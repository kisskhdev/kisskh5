00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.320
Sorry, I think I spoke too much.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.550
Why are you so against it?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.750
Pardon?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.150
It's wonderful to be able to fall in love with someone.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.200
Shogun?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.390
Shogun!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.710
Shogun!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.350
Is it true?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.160
- Shogun was kidnapped?
- Yeah.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.390
Mr. Shirosaki is now at the police station.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.820
The police...

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.960
I can't believe Shogun was...

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.020
This still feels surreal. I mean, kidnapped?

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.170
Good morning!

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.410
What's wrong?

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.380
It had to be him!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.490
Him? Who?

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.580
That guy... The one who came to take Shogun back.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.850
That rich guy with the wads of cash and the helicopter!

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.880
He has to be the culprit!

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.430
Mr. Shirosaki.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.000
- Where's Shogun?
- Do you have any idea who's behind this?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.370
You took him, didn't you?

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.390
Where are you hiding Shogun?

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.460
- I don't know anything either.
- Don't lie.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.510
Please calm down, Mr. Shirosaki.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.470
I don't think Mr. So Ha would do such a thing.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.090
He wouldn't have come running here if he'd been involved in this.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.840
He would have just run away.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.660
So... you were saying the dog is part of an inheritance?

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.420
That's right. An inheritance worth 50 billion yen.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.870
That may be why he's missing.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.600
If you know anything, spit it out. Right now.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.520
Inheritance? What are you talking about?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.010
Huh?

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.060
Are you all right, Mr. Kai? You must be dreaming.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.610
Hold on. What was that back there?

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.950
Don't reveal too much. You'll cause an uproar.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.370
Says the one who got me involved!

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.600
- I didn't do anything ー
- Mr. Shirosaki, this is a misunderstanding.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.390
In any case, let's first establish the facts ー

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.680
- I'm terribly sorry.
- My foot...

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.060
You should have stepped on that dog-napper's foot instead!

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.660
Napper? What did he say?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.320
It's kind of hard to translate that.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.200
- Yes?
- What's "napper"?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.660
Kai?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.790
Some folks got back to me.
[National Dog Friends Association]

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.650
They're from a network of dog lovers
across all 47 prefectures in Japan.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.420
Incredible.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.850
Not every source can be trusted, but...

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.760
We think we found Shogun's dog collar.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.400
It's in the photo of a family on vacation here.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.090
It's gone.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.170
Shogun...

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.340
This should be the place.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.010
How do we find him?

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.160
Mr. Kai, maybe they're planning to get the dog out of Japan.
[Hiratsuka Ferry]

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.620
Please hold on.
I'll check which ferry he may possibly be on.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.020
Who the hell is doing this?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.580
So you're really not aware of all this?

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.120
I'm not that desperate.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.140
I don't have any ambition, and I'm not interested in money.
I'm clean.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.070
I've let Shogun down.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.460
When I was little, I'd found an abandoned dog
in the neighborhood.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.850
But I couldn't keep it, and gave up hope of raising it.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.810
That was when I vowed to become a vet.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.530
But look at me now.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.110
I can't even protect my own dog.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.110
Mr. Kai!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.170
There's a ferry departing for Kyushu at 12:15pm.
Pets are allowed on board.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.360
The culprit may have boarded this ferry to head to Korea.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.740
- That is...
- It's leaving in five minutes.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.420
Wait...

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.480
Hang on.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.900

Huh? What?
[Cargo Ship Terminal - Passenger Ship Terminal]

Sir, calm down!

Sir, wait for me!

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.310
This is killing me!

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.430
Sir, please wait for me!

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.520
What are you doing?

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.940
Where are you going, sir?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.930
Shogun!

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.100
Shogun...

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.910
Hang on, you're not jumping in, are you?

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.280
- But Shogun is...
- It's useless. Let's think of another way ー

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.120
- The same foot.
- I'm so sorry.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.030
I can look for Shogun on my own. Just leave.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.640
I'm also worried about him.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.330
Mr. Kai!

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.460
We've found him.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.710
Shogun is safe and sound!

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.110
Mr. So Ha found him...

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.410
Shogun, I'm so glad you're okay.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.230
Shogun, we were so worried. Good boy.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.240
That dog...

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.340
Mr. So Ha, are you okay?

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.920
You mean this? I fell along the way.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.980
That's not true. He actually...

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.660
We found out that another cargo ship
was departing at the same time.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.650
Keep quiet!

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.550

Sir, you okay?

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.030
- So that bruise was...
- Nah, this is nothing.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.680
Shogun still looks sprightly, don't worry.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.050
- What about the culprits?
- They ran away, but we've filed a report to the police.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.670
Are you injured anywhere else, Mr. So Ha?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.710
I'm totally fine.

You're welcome.

- You're welcome. That's my reply.

I haven't said a word, though.

You looked like you wanted to.

Nah, I'm not surprised that you'd suspect me.

Not to worry. I'm a magnanimous person, you see.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.860
Urgent assignment? You're taking time off today?

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.460
That's right.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.570

Could you go ahead with preparing
Ms. Sekine's divorce settlement?

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.020
Review the written statement, right?
I'll contact the relevant parties.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.580
Thank you so much. Talk to you later.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.050
I wish to ask you a few questions,
assuming you're not involved in the kidnapping.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.640
- Sure.
- What questions?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.600
Pet kidnapping is a crime of theft.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.570
If convicted, you would either serve a 10 year sentence,
or be fined up to 500,000 yen.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.740
If harm was also inflicted, this would be property damage,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.600
and violates the Animal Welfare Act.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.950
It's obvious those thugs kidnapped Shogun

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.320
to forcibly own him, and get a hold of the inheritance.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.030
Wouldn't this suggest your family may be involved?

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.190
Why did you act on your own?

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.100
I only told you to keep watch on So Ha.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.280
So what now?

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.150
I'm hanging up.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.860

You can always come to me for advice.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.250
What?

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:34.110
I heard the resort hotel in Cebu you launched with fanfare
is making huge losses.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.300
Business will pick up in no time.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.640

I don't think so.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.600
I overheard those thugs speaking Japanese.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:13.040
Besides, my family cares more about their own businesses,
rather than some dog.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.540
Are you sure?

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.220
Yeah.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.820
In that case, we can only wait for the culprits to get arrested.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.500
But what if Shogun gets targeted again?

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.580
Ms. Aiko, how's your leg?

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:42.140
My leg's fine. I'll go buy some band-aids.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.750
Mr. Kai.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.090
It's fine if you don't thank me.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.470
But you should properly thank Ms. Aiko.

Meet Sakura?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.090
That's right. I'd love for Shogun and Sakura to meet each other.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.060
Of course. I'm sure Sakura would be happy, too.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.610
Dad, I'm tired.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.340
What? Seriously?

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.630
You shouldn't spoil him like that.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.760
Let's go!

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.250
If you don't mind...

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.190
I-It's fine. I can walk on my own.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.520
I'll go sit down for a bit.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.800
I can get water on my own.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.910
This is the worst.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.130
Thank you.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.790
Want some water too, Shogun?

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.600
This feels so nostalgic.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.960
I used to look after that stray dog like this.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.690
- You mean King?
- Yeah, King.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.360
I found him by the river and let him drink water like this.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.140
I'd buy him canned food from the supermarket, and...

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.400
How do you know his name?

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.040

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.330
In the end, he was adopted by the nearby animal hospital.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.750
How did you know?

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.290
It's me.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.590
I was that elementary schooler who took care of him with you.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.980
I was that little girl.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.080
I see.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.820
Let's go, Shogun.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.580
Can you make it to the parking lot?

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.870
Yes, thank you.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.270
No response?

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.660
Dorako...

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.100
Dorako...

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.080
Dorako...

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.610
Huh? He didn't give any reaction?

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.420
No, not at all.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.140
Even though you told him
you were that little girl from back then?

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.040
He was completely unresponsive.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.380
How can that be?

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.070
I guess that's the best I could get out of him.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.220
Maybe he forgot about me.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.370
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. So Ha.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.300
Please take a seat, Mr. Yeon Su.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.610
I just heard from a police friend of mine.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.200
They've arrested the culprits who kidnapped the dog.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.680
They've been caught?

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.610
Really? Are you sure?

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:11.230
Yes.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.540
The culprits were a pair of hoodlums.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.720
Hoodlums?

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.060
- Troublemakers.
- Ah, I get it.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.800
- Gangsters.
- Something like that.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.860
The pair took on the gig for money.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.630
They only received instructions,
with no knowledge of their employer.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:35.670
But they did say the dog was to be handed off in Kyushu.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:41.940
We believe someone who knew of the inheritance
attempted to transport the dog to Korea.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.450
In any case, we have to find the mastermind soon.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.850
Otherwise, something dangerous could happen again.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:57.330
The dog is in a precarious situation indeed.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.780
But please do not worry.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.210
Regarding Shogun ー

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.970
Pardon me... Regarding Rocky,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:11.610
we aim to resolve this inheritance issue as soon as possible.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.080
Shogun! You're back with us safe and sound!

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.890
You got me so worried.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.090
Sorry to worry all of you.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.200
Did you catch the culprit?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.200
It had to be the rich guy with the cash and helicopter, right?

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.580
- It wasn't him.
- What?

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.350
In fact, he was the one who rescued Shogun.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.980
Of course. He's way too cool to be bad.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.790
Mr. Shirosaki, we have an emergency case.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.200
Yes, understood. Right.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.180
Your father called.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.330
He wants an update on this case immediately.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.450
What sweets did they give us?

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.830
Yatsuhashi? Are they some kind of medicinal sweets?
[Cinnamon-seasoned rice flour crackers]

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.840
Sir.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.160
I'll buy some matcha to bring back with me.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.130
I know you, sir.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:05.360
You're kind at heart and hate to get into fights.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.040
But you have to go back sooner or later.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.580
I know that.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:15.940
Be it run away from them or stay and fight,
it's crucial that you make a choice.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.600
Hopefully, you understand that.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:24.890
[Director's Recommendation]

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.920
By the way, I wonder if Mr. So Ha truly is the dark horse.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.540
Dark horse?

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:36.910
Woo So Ha. At one point,
he was rumored to be the heir of WooRoA Group.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:41.600
He may be the youngest of three siblings,
but he's the most outstanding.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.870
But now?

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.090
His brother and sister are constantly launching new businesses,

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.350
while he's settled for a nonessential role
in an affiliated company.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.350
So he's been sidelined?

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:57.580
Anyway, we welcome anyone from that conglomerate family.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.810
The WooRoA Group currently has their hand in logistics.
Which means...

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.410
- Distribution.
- Bingo.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.190
They're focused on setting up an international logistics hub

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.420
from Asia to the Middle East.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.400
If can get even a fraction of the profit they'll gain
from acquiring companies,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.050
we'd be rich.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.960
This is my favorite phrase ー "Aim higher"!

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.340
Ms. Hanamura, please find out what Mr. Shirosaki plans to do
moving forward.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.370
A man and his associates desperate for this dog,

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.550
versus the vet who wants to protect him.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.790
To be honest, I want to root for the vet.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.510
But alas, I have to stand with the folks at WooRoA Group.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.480
Profits first.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.390
It's alright.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.610
You'll be fine.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.820
Gastric dilatation-volvulus?
[GDV: A condition where the stomach twists around its axis]

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.690
- Arrange an X-ray immediately.
- Got it.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.480
- Bring her in. See you later, Lulu.
- Lulu, let's go.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.010
We'll first do a detailed examination.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.370
The stomach may have gotten twisted and blocked blood flow.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.490
In certain cases, we may need to do an emergency surgery.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.100
What?

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.730
We'll leave her in your good hands.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.400
What's your name?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.730
- Seri Inoue.
- Seri? Don't worry.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:36.560
Lulu wants to get better
so that she can play with you again soon.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.090
An emergency surgery?

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.600
Yes. That's why I came on his behalf.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.410
This is from Mr. Shirosaki.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:46.850
Thank you.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.760
Thank you for helping us search for Shogun.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.020
It's fine. I'm glad that he's safely back with us.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.840
Wow, they look delicious! Care to eat with us?

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.450
Really? May I?

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.980
- I'll go get coffee.
- Great. Thanks.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.190
But I didn't expect Kai to return to work so soon.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.430
He should have rested a little longer.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:19.210
I also told him that,
but he said he has nothing to do at home anyway.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:24.210
- He wasn't always such a workaholic.
- Huh?

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.770
He looks so happy.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.740
These were good times.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.180
Was this during university?

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.220
That's right. We met at an internship program I attended

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.900
while in pet grooming school.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.320
Our group went on drives, sang karaoke,
and drank till morning practically every day.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:51.500
Kai would often laugh and say,
"I'm having my first real taste of youth!"

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.740
A lot had happened then.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.150
Please show me the photos too!

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.360
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.650
Gosh! Mr. Kai looks so young here!

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.110
You haven't changed at all, Ms. Yuka.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.200
Ms. Yuka, were you already popular with boys at that time?

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:23.340
Maybe. I was young then, so I was kind of the cutesy type.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.000
So right now, you're the charming type?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.850
- The kind that attracts men like him...
- Hey, stop it! Stop!

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:38.510
In the past, I'd watch my diet,
and wouldn't eat much in front of my crush. But now?

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.880
(No problem at all.)

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.010
Does that mean I'm...

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.450
Right, right, right?

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.810
He's completely charmed.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.570
Looks like there's another one coming to be charmed.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.950
- What?
- What brings you here, Mr. So Ha?

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.050
Ms. Yuka, actually...

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.370
I came to ask you for a favor.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.460
That's right. Slowly...

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.750
We cut their nails once a month.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.690
Where does the nail start and end?

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.030
This is where the blood vessels are, so don't cut too deep in.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.200
It'll bleed if you do.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.790
Got it.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.810
You can cut a little bit deeper.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.850
But Sumomo's scared! Isn't that right?

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.730
That's right. Well done.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.850
- Let's put some foam here.
- Thanks.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.800
Ma'am, does that feel good?

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.710
Our massage and pedicure is wonderful, right?

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.200
Is this around one portion?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.920
That's right. We feed them two times a day, at 9AM and 6PM.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.750
Alright, eat up.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.950
Mr. Kai, I have a favor to ask.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.630
Could I accompany you on a walk?

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.210
A walk?

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.480
Come on, walk with me.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.670
Nice! Follow me, follow me.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.400
Good boy.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:35.790
What's your motive?

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.160
I don't have any motive.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.990
I wanted to try taking care of him like my grandmother did.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.840
Hey there, Mr. Shirosaki.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.380
And Mr. Basketball Genius.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.650
- Can he do it?
- Nah, he can't.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.720
- Nice one!
- One more!

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.580
Nice shoot.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.450
So...

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.010
You have something to tell me?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.150
I'll take care of him.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.020
I'll take on the responsibility of taking care of Shogun.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.050
I won't let anyone harm him again.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.040
So

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.380
I'd like you to trust me, and let me keep him.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.820
After that, I'll disappear.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.160
It'd be farewell. Bye-bye.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.940
Mr. Shirosaki, Lulu's owners are here to see her.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.250
Like what we previously informed you, her condition is stable.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.540
I've shifted the stomach back and fixed it in place
so the problem won't recur.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.820
We also performed a partial gastrectomy,

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.410
so we'll monitor her for any bleeding or arrhythmia.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.910
If none of that happens,
Lulu will be discharged in a few days.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.560
That's great to hear, right?

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.420
- Thank you so much.
- Give her a pat, Seri.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.720
Lulu, I'm glad you're okay.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.340
Rest well, alright?

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.020
Lulu.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.640
Doctor, thank you so much.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.020
No problem.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.040
Let's go, shall we?

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.000
Bye-bye, Doctor.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.620
Bye.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.940
Are you that surprised to see me?

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.190
Since you invited me, I brought her here to see Shogun.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.830
I suddenly remembered.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.400
Remembered what?

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.380
About King.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.710
I couldn't keep him back then,

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.890
so every once in a while,
I'd wonder how he was doing.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.140
I know what happened to him.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.090
After that day, the nurse adopted him and raised him up.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.950
He spent his days being lovingly doted on,

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.700
until he crossed the Rainbow Bridge at 14 years old.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.380
I only heard about it later on from the folks at the hospital.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.600
King...

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.180
He lived his life in happiness.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.750
He was happy, huh?

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.690
What should I do, Shogun?

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.660
Sakura, be a good girl and stay there, okay?

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.070
We received a call from Mr. Shirosaki earlier.
[Son Yeon Su]

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.130
He said he'll return Shogun to us.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:05.510
We'll be meeting him at 9AM,
at the beach where we previously met.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.940
Would you like to come too, Ms. Hanamura?

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.360
Mr. Shirosaki.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.750
You came.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.620
I'm surprised.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.090
I didn't think you'd give him up.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.060
Mr. So Ha said that he'll regularly keep in touch with me.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.790
I also plan to go to Korea to see him.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:40.310
So you've made your decision.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.640
Good day, everyone. Good morning.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.420
Good afternoon.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.700
Good evening.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.700
What's with the weird greetings?

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.850
I'm saying them all at once, since today is my last day here.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.010
I heard about your offer.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:05.490
I will be visiting to check on Shogun as well.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.430
You're welcome anytime. I keep my promises.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.600
Please take care of him.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.030
Are you sure you don't want any compensation?

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.140
I don't need it. More importantly...

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:34.130
These are Shogun's belongings.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.540
I've also written down things to note.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.260
[Important Notes for Dog Care and Personal Requests]

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.700
[Please contact me if anything comes up.
I'm entrusting Shogun to you. - Kai Shirosaki]

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.100
Thank you.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.330
Let's go, Rocky.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.920
Bye-bye.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.990
Rocky.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.480
Young master!

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.000
Well then,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.650
goodbye.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.960
Come on, Rocky. Let's go.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.280
I have made the flight arrangements.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.090
What do we do with this?

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.770
We have to head back to that boring home.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.250
Rocky!

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.510
Handshake.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.810
Don't look at me like that.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:55.330
You know... I'll feel lonely too.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.900
Yes, Father?

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.570
You're finally heading home?

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.600
With that dog?

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.440
Yes. I'm flying back soon.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:36.010
Good. We have a pet-sitter at home, so just pass the dog to her.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.110
No, I'm the one taking care of him.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:44.310
Don't be ridiculous.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:49.750
You should start getting more involved
in our company operations.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:57.500
In that case, I'm not handing the dog over.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.020
What did you say?

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.240
If I can't keep my promise, I can't bring the dog back with me.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.200
Thankfully, the owner has rejected the compensation.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.990
After doing the legal procedures,
I'll travel the world and find something I want to do.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.780
Fine.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.110
- What?
- Do what you want.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.850
But don't ever come back.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.750
- But Dad...
- Our household...

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.680
doesn't need a useless son like you.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.400
Sir, what did your father say?

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.560
What? He can stay here?

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.470
Is he allowed to stay?

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.440
That's great, Shogun!

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.100
I've checked with my family.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.210
They told me to do whatever I want.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.470
That's great, Sakura.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.000
Your father has chased you out of the house!

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.200
This is not a joke. What will you do now?

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.150
Young Master, get a grip on yourself!

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.300
Stop it! I'm already hella frustrated!

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.390
Dorako.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:49.170
That's the name I gave to the girl
who took care of the dog with me, and treated me to dorayaki.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:56.470
Dorako. I secretly named her that.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.610
Dorako?

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:01.910
What's with that nickname?

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.510
Does that mean you remember me?

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:13.330
Of course. Ever since I moved away,
whenever I came across a dog or dorayaki,

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.820
you would come to mind.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:25.440
I'm really happy to hear that King had lived a happy life.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:32.840
Thank you for showing concern over Shogun.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.440
You even helped me search for him.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.310
Really, thank you.

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.670
Long time no see.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.000
Likewise, it's been a while.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.200
First love, huh?

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.430
What is this?

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.230
This?

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.100
This states the ten promises to abide by,
in order to get along well with dogs.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.350
Ten promises?
[10 promises between my dog and me]

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.420
Number one.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:05.780
"My life probably only lasts around 10 to 15 years."

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:11.960
"That is why it is so painful every moment
that I am not by your side."

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:19.130
"So please think carefully about that
before you decide to start living with me."

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.640
Number two.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:33.580
"Please be patient with me. It may take a while
before I can understand what you want me to do."

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.400
I guess this applies to humans, too.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.010
This is great news for both of you, yeah?

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.040
I think I get it somehow.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.240
Huh?

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.040
Mr. Shirosaki, you are someone who takes time.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.060
What do you mean by that?

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.530
Please hold this for me.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.010
Sure.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.660
I owe you one.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.350
I don't know what's going to happen from now on,

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.060
but if there's anything that I can do...

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.670
There is.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.700
You're kidding me.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.710
- For real?
- Thank you for having me!

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.270
Good day, sir.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:50.810
Hey, hey, hey...

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.860
Hey, you...

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.960
Wow, the kitchen is huge with a washing machine.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.910
The rooms...

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.040
What a nice house.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.430
- Where's Shogun?
- Shogun?

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:20.240
Hey, Shogun! The two of us will protect you from now on, yeah?

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.380
- "The two of us"?
- Sorry about this!

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.860
Huh? What?

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.410
Busy, busy...

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:30.900
There's more.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.350
In short, we'll be living together.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.480
I'll be in your care.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.240
We're living together?

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.020
I have made the flight arrangements.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.850
What do we do with this?

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:03.820
[Epilogue]

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.760
In the end, we bought all sorts of stuff.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.540
I don't think we can carry them all back.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.140
Maybe I should give Aiko this kendama.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.680
She took a great photo of me with it.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.700
I should give her this, too.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.450
Napolitan. That was really delicious.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.290
I feel like eating it again.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:39.180
And also... this one, and these, too.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.360
These, too.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.360
Isn't there anything else I can give her?

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.500
She needs that, too.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.530
I think she'll love this the most.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.660
I hope you'll meet again in future.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.630
Meet who?

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.280
A bond... a friendship...

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.130
may form between us.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.780
I can't do this!

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:22.770
You can go shopping?

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.170
I'm okay with that.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.710
I couldn't choose the person I truly love.

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.090
There's no one else but you.
