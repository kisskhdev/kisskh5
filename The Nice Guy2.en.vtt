WEBVTT

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.960
The Nice Guy

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.295
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:48.924
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.554
Seokhee!

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.893
Seokhee!

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:13.991
Seokkyung!

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.287
- Are you okay?
- What? Yes.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.580
What about you?

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:20.664
Okay, let's go.

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.882
Come at me. Come on.

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:36.013
You bastard!

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:40.726
- Stop them!
- Hey, stop!

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.644
Seokhee, start the car.

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:47.357
Hurry!

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.152
What the heck? Unlock the door, now!

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.611
Do it yourself.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:53.947
- Is that the key?
- It is.

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.157
Damn it!

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:56.908
Hey!

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.662
Come on, boss,
stretch your arm further! Darn it.

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.539
Gosh, boss.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:06.335
Should I report them to the police
for kidnapping, battery, and confinement?

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:07.878
- Do what? Call the cops?
- Yes.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.006
Call the cops?
Think before you speak, fool!

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.760
- I can't reach it.
- Stretch, you punk!

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.355
Are you two all right? Are you hurt?

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.691
The kind of things I get involved in
thanks to my genius sister!

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.195
Seokkyung, where's your stuff?

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.447
He asked you a question.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.033
In a dorm room.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:41.286
A dorm room? That's where you went
after you made that mess and left us?

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.665
That's okay, I don't need it.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:48.543
Seokcheol, just drop me off
anywhere near the Hangang Bridge.

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:50.295
- Jeez.
- The Hangang Bridge?

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.882
The thought of getting an earful from me
makes you want to jump off a bridge?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.967
Hey, don't talk like that.

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:57.427
I'm too ashamed to face you.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.306
Just drop me off
at the Hangang Bridge, Seokcheol.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.599
What a joke.

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.601
Jumping into the Hangang River
would be a luxury for you.

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:08.647
From now on, you have no right
to say anything or make any decisions.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.149
Where's that room? Tell us.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.445
Go straight.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.489
Go straight.

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.120
- Open.
- Open the door now.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:26.498
Go on.

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.712
Come on in.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.675
Why do you have all these playing cards?
It's like a factory in here.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.637
Well, I get lonely and frustrated
when I'm alone,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.016
so I try to tell my fortune,
hoping things will be better tomorrow.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.309
Come on, pack up.

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:48.520
February plum blossom
means "lover," right?

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:51.690
The September chrysanthemum card
means "a drinking guest."

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.818
Guess that means you'll go drinking.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.363
- Damn it, I hate how accurate it is.
- You know quite well.

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.198
I used to watch Mom doing it.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.701
How's Mom?

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:04.369
Is she well?

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.414
Forget it.
You don't deserve to ask about her.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.749
She's doing fine.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.543
Now stop dillydallying
and pack up your things.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.510
What's this T-shirt?

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.514
- That's Hyeonggeun's.
- Why is his T-shirt here?

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.767
Whenever I miss him
or I can't fall asleep,

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.479
I cover my face with it and go to sleep.

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:34.232
- How dramatic and pitiful.
- I'm not.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.236
When I put the T-shirt
over my eyes like this,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.323
I can feel Hyeonggeun's essence...

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.700
...embrace my whole body,
and I can sleep well.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.577
You don't have kids. You won't understand.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.829
It's drenched in your tears and snot.

00:04:47.913 --> 00:04:50.207
Anyway, does that make him appear
in your dreams?

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:54.044
He's crazy about playgrounds nowadays.
Play with him in your dreams.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:58.131
Mom's knees ache from taking care of him
and running around him all day.

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.634
- Did you know that?
- Really?

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.304
Hyeonggeun must be having fun
at the playground.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:08.725
I'm sure he doesn't want to see me.
He must hate me.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:14.314
I'd like to see him in my dreams,
but he's never appeared, not once.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.608
Then why do something
that would make him hate you?

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.737
Stop already. I know what I did,
and I know it's all my fault.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:22.405
But...

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:26.409
...I miss my Hyeonggeun
so much.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:31.456
I can't help myself.
I want to hug him each night.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.585
Hyeonggeun.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.008
Park Seokkyung,
my older sister,

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.428
who was as much of a troublemaker
as I was, if not more.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.222
HAIR SALON

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.765
I left the stove on.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.976
- You need to be back in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.022
I got it!

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.067
My sister
used to work as a hairdresser.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.113
She got pregnant
and had a shotgun wedding.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.203
Right after a year of
a happy honeymoon...

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:11.288
MYOUNGSAN DISTRICT COURT

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.581
...she got divorced.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.460
The reason for the divorce
was my sister's domestic abuse

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.171
that was fueled by her husband's affair.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:23.967
- God, seriously...
- Bye.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.552
Instead of getting alimony,

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.013
she had to compensate him
for his broken nose.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.973
She took up gambling

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.810
in an attempt to fill the void
that her failed marriage created.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.604
Let's see.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:40.025
She secretly coaxed Mom
and lost our house deed to the bank.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:45.614
Seokkyung was the first to run away
when we got beaten up as kids.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.867
Before Father could break her legs
for what she had done,

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.620
she chose to flee
in the middle of the night.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.664
Her phone was out of service,
and her address unknown.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:58.418
We heard rumors of her being spotted
at different gambling dens around town.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.007
On the way back home with her,

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.136
the three of us were quiet,
lost in our own thoughts.

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:36.915
Come on.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.131
It hurts.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.093
Here. Take this in.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.845
Sorry about the trouble
I caused you guys today.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:52.806
As long as you're aware of it.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.767
Listen to what Seokhee says,
and stay put in this house.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:02.148
Seokcheol, I could just go
to another dorm room--

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.316
No, you won't.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:06.111
Go on.
And don't you dare step out of the house.

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:07.195
Go on.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.155
Hurry up.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.958
- Seokcheol, I'm scared--
- Just go in already.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.378
You better not run away again.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.644
The Nice Guy

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.774
{\an8}

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:10.008
{\an8}- Gosh.
I'll do it. Go and rest.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.304
{\an8}You're so young, and you've been working
so hard this early in the morning.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.681
You said so yourself.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.517
If I don't want to suffer later,
I should try and earn more now.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.227
That's true.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:23.813
Work hard.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:39.829
{\an8}

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:49.672
MIYOUNG

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.634
Good morning.
Let's work hard today too.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.097
Sure. Let's work hard.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.355
Yes, sir. I'll work hard.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.536
You're eating well.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.957
- Good morning, Uncle.
- Hey. How did you sleep?

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.292
Sit down. I'll reheat the soup.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:36.678
Your mom would also use
two sheets of seaweed to wrap the rice.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:38.888
Do you miss her?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.141
Yes.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.853
Wait a bit longer.
I'll bring your mom home.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.272
- Really?
- Yes.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:51.943
But make sure you keep this a secret
from Grandma and Grandpa, okay?

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.027
Okay.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:54.863
Shake on it?

00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:56.447
Promise.

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.034
Wake up.

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:02.120
How long are you going to sleep? Wake up.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.539
I'm not used to waking up this early.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:05.748
What a joke.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.792
It's cold and windy here.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.378
- Get up!
- Come on!

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:11.963
- Time for breakfast.
- Breakfast?

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:17.802
A sinner should eat too.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.518
It's too sweet.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.813
You ordered these in, didn't you?

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:32.775
I won't take your complaints about food.
Don't piss me off.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.819
I never complain about food.

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.447
But this much sugar in your food
is bad for you.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.159
If you keep this up,
I'll call Father and tell him you're here.

00:11:41.993 --> 00:11:43.661
You get meaner by the day.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.497
When will you go back home?

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.833
Hyeonggeun's school has invited parents
to sit in on classes.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.543
Other kids' parents are gonna be there.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:53.129
Are you going to make Hyeonggeun
go with his grandma?

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.381
He's gonna look like an orphan.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.678
Stop tearing up, and say something.

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:02.430
You must have a plan.

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:04.098
I want to go home too.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.684
I want to hold Hyeonggeun's hand
and take him to school.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:09.938
But I'm too scared of Father to go back.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.523
He might really break my legs.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.735
Isn't that a small price to pay
in exchange for being with your son?

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.237
Seokkyung,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.200
did you know I left home because
I got sick of sharing my room with you?

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.416
Why are you wearing those socks?

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:32.752
I was cold.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.254
Do I need your permission for this too?

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.340
Take them off. They're my favorite pair.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.092
Kihong bought them for me.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.261
Oh, no, you must be upset.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.098
Fine, I'll take them off. Sheesh.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.433
There.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.978
- Happy now?
- Yes, I'm happy.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.152
Only one sheet of seaweed from now on.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.613
Why do you always take two?

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:01.698
Put one of them here.

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.616
God, you're being so petty.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.716
SIS FROM HOUSE

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:23.594
- She keeps calling.
- "House"?

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.888
Don't pick up.
You ignored all my calls, after all.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:28.349
- I'll answer it.
- I said don't!

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.813
- Hello.
- Seokkyung.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.524
- Where did you run off with my money?
- Oh, well...

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:39.235
Do you think you can hide from me,
you witch?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.112
You sound very angry.

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:44.615
When I find you,
I'm gonna shred you into tiny pieces.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:48.244
- You'll do what?
- Hey!

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.079
- Who are you?
- Her sister.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.789
- You got a problem?
- What?

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.083
Firstly, you don't need to repay
a gambling debt.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.878
And the guy who followed her around
is a detective.

00:13:56.961 --> 00:14:00.381
If you lay a hand on my sister,
I'm sure they'll put you behind bars.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.592
Do you take me for a fool?

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.760
- Get lost!
- You witch.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.596
- You disgusting piece of--
- Go and off yourself, bitch.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:09.057
Don't talk down to me.
You don't even know me.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.225
Don't you dare call again.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:13.811
- I'll kill you.
- You stupid little--

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.400
She's ridiculous.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.279
She better not show up again,
or I'll headbutt her.

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:26.491
Hey. Do you think
headbutting someone is easy?

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:27.867
You need the skills for it.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.912
What kind of skills do you need?
All you do is butt them.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:34.248
It's not just about
butting into their forehead.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.626
You need to have a hard forehead

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.337
so your opponent gets hurt
when you butt them, but you don't.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.130
Go on. Feel my forehead.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.509
My goodness.

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:46.594
It's so hard.

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:47.887
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.722
It's something you're born with.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.599
- Basketball players must be tall.
- Yes.

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.392
- Soccer players must be fast.
- Yes.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.728
Headbutters have a hard forehead. Bam!

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:56.813
Really?

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.816
- You think I could do it?
- Let me check.

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.320
What? What is it?

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.699
Hey. You could do it.

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:09.951
- Really?
- Yes.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.537
Is my forehead hard enough?

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.455
Let me feel it. My gosh.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:20.837
Geummyeong Bank.
The branch manager is Moon Gisu.

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.507
Yes. You'd better not make a mistake.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.801
If you do, I'll kill you.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.262
Okay. I trust you.

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.763
I'm hanging up. Bye.

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:32.974
- Boss.
- Yes.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:36.394
Jindeuk said
he'll get an appointment in two days.

00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:38.855
The branch manager
bends to his every whim.

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.399
Okay, good job.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:45.820
That girl Seokkyung is just like you.
She's so reckless.

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:47.989
She is your daughter, after all.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:51.492
She causes trouble as much as you do.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.494
What did you say?

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:57.748
Did I say something wrong?

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:01.502
Would you look at the time.
I should get going.

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:04.005
- Get out of here!
- Bye.

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:05.256
Punk.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.973
This is District Three.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:18.477
It's the prime location
of Myoungsan City's redevelopment area.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.188
{\an8}As long as we secure this area,

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:25.401
we can easily get our hands
on future development areas. Understood?

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.569
Yes, sir!

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:29.572
The problem is the tenants again.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:32.992
The developer promised
compensation and negotiations,

00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:36.245
but they're unhappy,
and getting in the way of the demolition.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.539
There's one particularly reckless jerk.

00:16:38.623 --> 00:16:39.874
Show us his picture.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:46.464
That's the President
of the Tenant Housing Committee,

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.174
Kim Jinho.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:52.303
If we can take him down,
District Three will be ours in no time.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.056
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:57.683
Take a good look at him.
Remember his face.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.275
Tenants still live here!
Provide relocation measures!

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.904
Tenants still live here!
Provide relocation measures!

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:12.990
Forced demolition is unacceptable,

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.242
Oseon E&C!

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.911
Forced demolition
is unacceptable!

00:17:16.994 --> 00:17:18.746
Forced demolition is unacceptable!

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.055
{\an8}TENANTS DID NOT CONSENT

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:38.849
We fight together!

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:55.324
Hey.

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:59.161
I'll go in first. You guys wait here.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.455
- Let me come with you.
- You're the last person I want with me.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.709
Don't make things worse.
Stay out of sight, got it?

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:05.793
Yes, sir.

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:09.046
What are you doing here?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.465
I'm a contract employee.
I work for the developer.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.385
- Park Seokcheol, Myoungsan Industries.
- Give me your ID.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.053
- Sign here.
- Okay.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:20.725
Come with me.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.145
Come on.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.526
You said you were gonna quit.
What are you doing here?

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.528
It's my last gig. Give me that.

00:18:34.196 --> 00:18:35.740
Don't you trust me?

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.409
If I say it's my last gig, it is.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.167
Don't worry,
I'm better at this than you are.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.382
Call the Tenant Housing Committee.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.634
Tell them someone's coming up.

00:18:58.679 --> 00:18:59.764
It won't be easy.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:03.142
The committee president
is the nastiest person you'll meet.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:04.935
It'll be a disaster.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:07.521
I think so too.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:11.275
But, sir, I heard that the team leader
of District Three is Park Seokcheol.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:15.863
Wow.

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:19.617
What would Kim Changsoo have done
without Seokcheol?

00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.788
But even Seokcheol
won't be able to pull this off.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.459
That's why I gave up on the bidding.

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:30.544
FIGHT TOGETHER

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.134
What could you possibly
want to talk to me about?

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.806
President, the longer you resist,
the longer you suffer.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.641
You know that very well.

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:46.394
The developer wants us
to barge right in today,

00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:48.312
but I have no intention of doing that.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.607
Let's talk it out.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.360
There's no need to fight and shed blood.

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:01.200
It seems like thugs these days are getting
more subtle with their threats.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.744
It's not a threat.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:05.746
I'm asking for a negotiation.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:14.296
I know thugs like you very well.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.257
Poor jerks.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.428
You act all tough, but you're actually
the most pitiful creatures.

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.642
Have you seen anyone
prepared to die for a cause?

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.438
Don't think of negotiating with me.

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:33.107
Now leave.

00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:59.633
HOUSING COMMITTEE

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.270
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:13.022
- Thank you.
- Boss.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.273
Let's go eat.

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:16.734
- I'm good. You guys go ahead.
- Okay.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.110
- Dusik.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.236
I need a word with you.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.030
- You guys go on.
- We'll get going.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.114
Let's go.

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:25.409
After lunch, go back to District Three.

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:26.994
Again?

00:21:27.077 --> 00:21:30.539
Go find out if there's a cop or someone
who messes with the tenants.

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:34.251
And the President is a tough guy,
so be careful.

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:35.336
I understand.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:38.172
- Call me if anything happens.
- Okay.

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.507
- Go. You must be hungry.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.925
- Have a good lunch, sir.
- Okay. Bye.

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:45.888
Seokcheol is the team lead, right?

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:46.972
Yes, sir.

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.641
Let's use this chance

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.811
to get rid of Kang Taehoon's lackeys.

00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:54.313
We can't afford to share any land
in this small country.

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.357
If they won't reason with us,

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.693
get the contractors to wipe them out.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.034
Yes, sir.

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:12.414
SEOKHEE

00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:15.835
Gosh, hold on.

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:18.337
Wait, wait...

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.551
- Hello?
- Why are you panting?

00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:26.011
I rushed to answer your call,
and I fell down.

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:29.515
- Why did you fall?
- It was slippery.

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:32.726
Don't take so long to answer my calls.
It makes me anxious.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.687
I was in the toilet.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:37.106
Take your phone to the toilet.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.066
And don't answer any calls from the house.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.651
Got it.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:42.403
Don't run away.

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:45.948
Listen, I have nowhere left to run to.

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:47.408
Stop doubting me.

00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:49.451
You've given me no reason to stop.

00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:51.954
Just stay holed up in the house.

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:53.247
Fine.

00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.339
Not going to eat?

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:07.011
Ah. No. Someone I know is visiting.
I'm giving her a consultation.

00:23:07.094 --> 00:23:09.722
Oh. Shall I go get you a sandwich then?

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:10.806
No, that's okay.

00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:14.685
So, what happened to Seokkyung?
Did she go back home?

00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.562
She's staying with me.

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:19.857
- What about your parents?
- She's too scared of Father to go back.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:21.734
I can't kick her out, either.

00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:25.821
That's true.
Your father might actually break her legs.

00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:28.866
But if she's with you,
I can't come over to your place.

00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:38.584
You won't have to wait long.
I'll send her back home as soon as I can.

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:41.587
If she refuses to go,
I'll drag her back home myself.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.922
All right.

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:44.632
- You got this.
- Thanks.

00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:45.799
Enjoy your meal.

00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.555
- Dr. Jang!
- Oh, yes, madam.

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:54.642
I think I'm a little early
for my appointment.

00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:59.813
Goodness, it's so hard
to get ahold of you.

00:23:59.897 --> 00:24:03.275
My husband said you get
the most appointments in our hospital.

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:06.862
- Did the director say really that?
- Yes.

00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:09.281
My husband praises you all the time.

00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:10.866
Thank you.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.534
How is your back?

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:14.536
That was an excuse.

00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:18.290
I came here to introduce you to someone.

00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:21.001
Jinhee.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.921
Why don't you come in? Come on in.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.092
This is Jinhee, my daughter.

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:30.678
You've heard, right?
She's studying in the States.

00:24:30.761 --> 00:24:32.137
She flew in for her vacation.

00:24:32.221 --> 00:24:34.431
She's a big fan of yours, Dr. Jang.

00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:37.726
She says you're the most handsome
and gentle doctor here.

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:41.397
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:43.607
I'm sorry,
I should've asked you this before.

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:47.069
Dr. Jang, do you have a girlfriend?

00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:53.450
Do you?

00:24:53.534 --> 00:24:54.827
Uh...

00:24:55.786 --> 00:24:56.787
Yes, well...

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:03.127
- I don't.
- I'm so glad!

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:09.800
So, I have tickets to a piano concert.

00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:13.345
Would you like to go with Jinhee?

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:15.931
- Do you like piano music?
- Piano...

00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.726
Yes, well...

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:22.104
- Ms. Seokhee.
- Yes?

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:24.106
Since this is not a consultation,

00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.316
you can leave.

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.193
Oh.

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:33.240
Goodness, you look good together already!

00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:35.451
My gosh.

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:38.370
- Have you had lunch?
- No, not yet.

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.999
- Here are your side dishes.
- Thanks.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:43.792
Water, please!

00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:46.420
- Enjoy.
- Can I have a bottle of soju?

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:48.047
One bottle of soju, coming up!

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.965
- Yes?
- We'd like a bottle of soju too.

00:26:00.768 --> 00:26:05.105
Good going today. You worked so hard.

00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:06.815
I'm just doing my job.

Boss, it's a mess here.

00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:12.941
Sangyeol and the contractors
are dragging the tenants out.

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:14.026
Come quickly.

00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:32.169
No!

00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:33.545
Let me cover it!

00:28:34.254 --> 00:28:35.422
Hey, what's happening?

00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:36.673
Don't do it.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.841
Shit!

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.009
- Who are you?
- Let me go!

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.761
Hey, Seokcheol!

00:28:50.312 --> 00:28:52.356
Tenants have the right to oppose!

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.441
I told you to wait.

00:28:56.193 --> 00:28:58.195
Boss, you should have left this to me.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.447
Now isn't a good time.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.075
It was the Chairman's orders.

00:29:03.158 --> 00:29:05.994
What can we do
but follow orders from our higher-ups?

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.829
You'll ruin everything at this rate!

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.791
Why are you yelling at me?

00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:11.959
Take it up the Chairman.

00:29:12.042 --> 00:29:13.335
I have no say in this.

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:22.177

It's gasoline!

Come on down! Come back here!

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:36.566
You bastards!

00:29:37.234 --> 00:29:38.860
Watch closely.

00:29:50.706 --> 00:29:53.625
I'm all set.

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:57.129
Come on. Come and get me, bastards!

You can't go up there!

Dad...

00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:44.760
- Dusik.
- Yes, sir.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:47.345
Didn't you serve a prison sentence
for picking locks?

00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:48.513
Yes. It's my specialty.

00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:50.098
Come with me.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.350
Come on.

00:30:57.939 --> 00:31:00.067
You think you can get it done tonight?

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.234
I'm doing my best, sir.

00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:04.529
Don't scold him when he's working.
You'll distract him.

00:31:04.613 --> 00:31:05.989
You keep your mouth shut.

00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:12.287
- I did it, sir.
- What?

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.039
Good job, Dusik.

00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:19.086
Boss. What are you gonna do?

00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:21.254
What else? I'll go in and get him out.

00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:23.465
- You guys wait here.
- Yes, sir.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:24.549
Be careful, sir.

00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:50.158
You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.
It's bad for you.

00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:55.288
What did you do? How did you get in?

00:31:56.832 --> 00:31:58.500
Well, you know...

00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:00.669
I walked up the stairs.

00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:02.712
Oh, gosh.

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:04.840
Let's go.

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:19.646
You're making this so hard for me.

00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:24.776
I should've quit this job long ago.

00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:28.029
Listen, sir.

00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:30.949
Don't waste your precious life here.

00:32:31.408 --> 00:32:32.742
Let's get out of here.

00:32:32.826 --> 00:32:35.287
Don't act as if you're trying to save me.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.372
You're nothing but a thug.

00:32:38.415 --> 00:32:40.625
I didn't come here to save you.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.837
I want to quit my job as a thug.

00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:48.550
But I can't do that if you die in here.

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:50.802
Not only will I not be able to quit,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.139
but my life will get messier
than it already is.

00:32:55.432 --> 00:32:57.350
So, let's just go, okay?

00:32:57.893 --> 00:32:59.269
What if I don't?

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:02.772
Then I'll have to use force.

00:33:04.316 --> 00:33:05.567
Spoken like a true thug.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.070
Have you heard of Yeonsinnae's Eyeball?

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:13.825
Back in my prime, no one pissed me off
and walked away unscathed.

00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:15.952
Bring it on.

00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:20.415
Let's see how strong thugs are nowadays.

00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:50.612
You sure can throw a good punch.

00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:52.280
All thanks to my good upbringing.

00:33:58.203 --> 00:33:59.704
- Let go!
- Please, stop!

00:34:08.088 --> 00:34:09.506
Seokcheol went in there?

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:11.967
Yes, well...
He said he'd bring the president out.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.093
Okay.

00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:14.552
Okay, my foot!

00:34:15.512 --> 00:34:19.015
Will you take responsibility
if something happens to Seokcheol, huh?

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:21.893
You're scaring me. What's the problem?

00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:23.395
You have no loyalty at all.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.856
Look at what happened.

00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:31.444
Please stop. I'm exhausted too.

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:49.754
Let's end this here.

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.807
Remember I asked you...

00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:05.437
if you'd seen anyone prepared to die.

00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:15.530
So...

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:19.034
Do you think
I'll burn this place up or not?

00:35:21.328 --> 00:35:23.580
Do you know how the homeless suffer?

00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:27.542
Whether in here or on the streets,

00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:29.252
I'm gonna die either way.

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:43.558
Come on, we really need to leave.

00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:45.685
Go!

00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:52.275
What's that smoke?

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:54.694
Fire! Fire!

00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.238
Call 911!

00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:07.290
Go. It's over anyway.

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.709
You shouldn't die too.

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:11.503
Get out of here.

00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:16.132
Seokcheol!

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.344
Seokcheol... Seokcheol!

00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:21.596
- Park Seokcheol!
- No, no!

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.181
- Let go!
- Seokcheol!

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:28.436
What about your daughter? What about her?

00:36:29.104 --> 00:36:30.271
Get up. Come on.

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.274
Get up!

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.697
Seokcheol!

00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:41.783
Come on! This way!

00:36:47.122 --> 00:36:49.791
- There they are!
- They're out!

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:50.917
Call an ambulance!

00:36:54.003 --> 00:36:55.004
Boss!

00:36:57.966 --> 00:36:59.217
- Are you okay?
- Boss!

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.593
- Damn it!
- Boss!

00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:09.269
Father,

00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:13.523
your grandson Seokcheol's face was printed
on the front page of the newspaper.

00:37:14.107 --> 00:37:19.112
And it wasn't because
he hit someone in the face, like I did.

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:23.992
He's in the papers
because he saved a life.

00:37:24.784 --> 00:37:27.871
He's brought honor to our family.

00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:33.251
What does a family of thugs
even know about honor.

00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:35.253
Finish up quickly and eat your meal.

00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:38.006
Is something wrong?

00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:40.467
You're in the papers.

00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:42.385
What?

00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:52.479
SAVES THE COMMITTEE PRESIDENT
FROM SUICIDE ATTEMPT

00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:55.774
It means we've been blessed
by our ancestors.

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:57.817
Yeah, right.

00:37:58.234 --> 00:38:00.820
You getting a 15-year sentence
and coming out in 10,

00:38:00.904 --> 00:38:01.988
now that is a blessing.

00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:04.157
Come on, the day has barely even begun!

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.825
Stop annoying me.

00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:08.495
Then stop talking nonsense.

00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:11.623
Does Seokcheol seem like
he was born to be a thug?

00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:14.375
It's all because of your family.

00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.920
Generations of thugs,
starting with your father.

00:38:17.003 --> 00:38:18.379
Will you stop it?

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:21.633
My father wasn't any ordinary thug.

00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:25.261
He fought the Japanese police
during the Japanese invasion.

00:38:25.345 --> 00:38:26.721
He was a vigilante!

00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:29.641
You make it sound like
he was a freedom fighter.

00:38:30.433 --> 00:38:31.434
Jeez!

00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:35.980
How dare they use my photo
without permission--

00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:37.607
What?

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.609
Stop being reckless.

00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:41.653
Why'd you run into a house
when it was on fire?

00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:43.279
You're a thug, not a firefighter.

00:38:43.363 --> 00:38:44.489
All right, I get it.

00:38:45.114 --> 00:38:46.783
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:38:46.866 --> 00:38:48.535
I'm perfectly fine.

00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:26.281
Come on. Why didn't you just eat it?

00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:28.241
Just eat what he gave you.

00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:31.703
I don't want to indulge him.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.122
Here. You have it.

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.915
- What are you doing?
- Open up.

00:39:58.897 --> 00:39:59.898
Hello.

00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:05.486
I was just in the area.

00:40:06.195 --> 00:40:08.573
Thought I'd drop by
and see how you were doing.

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:13.369
Oh, uh...

00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:15.622
Would you like this?

00:40:24.213 --> 00:40:25.214
Mmm.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.342
It's nice and sweet.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.344
You can have some later.

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:37.477
The developers say they'll try and match
your compensation request.

00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:40.396
Oh. Hey, kid.

00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:48.154
My Miran said

00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:50.323
I should thank you

00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:52.784
whenever I met you next.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.621
But I just can't...

00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:01.292
get myself to say it,
so just assume I did, and go away.

00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:05.296
You're a better person than your father.

00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:11.260
Well then, take care of yourself. Bye.

00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:14.389
Wait.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.936
You said you wanted to quit being a thug.

00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:22.063
Did you mean it?

00:41:26.943 --> 00:41:29.696
As someone who's been in your shoes,
here's my advice:

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:32.699
Brace yourself if you're going to quit.

00:41:32.782 --> 00:41:37.203
If not, you'll be stabbed in the back and
abandoned by the ones you trust the most.

00:41:39.247 --> 00:41:40.456
That's how it is.

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.338
Okay.

00:42:06.315 --> 00:42:09.902
What's the matter? Is it about Seokcheol
not eating the meat you gave him?

00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:12.780
Tsk! What makes you say that?

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.368
His resentment won't fade so easily.

00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:20.830
Remember when he was in elementary school?

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.332
I remember.

00:42:23.416 --> 00:42:25.835
I remember it very vividly.

00:42:27.462 --> 00:42:29.964
Even at that age,
he knew what you were thinking.

00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:32.967
You went to your son's presentation
as a father,

00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:37.847
but to him, you were a thug, not a father.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.725
And when you were in prison,

00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:43.227
you forced him to go to them
and take their money.

00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:44.520
He hated it so much.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.068
Now he goes to the place he hates so much
and calls it his workplace.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.321
Oh, dear.

00:42:56.616 --> 00:43:00.328
As you know, when it came to demolition,

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:03.623
we were always second
to Kang Taehoon and his people.

00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:07.543
But no matter what stunts they pull,

00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:13.508
they can't do what Seokcheol did
and risk their lives.

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.426
So, today's first toast

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:19.972
is for Park Seokcheol
and his brilliant work.

00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:22.058
Everyone, cheers!

00:43:22.141 --> 00:43:23.976
Cheers!

00:43:29.816 --> 00:43:30.817
Okay, everyone.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:36.364
The Chairman
will now present the monetary reward!

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.085
- Thank you.
- Good job.

00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:51.796
Congratulations!

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:54.757
Now, now!

00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:56.634
That's not all.

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:59.637
For our star of the day, Park Seokcheol,

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.683
the Chairman has prepared a special gift.

00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:07.186
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:08.729
Open it.

00:44:10.398 --> 00:44:11.399
Try it on.

00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:22.952
- Thank you.
- Applause!

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:25.872
Park Seokcheol!

00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:31.169
Park Seokcheol! Park Seokcheol!

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:41.304
Those little shits.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.933
Oseon E&C stabbed me in the back.

00:44:46.017 --> 00:44:47.393
With Changsoo, at that.

00:44:47.476 --> 00:44:51.105
The headquarters ordered them
to change the company.

00:44:51.731 --> 00:44:54.192
- Because of what Seokcheol did?
- Yes.

00:44:54.275 --> 00:44:57.445
They changed their minds when they saw
the news about District Three.

00:45:00.156 --> 00:45:03.993
The jerk Kim Changsoo
gets to hang in there thanks to Seokcheol.

00:45:05.203 --> 00:45:07.079
Sir, what will you do?

00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:09.290
What else?

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:11.709
It's time for payback.

00:45:15.922 --> 00:45:17.381
Let's go, boss.

00:45:24.013 --> 00:45:27.225
Jindeuk already gave him
a heads-up, so don't worry.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.729
GEUMMYEONG BANK

00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:37.193
Shall we?

00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:45.868
Thank you for coming.

00:45:53.292 --> 00:45:54.585
We drink...

00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:57.380
- We drink instant.
- Instant coffee, you mean?

00:45:57.964 --> 00:45:59.257
- Get instant coffee.
- Okay.

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:07.223
You're here to discuss the overdue loan
at our branch, right?

00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:10.476
From what I know,

00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:14.021
the loan is about 360 million won,
and your house is collateral.

00:46:14.981 --> 00:46:18.234
- Yes, about that...
- Yes.

00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:23.990
I'd like to extend the due date
of the loan payment.

00:46:24.573 --> 00:46:25.616
Yes, of course.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:30.454
CEO Lee Jindeuk
is a long-term customer at our bank.

00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:34.250
He called me
and asked me to take good care of you.

00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:36.836
Yes, I trust you'll handle it well.

00:46:36.919 --> 00:46:38.504
Sure.

00:46:38.587 --> 00:46:44.010
So, why don't we give it plenty of time
and extend the period to, say, five years?

00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:46.762
Yes, well...

00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:49.098
That's good.

00:46:49.181 --> 00:46:52.518
In that case, if you want an extension,

00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:56.147
you'll need to pay back
some of the principal.

00:46:57.523 --> 00:47:00.651
- Pay back some of the principal?
- Yes.

00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:05.364
Otherwise it's hard to get the HQ's
screening department to approve it.

00:47:05.448 --> 00:47:06.991
Hold on.

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:10.494
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

00:47:10.578 --> 00:47:14.123
I came to see you
because I don't have that kind of money.

00:47:14.206 --> 00:47:16.834
Well, as I said just now,

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:20.796
you'll need to repay
at least 70 million won.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.715
What? 70 million?

00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:28.512
So, he needs to pay 70 million won
just to get the deadline extended?

00:47:28.596 --> 00:47:31.849
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes. That's exactly it.

00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:33.017
Damn it!

00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:36.645
Why didn't you just tell us about it
at the beginning?

00:47:36.729 --> 00:47:38.856
Are you toying with us?

00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:41.442
You're pissing me off!

00:47:45.988 --> 00:47:48.491
Sir, you can't do this. Sir...

00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:52.328
- Listen up.
- Yes.

00:47:53.037 --> 00:47:55.873
By when do I need to pay back the money?

00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:57.166
What... In a week.

00:47:57.875 --> 00:47:58.876
I mean...

00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:01.712
In two weeks, yes. Two weeks.

00:48:01.796 --> 00:48:03.506
- Two weeks?
- Yes.

00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:05.841
Do you know how unreasonable that is?

00:48:05.925 --> 00:48:06.926
Make it a month.

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.178
Sorry? One month...

00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:14.892
Okay. I'll try to make it a month.

00:48:14.975 --> 00:48:17.061
I'll leave you
to take care of the paperwork.

00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:18.437
Okay.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.692
- It's hot!
- Oh, no!

00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:25.319
- Damn it.
- I'm sorry.

00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:27.822
- What's the matter with you people!
- It's okay.

00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:29.782
It's fine. I can just wipe it off.

00:48:29.865 --> 00:48:32.326
- It's okay.
- My goodness.

00:48:34.954 --> 00:48:35.955
Seriously.

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.999
I'm sorry.

00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:44.046
Jeez.

00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:49.093
That punk Jindeuk said it was all sorted.

00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:52.930
This won't do. I'll give him an earful.

00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:54.181
Don't call him.

00:48:55.724 --> 00:48:57.393
I'm sure he did his best.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.274
You're having to go through this
all because of Seokkyung.

00:49:04.316 --> 00:49:07.862
By the way,
will you be able to get that much money?

00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:12.658
Boss.

00:49:13.576 --> 00:49:15.661
- I'll sell my house.
- You crazy...

00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:19.039
Don't be ridiculous.

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:21.750
At least let's go have some makgeolli.

00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:24.587
Not today. I'm going home.

00:49:37.725 --> 00:49:39.852
- Grandma, throw it!
- Here.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.105
- Bounce.
- My gosh.

00:49:43.189 --> 00:49:45.774
I'm beat. Here.

00:49:45.858 --> 00:49:48.486
Can you go play on your own now?
Throw it there.

00:49:49.028 --> 00:49:50.029
My goodness.

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.406
Gosh, good job.

00:49:55.034 --> 00:49:56.535
You're good at it.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.126
My gosh.

00:50:35.658 --> 00:50:38.035
- Is it happening tomorrow?
- Yes.

00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:41.664
We'll meet tomorrow to get acquainted,
fine-tune the details of the contract,

00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:43.207
and bribe them a little.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.375
It'll all work out.

00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:46.210
Good to know.

00:50:48.629 --> 00:50:50.714
- Boss.
- Yes?

00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:55.803
Like I said before,
I'm leaving once this deal is settled.

00:50:57.137 --> 00:51:00.099
You're ruining a perfectly good day again.

00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:02.810
Fine, you punk. I get it.

00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:05.479
Okay.

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.152
Gosh, that punk.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.585
- How are you doing nowadays?
- It's tough.

00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:30.379
I need some results.
I can't let them laze around.

00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:31.922
Anything happening lately?

00:51:32.506 --> 00:51:34.091
Well...

00:51:34.174 --> 00:51:35.843
I think I can make something happen.

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.053
Would you like a present?

00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:46.103
I heard that
Changsoo might be...

00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:48.939
It could work in our favor
if you get the timing right.

00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:52.401
Goodness.

00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:56.238
This is why Changsoo can never beat you.
You use your wits.

00:51:57.448 --> 00:52:00.284
It seems like you really hate Changsoo.

00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:02.494
Not at all. I used to work for him.

00:52:02.578 --> 00:52:04.663
- Drink up. Let's get another round.
- Okay.

00:52:17.343 --> 00:52:20.137
BAND AND SOLO AUDITION
DARE TO BE A STAR

00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:35.152
Go ahead first, sir. I'll catch up soon.

00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:36.820
- Escort him.
- Yes, sir.

00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:37.905
This way, sir.

00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:50.626
Hello.

00:53:11.897 --> 00:53:13.482
Do you like music?

00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:16.777
Oh, yes.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.197
If you're here to watch the performance,
it's downstairs.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.448
Downstairs?

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:23.242
Oh, okay. Thank you.

00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:40.926
Welcome. Are you here alone?

00:53:41.009 --> 00:53:44.012
Oh, I want to sign up for the audition.

00:53:44.096 --> 00:53:46.390
You can do it online.

00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:50.018
I know,
but I wanted to check out the vibe.

00:53:50.102 --> 00:53:51.437
Is it okay if I look around?

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.063
Oh, okay, sure.

00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:55.399
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

00:54:24.553 --> 00:54:25.554
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:26.764
That's spicy.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:29.391
- Is it good?
- Yes.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.941
Yes.

00:54:43.405 --> 00:54:45.949
- Boss, do you have a minute?
- No.

00:54:46.033 --> 00:54:48.327
I just want to introduce some guys to you.

00:54:49.578 --> 00:54:50.579
What?

00:54:51.246 --> 00:54:52.289
Come on in!

00:54:58.837 --> 00:55:03.008
Show him respect, boys.
This is the famous Park Seokcheol.

00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:04.927
Greetings, sir!

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:11.308
- Who are they?
- They're high-school bullies.

00:55:11.934 --> 00:55:13.268
Jeez.

00:55:13.352 --> 00:55:14.937
We've heard a lot about you, sir!

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.523
Jang Wooseok of Myoungsan High School,
42nd batch.

00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:19.024
The schools around here
come under my turf.

00:55:19.107 --> 00:55:22.402
I aspire to be as cool as you someday.

00:55:25.781 --> 00:55:27.658
Boys, come closer.

00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:33.413
You know Mr. Kim Ku, right?

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.207
Kim...

00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:38.001
There's no teacher by that name
in my school.

00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:40.420
He's not a schoolteacher.

00:55:41.296 --> 00:55:44.091
He fought for independence, against Japan.

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:45.968
Gosh. I knew that.

00:55:46.635 --> 00:55:48.971
- What?
- I know Mr. Kim Ku.

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.681
Sure.

00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:54.935
There should be a book titled
The Diary of Kim Ku in the library.

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:57.646
If you read the whole book
and write a review,

00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:59.106
I'll accept you into the gang.

00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:02.192
Got it?

00:56:02.276 --> 00:56:03.277
Yes, sir!

00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:05.571
Now, turn right.

00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:08.574
Now leave.

00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:11.326
Go on.

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.957
Do you think they'll read the book?

00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:20.002
Of course they won't.

00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:22.087
That's why I asked them to read it.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.089
- Did you read it?
- Well...

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:28.218
The next time you bring kids like them
to me, you're in serious trouble.

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.137
Okay, I'll try not to.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.888
- "Try not to"?
- I won't bring them!

00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:34.141
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:37.269
- Now leave me alone.
- Yes, sir.

00:56:42.316 --> 00:56:43.442
Hello, sir!

00:56:43.525 --> 00:56:45.277
- Hi.
- Guys, quick! Get up!

00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:49.448
Father.

00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:52.492
Why are you here?

00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:57.164
I need to talk to Changsoo.

00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:04.296
Talk about what?

00:57:04.379 --> 00:57:06.089
It's none of your business.

00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:09.426
Wait.

00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:17.809
What do you mean,
it's none of my business?

00:57:17.893 --> 00:57:19.353
Look at your clothes...

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:25.525
You're not here to ask him for money,
are you?

00:57:27.653 --> 00:57:29.988
Mind your own business. I'll handle it.

00:57:32.074 --> 00:57:33.075
It's my business, too.

00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:37.704
Who do you think will have to pay back
the money you borrow from him?

00:57:37.788 --> 00:57:40.040
You know how hard I'll have to work
to make up for it.

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.042
- You ungrateful--
- It's because of you...

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:47.047
that I got into this line of work.

00:58:06.358 --> 00:58:08.902
- Oh, sir. You're here already?
- Yes...

00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:10.362
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

00:58:13.907 --> 00:58:15.409
Ah!

00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:19.121
Seeing father and son together
makes me feel so reassured.

00:58:19.204 --> 00:58:20.747
- Shall we go in?
- Sure.

00:58:20.831 --> 00:58:22.374
This way, please.

00:59:12.924 --> 00:59:14.551
How is your father doing?

00:59:14.634 --> 00:59:15.844
{\an8}PARK SEOKCHEOL

00:59:16.845 --> 00:59:18.138
Where was he relocated to?

00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:20.724
Sangwol Prison, sir.

00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:23.143
Oh, dear. He keeps getting further away.

00:59:24.186 --> 00:59:26.938
I should visit him,
but I just can't seem to make time for it.

00:59:27.439 --> 00:59:28.440
Anyway...

00:59:29.149 --> 00:59:30.317
Here.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.402
Give this to your mother.

00:59:48.877 --> 00:59:50.879
- So, why did you want to see me?
- Hmm.

00:59:52.464 --> 00:59:56.259
- How the business doing? All good?
- Yes.

00:59:56.343 --> 01:00:00.263
Thanks to Seokcheol,
I can walk around with my head held high.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:05.018
I'm so glad I took your advice back then.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.273
It's about my son.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.277
Yes. Seokcheol?

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.280
Give him a job at your company.

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.576
The money you send to my house
can be considered as his salary.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.036
Does that work for you?

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.346
You're Seokcheol, right?

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:45.934
In a way, you're part of our family, brat.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.687
Isn't that right?

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.481
I've heard you're a good fighter.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.612
My God, look at that stare!

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.616
He's ready.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.122
Whose fault is it...

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:11.543
Whose fault is it?

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:51.249
The Nice Guy

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:54.961
I didn't blindly
get the money, don't worry.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.380
{\an8}You brat.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:02:01.051
{\an8}Just sit down with Seokcheol
and tell him how you feel.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:05.013
{\an8}I'd be a fool
to expect him to understand me.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:07.140
{\an8}We have a problem!

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.267
{\an8}Some people are trying
to take Go Jeongnim away!

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:10.602
{\an8}

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:14.898
{\an8}Shouldn't we do something
about Park Seokcheol too?

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:17.442
{\an8}Everything's set up.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.986
{\an8}-
Will you come see me tonight?

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.154
{\an8}It's my first show.

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:24.074
{\an8}Of course I will.
I don't want to miss that.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.784
{\an8}Boss, we got a problem.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:26.868
{\an8}What are you talking about?

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:29.746
{\an8}Beautiful.

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:33.291
{\an8}It makes my heart ache.
