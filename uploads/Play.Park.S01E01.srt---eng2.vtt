WEBVTT

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:40.385
There, there. It's okay.

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:43.185
You can't find Mom and Dad?

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.465
I just saw her parents
walking that way a moment ago.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.785
Oh, that means they're around here.
They probably haven't gone far.

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:52.425
There, there. It's okay, alright?

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.865
-Don't cry. Let's go find Mom and Dad.
-There, there.

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:56.505
Wanna go find Mom and Dad?

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:59.185
Okay. What does Fifi look like?

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.505
It has round eyes too.

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:03.265
Okay, round eyes.

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:04.745
-And?
-They're black.

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:06.865
Okay, black eyes.

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:10.865
Its ears aren't normal. They can move

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.705
-up and down.
-Oh, the ears move?

00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:15.425
Fifi's ears can move? Okay.

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.385
So, what does Fifi look like?

00:03:25.465 --> 00:03:27.305
Um, it's a little chubby.

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:28.785
-Okay, a little chubby.
-And its legs

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:30.025
are this long.

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:31.385
Just this long?

00:03:57.465 --> 00:03:59.745
Ms. Lin. Mr. Pao has arrived.

00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:08.705
Ms. Lin.

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:10.785
Mr. Pao is here.

00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:12.145
Let's go.

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:27.385
Please come in, Ms. Lin.

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:28.865
Thank you.

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:31.665
How is your father doing?

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:33.585
I haven't had a chance to visit him.

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:36.345
He has been resting at home,
so his condition has improved.

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:38.705
So the daughter is running everything now.

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:44.345
And how's everything coming along?
Do you like Play Park's location?

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:46.345
I love it.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.345
Hello, welcome to Play Park.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.305
Please let me put your wristband on.

00:04:53.385 --> 00:04:55.905
-Please come in. Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:04:55.985 --> 00:04:58.305
Let's put this wristband on.

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:02.145
-Okay. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:03.625
-Have fun in there.
-Thank you.

00:05:03.705 --> 00:05:04.665
Thank you.

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:07.545
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:10.665
Hello.

00:05:10.745 --> 00:05:13.545
Oh, you'd like to
exchange the product, right?

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.625
Absolutely, we can still do that.

00:05:16.705 --> 00:05:19.705
Please send me a message again
to confirm this.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:21.105
Alright. Goodbye.

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:25.545
So many jobs.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.105
Could you please
move your faces closer together?

00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:30.785
So cute!

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.065
A little bit more.

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:34.225
Just a little closer, please.

00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:35.865
That's lovely!

00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.265
Can you get a little closer?

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:10.105
You two are so cute.

00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:36.225
STROLLER AND WHEELCHAIR RENTAL SERVICE

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.585
What are you smiling at, Ms. Lin?

00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:48.305
Nothing.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:50.945
That couple looks cute together.

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:02.865
Anywhere else you'd like to stop by?

00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:05.825
I think I'll head home. I want to rest.

00:07:05.905 --> 00:07:07.585
There's a birthday party
for Jang's son this evening.

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:09.025
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:27.865
-Let's see.
-Would you like to see it?

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:29.105
Yes.

00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:30.625
Here.

00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:32.585
-So cute!
-So cute!

00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:34.345
It's cute, huh?

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:46.905
Give it to me.

00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:48.825
-Hey.
-Give it here. I want the balloon.

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:50.025
Let go of my son.

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:53.865
Today is my son's birthday.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:56.105
I hired you to make balloons as gifts,

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.065
so why are you upsetting him?

00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:04.145
Jang.

00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:07.545
Oh, Lin? You're here.

00:08:11.745 --> 00:08:14.345
Hey, pack up all your stuff.

00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:16.665
I can only pay you half the price.

00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:21.305
Take it easy, Jang.

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:24.825
I saw what happened.

00:08:24.905 --> 00:08:27.985
Your son took a balloon from a friend,
so she stepped in to help.

00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:29.465
She didn't do anything wrong.

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:42.185
On your birthday, you should
make sure your friends are happy.

00:08:42.264 --> 00:08:46.145
What if your friends leave
before you get to blow out the candles?

00:08:49.225 --> 00:08:50.065
Happy birthday.

00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:51.865
Thank you. Yay!

00:08:58.025 --> 00:08:59.345
Let her continue her work.

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.345
See you inside then.

00:09:07.985 --> 00:09:09.505
Keep up the good work.

00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.025
Her name's Lin?

00:10:22.425 --> 00:10:23.585
Beautiful name.

00:10:24.105 --> 00:10:26.345
Lin? You're here.

00:10:29.065 --> 00:10:30.825
She's kind too.

00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:33.505
On your birthday, you should
make sure your friends are happy.

00:10:33.585 --> 00:10:36.825
What if your friends leave
before you get to blow out the candles?

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.025
And she has a pretty face.

00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:48.265
Can't believe
someone like her actually exists.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:01.665
Hello, what is it?

00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:03.785
Oh, really?

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:07.025
Then go to the hospital.
I'll cover for you.

00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:11.145
Oh, don't worry.
I'm always happy to earn some extra cash.

00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:12.785
Okay? I'll hurry over.

00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:46.145
Your food order has arrived.

00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:50.625
The gate is open, you can come in.

00:11:50.705 --> 00:11:51.625
Okay.

00:12:17.825 --> 00:12:18.625
-It's you?
-Oh, you.

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:21.545
-You saw me, right?
-You remember me?

00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:27.225
We thought the same thing.

00:12:30.025 --> 00:12:31.745
You ordered ramen, right?

00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:05.105
PP RAMEN

00:13:07.985 --> 00:13:09.185
Here's your food.

00:13:13.865 --> 00:13:14.785
Oh.

00:13:25.425 --> 00:13:27.065
It's okay. I'll pick it up for you.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.505
I'm sorry.

00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:05.385
I'm not trying to take it from you.
You can let go of my hand now.

00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:11.705
Sorry.

00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:16.505
Your name is Ing?

00:14:17.985 --> 00:14:19.225
Yes, Ms. Lin.

00:14:21.505 --> 00:14:23.625
How did you know my name?

00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:30.265
Well…

00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:32.465
I'm someone

00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:33.945
with a special sense.

00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:39.145
When I talk to someone

00:14:39.225 --> 00:14:41.345
and look at their face,

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:43.905
their name just pops into my head.

00:14:45.465 --> 00:14:46.865
You're confused?

00:14:47.465 --> 00:14:49.705
People around here
are just as confused as you are

00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:51.065
about how I know.

00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:01.065
Oh.

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.265
The food spilled everywhere.

00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:06.705
I don't think you can eat it anymore.
I'll go get you a new one.

00:15:07.585 --> 00:15:08.585
Wait.

00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:13.105
Yes?

00:15:14.905 --> 00:15:16.745
You have to be the one to deliver it.

00:15:17.265 --> 00:15:22.385
I want to hear more about
your ability to sense people's names.

00:15:25.105 --> 00:15:27.345
It's a personal belief.

00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:31.945
You might need to take what you hear
with a grain of salt.

00:15:34.505 --> 00:15:37.505
Okay. I'll wait.

00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:41.025
Yes.

00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:18.704
I can't sleep.

00:17:53.465 --> 00:17:54.705
Oh.

00:17:55.225 --> 00:17:57.105
It's okay. I'll pick it up for you.

00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:21.745
Let's meditate.

00:18:25.345 --> 00:18:27.585
I'm focusing my mind to meditate,

00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:30.145
so that my mind may be at peace.

00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:19.345
Let's pray.

00:19:21.345 --> 00:19:24.825
Araham sammā-sambuddho bhagavā

00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:29.225
Buddham bhagavantam abhivādemi

00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:33.945
Svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo

00:19:34.025 --> 00:19:36.225
Dhammam namassāmi

00:19:36.305 --> 00:19:39.465
Ugh, why didn't it help?

00:19:43.545 --> 00:19:45.505
Will I be able to wake up for work?

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:14.945
How'd it go with Mr. Pao?

00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:18.945
He still seems conflicted.

00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:23.065
The business isn't going well,
and he's still pushing.

00:20:23.585 --> 00:20:24.905
Should I go talk to him?

00:20:25.585 --> 00:20:26.865
It's okay.

00:20:26.945 --> 00:20:29.705
I still want to check a few things,
just to be sure.

00:20:31.985 --> 00:20:34.305
This job is a test of your skills.

00:20:34.385 --> 00:20:35.785
You can't mess up even once.

00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:39.385
You know your uncle is aiming
for your position, right?

00:20:39.465 --> 00:20:40.905
Yes, Dad.

00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:39.905
MEETING ATTENDANT
MS. LILIN JUKRAWUT, CEO

00:21:39.985 --> 00:21:42.025
MEETING AGENDA

00:21:47.345 --> 00:21:49.385
How did you know my name?

00:21:50.425 --> 00:21:53.905
Well… I'm someone

00:21:54.425 --> 00:21:55.785
with a special sense.

00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:00.065
When I talk to someone

00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:04.825
and look at their face,
their name just pops into my head.

00:22:04.905 --> 00:22:06.745
You're confused?

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:10.945
People around here are just
as confused as you are about how I know.

00:22:31.345 --> 00:22:32.665
There you are.

00:22:32.745 --> 00:22:34.425
Your coffee, ma'am.

00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:36.305
What's the meeting lineup for today, Jane?

00:22:36.385 --> 00:22:40.225
Uh, 11 a.m. till noon, a break for lunch,
and then we're back at it all afternoon.

00:22:41.825 --> 00:22:43.785
-I'll be right back.
-Oh?

00:22:43.865 --> 00:22:45.785
-Where are you going?
-It's an urgent matter.

00:22:46.385 --> 00:22:48.065
Would you like me to drive you?

00:22:48.145 --> 00:22:51.105
No need. Just have this coffee for me.

00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:17.425
Oh?

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.465
What is she doing here?

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:24.945
IngIng.

00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:26.945
Yes? Oh.

00:23:27.025 --> 00:23:28.745
-Wanna play hide-and-seek?
-Yes.

00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:31.145
Okay. Let's go. You go hide, alright?

00:23:32.705 --> 00:23:34.785
Hurry up and hide. Go.

00:23:48.065 --> 00:23:49.265
What are you doing in here?

00:24:01.425 --> 00:24:03.065
-Safe!
-Oh.

00:24:23.345 --> 00:24:25.625
Are you going to deliver
Japanese food again this evening?

00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:28.945
I am.

00:24:31.545 --> 00:24:35.185
I'll call to place an order.
You'll have to deliver it yourself.

00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:43.025
Let me think about it.

00:24:45.865 --> 00:24:47.345
I'll be waiting.

00:24:54.465 --> 00:24:55.665
But…

00:24:56.225 --> 00:24:58.385
I'm not sure yet…

00:24:59.385 --> 00:25:00.705
if I'll go.

00:25:50.185 --> 00:25:51.785
Oh, you still haven't gone home, Ing?

00:25:51.865 --> 00:25:53.545
Mhm, I'll leave soon.

00:25:54.065 --> 00:25:55.865
Did no one order anything for delivery?

00:25:55.945 --> 00:25:58.545
We're about to close.
There shouldn't be any orders after this.

00:26:10.145 --> 00:26:11.905
Are all the riders off the clock?

00:26:12.945 --> 00:26:15.065
Not yet. I'm here.

00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:16.905
Here.

00:26:17.425 --> 00:26:19.545
-Thank you. I'll deliver it.
-Okay.

00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:26.385
I'm sorry for the late order.
I was in meetings all day.

00:27:26.465 --> 00:27:28.305
I shouldn't have kept you waiting.

00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:32.465
Oh, no worries at all.

00:27:32.545 --> 00:27:35.425
I was just on my way home,
so I thought I'd stop by.

00:27:38.105 --> 00:27:39.265
Thanks.

00:27:41.505 --> 00:27:42.345
Right.

00:27:45.145 --> 00:27:48.025
Oh, and why did you order so much?

00:27:48.705 --> 00:27:50.505
I ordered some for you too.

00:27:52.625 --> 00:27:55.985
Why did you order for me?
I'm not hungry yet.

00:27:58.465 --> 00:28:02.425
Come and join me for dinner.
I have something to talk to you about.

00:28:11.225 --> 00:28:13.025
What does she want to talk about?

00:28:20.505 --> 00:28:23.145
Make yourself at home. Don't be shy.

00:28:37.905 --> 00:28:39.745
What a lovely home.

00:28:41.225 --> 00:28:42.465
But I don't get to be home much.

00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:46.465
Me neither.

00:28:49.425 --> 00:28:52.705
So, do you live alone?

00:28:53.425 --> 00:28:55.145
Why is your house so quiet?

00:28:55.905 --> 00:28:57.065
Yes.

00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:02.945
My father lives in the front house.
We can walk through to see each other.

00:29:04.385 --> 00:29:06.225
Oh…

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:10.185
I remember now.
I used to deliver food there too.

00:29:14.025 --> 00:29:17.345
So what did you want to talk to me about?

00:29:20.665 --> 00:29:25.945
LILIN JUKRAWUT
FAMILY NEST COMPANY

00:29:26.025 --> 00:29:27.345
Family Nest?

00:29:28.785 --> 00:29:32.025
Whoa, you're the CEO here?

00:29:33.545 --> 00:29:34.465
Mhm.

00:29:46.305 --> 00:29:49.705
I was observing you while you were working
at Play Park, and I'm very impressed.

00:29:50.785 --> 00:29:52.745
You seem very happy with your work.

00:29:52.825 --> 00:29:55.305
Any company would be very lucky

00:29:55.385 --> 00:29:58.185
to have someone as passionate
about their work as you are.

00:29:58.905 --> 00:30:01.905
How long is she going to keep praising me?
I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.

00:30:01.985 --> 00:30:03.185
Oh my gosh.

00:30:04.865 --> 00:30:06.185
Why would they be lucky?

00:30:06.825 --> 00:30:08.705
You seem very diligent.

00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:11.305
You tackle both heavy and light tasks,

00:30:12.065 --> 00:30:13.945
and you don't hesitate to accept any job.

00:30:14.025 --> 00:30:17.465
Why is she looking at me so tenderly?

00:30:17.545 --> 00:30:19.905
I'm not imagining things, am I?

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:22.065
Come on, Ing.

00:30:24.385 --> 00:30:26.225
I really admire you.

00:30:26.745 --> 00:30:28.465
I want you…

00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:33.705
I want you…

00:30:36.905 --> 00:30:38.385
I want you…

00:30:40.945 --> 00:30:42.865
to come work with me.

00:30:48.225 --> 00:30:50.825
If you're bored at the amusement park
or have any problems,

00:30:50.905 --> 00:30:53.585
you can contact me right away
using the info on my business card.

00:30:55.585 --> 00:30:56.825
LILIN JUKRAWUT
FAMILY NEST COMPANY

00:30:59.105 --> 00:31:02.425
It feels like I'm being headhunted.

00:31:03.025 --> 00:31:04.745
Can I call dibs on you?

00:31:14.745 --> 00:31:17.425
She's so cute.

00:31:44.585 --> 00:31:45.865
Thank you for the meal.

00:31:46.385 --> 00:31:48.785
It was nice to meet you.

00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:56.345
I feel a very strong connection with you.

00:32:01.345 --> 00:32:02.825
Thank you.

00:32:03.865 --> 00:32:07.305
So, I'll be heading back now.

00:32:08.545 --> 00:32:09.745
Wait.

00:32:13.505 --> 00:32:15.265
Are you going to the park tomorrow?

00:32:17.145 --> 00:32:19.465
No, tomorrow's my day off.

00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:21.465
Oh.

00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:25.705
-What's the matter?
-I thought I'd stop by.

00:32:26.385 --> 00:32:28.385
But if it's your day off,
you should relax.

00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:31.265
Ride home safely.

00:32:32.705 --> 00:32:33.545
Yes.

00:33:28.505 --> 00:33:31.305
WELCOME TO CHOO CHOO ADVENTURE

00:33:31.385 --> 00:33:34.305
Once all the rides are cleared,
we can start working right away.

00:33:34.945 --> 00:33:37.145
-Is it going to be done in time?
-Absolutely.

00:33:37.785 --> 00:33:39.265
Hey, the manager's here.

00:33:39.345 --> 00:33:40.905
-Really?
-She brought Donut along too.

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:43.145
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

00:33:57.585 --> 00:33:59.305
-Let me kiss your cheek.
-Me too.

00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:07.745
Oh, wow.

00:34:08.264 --> 00:34:09.465
-Wah! Wah!
-Oh.

00:34:09.545 --> 00:34:10.385
-Wow!
-The sound.

00:34:51.264 --> 00:34:55.585
Boop, boop, boop.

00:34:59.825 --> 00:35:01.025
-Sis.
-Hm?

00:35:01.105 --> 00:35:01.945
Waiting for someone?

00:35:03.105 --> 00:35:04.145
Waiting?

00:35:06.185 --> 00:35:08.305
I've seen you
looking for someone for a while now.

00:35:09.305 --> 00:35:12.105
Ugh. I was just checking
to see if everything was in order.

00:35:12.185 --> 00:35:13.865
That's what I usually do.

00:35:15.185 --> 00:35:17.145
You're talking nonsense. Come on.

00:35:17.745 --> 00:35:21.065
Come to Mama. Come to Mama.

00:35:21.145 --> 00:35:24.025
-Is it too hot?
-Don't want the hat anymore?

00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:27.305
-Help, Uncle Ith. Pull it to the back.
-Wah.

00:35:27.385 --> 00:35:29.385
Pull it to the back?

00:35:29.465 --> 00:35:31.105
-Okay.
-Yeah.

00:35:31.185 --> 00:35:33.505
Wanna come to Mama? Come to Mama.

00:35:33.585 --> 00:35:35.665
Wow.

00:35:36.265 --> 00:35:37.465
It's hot, right?

00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:39.425
Too hot out here?

00:35:39.505 --> 00:35:40.825
-It's too hot.
-So hot, right?

00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:43.265
Too hot?

00:35:50.025 --> 00:35:51.505
So embarrassing.

00:35:52.185 --> 00:35:53.905
I really put myself out there.

00:35:57.225 --> 00:35:59.385
IngIng must have felt
so uncomfortable last night.

00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:05.745
The meeting is ready, ma'am.

00:36:05.825 --> 00:36:07.425
Thank you.

00:36:09.505 --> 00:36:11.425
How could I face her now?

00:36:26.185 --> 00:36:30.985
What's up? What is it?

00:36:43.465 --> 00:36:44.585
Ugh.

00:36:49.505 --> 00:36:50.745
Ing?

00:36:52.025 --> 00:36:52.985
Ing.

00:36:54.105 --> 00:36:56.145
Ith. Hospital. Now.

00:36:58.065 --> 00:36:58.905
Have you called Guy?

00:36:59.785 --> 00:37:01.225
I won't tell him.

00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:03.225
Let's go. Careful.

00:37:13.425 --> 00:37:15.225
Mama's off to work now.

00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:25.065
Where are you going again?

00:37:27.065 --> 00:37:28.545
I'm going to deliver food.

00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:30.105
Take a break, sis.

00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:33.265
This month's house payment is all settled.

00:37:34.945 --> 00:37:37.025
Plus, I've already taken on a design job.

00:37:38.385 --> 00:37:40.665
It'll take too long before you get paid.

00:37:40.745 --> 00:37:42.265
There will be back-and-forth revisions.

00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:45.545
My job is much more secure.
I'll get paid as soon as I finish it.

00:37:49.945 --> 00:37:51.785
Mama will be right back.

00:37:51.865 --> 00:37:54.185
Mama's going to work
to earn some milk money.

00:37:54.265 --> 00:37:57.145
Okay? Stay with Papa, alright?

00:37:59.665 --> 00:38:00.945
Hey, sis.

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.545
Don't say it like that outside, okay?

00:38:04.785 --> 00:38:07.105
Everyone already thinks I'm your husband.

00:38:07.945 --> 00:38:09.545
I'm going to be single forever.

00:38:10.545 --> 00:38:14.465
That's good, isn't it? So you can
stay home and take care of your nephew.

00:38:15.065 --> 00:38:16.145
Just go.

00:38:16.865 --> 00:38:17.985
You too.

00:38:19.345 --> 00:38:21.385
Tell me when
you're going to see your friends.

00:38:21.905 --> 00:38:23.505
Enjoy life.

00:38:24.985 --> 00:38:25.905
Yeah, I know.

00:38:28.705 --> 00:38:30.745
Mama's going now.

00:38:33.865 --> 00:38:35.105
Let me go change.

00:38:41.665 --> 00:38:42.585
I'm not going out.

00:38:43.425 --> 00:38:47.745
It's much more fun
playing with you, right, Donut?

00:39:01.625 --> 00:39:05.585
Oh, she's home.

00:39:08.985 --> 00:39:10.865
But why didn't she order anything today?

00:39:11.985 --> 00:39:13.945
I haven't seen her at all.

00:39:16.945 --> 00:39:19.585
The lights are on, but where is she?

00:39:24.665 --> 00:39:26.985
I'm waiting for your order, you know?

00:40:12.705 --> 00:40:13.505
Manager.

00:40:13.585 --> 00:40:14.865
-Huh?
-Is it true?

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.665
Are we going to lose our jobs?

00:40:16.745 --> 00:40:17.865
What's going on?

00:40:17.945 --> 00:40:19.865
Someone wants to
take over Play Park's lease.

00:40:19.945 --> 00:40:23.225
Huh? The lease hasn't expired yet, has it?

00:40:23.305 --> 00:40:25.745
Is Mr. Pao going to close Play Park?

00:40:27.145 --> 00:40:28.145
Is Mr. Pao here?

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:31.465
Not yet. But the one requesting the rental
is already in the meeting room.

00:40:33.545 --> 00:40:35.665
Let me see the face of that cruel person.

00:40:52.465 --> 00:40:53.465
Ms. Lin?

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:02.705
What are you doing here?

00:41:03.305 --> 00:41:05.825
Family Nest is going to
sublease this property.

00:41:06.865 --> 00:41:07.985
Huh?

00:41:09.265 --> 00:41:12.545
But why not rent somewhere else?

00:41:12.625 --> 00:41:14.345
This is the best location.

00:41:16.985 --> 00:41:18.305
What did Mr. Pao say?

00:41:18.385 --> 00:41:20.905
He was still hesitant
and needed time to consider.

00:41:20.985 --> 00:41:22.985
So I came here today to hear the answer.

00:41:23.825 --> 00:41:25.065
Oh.

00:41:26.145 --> 00:41:27.985
You were trying to get close to me

00:41:28.905 --> 00:41:31.305
because you knew
I was the manager here, right?

00:41:32.665 --> 00:41:35.065
And you even
offered me money to join your side.

00:41:35.145 --> 00:41:36.865
How could you think like that?

00:41:40.385 --> 00:41:43.265
I never thought of it that way.
I really admire you.

00:41:47.625 --> 00:41:51.625
I can settle the rent agreement
with Mr. Pao without your help.

00:41:55.265 --> 00:41:56.625
Then go ahead and try.

00:41:57.905 --> 00:41:59.305
Let's see if he'll change his mind.

00:42:07.945 --> 00:42:10.665
Don't make a simple matter complicated.

00:42:13.145 --> 00:42:14.545
If you want to make things easy,

00:42:15.145 --> 00:42:16.745
why don't you rent somewhere else?

00:42:42.105 --> 00:42:44.185
I need to rent this place.

00:42:46.785 --> 00:42:49.385
Then I need to find a way to stop you too.

00:43:14.025 --> 00:43:16.185
Someone's trying to rent
the Play Park space after Mr. Pao.

00:43:16.265 --> 00:43:19.345
Good thing she's pretty,
or I'd be more upset.

00:43:19.865 --> 00:43:20.945
Again?

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:22.705
Soft spot for pretty ones?

00:43:24.665 --> 00:43:27.185
You're trying to stop me
from renting this place

00:43:27.265 --> 00:43:29.345
because you know it isn't good, right?

00:43:32.425 --> 00:43:33.745
A ghost! A ghost!

00:45:41.145 --> 00:45:43.945
