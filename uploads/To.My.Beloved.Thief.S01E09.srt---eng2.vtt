WEBVTT

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:51.322
They've given the order to kill
all the sick here and shut the place down.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:19.350
Hong Eun-jo.

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:47.629
Halt!

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:53.301
His Highness is in there.

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:06.064
{\an8}Don't worry.
There will be no more arrows coming.

00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:07.357
{\an8}Thank you, Your Highness.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:11.653
{\an8}Thank you.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.242
{\an8}Brother.

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:22.872
{\an8}Sorry I'm late.

00:02:23.498 --> 00:02:24.707
{\an8}Your Highness.

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:35.260
Your Highness!

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:39.305
It's you again.

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.183
It seems my thoughts keep slipping out.

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.937
Don't make me regret
not killing you last time.

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.486
Is this funny to you?

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:57.323
So many people nearly died,

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:59.951
all because of your family's greed.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:03.913
Go.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.166
I don't feel like seeing
anyone's blood today.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.626
Why don't you just punish me?

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.170
Your brother will be punished
for commanding this, and you…

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:13.464
have already been punished.

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:24.308
Did you know
you almost killed Physician Hong?

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:27.228
What?

00:03:46.164 --> 00:03:47.665
You were here.

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:49.459
How's the wounded one?

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:52.545
The arrow didn't go in very deep.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.800
You saved the people at the camp.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.137
Thank you so much for coming.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.556
Of course. You called.

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:08.686
Let me clean up the rest.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.271
If you stay too long, you might--

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:11.397
Why is this

00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:13.107
stuck so tight?

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:15.318
Listen to me, will you?

00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:18.863
I can be pretty stubborn too.

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:23.826
At least wear the face covering properly.

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:28.122
If you're done nagging, you can go.

00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:33.753
- Let me fix it for you.
- I'm good.

00:04:34.754 --> 00:04:36.798
I'm saying this as a physician.

00:04:44.013 --> 00:04:48.434
You know the entire pharmacy would panic
if you caught even a cold.

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:53.064
It's quite bold of you to do this,
given where we are.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.024
You're right.

00:04:55.108 --> 00:04:56.859
I'm usually a coward.

00:04:56.943 --> 00:04:58.194
Running away is my specialty.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:03.825
And you ran into a hail of arrows
just like that?

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:06.994
Next time, stick to your specialty.

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:08.329
Run away.

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.959
I wish I could, but I can't help it.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.712
When I'm with you, I become fearless.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:19.924
What?

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.010
This is because
you brought up the folk tale and all.

00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:24.429
You made me too brave.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.348
Are you saying it's my fault?

00:05:27.432 --> 00:05:29.600
Yes, you keep giving me courage.

00:05:34.772 --> 00:05:37.316
This is why I need to be
selective about people.

00:05:40.153 --> 00:05:41.445
What did you just say?

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:51.247
I guess just the two of us are going.

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:53.666
What about His Highness?

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.501
Is he spending the night here?

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.420
He says he has to protect her tonight.

00:05:57.503 --> 00:05:59.589
Oh, the power of love.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.843
I once yearned for a woman just as deeply.

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:06.304
Is she gone now?

00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:09.265
She's high up now.

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:11.934
I'm surprised.

00:06:13.436 --> 00:06:14.770
By my devoted love?

00:06:15.438 --> 00:06:17.899
I get that a lot.
People say I'm too handsome for that.

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:21.235
You had a woman?

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.112
That's why you're surprised?

00:06:23.654 --> 00:06:24.655
That's offensive!

00:06:28.743 --> 00:06:30.953
Don't you have to go back to the palace?

00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:33.956
People at your residence
must be looking for you.

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:38.002
That's why I sent Dae-chu.

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:43.049
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:06:43.132 --> 00:06:45.760
Spending the night
in the forest isn't easy.

00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:46.928
It can't be that different.

00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:50.640
We're on the same land of Joseon
under the same sky.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.892
It's nice out here.

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:55.102
It's dark,

00:06:55.853 --> 00:06:56.854
black,

00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:00.816
and pitch-dark.

00:07:44.652 --> 00:07:46.821
I wonder if Dae-chu will be really late.

00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:47.947
Right.

00:07:48.698 --> 00:07:49.824
I wonder.

00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:56.372
Is he already back?

00:07:58.583 --> 00:07:59.750
Did you hear that?

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:01.961
That's definitely the sound of a wolf.

00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:03.796
Do you

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.840
know that wolf?

00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:07.216
How would I know any wolf?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.261
You said you saw one around the annex.

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:12.763
That's a wolf I wish I didn't know.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.768
Then I'll scare it off.

00:08:17.852 --> 00:08:20.313
I'm sure it's a wild dog looking for food.

00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:33.451
Go away.

00:08:33.534 --> 00:08:35.036
Stay back, or you'll get burned.

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:40.041
It's leaving.

00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:44.795
That's right. It left.

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:51.969
This is

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:56.974
just like when you said
the rain was a thunderbolt.

00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:00.686
I'm not

00:09:01.312 --> 00:09:03.064
very good with water.

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.608
I'm sure you are.

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:06.817
I really am not.

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:08.402
Ever since I was little.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.821
Why?

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.157
I once fell into a lake.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.174
How did you get out?

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:31.842
I woke up at the Royal Villa.

00:09:31.926 --> 00:09:34.929
Apparently, someone saved me
and carried me to the shore.

00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:38.516
They saved your life.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.062
My mother looked for them everywhere,
but she couldn't find them.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.358
You must've been so scared,
all alone in the water.

00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:50.403
I don't remember it
because I was too young.

00:09:54.073 --> 00:09:57.743
If you ever need to be near water,
let me know.

00:09:58.494 --> 00:09:59.662
You?

00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:02.039
I'm a pretty good swimmer.

00:10:02.623 --> 00:10:03.499
My mother said

00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:06.210
that I was a fierce swimmer in her womb.

00:10:07.086 --> 00:10:08.713
I guess I'm a natural in the water.

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:15.052
I'm serious.

00:10:15.803 --> 00:10:17.012
Are you laughing at me?

00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:18.681
I was just smiling.

00:10:19.265 --> 00:10:20.266
I always have been.

00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:27.481
If the feelings are too deep to let go of,

00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:30.359
please leave Joseon

00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:33.028
for Eun-jo's sake.

00:10:47.877 --> 00:10:48.878
It looks tasty!

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.046
It looks tasty, doesn't it?

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:00.806
This is the only thing we can give you.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.351
It was made by a healthy child
who was born and is living here.

00:11:04.435 --> 00:11:05.644
So it's safe to eat.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.689
This is precious food. How could you…

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:11.734
We received some rice from Gil-dong.

00:11:14.153 --> 00:11:15.404
Who? Gil-dong?

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:21.076
Rice cake, Gil-dong,
there's a lot to digest.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.286
Are you all right?

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:31.045
So, Gil-dong rose from the dead?

00:11:31.712 --> 00:11:33.255
He'll soon be immortal.

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:35.132
That's what rumors are like.

00:11:35.216 --> 00:11:36.675
Now do you see how I felt?

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:43.015
You're listening in so naturally.

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:45.684
Naturally. I know it already.

00:11:46.477 --> 00:11:47.770
I'm his lord.

00:11:47.853 --> 00:11:49.396
If I lose my job, I'll be an idler.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.565
And you'll break your parents' hearts.

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:53.984
What are you talking about?

00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:56.153
I'm saying I will keep my mouth shut.

00:11:56.237 --> 00:11:58.697
I refuse to be
your partner in crime though.

00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:00.574
Are you backing out now?

00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:02.159
I've backed out.

00:12:03.744 --> 00:12:06.580
How about both of you back out?

00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:09.583
Sister! Brother!

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:10.960
Geum-dol.

00:12:14.088 --> 00:12:14.922
Here.

00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:17.132
What's that, kiddo?

00:12:17.216 --> 00:12:18.884
It's a talisman.

00:12:19.468 --> 00:12:21.095
All the children born here

00:12:21.178 --> 00:12:23.305
wear this talisman
with the word "life" written on it.

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:26.684
It's meant to protect them
from the illness their parents carry.

00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:29.520
Why did you bring them, Geum-dol?

00:12:29.603 --> 00:12:32.022
You can have them.
I don't need them anymore.

00:12:32.106 --> 00:12:35.109
- What?
- Animals don't need them.

00:12:40.281 --> 00:12:42.074
Who said that?

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:43.534
Bun-i did.

00:12:44.076 --> 00:12:46.620
She said that
even if we had been wiped out yesterday,

00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:49.498
no one would have cared
because we're just animals.

00:12:49.582 --> 00:12:52.585
So you and Brother can have them.

00:13:03.262 --> 00:13:04.430
Of course you don't need it.

00:13:05.556 --> 00:13:06.390
Kiddo,

00:13:06.473 --> 00:13:08.183
you can live a good life

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:09.310
without it.

00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:11.729
Really, Sister?

00:13:19.695 --> 00:13:20.738
Of course.

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:30.706
We will dispatch a post horse
to the Royal Villa

00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:34.001
to inform His Majesty
of the vile acts you committed yesterday.

00:13:34.877 --> 00:13:35.711
Go ahead

00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:37.880
if you have the nerve to bear the cost.

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:47.765
Grand Prince Dowol?

00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:54.313
Why does he want me to come this far?

00:13:59.276 --> 00:14:00.527
What's this?

00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:02.404
Who set a trap here?

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:05.491
Of course it's me. I called you here.

00:14:12.706 --> 00:14:16.543
Your Highness,
how could you treat a scholar like this?

00:14:16.627 --> 00:14:18.545
I'm only treating an animal
like an animal.

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:19.964
Pardon?

00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:22.758
Mong-sil.

00:14:29.056 --> 00:14:30.599
Get him.

00:14:30.683 --> 00:14:32.476
Your Highness, what is this about?

00:14:34.395 --> 00:14:35.521
Good boy.

00:14:37.648 --> 00:14:40.192
Your Highness, please don't kill me.

00:14:42.653 --> 00:14:45.698
That's exactly
what people at the leper camp shouted.

00:14:47.324 --> 00:14:48.409
How…

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.828
How did you…

00:14:54.456 --> 00:14:57.001
Im Seung-jae admitted that
he ordered the leper camp burned down

00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:58.335
in this letter of confession.

00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:02.131
He's the eldest son of Chief Secretary Im.

00:15:02.214 --> 00:15:05.467
It would be difficult for me
to dismiss him over this alone.

00:15:05.551 --> 00:15:07.469
I was told it would actually be easy.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.763
The leper camp he ordered burned down…

00:15:10.347 --> 00:15:12.182
His Highness was there.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.309
Grand Prince Dowol?

00:15:14.393 --> 00:15:18.355
This is a grave matter.
The Grand Prince was nearly killed.

00:15:20.524 --> 00:15:24.570
Tell His Highness that this affront to
the royal family will not go unpunished.

00:15:31.076 --> 00:15:33.370
Did you know
you almost killed Physician Hong?

00:16:13.077 --> 00:16:14.953
I can't even enter my own house?

00:16:22.711 --> 00:16:24.713
You must think you're a great physician,

00:16:24.797 --> 00:16:27.549
thinking you can save
all the sick in Joseon.

00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:31.720
I'm sorry that arrow didn't kill me.

00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:36.433
Last night,

00:16:37.643 --> 00:16:39.436
you took away something

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.439
from a child
whose whole world was the leper camp,

00:16:42.523 --> 00:16:44.441
and whose only wish

00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:48.028
was to live a long life
with his ailing mother.

00:16:48.112 --> 00:16:50.572
Do you know what that was?

00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:56.703
How could you treat a human being
like an animal?

00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:00.999
Because…

00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:05.712
those are lowlifes.

00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:12.761
That's what the world says.

00:17:15.472 --> 00:17:16.807
But not my world.

00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:20.435
To me, everyone is precious.

00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:42.499
LIFE

00:18:31.215 --> 00:18:32.758
Young Master.

00:18:32.841 --> 00:18:35.552
Grand Prince Dowol,
how dare you dismiss me?

00:18:36.303 --> 00:18:37.846
Once Father is back…

00:18:40.057 --> 00:18:41.141
Young Master.

00:18:41.225 --> 00:18:42.392
Black Sword!

00:18:58.158 --> 00:19:00.452
What is this scoundrel even saying?

00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:03.789
Do you think I will do as you say?

00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:09.086
No. I think you must.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.363
How could you miss catching him
every single time?

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:37.447
I apologize.

00:19:38.573 --> 00:19:40.701
He said he'd put an arrow
through my throat tomorrow.

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:42.995
What do we do?

00:19:43.954 --> 00:19:45.205
Do you have an idea?

00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:56.717
This is the idea?

00:19:58.677 --> 00:19:59.720
I don't like it either.

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:02.514
It's only until we catch him.

00:20:03.307 --> 00:20:05.851
Young Master, your lunch is ready.

00:20:07.436 --> 00:20:08.562
Bring it in.

00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:14.568
- Oh, dear!
- Seung-jae.

00:20:15.694 --> 00:20:16.903
Seung-jae.

00:20:24.453 --> 00:20:25.912
How did he even…

00:20:31.335 --> 00:20:34.463
It says, "Tomorrow, it'll be
steel at your throat, not cotton."

00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:39.217
Why don't you just do as the letter says?

00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:41.887
I would rather die than disgrace myself.

00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:44.723
I can't do that to those lowly animals.

00:20:54.691 --> 00:20:55.901
"I have wronged you

00:20:56.735 --> 00:20:58.153
beyond forgiveness."

00:21:00.072 --> 00:21:01.323
"It was no way

00:21:02.699 --> 00:21:04.993
to treat a human being."

00:21:06.453 --> 00:21:08.246
"You are not animals."

00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:11.124
"I am."

00:21:12.292 --> 00:21:13.668
"It is I,

00:21:15.087 --> 00:21:16.380
Im Seung-jae."

00:21:25.013 --> 00:21:26.473
Why are you all crying?

00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:28.517
Don't cry.

00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:45.867
Now I've seen everything.

00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:48.120
I can't believe
a nobleman apologized to us.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.665
Really? That's unusual.

00:21:51.748 --> 00:21:52.874
Right?

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.501
And it happened twice.

00:21:57.838 --> 00:21:58.880
Twice?

00:21:59.714 --> 00:22:00.924
The State Tribunal's secretary

00:22:01.007 --> 00:22:03.218
came back and said
that he was the younger brother.

00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:08.807
Was his name

00:22:09.516 --> 00:22:12.519
Jae-i of the Im family, by any chance?

00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:13.603
Yes.

00:22:14.312 --> 00:22:17.816
He said he didn't deserve forgiveness.

00:22:17.899 --> 00:22:20.318
He said that,
whether with fists or arrows,

00:22:20.402 --> 00:22:22.279
we should pay them back twice over.

00:22:24.072 --> 00:22:27.159
It sounded harsh,

00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:29.411
but it sounded like a heartfelt apology.

00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:07.908
Do you want me to pay you back too?

00:23:15.916 --> 00:23:17.125
Come on. Stab me.

00:23:17.209 --> 00:23:20.170
You've already been slashed
dozens of times.

00:23:20.253 --> 00:23:22.422
I don't need to add to it.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.804
Take off the cotton cloth.
I'll apply some medicine.

00:23:32.807 --> 00:23:34.517
I almost killed you.

00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:42.442
I would stab you a hundred times,

00:23:43.693 --> 00:23:44.611
but I will accept

00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:46.279
your apology.

00:23:48.073 --> 00:23:49.783
And this is the Hyeminseo.

00:23:50.325 --> 00:23:52.285
We save people's lives here,

00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:53.620
not kill them.

00:23:57.457 --> 00:23:59.334
And I'm a physician.

00:24:02.462 --> 00:24:05.799
Your brother will be punished
for commanding this, and you…

00:24:05.882 --> 00:24:07.592
have already been punished.

00:24:11.304 --> 00:24:12.597
So this is my punishment.

00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:16.977
Punishment?

00:24:17.435 --> 00:24:20.146
Having you worry about my wound
when I almost killed you.

00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:23.900
Having you show me warmth

00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:26.403
and give me false hope.

00:24:29.114 --> 00:24:30.407
That's my punishment.

00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:41.376
Are you just leaving like that?

00:24:43.253 --> 00:24:44.671
What did you mean by that just now?

00:24:50.593 --> 00:24:53.430
The Grand Prince knew
that I was getting this punishment.

00:24:54.723 --> 00:24:56.474
I don't understand.

00:24:58.476 --> 00:24:59.644
Here's my hand.

00:25:00.478 --> 00:25:01.730
What are you doing?

00:25:02.647 --> 00:25:04.774
What are you looking at? I'm hurt.

00:25:06.151 --> 00:25:08.361
- Are you doing this on purpose?
- Yes.

00:25:08.445 --> 00:25:09.779
- Why?
- Because I want to.

00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:12.699
Let go of her hand.

00:25:15.702 --> 00:25:17.245
I wonder how it would look

00:25:17.329 --> 00:25:19.372
if the most exalted Grand Prince

00:25:19.456 --> 00:25:21.499
were to lose his composure and go mad.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.793
You won't get to see that.

00:25:23.877 --> 00:25:25.545
Because he's just like me.

00:25:26.671 --> 00:25:27.672
He's hurt.

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:30.467
He's a patient.

00:25:37.474 --> 00:25:38.516
What are you doing?

00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:40.268
Go on, hit me.

00:25:41.227 --> 00:25:43.188
Even in war,
the wounded are not to be attacked.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.401
He's here to apologize.

00:25:49.736 --> 00:25:51.112
If you're done here, leave.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.115
And seek a private physician if possible.

00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:00.080
You're making me pettier and pettier.

00:26:00.872 --> 00:26:01.998
What?

00:26:17.889 --> 00:26:18.723
What's that?

00:26:19.849 --> 00:26:22.310
I heard something interesting
at the constabulary.

00:26:22.894 --> 00:26:26.981
I think I read somewhere that Gil-dong
used cotton as an arrowhead.

00:26:27.524 --> 00:26:28.358
Is this the one?

00:26:28.441 --> 00:26:31.111
It does look like
Gil-dong's arrow that I saw,

00:26:31.986 --> 00:26:33.279
but Gil-dong is dead.

00:26:34.239 --> 00:26:35.407
Where did you get this?

00:26:36.366 --> 00:26:38.576
I picked it up in my own room.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.623
You must have heard

00:26:44.749 --> 00:26:48.545
about the rumor that Gil-dong was the one
who sent rice to the leper camp.

00:26:49.295 --> 00:26:50.797
Get to the point.

00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:54.926
My conclusion is

00:26:55.593 --> 00:26:56.803
that Gil-dong

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:57.887
is alive.

00:26:59.347 --> 00:27:01.391
And he's still around Your Highness.

00:27:08.773 --> 00:27:11.192
The investigation into Gil-dong
has been closed.

00:27:12.152 --> 00:27:13.903
The Chief Secretary has agreed too.

00:27:16.448 --> 00:27:17.365
I knew it.

00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:20.160
You go to such lengths to protect him.

00:27:20.243 --> 00:27:23.246
Gil-dong must be someone dear to you.

00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:26.082
I'm almost jealous.

00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.001
Don't do anything silly, Im Jae-i.

00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:30.170
Stop.

00:27:30.253 --> 00:27:32.547
That concludes my report, Your Highness.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.216
I'm the secretary of the State Tribunal,
Jae-i of the Im family.

00:27:36.551 --> 00:27:38.720
We'll speak again
regarding Gil-dong's case.

00:27:49.189 --> 00:27:50.356
What happened?

00:27:53.818 --> 00:27:56.070
I didn't want to use
the arrow as a threat,

00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:59.115
but I couldn't just sit by and do nothing.

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:01.034
They're the ones who took it away.

00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:02.285
Took away what?

00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:06.164
Basic human dignity.

00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:10.376
I can't let them take that away too.

00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:15.590
If anyone at the leper camp

00:28:15.673 --> 00:28:18.092
had actually lost their life,

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.845
I might've done something even worse.

00:28:23.264 --> 00:28:24.766
It's good that they got it back.

00:28:27.977 --> 00:28:29.979
But next time, ask for my help.

00:28:30.688 --> 00:28:32.524
Don't get your hands dirty
threatening people.

00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.947
"Threaten"

00:28:39.906 --> 00:28:42.033
isn't quite the word I would use.

00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:44.452
It was more like a suggestion.

00:28:45.578 --> 00:28:47.831
"Listen to me while I'm being nice"?

00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:50.083
I see. That's respectful enough.

00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:52.168
Anyway,

00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:54.254
don't worry.

00:28:54.337 --> 00:28:57.882
The Chief Secretary's second son
won't be able to find any more evidence.

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:00.093
And in Joseon--

00:29:00.176 --> 00:29:01.094
I know.

00:29:01.177 --> 00:29:02.929
No one would ever suspect a woman

00:29:03.012 --> 00:29:04.430
of being a thief.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.562
Except for one person.

00:29:10.645 --> 00:29:12.605
You're the only one in Joseon who knows.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.068
Right.

00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:21.990
So if I disappear from Joseon,

00:29:22.949 --> 00:29:24.784
then no one will know anymore.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.456
I must head to the constabulary.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.792
I left my horse there.

00:29:43.386 --> 00:29:44.220
Your Highness.

00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:49.142
These are all the records about Gil-dong.

00:29:49.225 --> 00:29:51.644
Make sure nothing about Gil-dong
is spoken of.

00:29:52.478 --> 00:29:56.524
If you find anyone other than Im Jae-i
chasing Gil-dong,

00:29:56.608 --> 00:29:57.984
make sure she's protected.

00:29:59.235 --> 00:30:00.528
What about Your Highness?

00:30:01.446 --> 00:30:03.239
Are you going somewhere?

00:30:03.948 --> 00:30:05.575
I'm doing what I'm best at.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:08.536
Running away.

00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:14.626
Hong Eun-jo.

00:30:20.798 --> 00:30:23.968
I was terrified when he found out,

00:30:25.011 --> 00:30:27.555
but now I'm glad that he knows.

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:32.060
How funny is that?

00:30:38.358 --> 00:30:40.443
You keep giving me courage.

00:30:44.572 --> 00:30:45.698
I'm just smiling.

00:30:46.407 --> 00:30:47.283
I always have been.

00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:57.460
Right.

00:30:58.002 --> 00:30:59.045
This is

00:30:59.796 --> 00:31:01.047
my proposal.

00:31:03.466 --> 00:31:05.551
I totally forgot about it.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.347
Where did I lose it?

00:31:11.224 --> 00:31:13.309
I heard that Im Seung-jae was dismissed.

00:31:13.393 --> 00:31:17.355
Chief Secretary Im will be shocked
to hear this when he's back.

00:31:18.231 --> 00:31:21.192
Grand Prince Dowol is behind all this.

00:31:22.568 --> 00:31:26.614
He had an aide
deliver Im Seung-jae's confession to me.

00:31:30.827 --> 00:31:32.161
That person?

00:31:49.929 --> 00:31:53.599
Here's the report on the rumors
surrounding Gil-dong, as requested.

00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:58.521
Look into how Grand Prince Dowol
is involved with the leper camp.

00:31:58.604 --> 00:31:59.605
Yes, ma'am.

00:32:03.276 --> 00:32:05.611
My niece as His Highness' bride?

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:08.072
If you must say no,

00:32:08.156 --> 00:32:11.117
I'll try not to be too disappointed,
for old time's sake.

00:32:12.785 --> 00:32:13.995
I would never.

00:32:14.704 --> 00:32:16.497
I will send a letter to my niece.

00:32:17.165 --> 00:32:20.334
If we get caught up in formalities,
His Majesty will step in.

00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:24.005
Do you have something in mind?

00:32:27.008 --> 00:32:28.176
A little bit of

00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:30.386
romance?

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.312
Where is Her Majesty?

00:32:52.241 --> 00:32:53.326
What are you doing here?

00:32:56.412 --> 00:32:57.663
Your Highness.

00:32:59.332 --> 00:33:02.627
Her Majesty asked me
to play some music, so…

00:33:04.754 --> 00:33:06.214
She was here just a moment ago.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.926
It seems like
I'm supposed to be carried away

00:33:10.009 --> 00:33:11.844
either by your music or your beauty,

00:33:12.637 --> 00:33:14.514
and end up completely smitten.

00:33:15.973 --> 00:33:17.517
What's next?

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.393
Running into you by a secluded watermill?

00:33:27.652 --> 00:33:29.946
It seems like
I'm supposed to lose my cool here and…

00:33:39.497 --> 00:33:42.458
At least don't make it so obvious
that Her Majesty is behind this.

00:33:47.255 --> 00:33:49.423
The two of them
have pretty classic tastes.

00:33:50.007 --> 00:33:51.008
I would call it outdated.

00:33:51.092 --> 00:33:52.718
They believe coincidences mean destiny.

00:33:55.263 --> 00:33:57.223
Oh, a dullard.

00:33:57.306 --> 00:33:58.975
Wait. He's from…

00:34:00.184 --> 00:34:01.644
May I ask you a question?

00:34:03.312 --> 00:34:04.981
That's why the three coincidences

00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:07.483
were overlooked.

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:09.819
What do you mean?

00:34:11.237 --> 00:34:12.280
Nothing.

00:34:13.447 --> 00:34:15.992
I heard about the unfortunate incident
at the leper camp.

00:34:16.075 --> 00:34:19.036
Though it was for a short while,
I was engaged to someone from that family.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.371
What they did is

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:22.123
truly infuriating.

00:34:22.206 --> 00:34:24.500
Since you're saying
you finally realized it,

00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:25.877
congratulations

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.461
on escaping the Im family.

00:34:28.045 --> 00:34:29.338
Move on from that engagement.

00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:33.593
What about you, Your Highness?

00:34:34.552 --> 00:34:36.929
Are you moving on from that woman?

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.349
I'm running away from her.

00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:44.020
What did you just say?

00:34:44.103 --> 00:34:45.813
I will leave Joseon.

00:34:48.316 --> 00:34:49.150
Why?

00:34:49.942 --> 00:34:51.527
A trip disguised as studying abroad.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.240
You'd feel more at ease that way

00:34:56.324 --> 00:34:58.743
than if I stayed close to His Majesty.

00:35:09.295 --> 00:35:10.838
It's a hit, Your Majesty!

00:35:10.922 --> 00:35:13.299
Your Majesty is truly
an exceptional hunter.

00:35:13.883 --> 00:35:16.219
I'm concerned for Your Majesty's health.

00:35:16.302 --> 00:35:18.512
Our return to the palace
has been delayed by ten days.

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:21.933
For tomorrow's hunt,
we'll go farther than Mount Dogo.

00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:25.019
I hear there are tigers there.

00:35:25.102 --> 00:35:25.937
Your Majesty,

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.316
thousands of people
have been displaced for this hunt.

00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:34.070
And tomorrow,
the number will grow tenfold.

00:35:52.463 --> 00:35:55.591
It's suspicious that
he suddenly wants to study abroad.

00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:00.179
Is Hong-si still on sick leave?

00:36:01.264 --> 00:36:02.265
Well…

00:36:03.182 --> 00:36:05.309
There is something
I have not yet told you,

00:36:06.352 --> 00:36:08.938
fearing it might upset you, Your Majesty.

00:36:10.106 --> 00:36:13.859
How dare you bring an outsider
into the palace disguised as a court lady?

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:20.825
So, you refuse to tell me who Hong-si is?

00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:28.040
Well done.

00:36:30.668 --> 00:36:32.128
If anyone asks, keep silent,

00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:34.755
and never speak of her.

00:36:35.715 --> 00:36:37.883
His Majesty must not learn of this.

00:36:54.191 --> 00:36:56.152
Sister, what are you looking for?

00:36:58.154 --> 00:36:59.196
Geum-dol.

00:37:00.698 --> 00:37:02.158
Have you seen

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.328
an envelope this big?

00:37:08.456 --> 00:37:10.166
Maybe it's not here.

00:37:10.249 --> 00:37:11.751
Is it important?

00:37:17.631 --> 00:37:18.924
It's something

00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:21.969
I want to keep only to myself.

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:26.974
Brother.

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:33.898
How did you…

00:37:33.981 --> 00:37:36.317
I went to Hyeminseo to talk to you,
and you weren't there.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.360
So I knew where to go.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.032
Hey, my brother.
Were you talking about something fun?

00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:44.492
Yes, Sister said

00:37:44.575 --> 00:37:46.619
she wanted to keep something--

00:37:46.702 --> 00:37:47.953
Geum-dol!

00:37:48.037 --> 00:37:49.038
Your…

00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:52.666
Your mother is looking for you.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:53.959
You should hurry back.

00:37:54.043 --> 00:37:56.128
His mother is waiting.
I'll take him to her.

00:37:56.212 --> 00:37:58.631
Come on. Let's go.

00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:04.178
All of a sudden?

00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:12.478
The weather has been nice these days.

00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:16.190
You're right.

00:38:17.733 --> 00:38:19.485
I'll remember this for a long time.

00:38:20.861 --> 00:38:22.029
This time we're in now.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.243
So…

00:38:27.952 --> 00:38:29.662
What is it that you wanted to say?

00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:30.955
Right.

00:38:31.038 --> 00:38:32.456
Don't worry about Im Jae-i.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.709
I made sure all evidence
tied to Gil-dong is gone,

00:38:35.793 --> 00:38:38.045
so he won't be able to interfere anymore.

00:38:41.048 --> 00:38:42.883
I'm worried about me, not you.

00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:44.593
If you get caught,

00:38:44.677 --> 00:38:46.804
I'll get in trouble too.
We're partners in crime.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.979
I don't usually like to brag,

00:38:55.771 --> 00:38:57.231
but I learned my archery

00:38:58.065 --> 00:39:01.777
from my lord, the former Minister of War.

00:39:02.486 --> 00:39:03.779
You must be close to him.

00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:04.864
Yes.

00:39:06.115 --> 00:39:07.658
When I was little,

00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:09.285
my lord and I

00:39:09.368 --> 00:39:12.288
went to the market together every year.

00:39:13.706 --> 00:39:16.041
It felt like a special outing to me.

00:39:17.042 --> 00:39:20.463
It was only later that I found out

00:39:20.546 --> 00:39:24.008
it was the day before
he was dispatched to the battlefield.

00:39:24.091 --> 00:39:25.509
It's yeot!

00:39:26.635 --> 00:39:27.720
Do you want some?

00:39:28.637 --> 00:39:32.099
If he had died in any of those battles,

00:39:32.183 --> 00:39:34.643
that special outing would have been

00:39:34.727 --> 00:39:36.812
my last day with him.

00:39:38.189 --> 00:39:41.400
He said he didn't want
my last memories with him to be sad.

00:39:43.068 --> 00:39:44.820
That's the kind of man he is.

00:39:44.904 --> 00:39:46.572
And he taught me archery

00:39:46.655 --> 00:39:48.949
so I could protect myself and the family

00:39:49.575 --> 00:39:51.452
when we're left alone.

00:39:52.995 --> 00:39:55.664
And now, you're even looking out
for your neighbors.

00:39:58.375 --> 00:40:00.169
Even if I'm not in Joseon--

00:40:02.296 --> 00:40:03.547
Is that…

00:40:08.594 --> 00:40:09.803
Hello.

00:40:15.392 --> 00:40:16.477
What are you doing?

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.728
I almost missed it.

00:40:17.811 --> 00:40:19.188
{\an8}Today, we have Maeguigut.

00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:21.190
{\an8}MAEGUIGUT: A FOLK RITUAL
PRACTICED FOR GOOD LUCK

00:40:24.235 --> 00:40:25.486
We should make wishes.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.197
Can I get two, please?

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.615
I'm sorry.

00:40:30.282 --> 00:40:31.825
I only have one left.

00:40:31.909 --> 00:40:33.827
Don't worry about me. I don't make wishes.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.664
Why don't you give it a try?

00:40:36.747 --> 00:40:39.875
As they say,
the heavens are always by our side,

00:40:41.043 --> 00:40:42.586
closer than we think.

00:40:44.421 --> 00:40:46.757
Their hearing might be
worse than we think too.

00:40:50.427 --> 00:40:52.972
Then I'll say my wish out loud and clear.

00:40:53.055 --> 00:40:54.640
I'll take the last sky lantern.

00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:57.059
Make sure you make only one wish,

00:40:58.519 --> 00:41:00.771
and say it loud and clear
so they can hear it.

00:41:06.026 --> 00:41:09.113
We have lovely, bright moonlight tonight.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.471
What are you thinking about for so long?

00:41:34.555 --> 00:41:36.849
I can only make one wish,

00:41:36.932 --> 00:41:39.602
so I don't know what to write.

00:41:40.436 --> 00:41:42.104
You have that many wishes?

00:41:43.522 --> 00:41:45.608
Maybe you're actually pretty greedy.

00:41:45.691 --> 00:41:47.359
"Greedy"?

00:41:49.528 --> 00:41:52.156
It's just that
I've never made a wish before.

00:41:53.616 --> 00:41:54.742
What is it?

00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:57.703
We should release the lantern soon.

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:59.121
Just give me a rough idea.

00:42:05.002 --> 00:42:06.378
The thing is

00:42:07.421 --> 00:42:09.757
I feel like

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.800
this is actually me being greedy.

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:20.434
I already have more than I could ask for.

00:42:20.517 --> 00:42:23.979
So I was just going to leave it at that.

00:42:25.522 --> 00:42:28.317
I'm not even sure
if I should wish for this.

00:42:30.569 --> 00:42:32.446
Are you talking about your nosiness?

00:42:34.239 --> 00:42:35.324
No, I'm not.

00:42:35.908 --> 00:42:37.242
You are.

00:42:37.326 --> 00:42:39.286
If you're going to wish to be even nosier,

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.704
put the brush down.

00:42:40.788 --> 00:42:41.955
It's my wish.

00:42:42.706 --> 00:42:44.083
Don't be so nosy.

00:42:47.711 --> 00:42:48.796
Don't look.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.756
I won't.

00:43:44.601 --> 00:43:46.437
You're really wishing hard.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.730
You can tell me now.

00:43:47.813 --> 00:43:50.649
I'm sure I can grant your wish faster.

00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:54.820
What? Did you see my wish?

00:43:55.529 --> 00:43:56.363
No, I didn't.

00:43:57.406 --> 00:44:00.033
So it's really something I can do?

00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:03.746
No, it's not.

00:44:04.663 --> 00:44:06.331
You have nothing to do with it.

00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:08.000
I don't believe you.

00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:10.335
What is it?
Is there another corrupt official?

00:44:11.336 --> 00:44:12.171
No.

00:44:12.254 --> 00:44:13.422
Is someone sick?

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:15.466
No.

00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:16.717
Is someone starving?

00:44:17.384 --> 00:44:18.594
No!

00:45:06.225 --> 00:45:07.267
My lord.

00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:17.152
I put two winter clothes in your bag.

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.278
Thank you.

00:45:19.154 --> 00:45:21.740
Where have you been at this hour?

00:45:24.201 --> 00:45:27.871
I met someone I know
to ask for something important.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:31.667
You must be tired.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.711
You should get some sleep soon
before the trip tomorrow.

00:45:36.505 --> 00:45:37.714
Eun-jo…

00:45:40.968 --> 00:45:42.261
you held on well.

00:45:45.013 --> 00:45:46.056
It's nothing.

00:46:12.416 --> 00:46:13.625
I missed it.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.798
The animals must have sensed
your procession and run away.

00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:21.758
Let's go back to the palace--

00:46:21.842 --> 00:46:24.928
Don't even utter a word about the palace
until I hunt a tiger.

00:46:25.012 --> 00:46:27.139
- Keep chasing it!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:46:29.266 --> 00:46:31.560
Father, I'm so exhausted.

00:46:31.643 --> 00:46:35.314
We still have a long way to go to Namwon.

00:46:35.397 --> 00:46:36.481
Father,

00:46:36.565 --> 00:46:38.400
do I really have to go?

00:46:38.483 --> 00:46:40.068
Stop complaining and follow me.

00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:48.201
Eun-jo!

00:46:48.577 --> 00:46:49.786
Coming!

00:46:53.081 --> 00:46:54.333
Lady Hae-rim?

00:46:54.416 --> 00:46:55.459
To the dispensary?

00:46:59.713 --> 00:47:01.173
Where is Hong-si?

00:47:02.049 --> 00:47:04.217
She's been on sick leave for a while now.

00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:08.221
How would I know about
some sick court lady?

00:47:08.805 --> 00:47:09.890
I'm sure you do.

00:47:10.515 --> 00:47:14.728
Because that court lady is the woman
you said you would never forget.

00:47:18.106 --> 00:47:20.025
Is she from a noble family?

00:47:20.108 --> 00:47:21.443
Is her family respectable?

00:47:22.235 --> 00:47:23.320
Are they well-off?

00:47:24.112 --> 00:47:26.823
Where she is
isn't your main concern, is it?

00:47:27.699 --> 00:47:30.786
If the answer to any of that is no,
I don't care where she is.

00:47:34.081 --> 00:47:36.208
She already rejected me long ago.

00:47:37.209 --> 00:47:39.127
What? Rejected?

00:47:39.211 --> 00:47:40.796
What could possibly the reason?

00:47:40.879 --> 00:47:42.506
Who would reject a face like yours?

00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:45.050
Who dares reject my son?

00:47:46.385 --> 00:47:48.387
Where is she? Lead the way.

00:47:49.179 --> 00:47:51.431
Now you want to know where she is?

00:47:58.772 --> 00:48:01.441
Are you thinking of leaving Joseon

00:48:02.234 --> 00:48:03.485
because of Hong-si?

00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:10.992
Does Hong-si know?

00:48:12.869 --> 00:48:14.371
I will just disappear.

00:48:14.454 --> 00:48:16.331
Why would you do that?

00:48:18.667 --> 00:48:20.502
If I say goodbye to her,

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.256
I will want to stay with her.

00:48:25.132 --> 00:48:26.466
And if that happens,

00:48:26.967 --> 00:48:28.385
I know I can't stop myself.

00:48:29.052 --> 00:48:30.345
I will cling to her

00:48:30.887 --> 00:48:32.556
and make a nuisance of myself.

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:37.018
Then she will have to reject me
once again.

00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:40.147
I can't make her say something
so painful for her.

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:45.861
If that's your decision,

00:48:46.862 --> 00:48:48.780
you shall leave as soon as possible.

00:48:50.031 --> 00:48:51.533
I've already packed my bag.

00:48:51.616 --> 00:48:53.744
I'm leaving today.

00:48:54.745 --> 00:48:56.580
You and His Highness?

00:48:59.166 --> 00:49:01.918
All those coincidences
were set up by the elders.

00:49:04.463 --> 00:49:08.508
Because that's the kind of marriage
the elders want.

00:49:09.468 --> 00:49:12.429
But His Highness does not want it.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.223
That's why he said he was leaving.

00:49:16.183 --> 00:49:17.267
Leave?

00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:18.852
Where?

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:21.563
That, I don't know.

00:49:24.858 --> 00:49:26.401
I've been only talking about myself.

00:49:27.068 --> 00:49:28.695
Tell me about you, Physician Hong.

00:49:29.237 --> 00:49:31.281
Why was your marriage broken off?

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.285
Well…

00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:37.996
My lord--

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.247
Eun-jo!

00:49:44.336 --> 00:49:45.378
Is that…

00:49:46.213 --> 00:49:48.423
This is Gil-dong's arrow?

00:49:48.507 --> 00:49:50.634
Maybe someone's pretending to be him.

00:49:50.717 --> 00:49:54.095
Grand Prince Dowol destroyed
all the evidence linked to Gil-dong.

00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:57.682
I'm sure.

00:49:57.766 --> 00:49:58.975
Young Master!

00:49:59.768 --> 00:50:01.061
Young Master!

00:50:05.065 --> 00:50:08.610
The lord sent an urgent letter
from the Royal Villa.

00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:22.374
Hong Eun-jo.

00:50:25.126 --> 00:50:26.253
Eun-jo.

00:50:27.128 --> 00:50:28.880
Do you know him?

00:50:31.633 --> 00:50:34.135
I think he's my Young Master.

00:50:35.136 --> 00:50:36.137
Eun-jo!

00:50:37.305 --> 00:50:38.557
Eun-jo!

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:41.768
Eun-jo!

00:50:46.898 --> 00:50:47.899
Eun-jo.

00:50:49.192 --> 00:50:50.443
Eun-jo.

00:50:52.112 --> 00:50:53.780
I brought Father with me.

00:50:56.074 --> 00:50:57.242
Eun-jo.

00:50:57.325 --> 00:50:58.702
You're a physician, right?

00:50:59.494 --> 00:51:00.829
Have a look at him.

00:51:00.912 --> 00:51:03.290
I don't know why,

00:51:03.373 --> 00:51:05.458
but he hasn't said a word the whole way.

00:51:07.294 --> 00:51:09.337
I must've done something wrong.

00:51:10.088 --> 00:51:11.089
Eun-jo.

00:51:24.769 --> 00:51:25.604
Eun-jo.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.739
My lord.

00:53:09.165 --> 00:53:10.166
Who?

00:53:10.834 --> 00:53:12.002
Lord Hong Min-jik--

00:53:12.085 --> 00:53:13.712
No, the other one.

00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:17.507
His Majesty.

00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:23.972
So you're saying

00:53:25.932 --> 00:53:27.183
my brother…

00:53:29.811 --> 00:53:30.895
His Majesty

00:53:32.647 --> 00:53:33.815
has hunted

00:53:35.025 --> 00:53:36.067
Lord Hong.

00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:03.428
You seem tired.

00:54:06.139 --> 00:54:07.432
Rest well.

00:54:09.726 --> 00:54:11.853
And don't worry about a thing.

00:54:32.332 --> 00:54:34.250
There will be no pain…

00:54:40.131 --> 00:54:43.593
where you are now.

00:54:55.814 --> 00:54:58.233
Father, you should wake up now.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.655
We should keep going.

00:55:07.575 --> 00:55:11.037
We have a long way to go.

00:55:14.332 --> 00:55:17.669
Father, please wake up.

00:55:50.493 --> 00:55:51.494
Where are you going?

00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:54.414
We must prepare a funeral.

00:56:00.503 --> 00:56:01.546
Just cry.

00:56:04.674 --> 00:56:07.635
I must find an embalmer and get a coffin.

00:56:08.469 --> 00:56:09.846
There's so much to be done.

00:56:13.766 --> 00:56:15.935
The Chief Secretary sent us a letter.

00:56:16.019 --> 00:56:18.396
He said to make
all the preparations for the funeral.

00:56:19.522 --> 00:56:21.691
It's my lord's funeral.

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.652
This is something I have to do myself.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:28.489
Help my Young Master instead.

00:56:29.616 --> 00:56:30.867
He can be pretty clumsy.

00:57:12.408 --> 00:57:14.244
Father!

00:58:00.373 --> 00:58:02.375
Can you move any faster?

00:58:02.458 --> 00:58:04.836
His Majesty wishes to return
to his chambers at once.

00:58:04.919 --> 00:58:06.462
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:58:09.507 --> 00:58:10.800
Yes, Young Master.

00:58:15.263 --> 00:58:16.848
My brother allowed

00:58:16.931 --> 00:58:19.392
my family and our slaves
to come and help as well.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.229
By the way, I haven't seen Eun-jo around.

00:58:27.317 --> 00:58:28.818
Has she not come back yet?

00:58:42.248 --> 00:58:43.541
Eun-jo…

00:58:45.251 --> 00:58:46.628
you held on well.

01:00:33.776 --> 01:00:34.819
{\an8}If what I think happens,

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:38.281
{\an8}not only Eun-jo,
but her entire family will be executed.

01:00:38.364 --> 01:00:40.783
{\an8}We must not let that happen. Never.

01:00:40.867 --> 01:00:42.910
{\an8}Hong Eun-jo! Snap out of it!

01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:44.579
{\an8}If you want to die, die alone.

01:00:44.662 --> 01:00:46.581
{\an8}He jumped in to stop it.

01:00:46.664 --> 01:00:48.791
{\an8}Return!

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:50.668
{\an8}Return!

01:00:50.752 --> 01:00:53.546
{\an8}Pay your respects with utmost sincerity.

01:00:53.629 --> 01:00:54.464
{\an8}Move out!

01:00:54.547 --> 01:00:58.009
{\an8}For now, Lord Hong's family
are the prime suspects.

01:00:58.092 --> 01:00:59.802
{\an8}Find evidence of the murder!

01:00:59.886 --> 01:01:01.137
{\an8}It was me.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.139
{\an8}How long have I been here?

01:01:03.222 --> 01:01:04.348
{\an8}I must see him.

01:01:04.432 --> 01:01:06.434
