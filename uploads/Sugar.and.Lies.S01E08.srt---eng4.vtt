=We Can't Go Back=

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.140
You're acting so natural now.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080
You've changed.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.240
Then what was I like back then?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.520
Who was the one hanging around

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.540
that Tong Sui shop for half a month

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.560
just to sneak a peek at me?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.720
I just liked their Tong Sui

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.200
and saw you, you know, by chance.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.280
And who was the one

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.400
who waited outside my place for hours

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.840
just to celebrate with me

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.440
after my Gaokao

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.680
and almost got mistaken for a thief?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.760
How is that my fault?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.280
That person just had bad eyesight.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.640
Alright.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120
Then...

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.120
who was the one

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.740
who'd rather wear that awful clothes

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.920
and take that job just to work with me?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.800
Hey, don't tell me

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.000
you're bringing up old stuff here

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.720
just to stop me from sleeping in your bed.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.240
You weren't this chubby before.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.500
You think I look bad now?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.480
No, I don't.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
You've never been pretty.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.920
Hey...

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.160
Kiss me.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.880
Time to sleep.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.880
Wai,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.780
what's that supposed to mean?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.480
What do you mean?

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680
What's the point of doing all this?

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800
After that,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.440
I might be leaving Mancheng.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.640
Maybe,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.440
I'll never come back again.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.560
Can you really let it go?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.190
If I can't,
what difference does it make?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.840
You're about to get engaged.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.480
Go to sleep.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.800
What I'm saying is,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.120
can you really let go

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.440
of your career and leave here?

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.360
Chen Aming.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.240
Can you tell me just one truth?

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.160
Just one.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.880
Why did you really come back?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.720
My name is...

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.090
Don't call me Chen Aming.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.000
My name is Yu Kun.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.400
Yu Kun.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.960
Yu Kun, Yu Kun.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.800
When will you finally

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.880
face the real you?

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.920
Then when will you

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.280
stop turning cold out of nowhere?

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.280
All these years, I've never changed.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.600
The one who's changed is you.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.160
A coward
who even abandoned his real name.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.760
(What I left behind wasn't my name.)

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.560
(It was my regret, my pain,)

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.400
(and...)

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560
(my weakness.)

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.680
Same as always, please.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.240
I forgot to bring cash again.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.960
Can you put it on Zhou Haoran's tab?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.680
Putting it on hiss tab means
putting it on my sister's.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.040
Putting it on my sister's means
it's on me.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.640
Total sister protector.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.020
Don't feel like owing me?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.440
You can work it off.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.760
Give it a shot, it's stress-relieving.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.200
Have you made up your mind?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.200
Yeah.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.640
But let me make one thing clear first.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.880
You're free to go.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.680
Are you staying to help me turn this around,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520
or are you leaving?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.380
The door's right there.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.240
If we go through with this,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.440
the risk is huge.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.560
Anything we do comes with risk.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.920
If we don't try, how will we know?

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.520
I'm with Boss on this.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.040
Ding Daang.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.400
Ding Daang.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.220
Ding Daang.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.200
Stop following me.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.520
We finally met again.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.960
Do you really want to waste

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.820
the last of our time
on wandering like this?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.120
Waste?

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.320
Are you saying every second with me

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.360
is just a waste?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.390
Who gave you the right to decide for me?

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.920
But Miaomiao needs to go to school.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.920
What's wrong with me paying her tuition?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.120
This is my family matter.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.520
Not your concern.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.200
But I…

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.920
Aren't we in the same boat?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.840
Ding Daang.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.000
I owe you too much.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.200
I'm sorry.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.600
Aming…

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.540
There's no need
for apologies between us.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.160
And didn't we agree

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.040
we'd face everything together?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.640
I've made up my mind.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.360
I'm going abroad with Professor Luo.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.160
What did you just say?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.760
Aming…

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.760
You're mad at me, aren't you?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.200
My dad's health isn't good.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.080
Didn't you say…

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.680
you'd go back
and help him after graduation?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.680
It's alright.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.340
You could stay for two years.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.360
After that, I'll go abroad

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.400
and we'll do what you love.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.240
Ding Daang.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.840
I don't want to waste time.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.920
Sorry.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.920
Not your concern.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It's not even a week yet.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.560
So,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.540
it's not for you to decide.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.040
Put me down.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.480
Will you be good?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.720
No.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.080
Let go of me.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.360
The last wild fling before marriage.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.800
That kind of thrill is just human nature.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.540
Or is it a sign
of disrespect for marriage?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.800
I mean,

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.520
did you bring Gu Ruomai as a streamer

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.040
just to get close to me?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.000
Ding Daang.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.840
Where have you been?

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.920
I want to have a talk with you.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.360
Ding Daang.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.600
Your fiancé...

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.480
He's kind of interesting.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.680
Cold and heartless, I see.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.960
Have you already forgotten

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.720
Chen

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.960
Miao

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.920
