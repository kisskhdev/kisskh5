WEBVTT

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.413
Your son shoplifted from my store.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.849
We shouldn't let him manipulate us
any further.

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:12.951
What is he demanding?

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:15.720
The victim is Hideyuki Sakuma,
40 years old.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:18.389
The manager of Smile Sakuma
in Mitsuba Minami.

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:20.158
The bullet extracted from the body

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:23.761
was fired from the gun that belonged
to Keisuke's father.

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.732
This will be a secret
between just the four of us.

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:30.335
One of us here opened the time capsule

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:31.569
and took out that gun.

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:35.039
I didn't get home until around 11:00 p.m.

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.307
I opened the time capsule,

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:38.443
- but there was no gun inside.
- Are you serious?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.512
The time capsule was opened two times.

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:42.313
If you’re telling the truth,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.015
it would have to be either Makiko
or Naoto.

00:00:44.082 --> 00:00:46.417
It'll be all right, Maki.

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:51.823
Nice to meet you. I'm Hiromi.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.991
Are you going to marry her?

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:57.795
But it is true
that there is some connection

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:01.933
between this incident
and the incident from 23 years ago.

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:04.903
Please accompany me to the police station…

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.006
- Mr. Naoto Sakuma.
- What?

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:11.809
You were captured on the security camera.

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:15.547
{\an8}It was possible for you to be
at the scene of the murder.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.655
Keisuke!

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:26.758
Keisuke!

00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.061
Keisuke!

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:43.841
Nagai,

00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:45.476
- what's going on?
- Mr. Tobina.

00:01:46.477 --> 00:01:48.079
What are you doing, Ms. Nara?

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:50.915
His alibi has fallen apart.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.586
Mr. Naoto Sakuma will voluntarily
accompany us to the station.

00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:00.592
I…

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:02.594
will go too.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.562
Detective Tobina, you’re off duty today.

00:02:06.965 --> 00:02:08.833
What brings you here?

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.636
Getting together with your

00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:14.038
- classmates to discuss something?
- I'm off duty,

00:02:14.706 --> 00:02:16.241
- so I came to hang out.
- I see.

00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:17.275
I'll be off then.

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.445
Let's go.

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:30.955
Naoto.

00:02:58.016 --> 00:03:00.118
Masaki. I'm coming in.

00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:11.262
Were they police officers?

00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:13.865
Yeah.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:17.535
They took Mr. Naoto with them?

00:03:18.403 --> 00:03:20.705
They just want to talk to him

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.975
about his older brother, that’s all.

00:03:26.678 --> 00:03:28.780
How did they know that Naoto was here?

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.615
Does that mean that he was being watched?

00:03:30.682 --> 00:03:33.918
- It would seem so.
- You didn’t know about this, Junichi?

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:36.454
I don’t think I was told
because I’m close with Naoto.

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.960
But did Naoto really do it?

00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:46.030
If that's the case,
when did he dig up the time capsule?

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:52.170
I opened the time capsule
around 9:00 p.m. on Friday night.

00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:55.773
The gun wasn't there at that time,
so it must have been removed before then.

00:03:59.043 --> 00:04:00.611
Do you think Naoto really did it?

00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:04.282
If he didn't do it,

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.051
why would he bother
to provide a false alibi?

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.057
Maybe it's because of a woman?

00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:14.392
Huh?

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.528
Maybe he’s secretly
dating someone complicated

00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:20.465
and wanted to hide the fact
that they were together.

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.699
That’s probably not it.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.702
Because he's always loved Makiko.

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:29.307
I think he has always
had feelings for Makiko.

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:33.111
Why didn't you talk back to them?

00:04:33.778 --> 00:04:35.413
It's so ridiculous.

00:04:36.114 --> 00:04:37.615
You're not going to do anything?

00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:40.451
- Come on, Naoto.
- What happened?

00:04:41.652 --> 00:04:44.622
Yanagihara and his friends
hid Naoto's shoes.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.493
They're in sixth grade,
and still doing things like that?

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:49.894
They're so immature.

00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:52.897
Let’s all go home in our indoor shoes.

00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:54.298
What?

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:56.334
What are you saying?

00:04:57.034 --> 00:04:59.504
Junichi, Keisuke, go get his shoes back.

00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:01.305
No, it’s all right.

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:03.741
You guys can get them back, right?

00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:08.246
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:08.312 --> 00:05:09.814
- Fine, we'll go.
- This way.

00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:10.715
- Hurry.
- Yeah.

00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:11.816
All right.

00:05:12.383 --> 00:05:13.851
Get it back!

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:14.819
Which way?

00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:16.120
Turn right.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.525
Hey.

00:05:22.493 --> 00:05:24.562
- What is it?
- Never mind.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.497
Stop that. What is it?

00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:29.333
Whatever it is you know, just tell me.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.641
When Hideyuki Sakuma contacted Makiko
about Masaki's shoplifting incident,

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:39.477
she tried to contact Naoto
to ask for advice

00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:41.145
and sent him messages and left voicemails.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.117
Naoto forgot his smartphone in Japan
while on a business trip overseas,

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:48.519
and he must have found out

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.822
about the shoplifting after he came back.

00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:55.927
So you think he went
to his brother's place to discuss that?

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.035
- This way.
- I'm sorry,

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:05.703
but I need to talk to you about something.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.604
MAKIKO IWAMOTO

00:06:07.438 --> 00:06:10.274
Masaki shoplifted
from your older brother's supermarket.

00:06:12.276 --> 00:06:15.246
Maki, I'm sorry for not getting back
to your messages and calls.

00:06:16.013 --> 00:06:18.449
I forgot my smartphone
and went on a business trip.

00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:22.086
Sorry to bother you when you’re busy.

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:24.755
No, I'm sorry too,

00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:29.393
about my brother causing you trouble.

00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:31.329
What happened?

00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:36.000
We gave him the money yesterday.

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:38.035
What? How much?

00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:40.037
300,000 yen.

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:44.642
I'm really sorry.

00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:49.080
I'll talk to my brother.

00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.716
Okay.

00:06:51.782 --> 00:06:53.084
Thank you.

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.454
Naoto…

00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:00.224
It'll be all right.

00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:02.693
Okay.

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:12.370
If Naoto had used that gun,

00:07:12.436 --> 00:07:14.805
he'd be asked where he got it from, right?

00:07:15.907 --> 00:07:17.208
Knowing him…

00:07:17.942 --> 00:07:22.713
Yeah, he probably won’t talk about the gun
or the time capsule.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:27.351
Even so, Ms. Nara might still uncover
the truth anyway.

00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:33.090
Junichi,

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:35.660
will you be all right?

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:36.761
What do you mean?

00:07:38.162 --> 00:07:39.297
You’re a detective,

00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:42.233
but you didn't tell the police
that we buried that gun,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.402
and you leaked information to us.

00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:46.871
This is no time to be laughing.

00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:50.341
If that gets discovered, won't you lose
your badge or even face a penalty?

00:07:53.177 --> 00:07:54.712
Don’t worry about me.

00:07:56.447 --> 00:07:58.215
Either way, there's no turning back now.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.754
I'm going to the station now.

00:08:04.622 --> 00:08:05.556
I’ll

00:08:06.824 --> 00:08:08.025
stay by Makiko’s side.

00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:11.495
Is your wife okay?

00:08:11.562 --> 00:08:13.364
She knows I’m staying in Mitsuba tonight.

00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:18.703
Junichi is going to the station.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:24.709
Bye.

00:08:34.852 --> 00:08:36.787
Are you okay? You should rest.

00:08:38.055 --> 00:08:38.990
Yeah.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.563
Are you blaming yourself for telling Naoto
about the shoplifting?

00:08:58.909 --> 00:08:59.910
Naoto.

00:09:09.286 --> 00:09:10.621
He’s maintaining his silence?

00:09:10.688 --> 00:09:13.224
He’s here voluntarily,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.794
so if he continues to remain silent,
we’ll have to let him go soon.

00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:32.243
Mr. Sakuma,

00:09:33.577 --> 00:09:34.645
are you hungry?

00:09:37.448 --> 00:09:39.884
Would you like to eat
a late-night snack with me?

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:43.821
Yes,

00:09:43.888 --> 00:09:47.024
I'm asking if you want to eat
because I’m the one who’s hungry.

00:09:50.828 --> 00:09:52.463
Or would you like to leave?

00:09:53.597 --> 00:09:55.700
Because you can leave too.

00:10:00.004 --> 00:10:02.506
As for the late-night snack,
we have instant ramen.

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:05.543
The available flavors are miso,

00:10:06.243 --> 00:10:09.814
soy sauce, salt, and curry.

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:13.617
I listed them in my order of preference.

00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:17.755
Should I repeat it?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.491
Miso,

00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:22.359
soy sauce,

00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:24.395
salt…

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:26.330
I did it.

00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:33.604
I killed my older brother.

00:10:39.243 --> 00:10:40.544
Hello.

00:10:40.611 --> 00:10:42.980
That’s a long game of mahjong.

00:10:43.914 --> 00:10:45.149
Sorry for not contacting you.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.252
- I’m at the station.
- Oh, I'm glad.

00:10:48.753 --> 00:10:50.454
Why are you glad?

00:10:51.989 --> 00:10:53.390
I’m just glad

00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:56.560
you’re not dead on the streets somewhere.

00:10:58.062 --> 00:10:59.196
Why would I be dead?

00:10:59.897 --> 00:11:04.101
But someone who’s healthy
can suddenly collapse, you know.

00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:05.402
I guess so.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.606
I wonder if you think that way
because you’re a nurse.

00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:11.709
More like,

00:11:12.443 --> 00:11:14.712
because you’re a detective,

00:11:15.212 --> 00:11:18.182
who knows when or what kind
of trouble you might get involved in.

00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:21.786
I’ll always call if I can't make it home.

00:11:22.753 --> 00:11:25.156
Yeah. To confirm you’re alive.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.391
Yeah.

00:11:28.592 --> 00:11:31.495
- Work hard.
- Yeah. Bye.

00:11:34.398 --> 00:11:35.699
Detective Tobina.

00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:39.403
Mr. Naoto Sakuma
just confessed to the crime.

00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:43.641
He'll be staying here tonight,
and we'll question him in the morning.

00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:45.309
But since you were his classmate,

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:47.411
you will not be allowed to join
the questioning.

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:45.369
You can’t sleep?

00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:48.372
You scared me.

00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:52.877
Of course you can't fall asleep, huh?

00:12:53.677 --> 00:12:56.647
After all, your former classmate
just confessed to murder.

00:12:59.717 --> 00:13:03.053
When and where did he obtain the gun

00:13:03.587 --> 00:13:06.190
used to shoot Hideyuki Sakuma,

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.860
and where was he keeping it?

00:13:10.794 --> 00:13:17.334
There’s no way he took the gun
when he discovered the body

00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:20.004
of Officer Kiyohara

00:13:20.738 --> 00:13:23.073
23 years ago, right?

00:13:24.008 --> 00:13:27.645
Because if that were the case,
you would have known.

00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:31.982
Are you listening?

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:36.186
Yes.

00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:37.788
Um…

00:13:37.855 --> 00:13:40.124
isn’t it awkward to talk
with your eye mask on?

00:13:40.858 --> 00:13:44.395
I don’t have much of a beauty regime.

00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:46.497
Beauty what?

00:13:46.563 --> 00:13:48.032
I said,

00:13:48.532 --> 00:13:51.101
- a beauty regime.
- Yes, I see.

00:13:51.168 --> 00:13:54.939
However, there's one thing I always do.

00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:56.974
At night,

00:13:57.474 --> 00:14:00.544
I always remove my makeup
before going to bed.

00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:01.979
Therefore, the eye mask.

00:14:02.479 --> 00:14:04.448
You're wearing it
because you have no makeup on?

00:14:05.082 --> 00:14:05.950
Good night.

00:14:14.558 --> 00:14:15.526
Huh?

00:14:18.562 --> 00:14:19.730
Is she serious?

00:14:20.998 --> 00:14:22.833
Oh man, she woke me up.

00:14:24.134 --> 00:14:25.336
Oh jeez.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.472
I probably can’t go back to sleep anymore.

00:14:30.374 --> 00:14:32.142
That's insane.

00:14:32.209 --> 00:14:35.846
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

00:14:47.157 --> 00:14:48.826
{\an8}On Saturday, the day of the incident,

00:14:48.892 --> 00:14:52.262
{\an8}we have confirmed
that you arrived at Haneda Airport

00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:53.764
at 8:55 p.m.

00:14:53.831 --> 00:14:55.265
NAOTO SAKUMA

00:14:55.332 --> 00:14:57.134
What did you do after that?

00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:00.704
I stopped by my brother's office
at the supermarket.

00:15:02.272 --> 00:15:03.374
Why did you go there?

00:15:03.941 --> 00:15:05.843
My brother was a manager in name only,

00:15:06.343 --> 00:15:09.313
and he had a bad reputation among
the employees, so it worried me a lot.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.049
So I was anxious about whether my brother

00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:14.985
actually did his job
while I was away on a business trip.

00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:16.186
Then?

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:20.858
He asked me to lend him money.

00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:22.159
What did you think about that?

00:15:22.993 --> 00:15:24.294
I thought, "Again?"

00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:26.230
"Enough of this already."

00:15:26.296 --> 00:15:29.767
How many times have you lent money
to your older brother?

00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:31.435
It happened so many times

00:15:32.036 --> 00:15:33.504
I can't remember the exact number.

00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:36.640
Did you give him money this time too?

00:15:36.707 --> 00:15:38.575
When I took money out of my wallet,

00:15:38.642 --> 00:15:41.178
he said it wasn't enough and told me
to go back home to get more.

00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:43.180
How much did he say he wanted?

00:15:43.981 --> 00:15:45.282
One million.

00:15:45.916 --> 00:15:48.318
He said he had to make payment
for his debts.

00:15:48.886 --> 00:15:49.686
Then what happened?

00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:54.658
I was initially going to do as he said,

00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:56.126
so I got in my car.

00:15:57.528 --> 00:15:59.163
But then I changed my mind.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.566
I was tired from my business trip,

00:16:03.634 --> 00:16:05.169
so I went back to the office instead.

00:16:07.704 --> 00:16:09.106
My brother got angry

00:16:10.074 --> 00:16:11.775
and started throwing things at me.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.912
That led to an argument,

00:16:16.013 --> 00:16:17.614
and my brother took a gun

00:16:18.482 --> 00:16:19.983
from underneath the couch.

00:16:21.452 --> 00:16:25.155
Your brother took out a gun
from underneath the couch?

00:16:25.222 --> 00:16:26.190
Yes.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.492
Weren't you scared?

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:31.261
I was pretty sure my brother
wouldn't actually pull the trigger.

00:16:31.762 --> 00:16:33.297
I figured it was just a threat.

00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:35.566
Then?

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:38.769
I grabbed the muzzle of the gun

00:16:40.871 --> 00:16:43.674
and we started fighting.

00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:46.343
A fight…

00:16:48.278 --> 00:16:50.080
A struggle over the gun broke out

00:16:51.014 --> 00:16:52.950
near the office entrance.

00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:59.123
My brother wasn't as strong as I expected.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.527
Perhaps it was because he was drunk.

00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:05.529
And then…

00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:10.501
There was a loud bang,

00:17:12.236 --> 00:17:15.706
and blood started coming out
of my brother's abdomen.

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:18.842
Where was the gun?

00:17:19.676 --> 00:17:20.611
In my hand.

00:17:25.883 --> 00:17:27.584
You pulled the trigger?

00:17:30.454 --> 00:17:33.123
I don't remember clearly
what happened at that moment,

00:17:35.592 --> 00:17:36.927
but yes, I think I did.

00:17:38.028 --> 00:17:42.966
Didn't you think
to call the police or an ambulance?

00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:48.939
I honestly don't remember much,

00:17:50.307 --> 00:17:52.576
but I think I was unable to move
for a while.

00:17:57.548 --> 00:17:59.750
By the time I realized,
there was a pool of blood,

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:03.787
and I knew he was dead.

00:18:04.588 --> 00:18:05.622
Then what did you do?

00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:07.824
I ran away.

00:18:08.992 --> 00:18:09.960
What about the gun?

00:18:11.695 --> 00:18:12.796
I took it with me.

00:18:18.769 --> 00:18:20.470
Did you already know

00:18:20.537 --> 00:18:23.840
from before the incident
that your brother owned a gun?

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.911
Yes, but more like,

00:18:27.978 --> 00:18:30.847
I thought it was fake.
I didn’t think it was a real gun.

00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:33.784
Can you explain that in detail?

00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:38.021
I think it was when
I was in middle school.

00:18:39.122 --> 00:18:42.993
I went into my brother's room
without permission and saw a gun.

00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:46.897
I thought it was a toy gun
and tried to touch it,

00:18:47.698 --> 00:18:49.733
but I got caught by my brother
who had just come home,

00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:52.302
and he got very angry with me.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.606
Did you tell anyone about the gun?

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.008
No.

00:18:58.942 --> 00:19:01.778
My brother was bragging,
saying it was the real thing,

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:03.680
but I thought he was lying.

00:19:05.849 --> 00:19:09.119
Did he say where he found the gun?

00:19:12.189 --> 00:19:14.291
He said he found it

00:19:14.925 --> 00:19:15.759
in the forest.

00:19:19.129 --> 00:19:20.631
Is this the same forest

00:19:21.298 --> 00:19:24.034
where you and your classmates
were the first to discover

00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:26.970
the body of Officer Kazuo Kiyohara?

00:19:28.639 --> 00:19:30.474
I think so,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.010
but I don't know the details.
I only heard that it was a forest.

00:19:37.914 --> 00:19:38.815
So then,

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.052
where is that gun

00:19:42.853 --> 00:19:44.187
right now?

00:19:48.825 --> 00:19:52.629
{\an8}Where is that gun right now?

00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:57.200
I threw it away. In the river.

00:19:59.136 --> 00:20:02.439
He stated that he threw away the gun
in this area.

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:04.207
Recovering the gun is top priority.

00:20:04.274 --> 00:20:07.177
Increase the search personnel
and conduct a thorough search,

00:20:07.244 --> 00:20:10.647
intensify the search for any witnesses,
and make sure you find it.

00:20:11.148 --> 00:20:12.316
Yes, sir!

00:20:14.284 --> 00:20:17.054
You left your brother's office

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.623
and stopped at a gas station
to put in gas on your way home.

00:20:20.457 --> 00:20:22.059
Is that correct?

00:20:22.793 --> 00:20:24.895
My memory is a little hazy,

00:20:26.129 --> 00:20:28.632
but by the time I realized,
I was driving on the highway

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.135
and saw that the gas lamp was on.

00:20:32.636 --> 00:20:35.072
I stopped at the first gas station I saw.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.377
Now let's fast forward
to the day after the incident.

00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:45.048
You stated that you had received
a threatening letter.

00:20:45.115 --> 00:20:47.317
It said that if we proceed
with the construction

00:20:47.384 --> 00:20:52.689
of the building complex
that our company is planning,

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:55.392
divine punishment will befall us.

00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:57.327
Was that true?

00:20:57.994 --> 00:21:00.430
No, that was a lie.

00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:04.935
I wanted to divert suspicion away
from myself, even just a little,

00:21:05.435 --> 00:21:07.237
so I made up that story.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.951
Maki.

00:21:21.651 --> 00:21:22.586
Mrs. Sakuma.

00:21:23.687 --> 00:21:24.755
Naoto…

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.357
Naoto…

00:21:27.424 --> 00:21:29.426
got arrested.

00:21:51.548 --> 00:21:53.016
- Nagai.
- Yes?

00:21:54.951 --> 00:21:57.788
Just give me one moment alone
with Naoto Sakuma.

00:21:58.288 --> 00:22:00.123
- What?
- I won’t cause trouble for you.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:02.692
I can't do that.

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:04.828
- What are you going to do?
- I just want to talk to him.

00:22:05.595 --> 00:22:07.664
- I can’t.
- There are things that only I can ask him.

00:22:07.731 --> 00:22:09.032
This is not a good idea.

00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:11.535
Please. Just give me one minute.

00:22:14.104 --> 00:22:14.971
Please.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.310
- If it's 30 seconds…
- Okay.

00:22:20.377 --> 00:22:22.813
- Are you serious?
- It's a deal.

00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:28.018
I threw the gun away right here.

00:22:28.084 --> 00:22:29.519
Which way?

00:22:29.586 --> 00:22:32.389
This is no joke.

00:22:32.456 --> 00:22:33.957
Will we be able to find it?

00:22:38.962 --> 00:22:40.931
Ready.

00:22:42.632 --> 00:22:43.700
Thank you.

00:22:54.811 --> 00:22:55.779
Naoto.

00:22:58.882 --> 00:23:00.217
Did you really do it?

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:03.353
Yeah.

00:23:05.088 --> 00:23:07.324
- Let me ask just one thing.
- It's okay,

00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:10.694
I said that my brother
found the gun in the forest.

00:23:13.063 --> 00:23:15.465
I haven’t mentioned the time capsule,

00:23:15.999 --> 00:23:17.667
and I’ll never mention it in the future.

00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:20.203
The gun will most likely

00:23:20.871 --> 00:23:23.673
- never appear ever again.
- What I want to know is,

00:23:24.674 --> 00:23:27.777
when exactly did you take the gun
out of the time capsule?

00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:34.217
Thirty-seven, thirty-eight,

00:23:34.818 --> 00:23:36.620
thirty-nine, forty.

00:23:36.686 --> 00:23:38.121
I gave ten bonus seconds.

00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:52.135
Ms. Iwamoto.

00:23:57.974 --> 00:23:59.409
What brings you here today?

00:24:00.076 --> 00:24:04.047
Mr. Naoto Sakuma’s mother asked me
to drop off his change of clothes.

00:24:04.114 --> 00:24:05.615
I see.

00:24:07.117 --> 00:24:10.620
I'm sure you're worried
about Mr. Naoto Sakuma.

00:24:11.688 --> 00:24:12.522
Yes.

00:24:13.023 --> 00:24:15.892
As you know, I can't talk about the status
of the investigation.

00:24:17.894 --> 00:24:18.728
Yes.

00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:20.263
Oh?

00:24:20.997 --> 00:24:22.933
Surely, Detective Tobina hasn't been

00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:26.770
leaking details of the investigation
to his former classmates, right?

00:24:27.837 --> 00:24:28.772
Of course not.

00:24:28.838 --> 00:24:31.241
Please don't take it so seriously.
I'm just kidding.

00:24:33.677 --> 00:24:34.911
May I see Naoto?

00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:36.780
Huh?

00:24:37.847 --> 00:24:38.882
I’m just kidding.

00:24:41.985 --> 00:24:43.353
I’m sorry.

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:47.524
Interesting.

00:24:49.492 --> 00:24:51.428
You can go inside to drop those off.

00:24:51.494 --> 00:24:52.562
Okay.

00:24:52.629 --> 00:24:55.498
MITSUBA POLICE STATION

00:25:27.597 --> 00:25:29.032
She got to see him after all.

00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:34.838
{\an8}It was brought in by a person
named Ms. Makiko Iwamoto.

00:25:35.805 --> 00:25:37.374
We'll have it processed later.

00:25:48.051 --> 00:25:49.319
Naoto!

00:25:52.689 --> 00:25:53.523
Maki!

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.560
Naoto, long time no see.

00:25:57.627 --> 00:25:58.762
It's been a while.

00:25:59.462 --> 00:26:02.666
- What? You quit kendo?
- Yeah.

00:26:02.732 --> 00:26:04.134
Why?

00:26:04.734 --> 00:26:07.771
I became friends with a girl who sat
next to me at the entrance ceremony,

00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:09.572
and she invited me
to join the basketball club.

00:26:10.073 --> 00:26:12.942
That's a shame
since you were so good at kendo.

00:26:13.009 --> 00:26:14.644
I’m good at basketball too.

00:26:14.711 --> 00:26:17.480
I'm the only second-year student
on the roster.

00:26:17.547 --> 00:26:18.782
I expect no less from you, Maki.

00:26:19.282 --> 00:26:21.951
You were always competing
with Junichi and Keisuke,

00:26:22.018 --> 00:26:24.354
so playing basketball against girls
must be a piece of cake.

00:26:25.388 --> 00:26:27.724
Hey, have you been in contact
with those two?

00:26:28.525 --> 00:26:29.693
No,

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:32.362
not at all ever since
we graduated elementary school.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.733
Both Junichi and Keisuke are heartless.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.237
Would it be okay

00:26:42.005 --> 00:26:45.875
if I went to cheer you on
at your next basketball game?

00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:48.945
I’ll be too embarrassed.

00:26:50.013 --> 00:26:52.015
I mean, I go to an all-girls school.

00:26:52.082 --> 00:26:55.018
If you came to cheer me on,
rumors would spread like wildfire.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.888
That's true.

00:26:59.856 --> 00:27:00.857
Oh, but I guess

00:27:00.924 --> 00:27:03.760
it would be less troublesome
if I just say that you’re my boyfriend.

00:27:05.595 --> 00:27:09.165
Hey, if it isn’t my younger brother.

00:27:12.268 --> 00:27:14.904
Hey, man, I just lost some money
playing pachinko.

00:27:20.343 --> 00:27:22.412
You only have 3,000 yen?

00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:23.847
Stop that.

00:27:23.913 --> 00:27:26.516
Give that back. It’s Naoto’s.

00:27:27.884 --> 00:27:29.552
Wait, are you Iwamoto?

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.923
You’ve gotten even more bratty
since I last saw you.

00:27:39.362 --> 00:27:40.697
How dare you!

00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:06.489
Naoto.

00:28:08.057 --> 00:28:09.292
Maki.

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:12.162
I didn’t expect to see you here.

00:28:12.228 --> 00:28:13.830
I'm doing some shopping.

00:28:13.897 --> 00:28:15.732
I thought I'd walk around here
for a change.

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:16.666
What about you, Maki?

00:28:16.733 --> 00:28:19.068
I was shopping too.
I needed light bulbs for the shop.

00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:20.069
I see.

00:28:22.405 --> 00:28:25.241
- You seem to be doing well.
- Yeah. You too.

00:28:25.975 --> 00:28:28.244
What grade is Masaki in now?

00:28:28.311 --> 00:28:32.148
He's in third grade now.
He's such a handful.

00:28:32.649 --> 00:28:35.251
Hearing that you have a child
in third grade,

00:28:35.318 --> 00:28:37.787
makes me realize how old I've gotten.

00:28:38.288 --> 00:28:40.256
Why don't you get married too, Naoto?

00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:44.327
Although it must be strange coming from me
who got divorced.

00:28:45.028 --> 00:28:48.498
- Isn't there a nice girl in your life?
- There's no one like that.

00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:51.868
- Really?
- I definitely don't have anyone.

00:28:52.635 --> 00:28:55.004
You don’t have to get
so worked up about it.

00:28:55.071 --> 00:28:57.006
You're right.

00:28:57.774 --> 00:28:58.975
Hey.

00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:02.145
Naoto, isn't your hair
getting a little long?

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.417
I guess I haven't gotten it cut
in a while.

00:29:09.619 --> 00:29:11.354
Have you been that busy?

00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:15.225
I've been entrusted
with more responsibilities,

00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:18.228
and I became
the managing director this year.

00:29:18.294 --> 00:29:21.231
Wow! That's amazing!

00:29:23.466 --> 00:29:26.302
Do you have time to spare right now?
I'll cut your hair.

00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:27.704
- You're going to cut it?
- Yeah.

00:29:28.338 --> 00:29:30.907
I'll give you a hairstyle
that girls will fall for.

00:29:31.841 --> 00:29:32.809
What do you say?

00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:39.282
- Give me one second.
- Yeah.

00:29:41.751 --> 00:29:44.821
RE: HERE ARE THE MATERIALS
FOR TODAY'S MEETING

00:29:44.888 --> 00:29:47.857
I WILL BE A LITTLE LATE FOR THE MEETING
PLEASE START IT WITHOUT ME

00:29:47.924 --> 00:29:48.992
SEND

00:29:50.493 --> 00:29:52.195
I'll take you up on your offer.

00:29:52.262 --> 00:29:54.264
All right. Leave it up to me.

00:29:55.732 --> 00:29:57.300
I'll make you look the part.

00:29:57.367 --> 00:29:59.669
- Like a managing director?
- Yeah.

00:29:59.736 --> 00:30:02.605
- Don't give me a weird hair style.
- How about we do this…?

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.746
Did you receive the notice
about the reunion?

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.181
- Elementary school reunion?
- Yeah.

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:14.918
Are you going?

00:30:15.518 --> 00:30:19.389
I haven't decided yet. What about you?

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.326
I'm really busy with work,

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.762
but I'll go if you're going.

00:30:29.732 --> 00:30:30.934
Do you think he'll come?

00:30:32.302 --> 00:30:33.403
Junichi?

00:30:33.903 --> 00:30:34.871
Yeah.

00:30:37.206 --> 00:30:40.410
Apparently, he's on a list of people
whose contact details are unknown.

00:30:41.811 --> 00:30:42.979
I see.

00:30:44.914 --> 00:30:47.183
Knowing Junichi, he must be doing fine.

00:30:48.584 --> 00:30:49.686
You're right.

00:31:05.134 --> 00:31:07.303
- It's raining already.
- Oh no.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.906
- I'll be going.
- Take care.

00:31:22.218 --> 00:31:23.052
Junichi?

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:24.087
Yeah.

00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.223
I'm glad you called.

00:31:28.224 --> 00:31:31.761
I figured it would be best to avoid
meeting in person,

00:31:32.662 --> 00:31:35.231
but I wasn't sure if it was okay to call.

00:31:37.633 --> 00:31:39.769
Naoto confessed that he did it.

00:31:43.206 --> 00:31:45.341
His brother asked for money,
they got into an argument…

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.879
and during the struggle, the gun went off.

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:54.517
He testified that his brother
found the gun in the forest.

00:31:55.351 --> 00:31:59.088
He said his brother found the gun
in the forest?

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.025
Yeah.

00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:07.897
To keep our time capsule a secret?

00:32:13.136 --> 00:32:15.738
How did Naoto come up with such a story?

00:32:19.008 --> 00:32:19.942
But…

00:32:22.311 --> 00:32:25.481
There are no loopholes in that story?

00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:30.286
No inconsistency has been found.

00:32:37.627 --> 00:32:39.395
In hindsight,

00:32:40.196 --> 00:32:42.632
I shouldn't have gone along with you.

00:32:45.001 --> 00:32:48.004
I wish I had never gone to the forest.

00:32:53.009 --> 00:32:56.012
I didn't even care to see
any freshwater crab.

00:33:01.484 --> 00:33:02.652
Can you come here?

00:33:06.122 --> 00:33:09.092
Please come here right now, Junichi.

00:33:12.962 --> 00:33:13.896
Sorry,

00:33:14.597 --> 00:33:16.766
I just don't know what to do.

00:33:27.677 --> 00:33:28.911
I'll stay on the line

00:33:31.047 --> 00:33:32.181
until you've calmed down.

00:33:37.453 --> 00:33:38.554
I won't hang up.

00:34:01.277 --> 00:34:02.345
Thank you.

00:34:05.548 --> 00:34:06.516
I'll hang up now.

00:34:09.252 --> 00:34:10.219
Bye.

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:41.217
I see.

00:34:42.818 --> 00:34:45.188
Thanks for coming all the way to Tokyo
to leak information.

00:34:47.623 --> 00:34:50.560
- There's no turning back now.
- But I wonder…

00:34:52.962 --> 00:34:54.263
what Naoto's intention was

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.466
when he went to his brother's place
with a gun that night?

00:35:00.937 --> 00:35:04.240
Of course, I don't think he went there
intending to shoot him.

00:35:04.307 --> 00:35:05.208
Keisuke,

00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:08.544
I asked to meet with you today

00:35:09.078 --> 00:35:10.279
to confirm something.

00:35:10.846 --> 00:35:11.681
What is it?

00:35:12.181 --> 00:35:16.052
You dug up the time capsule
around 9:00 p.m. on Friday, right?

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:17.486
Yeah.

00:35:18.387 --> 00:35:20.056
You had an eyewitness testimony, right?

00:35:20.122 --> 00:35:22.124
The gun was already missing at that point.

00:35:23.826 --> 00:35:26.495
- You're sure about that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

00:35:28.064 --> 00:35:29.632
Why are you asking?

00:35:42.945 --> 00:35:44.313
What is it, so late at night?

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.415
The only one being detained tonight
is Naoto Sakuma, right?

00:35:46.482 --> 00:35:47.250
Yes.

00:35:47.817 --> 00:35:49.318
I want to talk with him.

00:35:50.086 --> 00:35:51.287
Privately.

00:35:55.758 --> 00:35:56.859
You're saying

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.762
that you don't want this
to go on the record?

00:36:00.396 --> 00:36:01.330
Yes.

00:36:02.632 --> 00:36:04.233
I'd like you to step out as well.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.436
I can't allow that.
It's a violation of the rules.

00:36:07.503 --> 00:36:08.971
Can you please make an exception?

00:36:09.038 --> 00:36:11.207
You need to stop.
Or I'll report you to my superiors.

00:36:16.812 --> 00:36:19.482
You know, Mr. Konno, I play mahjong.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.052
Do you know of the mahjong parlor
in Nishimatsu?

00:36:24.186 --> 00:36:25.821
Sorry, we're full right now.

00:36:25.888 --> 00:36:27.823
A spot will open in about 15 minutes.

00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:36.065
- It seems like you won big money today.
- I was just lucky.

00:36:36.132 --> 00:36:38.868
- How much did you win?
- 110,000. Please take this as payment.

00:36:38.934 --> 00:36:41.003
If you just pay up every month,

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.572
- it would make all our lives easier.
- I'm sorry.

00:36:44.106 --> 00:36:45.274
Are you in debt?

00:36:47.877 --> 00:36:49.712
And are you involved
with any shady people?

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.947
I can report you.

00:36:57.586 --> 00:36:59.455
I understand. I'll go tell my superiors.

00:36:59.522 --> 00:37:01.791
Fine, I got it! I'll do as you say!

00:37:11.267 --> 00:37:12.802
Naoto!

00:37:13.536 --> 00:37:15.471
- It's me.
- Junichi.

00:37:19.175 --> 00:37:20.142
I want to talk.

00:37:20.676 --> 00:37:23.412
- Is this allowed?
- If I get caught, I'll be in trouble.

00:37:25.448 --> 00:37:28.651
I asked you when you took the gun
from the time capsule.

00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:30.219
Yeah.

00:37:30.286 --> 00:37:31.554
Then you said…

00:37:33.289 --> 00:37:35.191
The night I returned from
the business trip to Korea.

00:37:37.393 --> 00:37:39.995
So that's Saturday night,
the night of the incident?

00:37:40.796 --> 00:37:41.630
Yeah.

00:37:42.198 --> 00:37:43.766
What about that?

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.469
That story just doesn't add up.

00:37:47.103 --> 00:37:48.003
What do you mean?

00:37:48.738 --> 00:37:51.107
On Friday night,
the day before the incident,

00:37:53.709 --> 00:37:55.411
Keisuke dug up the time capsule.

00:37:57.713 --> 00:38:00.249
But he said the gun was already gone
at that time.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:04.820
But you're saying that you dug it up
and took out the gun on Saturday.

00:38:06.689 --> 00:38:10.025
The gun that wasn't there on Friday night
was there on Saturday night?

00:38:12.261 --> 00:38:13.229
Naoto,

00:38:15.464 --> 00:38:18.701
did you really dig up that time capsule
on Saturday night?

00:38:25.474 --> 00:38:28.411
If one of us is lying,

00:38:32.214 --> 00:38:33.716
who will you believe?

00:38:38.888 --> 00:38:41.190
Of course, you'll believe Keisuke, right?

00:38:41.257 --> 00:38:43.659
Hey, I never said that.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.463
Keisuke was an honor student
ever since he was little.

00:38:50.132 --> 00:38:51.200
But you know,

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:55.504
back when we were young,

00:38:57.106 --> 00:38:59.241
the person I wanted to be

00:39:01.343 --> 00:39:03.279
was you, Junichi.

00:39:06.182 --> 00:39:07.183
The other day,

00:39:07.883 --> 00:39:10.152
when I met you again after a long time,

00:39:12.421 --> 00:39:15.624
I thought, "Yes, this is the Junichi
that I always admired."

00:39:16.125 --> 00:39:17.092
Hey,

00:39:17.693 --> 00:39:19.628
{\an8}what kind of a weird confession is this?

00:39:20.396 --> 00:39:22.031
{\an8}Do you understand the situation you're in?

00:39:26.936 --> 00:39:28.404
{\an8}After the graduation ceremony,

00:39:31.173 --> 00:39:34.443
{\an8}we buried a time capsule
that would never be dug up again.

00:39:37.613 --> 00:39:41.584
{\an8}You and Keisuke moved to Yokohama,

00:39:42.318 --> 00:39:44.420
{\an8}so Maki and I were the ones left behind.

00:39:46.222 --> 00:39:48.691
{\an8}But Maki also moved away
when she was in high school,

00:39:51.093 --> 00:39:52.761
{\an8}leaving me alone.

00:39:56.232 --> 00:39:57.233
{\an8}I…

00:40:00.803 --> 00:40:03.205
{\an8}felt that I should never leave this town.

00:40:05.608 --> 00:40:07.276
{\an8}I felt like

00:40:07.843 --> 00:40:09.578
{\an8}I had to watch over that time capsule.

00:40:10.713 --> 00:40:12.848
{\an8}I thought that was my duty.

00:40:16.585 --> 00:40:18.153
{\an8}It's no exaggeration.

00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:21.557
{\an8}I seriously believed it.

00:40:25.561 --> 00:40:28.464
{\an8}Later, Maki and Keisuke

00:40:29.465 --> 00:40:31.867
{\an8}got married and returned to this town.

00:40:36.205 --> 00:40:37.206
{\an8}I never thought

00:40:38.073 --> 00:40:40.643
{\an8}you would come back here too.

00:40:45.948 --> 00:40:47.016
Is it true

00:40:47.883 --> 00:40:51.153
that when you're ordered to transfer
to another department, you can't refuse?

00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:54.723
I couldn't,
but I also had no reason to either.

00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:56.992
Is that so?

00:40:59.228 --> 00:41:00.229
I thought

00:41:01.964 --> 00:41:04.366
you would never

00:41:05.367 --> 00:41:07.636
come back here again.

00:41:09.505 --> 00:41:10.439
Why?

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.218
Why aren't you married, Junichi?

00:41:28.123 --> 00:41:30.025
There's no particular reason.

00:41:32.995 --> 00:41:34.797
Besides, I don't feel the need to.

00:41:34.863 --> 00:41:36.498
Why didn't you contact Maki

00:41:38.634 --> 00:41:40.536
after we all graduated?

00:41:41.403 --> 00:41:44.039
That's how most middle schoolers are.

00:41:50.779 --> 00:41:53.182
Isn't it because
you were shouldering something

00:41:55.417 --> 00:41:58.387
- that you'll never be able to escape from?
- Hey,

00:41:58.887 --> 00:42:00.990
- what are you talking about?
- I too…

00:42:04.994 --> 00:42:07.162
have something I've been shouldering.

00:42:10.165 --> 00:42:11.634
There's something I've decided

00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:14.203
to keep locked away in my heart

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:17.106
for the rest of my life.

00:42:23.345 --> 00:42:24.947
You have something like that too, right?

00:42:27.883 --> 00:42:29.084
But you know,

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.821
I think it's okay now.

00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:37.726
It's okay to be freed from what you did

00:42:38.994 --> 00:42:40.462
23 years ago.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.132
What the heck are you talking about?

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:47.836
On that day…

00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:51.807
I saw it…

00:42:53.709 --> 00:42:54.743
I'll go check things out.

00:42:56.111 --> 00:42:57.146
You stay here.

00:42:57.212 --> 00:42:58.414
I'll go too.

00:42:59.148 --> 00:43:00.182
Don't overdo it.

00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:13.889
{\an8}NEW CRIME IS REVEALED

00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:15.224
{\an8}Why did you become a police officer?

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:16.625
{\an8}I wasn't supposed to become one.

00:44:16.692 --> 00:44:18.026
{\an8}Because I've committed a crime.

00:44:18.093 --> 00:44:19.828
Can you please
come with me to the station?

00:44:19.895 --> 00:44:22.865
{\an8}The key to solving this case is that gun.

00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:24.299
{\an8}Who shot Oshima?

00:44:24.366 --> 00:44:28.003
{\an8}For example,
the first person who arrived at the scene.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:28.971
