00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:51.179
Help!

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.014
Help, please!

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:42.211
Guys, I think we’re almost there.

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:43.976
Almost?

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:47.438
After we've walked all this way!

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.316
We're already so exhausted!

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:56.988
Look at Dave!

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:59.658
He's been quiet for a while.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.493
Is he still alive?

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.745
Dave's just a quiet guy!

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:07.374
He's an introvert, remember? Introvert!

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:09.333
Dave!

00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:12.380
Are you still okay?

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:14.131
Sorry guys.

00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:15.925
I was just being careful.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:18.112
There might be snakes around the area.

00:06:18.636 --> 00:06:20.345
Didn't you think of that?

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:23.349
You'll be fine! Just
walk on the tall grass.

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:30.773
[alarm beeping]

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:33.025
What's that?

00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:35.652
Where is that coming from?

00:06:35.653 --> 00:06:36.653
Step count!

00:06:37.238 --> 00:06:38.238
10k steps already.

00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:39.991
Matt, seriously?

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:42.910
Thank you, bro!

00:06:43.202 --> 00:06:45.204
This isn't the time for that!

00:06:46.122 --> 00:06:46.748
Sorry, my bad.

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:49.833
But don't forget, it's intrams next month.

00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:51.961
Got to get my steps in, bro!

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.214
Guys, wait!

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:59.468
Are you sure this is the right way?

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:00.719
Wow!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.888
I never pegged you as a complainer, Zein.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.973
You've always liked these kinds of things.

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:06.433
Because when I make the plans,

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:09.771
I use GPS not a rusty old map!

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.439
This map is legit!

00:07:12.604 --> 00:07:14.272
If that's legit, where did you find it?

00:07:14.692 --> 00:07:15.811
Just trust me.

00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:17.613
Trust you?

00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:19.863
Boo!

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.490
Shit!

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:25.495
Relax, girl. Why are you
such a scaredy cat today?

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:27.538
Nice one!

00:07:29.832 --> 00:07:31.000
It's so hot!

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:32.835
Let's go!

00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:35.504
Come on.

00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:37.298
She's worrying about nothing.

00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:54.232
Be careful.

00:07:56.793 --> 00:07:57.961
It's so steep!

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.574
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.248
Where are we going?

00:08:12.043 --> 00:08:16.088
Wow! The almighty Zein Shion gets scared?

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:17.939
The Zein Shion.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.342
What are you talking about?

00:08:19.674 --> 00:08:24.262
Do you remember when you
punched someone who catcalled you?

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:25.721
That Zein Shion.

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:27.098
First of all...

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:29.808
that was a roundhouse kick, not a punch.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.685
Second, wow.

00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:32.926
How did you even remember that?

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:34.131
Of course, I remember.

00:08:34.188 --> 00:08:36.274
Besides, you were known for that back then.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.819
Didn't you get suspended because of that?

00:08:40.528 --> 00:08:43.322
How would I know that
punk was a nosebleeder?

00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:46.217
Was it worth it?

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:51.497
If you could go back to the past
and change things, would you?

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.290
As if!

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:55.208
Shit!

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:07.054
If anyone tries to hurt
you again, don't worry.

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:09.529
They're gonna have to go through me first

00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:12.094
before they can have a
taste of your roundhouse kick.

00:09:14.103 --> 00:09:15.938
Wow, thanks.

00:09:19.317 --> 00:09:21.881
Guys!

00:09:25.215 --> 00:09:27.092
How long 'til we get to Hell Academy?

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:29.410
Hell University!

00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:32.178
Sounds like a horror film!

00:09:33.164 --> 00:09:34.916
Guys, wait!

00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:37.668
This place looks so creepy!

00:09:38.169 --> 00:09:41.963
If this is a horror film, I'm claiming it.

00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:43.841
I'm going to be the final girl.

00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:46.481
FYI.

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:54.142
Sure, as long as I'm the comic relief

00:09:54.143 --> 00:09:55.772
who doesn't die early.

00:09:56.854 --> 00:09:57.854
You know...

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:01.400
I think the annoying
cheerleader would suit you more.

00:10:02.318 --> 00:10:03.319
The nerve...

00:10:03.674 --> 00:10:05.426
you're the only annoying one here.

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.551
Guys...

00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:20.573
I did my research.

00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:24.605
I can't find any schools
in the gps or maps.

00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:28.226
Are you sure about this, Mia?

00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:30.103
This school is abandoned.

00:10:30.562 --> 00:10:32.355
But according to my map

00:10:32.897 --> 00:10:34.399
we should be close to the gate.

00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:38.027
You mean that gate?

00:11:14.817 --> 00:11:16.026
Is anybody inside?

00:11:28.828 --> 00:11:30.580
Hell University.

00:11:37.128 --> 00:11:38.128
Guys...

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:40.589
do you think we can ask for
some drinking water?

00:11:41.007 --> 00:11:42.217
I'm so thirsty.

00:11:42.717 --> 00:11:44.469
I left my water tumbler at home.

00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:49.890
Unless, she's willing to share.

00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:51.184
You wish!

00:11:51.851 --> 00:11:52.977
No way!

00:11:53.693 --> 00:11:54.896
Nice try, boy.

00:11:55.772 --> 00:11:57.315
I have a bad feeling about this, guys.

00:11:57.815 --> 00:11:59.650
Maybe we should go back?

00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:00.651
Huh?

00:12:00.818 --> 00:12:02.237
After all that?

00:12:02.654 --> 00:12:04.280
We've walked so far!

00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:05.697
Mia's right.

00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:06.949
We've come all this way.

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:09.127
Let's check first if
they'll accommodate us.

00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:11.326
There's no one inside!

00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:15.250
Is anyone there?

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:17.793
Jerome, you're too loud!

00:12:17.794 --> 00:12:19.127
- Hello?!
- Jeez.

00:12:19.128 --> 00:12:20.088
Anyone!?

00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:21.089
Jerome!

00:12:21.965 --> 00:12:24.759
Guys, let's leave while
there's still sunlight!

00:12:25.802 --> 00:12:26.802
Come on!

00:12:34.102 --> 00:12:36.062
Jer, what's wrong with you?

00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.748
There's someone there.

00:12:39.857 --> 00:12:41.651
What are you doing here?

00:12:45.363 --> 00:12:46.363
Sir...

00:12:47.115 --> 00:12:48.741
are you the caretaker here?

00:12:54.497 --> 00:12:57.250
How did you find this place?

00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:10.972
We got lost while hiking, sir.

00:13:11.306 --> 00:13:13.558
Then we found this school.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.226
We thought it was abandoned.

00:13:16.978 --> 00:13:19.480
We’ve run out of water...

00:13:20.523 --> 00:13:22.650
Would it be okay to ask for some inside?

00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:28.156
Do you want to come in?

00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:51.929
But this should be clear...

00:13:52.555 --> 00:13:54.974
this place isn't abandoned.

00:13:55.892 --> 00:13:59.979
You mean there are students inside?

00:14:03.524 --> 00:14:05.777
Oh, there you go!

00:14:06.736 --> 00:14:07.736
Come on, Zein!

00:14:07.862 --> 00:14:09.322
You kept complaining earlier.

00:14:09.947 --> 00:14:11.783
Now you're quiet? Are you okay?

00:14:12.533 --> 00:14:13.659
Right.

00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:16.579
Don't tell me you're a
scaredy cat now, Zein Shion?

00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:18.330
Stop teasing, Zein.

00:14:18.331 --> 00:14:19.415
She's just tired.

00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:23.669
It's okay, Zein. We'll be fine.

00:14:26.214 --> 00:14:30.051
We should move before it gets dark.

00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:32.011
You're right.

00:14:32.929 --> 00:14:33.929
Let's go?

00:14:34.472 --> 00:14:35.472
Okay.

00:14:53.908 --> 00:14:56.119
There are doors... that once they close...

00:14:56.911 --> 00:14:58.538
You’re not the same when you come out.

00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:03.835
If you even come out.

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:13.136
There, we'll go to the admin office.

00:15:13.553 --> 00:15:14.762
Remember...

00:15:15.505 --> 00:15:19.134
This university changes at 7:00 p.m.

00:15:19.434 --> 00:15:20.601
Be careful.

00:15:38.828 --> 00:15:41.330
You all need to register.

00:15:41.956 --> 00:15:42.956
Register?

00:15:43.124 --> 00:15:44.959
Like an attendance, sir?

00:15:45.334 --> 00:15:48.211
We're just lost, we're
not planning to enroll.

00:15:48.212 --> 00:15:49.797
Why not?

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.549
Isn't it cool?

00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:52.549
Think of it this way...

00:15:52.592 --> 00:15:54.844
even if we cut class in this school,

00:15:54.969 --> 00:15:57.221
they won't tell our parents.

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:01.600
Jerome doesn't make sense
most of the time, but I agree.

00:16:01.601 --> 00:16:03.519
Guys, stop playing around.

00:16:04.061 --> 00:16:06.646
We're here to stock up supplies
then we're leaving.

00:16:06.647 --> 00:16:07.647
Guys!

00:16:08.107 --> 00:16:09.400
Stay close.

00:16:10.026 --> 00:16:13.570
- What's happening? They're being weird.
- Guys...

00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:14.738
Go back to your dorm.

00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:15.698
Students, come on!

00:16:15.698 --> 00:16:16.698
Shit!

00:16:18.117 --> 00:16:20.244
- Oh my god! This is crazy!
- Let's stick together!

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:22.455
What are you looking at?

00:16:24.123 --> 00:16:25.291
What's happening?

00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.626
- I don’t like this place, let's go home!
- Sir!

00:16:27.627 --> 00:16:29.712
Sir! We want to go back!

00:16:30.254 --> 00:16:31.827
Go back to your dorms!

00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:32.923
What?

00:16:35.676 --> 00:16:36.427
This is your fault, Mia!

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.387
What kind of map was that?

00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:40.014
Is this really a school?

00:16:41.307 --> 00:16:42.600
What the hell is happening?

00:16:43.976 --> 00:16:44.936
Let's go back home.

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:45.977
Stay close, guys.

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:47.108
Are they following us?

00:16:49.565 --> 00:16:50.358
I want to go home!

00:16:50.358 --> 00:16:51.358
Guys!

00:16:52.193 --> 00:16:53.152
I told you so!

00:16:53.153 --> 00:16:54.570
Sir, we'll go back!

00:17:04.539 --> 00:17:05.039
Guys...

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.331
What's going on?

00:17:06.332 --> 00:17:07.458
They have weapons!

00:17:14.924 --> 00:17:17.509
- Stay close, guys.
- What's happening!

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.261
What do you want?

00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:19.011
Stay away from me!

00:17:19.012 --> 00:17:20.804
What's going on?

00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:22.682
What are they doing?

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.976
Stay together!

00:17:25.977 --> 00:17:27.186
What's happening?

00:17:37.321 --> 00:17:38.781
It's just a riot.

00:17:39.073 --> 00:17:40.616
Don't mind them.

00:17:41.325 --> 00:17:42.535
Riot?

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.912
Why is no one stopping them?

00:17:45.871 --> 00:17:50.585
Your questions will be
answered inside. Let's go!

00:17:51.252 --> 00:17:52.295
No... we'll go home!

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.530
I don’t like this!

00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:55.798
We want to go home!

00:17:57.508 --> 00:17:58.508
Don’t panic!

00:18:00.928 --> 00:18:02.138
What’s happening?!

00:18:05.725 --> 00:18:09.353
Guys, faster!

00:18:25.661 --> 00:18:26.661
Oh my god.

00:18:26.704 --> 00:18:27.704
You know,

00:18:27.747 --> 00:18:31.042
I'm starting to get why this
place is called Hell University.

00:18:31.667 --> 00:18:34.128
This place is just so out of the box.

00:18:35.171 --> 00:18:37.881
And their approach to
education is... unique.

00:18:37.882 --> 00:18:40.885
Unique? You call that riot unique?

00:18:41.616 --> 00:18:42.591
Are you being serious, guys?

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:44.541
Am I the only one who
saw that riot outside?

00:18:44.722 --> 00:18:46.015
We all did, Zein.

00:18:47.642 --> 00:18:48.976
I don't care anymore!

00:18:49.852 --> 00:18:52.288
I only want to know if this place has WiFi.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.190
Oh my god...

00:18:54.191 --> 00:18:56.233
we soiled their floors.

00:18:57.068 --> 00:18:59.445
It's okay, maybe they have janitors here.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.737
Come on, guys.

00:19:00.738 --> 00:19:02.198
He's leaving us.

00:19:03.491 --> 00:19:04.825
Are you with the admin?

00:19:06.108 --> 00:19:07.818
Where are we going?

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:09.955
We're going to the headmistress' office.

00:19:10.956 --> 00:19:14.752
She can explain the registration process.

00:19:15.628 --> 00:19:17.838
We're not going to enroll.

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:22.502
Do you think we would want to after
witnessing what's out there?

00:19:28.474 --> 00:19:29.475
Dave, look.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.228
He looks like a doctor slash cult leader.

00:19:32.624 --> 00:19:34.689
Jerome, stop it! Let's go.

00:19:34.939 --> 00:19:36.440
Stop saying nonsense!

00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:38.109
Am I right?

00:19:39.318 --> 00:19:41.028
What did we get ourselves into?

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:43.989
What if something bad happens to us?

00:19:45.574 --> 00:19:49.036
Calm down, we'll get out of here safe.

00:20:40.087 --> 00:20:41.505
Hello, newbies.

00:20:42.248 --> 00:20:45.167
I am Madam Violet.

00:20:46.199 --> 00:20:50.036
Headmistress of Hell University.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.601
Simply put...

00:20:54.744 --> 00:20:57.622
I'm in charge around here.

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:00.636
Madam Violet.

00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:02.912
No offense...

00:21:03.023 --> 00:21:06.318
But are you aware of
the riot going on outside?

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:09.126
Don't fret.

00:21:09.899 --> 00:21:11.337
It happens all the time.

00:21:12.463 --> 00:21:14.173
Francisco...

00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:17.802
Have them fill these out please.

00:21:23.641 --> 00:21:25.268
How much is the tuition fee here?

00:21:34.902 --> 00:21:37.029
There is no tuition fee.

00:21:37.738 --> 00:21:39.240
Everything is free.

00:21:43.202 --> 00:21:44.322
Is this a public university?

00:21:44.996 --> 00:21:45.996
No.

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:47.038
We're private.

00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:50.084
It's complicated.

00:21:51.836 --> 00:21:56.048
Let's just say that we are not
your conventional university.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.050
Conventional?

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.469
What do you mean?

00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:05.891
7 pm to 5 am is what we call Freedom Night.

00:22:06.309 --> 00:22:08.686
Also known as Bloody Night.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.856
Everything is free.

00:22:14.525 --> 00:22:17.028
You are free to do whatever you want.

00:22:18.404 --> 00:22:20.489
Killing is allowed.

00:22:24.452 --> 00:22:26.370
So I suggest that you stay in your rooms...

00:22:26.954 --> 00:22:28.289
Lock up your doors,

00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:30.750
and don't go out.

00:22:32.209 --> 00:22:34.587
Because if you step outside...

00:22:37.048 --> 00:22:39.133
You may not come back alive.

00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:41.301
Wait a minute.

00:22:41.719 --> 00:22:42.845
Are you serious?

00:22:43.387 --> 00:22:45.431
You're spewing nonsense!

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.145
Nonsense...

00:22:51.562 --> 00:22:52.562
But it seems cool!

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.191
- Cool?
- Cool.

00:22:55.566 --> 00:22:57.401
This is insane!

00:22:58.819 --> 00:23:02.406
Guys, let's leave. The
people here are crazy.

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:07.619
Zein...

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.579
Guys?

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.831
This is the adventure we've
been looking for, isn't it?

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.917
Just agree, Zein.

00:23:18.714 --> 00:23:21.633
Zein, let's listen to her first.

00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:23.511
Maybe this will be good for us.

00:23:25.179 --> 00:23:26.179
Let's give it a try.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.600
If we can't handle it, we'll go home.

00:23:30.267 --> 00:23:31.852
Let's stay for one night.

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:35.940
Right! And we don't have
anywhere else to stay the night.

00:23:36.524 --> 00:23:38.401
It's more dangerous outside.

00:23:38.901 --> 00:23:41.904
What are you so afraid of, Zein?

00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:43.072
I'm not afraid!

00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:46.617
Then it's settled.

00:23:47.243 --> 00:23:49.746
Francisco, can you take
them to their rooms, please?

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:55.376
Fear is not a liability.

00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:59.004
So if I were you, Miss?

00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:01.381
Zein.

00:24:02.133 --> 00:24:03.134
Zein Shion.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720
Miss Zein.

00:24:08.754 --> 00:24:10.505
It’s a good thing you’re scared.

00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:16.564
Because fear is something
you would need here to survive.

00:24:17.773 --> 00:24:19.108
Be careful!

00:24:20.484 --> 00:24:24.822
Even your friends cannot be trusted.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.285
Never let your guard down.

00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:31.661
Or else...

00:24:32.788 --> 00:24:34.040
If you know what I mean.

00:24:35.332 --> 00:24:39.336
The directions to you
dorms are in the packets.

00:24:40.129 --> 00:24:45.176
You live in one dorm: separate
rooms for girls and boys.

00:24:45.968 --> 00:24:48.803
The instructions are in the packets.

00:24:48.804 --> 00:24:51.307
At least it's like a sleepover every day?

00:24:52.767 --> 00:24:55.102
And everything is free. Even our dorms.

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:57.730
Not bad. Slay!

00:25:04.111 --> 00:25:07.364
Welcome to Hell University.

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:34.475
If we enroll here, we'll be dormmates.

00:25:35.142 --> 00:25:37.978
It's spacious. Not bad.

00:25:38.395 --> 00:25:39.687
Slay!

00:25:39.688 --> 00:25:41.524
Slay!

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:45.151
Guys, where are the rooms?

00:25:45.152 --> 00:25:45.611
I don’t know.

00:25:45.612 --> 00:25:46.904
I think it's over here.

00:25:47.655 --> 00:25:48.988
Come on, let's check!

00:25:48.989 --> 00:25:49.989
Okay.

00:25:56.306 --> 00:26:00.851
This is nice!

00:26:00.876 --> 00:26:02.544
Let's use this room!

00:26:02.545 --> 00:26:04.170
And for the girls?

00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:05.422
Let's use this room, right?

00:26:08.717 --> 00:26:10.385
Matt.

00:26:10.386 --> 00:26:12.637
Check in with Zein.

00:26:12.638 --> 00:26:14.014
Go to her.

00:26:20.771 --> 00:26:22.022
Zein...

00:26:23.357 --> 00:26:24.692
Zein...

00:26:28.237 --> 00:26:29.613
Zein, are you okay?

00:26:35.744 --> 00:26:37.245
I just miss my sister.

00:26:37.246 --> 00:26:38.455
Allison.

00:26:43.627 --> 00:26:44.627
Zein...

00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:47.381
Why don't we give it a chance?

00:26:47.923 --> 00:26:48.923
Look...

00:26:49.383 --> 00:26:51.051
It seems nice here.

00:26:51.886 --> 00:26:53.387
The dorm is free.

00:26:54.388 --> 00:26:55.556
Even the tuition.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.140
Matt...

00:26:57.182 --> 00:27:00.394
What are saying? Aren't you a scholar?

00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:07.818
Not for long.

00:27:08.777 --> 00:27:10.177
I got kicked out of the team, Zein.

00:27:10.905 --> 00:27:13.324
I don't even know how to tell my parents.

00:27:15.117 --> 00:27:16.117
Matt...

00:27:16.327 --> 00:27:17.369
Sorry.

00:27:17.953 --> 00:27:18.953
I didn't know.

00:27:19.872 --> 00:27:20.873
That's okay.

00:27:22.207 --> 00:27:24.000
But please don't mention
it to the others yet.

00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:25.001
It's embarrassing.

00:27:31.258 --> 00:27:33.098
There's something
wrong with this place, Matt.

00:27:33.928 --> 00:27:36.055
What Violet said isn't normal.

00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:38.223
Killing is legal?

00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:40.142
What kind of school does that?

00:27:41.602 --> 00:27:44.104
Maybe it's just a scare tactic?

00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:52.613
I think it's best to follow their rules for
now and think about the rest tomorrow.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.452
Are you really scared?

00:27:59.745 --> 00:28:02.790
Is it because of the riot?

00:28:06.794 --> 00:28:07.795
Don't worry.

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.964
Nothing bad is going to happen to you.

00:28:11.632 --> 00:28:12.632
Or all of us.

00:28:14.718 --> 00:28:16.929
You're the bravest girl I know.

00:28:17.596 --> 00:28:20.808
Remember during elementary,
when our classmate made fun of me?

00:28:21.558 --> 00:28:24.311
Before I could do anything,
you already kicked him.

00:28:24.687 --> 00:28:28.357
But I got scared too when
he was about to retaliate.

00:28:28.941 --> 00:28:31.068
Good thing you had my back.

00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:35.738
I was surprised you were
willing to take a punch for me.

00:28:35.739 --> 00:28:37.241
Of course I would.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:38.950
It's you.

00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:42.204
I won't let anything bad happen to you.

00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:46.791
and Mia and Vanessa.

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:50.837
The boys are big enough
to handle themselves.

00:28:50.838 --> 00:28:52.548
So for now...

00:28:54.675 --> 00:28:56.092
Let's just rest.

00:28:56.093 --> 00:28:58.453
Let's worry about the things
we have to deal with tomorrow.

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:01.223
Do you want me to walk you to your room?

00:29:03.726 --> 00:29:04.768
No, it's okay.

00:29:04.977 --> 00:29:06.353
I just need some air.

00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:08.896
Look out for them, okay?

00:29:08.897 --> 00:29:09.982
I’ll just take a walk.

00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:11.108
Alright.

00:29:11.275 --> 00:29:12.275
Matt...

00:29:12.443 --> 00:29:13.152
Matt!

00:29:13.152 --> 00:29:14.152
What?

00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:16.572
Jerome took your spot.

00:29:16.739 --> 00:29:18.139
He said you can sleep on the floor.

00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:20.284
What a nutcase.

00:29:20.743 --> 00:29:24.620
I'll deal with that first.
Get some rest, Zein.

00:29:24.621 --> 00:29:25.621
Okay.

00:29:27.374 --> 00:29:29.084
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:14.421
Hell University...

00:30:14.922 --> 00:30:17.382
I thought my old school
was already a hellhole.

00:30:18.342 --> 00:30:20.135
Where are the students?

00:30:20.803 --> 00:30:22.346
Why is it so quiet?

00:31:08.684 --> 00:31:09.810
You're bleeding!

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:12.603
Are you okay?

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:14.731
That's not my blood.

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:18.861
What's your name, newbie?

00:31:19.736 --> 00:31:20.736
Zein.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.786
Angel-like but I know

00:31:28.537 --> 00:31:31.248
you'll use a knife soon to survive.

00:31:43.343 --> 00:31:44.594
Scared?

00:31:44.595 --> 00:31:46.430
You shouldn't have come here.

00:31:47.097 --> 00:31:48.348
Who are you?

00:31:49.558 --> 00:31:50.767
I'm not a friend.

00:31:51.143 --> 00:31:52.561
No one is your friend.

00:31:54.104 --> 00:31:55.731
I'll let you free for now, newbie.

00:31:56.273 --> 00:32:00.694
It's already 6:30 pm. You
still have thirty minutes.

00:32:01.153 --> 00:32:02.654
Lock all the doors.

00:32:03.155 --> 00:32:05.115
All eyes are on you and your friends.

00:32:06.074 --> 00:32:07.451
Watch your back.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.184
- Sorry, bro.
- What?

00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:34.644
There's no other pillows left.

00:32:34.645 --> 00:32:36.145
That's my pillow.

00:32:36.146 --> 00:32:37.231
Bro, give this to me.

00:32:37.856 --> 00:32:40.066
Please? I'm so stressed out.

00:32:40.067 --> 00:32:41.067
Fine.

00:32:42.569 --> 00:32:43.654
I'm sorry, bro.

00:32:47.282 --> 00:32:51.035
How are you able to
workout in this situation?

00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:52.955
Aren't you scared?

00:32:54.081 --> 00:32:55.332
I'm scared.

00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:56.959
Really scared.

00:32:57.918 --> 00:32:59.419
For my future...

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.506
My decision to enroll here...

00:33:04.925 --> 00:33:06.385
My parents...

00:33:07.678 --> 00:33:09.429
Who are worried about me now.

00:33:14.768 --> 00:33:16.394
I still don't know.

00:33:16.395 --> 00:33:18.397
How to tell them.

00:33:21.358 --> 00:33:22.943
But when I'm moving...

00:33:24.403 --> 00:33:26.488
My mind stops spiraling.

00:33:27.162 --> 00:33:29.039
I think much clearer.

00:33:30.534 --> 00:33:34.830
I'm my family's disappointment.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.375
So I'm sure they're not worried about me.

00:33:40.043 --> 00:33:44.172
"Jerome? He always gets home late."

00:33:45.424 --> 00:33:47.633
"He's probably just partying."

00:33:47.634 --> 00:33:49.856
"Drinking himself to death."

00:33:50.512 --> 00:33:52.465
Story of my life.

00:33:52.889 --> 00:33:54.308
They're looking for you.

00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:58.352
All our parents are worried about us.

00:33:58.353 --> 00:34:00.229
Don't spiral, bro.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.607
We'll tell them to let us out tomorrow.

00:34:04.151 --> 00:34:09.363
Do you think Madam
Violet is telling the truth?

00:34:09.364 --> 00:34:12.534
That killing is legal during Bloody Night?

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.535
Seriously?

00:34:14.536 --> 00:34:15.579
You're falling for that?

00:34:16.538 --> 00:34:20.791
Maybe she was just using it
as a metaphor or something?

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:22.512
You know, a discipline tactic for students.

00:34:23.503 --> 00:34:25.005
You're overthinking it.

00:34:25.464 --> 00:34:26.590
Relax.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:30.719
No, I feel like she's saying it literally.

00:34:33.055 --> 00:34:34.097
Whatever.

00:34:35.932 --> 00:34:36.932
Van?

00:34:36.933 --> 00:34:38.893
What's that?

00:34:38.894 --> 00:34:40.311
That’s Vanessa!

00:34:40.312 --> 00:34:41.479
I don't know. Let's check it out.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.398
Let's go!

00:34:44.274 --> 00:34:45.067
Van?

00:34:45.068 --> 00:34:46.108
Van!

00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.777
What's wrong?

00:34:46.777 --> 00:34:47.611
This is so frustrating!

00:34:47.612 --> 00:34:49.403
There's no WiFi! No signal!

00:34:49.404 --> 00:34:50.564
What's wrong with this place?

00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:52.199
Van...

00:34:52.866 --> 00:34:54.492
I need to call mom and dad

00:34:54.493 --> 00:34:56.660
for sure they're worried about me.

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.662
Let's try asking the students tomorrow.

00:34:58.663 --> 00:35:00.331
Maybe they have a way
to contact the outside?

00:35:00.332 --> 00:35:01.332
Tomorrow!?

00:35:01.528 --> 00:35:02.292
I can't last that long.

00:35:02.293 --> 00:35:04.293
My followers are waiting for me!

00:35:04.294 --> 00:35:06.212
Van, how did you fit all these in there?

00:35:06.213 --> 00:35:08.005
Of course!

00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:09.048
Beauty is essential.

00:35:09.049 --> 00:35:11.718
At least if I die, I'm
going to die beautiful!

00:35:12.302 --> 00:35:14.012
Bloody Night, bring it on!

00:35:14.206 --> 00:35:15.790
This is so frustrating!

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:18.183
Wait, where's Zein?

00:35:18.809 --> 00:35:19.534
Zein?

00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:20.851
She was just here earlier.

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:22.020
Zein?

00:35:23.063 --> 00:35:23.814
Guys...

00:35:23.814 --> 00:35:24.398
Zein!

00:35:24.399 --> 00:35:26.024
Zein!

00:35:26.582 --> 00:35:27.901
Are you okay?

00:35:29.945 --> 00:35:31.237
There's a boy in the park...

00:35:31.238 --> 00:35:32.531
wearing a mask...

00:35:33.115 --> 00:35:34.740
his shirt was bloody.

00:35:34.741 --> 00:35:36.159
He warned me!

00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:39.496
We made a mistake...

00:35:39.788 --> 00:35:41.915
This is no longer fun!

00:35:42.308 --> 00:35:43.475
Maybe he was just pranking you?

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.500
He wasn't.

00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:47.169
Zein, worrying will kill you first.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.170
No!

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.969
Is it Bloody Night already?

00:35:54.386 --> 00:35:54.719
Shit!

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.887
Over here!

00:35:56.263 --> 00:35:58.097
Run faster!

00:35:58.098 --> 00:35:59.349
Faster!

00:36:02.727 --> 00:36:03.687
Help me, please!

00:36:03.688 --> 00:36:05.522
Open the door! Help him!

00:36:13.196 --> 00:36:14.865
Please, let's help him!

00:36:25.924 --> 00:36:28.886
Open this! I'll kill you all!

00:36:31.631 --> 00:36:34.509
Get in! Quick!

00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.808
One...

00:36:41.808 --> 00:36:42.476
Two...

00:36:42.476 --> 00:36:43.476
Three!

00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:45.270
Bring it up!

00:37:07.501 --> 00:37:08.168
What's happening?

00:37:08.169 --> 00:37:09.878
What's wrong with this place?

00:37:11.463 --> 00:37:13.089
I don't want to die!

00:37:14.049 --> 00:37:16.008
Guys, don't give up!

00:37:16.009 --> 00:37:18.260
- I'm going to kill you all!
- We can do this!

00:37:18.261 --> 00:37:20.222
I'm going to kill you all!

00:37:21.556 --> 00:37:23.683
Guys, I don't want to die.

00:37:28.897 --> 00:37:30.982
Boys! Let's get out of here.

00:37:37.697 --> 00:37:38.657
Are you all okay?

00:37:38.657 --> 00:37:39.778
So that’s all you’ve got?

00:37:48.583 --> 00:37:50.000
Dave, are you okay?

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:51.335
Yeah, I’m okay.

00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:52.670
Are you guys okay?

00:37:52.671 --> 00:37:54.755
Guys, I don't want to die in this place.

00:37:54.756 --> 00:37:55.756
Please...

00:37:56.049 --> 00:37:58.385
Let's leave this place, please!

00:37:58.528 --> 00:38:01.262
Let's stick together no matter what.

00:38:01.263 --> 00:38:02.430
Dave's right.

00:38:04.029 --> 00:38:05.029
When daylight comes...

00:38:05.933 --> 00:38:07.518
Let's ask for help from the admin.

00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:21.533
I see that you're back at my office.

00:38:22.993 --> 00:38:26.830
Good morning, Madam Violet.
We want to leave this place!

00:38:28.665 --> 00:38:30.041
Why? What's the problem?

00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:33.962
This university is a complete mess!

00:38:34.379 --> 00:38:36.756
Why isn't the government
doing anything about it?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.302
Watch it, Ms. Zein Shion.

00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:45.462
This university is independent
from the government.

00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:48.351
They can't touch us.

00:38:49.019 --> 00:38:52.063
We're going to leave
this shithole of a school!

00:38:53.732 --> 00:38:55.233
We have rules here...

00:38:56.151 --> 00:38:57.485
Once you enter...

00:39:00.322 --> 00:39:02.198
there's no turning back.

00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:06.411
What do you mean?

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:10.123
We're not kidding around here. Let us go!

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:12.082
No.

00:39:12.584 --> 00:39:15.295
You entered this place on your own accord.

00:39:16.963 --> 00:39:18.089
Live with the consequences.

00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:20.425
Bullshit!

00:39:20.842 --> 00:39:22.134
We're going to leave this place!

00:39:22.135 --> 00:39:25.764
And we'll make sure to
report you to the police!

00:39:26.139 --> 00:39:28.266
Go ahead, Mr. Jerome Marquez.

00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:31.061
Find a way out.

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.063
If you can find one.

00:39:33.938 --> 00:39:35.732
Nobody's stopping you.

00:39:37.442 --> 00:39:39.277
Now I have a very busy day

00:39:40.445 --> 00:39:43.156
so if you're done yapping around...

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:44.324
I suggest

00:39:44.866 --> 00:39:47.452
wear your uniforms and go to your classes.

00:39:48.453 --> 00:39:49.537
Excuse me?

00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:51.706
Are we still going to study?

00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:56.503
Will we learn anything in
this place besides killing?

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.007
Hell University is still a school.

00:40:02.384 --> 00:40:04.511
The teachers here are
the cream of the crop.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720
They are the best.

00:40:07.347 --> 00:40:11.810
You will learn a lot from them
compared to other schools.

00:40:12.102 --> 00:40:13.144
Wow!

00:40:13.353 --> 00:40:15.980
I can't believe teachers apply
here with all this happening.

00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:16.981
Amazing!

00:40:17.941 --> 00:40:19.693
I wouldn't worry about them.

00:40:20.735 --> 00:40:22.153
Think of it this way...

00:40:23.196 --> 00:40:25.448
their salaries aren't normal either.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.534
Sometimes they get paid double...

00:40:27.826 --> 00:40:28.826
triple...

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.789
You know what, that’s enough!

00:40:34.708 --> 00:40:35.959
If I were you...

00:40:37.335 --> 00:40:40.547
get changed to your
uniforms and go to class.

00:40:40.964 --> 00:40:42.966
Cause if the President
gets a hold of you...

00:40:43.508 --> 00:40:47.846
the consequences are unimaginable.

00:41:07.574 --> 00:41:08.825
We need to leave.

00:41:09.784 --> 00:41:11.244
My mom and dad...

00:41:11.786 --> 00:41:13.329
they're looking for me!

00:41:14.372 --> 00:41:16.124
Are we really going to be able to leave?

00:41:17.499 --> 00:41:18.375
Mia.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.318
In... out, okay?

00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:22.714
Look at me.

00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:23.739
Five counts.

00:41:23.871 --> 00:41:24.871
One...

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:26.426
Two...

00:41:26.843 --> 00:41:27.843
Three...

00:41:28.158 --> 00:41:29.147
Four...

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:30.679
Five.

00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:31.723
Relax.

00:41:34.138 --> 00:41:35.890
Newbies!

00:41:37.032 --> 00:41:38.701
So the rumors are right.

00:41:41.024 --> 00:41:44.486
Six rats have entered this place.

00:41:46.488 --> 00:41:47.572
Let me give you a tip

00:41:48.797 --> 00:41:50.507
if someone tries to bring you down...

00:41:51.825 --> 00:41:52.825
cut their arm off.

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.078
Cause in this place...

00:41:55.962 --> 00:41:58.590
kindness is luxury

00:41:59.167 --> 00:42:02.462
and survival is currency.

00:42:03.963 --> 00:42:06.633
Sometimes even rats
eat each other to survive.

00:42:08.134 --> 00:42:09.302
So if I were you...

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.320
it's better to move alone.

00:42:13.261 --> 00:42:14.261
Hey!

00:42:14.286 --> 00:42:15.286
Don't worry about us.

00:42:15.377 --> 00:42:16.462
We're leaving this place.

00:42:18.645 --> 00:42:19.645
Leave?

00:42:21.991 --> 00:42:23.751
Do you think you can
still leave this place?

00:42:24.901 --> 00:42:25.710
Go ahead.

00:42:25.735 --> 00:42:27.821
Show me the way out when you find one.

00:42:29.602 --> 00:42:30.350
Why?

00:42:30.375 --> 00:42:31.735
You don't know the way out either?

00:42:35.304 --> 00:42:36.514
Didn't they tell you?

00:42:38.414 --> 00:42:39.999
Once you enter

00:42:40.434 --> 00:42:43.688
there's no turning back.

00:42:51.553 --> 00:42:53.221
Welcome to Hell University...

00:42:53.888 --> 00:42:54.888
newbies.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.288
I couldn't go outside from the chaos.

00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:19.747
Were you there?

00:43:21.916 --> 00:43:22.917
I wasn't.

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:25.335
Everyone got knocked out.

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.336
You didn't leave?

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:30.090
- It was almost a bloodbath.
- No. I'll go out later.

00:43:30.091 --> 00:43:32.510
Wait for me later, I'll show them.

00:43:43.313 --> 00:43:44.480
Excuse me.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:46.940
Excuse me...

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.528
Excuse me.

00:44:01.664 --> 00:44:03.291
Who are these new students?

00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:04.625
Yeah.

00:44:04.992 --> 00:44:06.410
I don't recognize them.

00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:10.340
How did they enter this place?

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.300
Good luck!

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:19.641
Do you like manga?

00:44:22.602 --> 00:44:25.438
Sorry... it's just that
you're good at drawing.

00:44:49.045 --> 00:44:50.338
Good morning, class!

00:44:51.297 --> 00:44:53.257
You thought you were safe?

00:44:55.927 --> 00:44:57.011
Good morning, class.

00:45:00.527 --> 00:45:02.237
I see we have new students here.

00:45:04.791 --> 00:45:06.501
Why don't you introduce yourselves?

00:45:13.987 --> 00:45:15.196
Zein Shion.

00:45:23.371 --> 00:45:24.622
Jerome Marquez.

00:45:25.707 --> 00:45:26.707
Promise

00:45:26.732 --> 00:45:27.732
I'll behave...

00:45:28.835 --> 00:45:30.086
for now.

00:45:34.632 --> 00:45:36.217
You think you're cute, huh?

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.386
Hey, hey, hey!

00:45:39.387 --> 00:45:40.430
Settle down!

00:45:42.334 --> 00:45:43.627
Settle down, class!

00:45:44.503 --> 00:45:47.008
May I have your attention, please.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.796
The elixir of immortality.

00:46:14.797 --> 00:46:18.217
There are many rulers
who are willing to kill

00:46:18.676 --> 00:46:22.555
to find the elixir that stops death.

00:46:23.389 --> 00:46:25.892
Like I've said, the elixir of immortality.

00:46:27.143 --> 00:46:29.145
Many have died in search for this.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:32.732
It's been ages but no one has succeeded.

00:46:32.815 --> 00:46:35.651
After a while, the myth of
the elixir has been forgotten.

00:46:36.652 --> 00:46:37.652
In the event

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:40.363
that you find

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:41.949
the elixir of immortality.

00:46:43.474 --> 00:46:44.474
What will you do with it?

00:46:51.157 --> 00:46:52.436
[woman screaming]

00:46:52.461 --> 00:46:53.669
What was that?

00:46:54.595 --> 00:46:56.172
What's happening?

00:46:57.173 --> 00:46:58.716
Don't go out!

00:47:00.134 --> 00:47:01.135
Zein, let's go!

00:47:14.607 --> 00:47:16.109
Is that Mia?

00:47:18.945 --> 00:47:21.864
Jerome, it's Mia!

00:47:42.844 --> 00:47:43.970
Who did this?

00:47:44.512 --> 00:47:46.597
The Black Blood Gang attacked again.

00:47:47.223 --> 00:47:49.225
That nail in his tongue...

00:47:49.434 --> 00:47:50.726
is their symbol.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.188
They showed up again
after the events last week.

00:47:55.481 --> 00:47:57.316
This only means one thing...

00:47:57.633 --> 00:47:59.593
another war will happen soon.

00:47:59.986 --> 00:48:01.611
And I know this war will be bloodier

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:04.866
now that they've killed Raze
Silvenia's one and only brother.

00:48:05.283 --> 00:48:06.742
Raze Silvenia?

00:48:07.702 --> 00:48:10.329
The leader of the Devil God Warrior.

00:48:12.903 --> 00:48:14.363
Devil God Warrior?

00:48:15.001 --> 00:48:16.252
Black Blood Gang?

00:48:17.005 --> 00:48:18.005
Who are they?

00:48:18.838 --> 00:48:21.549
The two most powerful gangs in this school.

00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:23.793
Stay away from them.

00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:25.803
Especially during Bloody Night.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.396
All students!

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.483
Go back to you classrooms!

00:48:40.276 --> 00:48:41.276
Now!

00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:49.664
What happened?

00:48:49.689 --> 00:48:50.703
Who is that?

00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:13.031
Do you know everything?

00:49:13.056 --> 00:49:14.307
I said...

00:49:15.084 --> 00:49:16.419
Do you know everything?

00:49:16.927 --> 00:49:18.428
If I want to know something...

00:49:19.357 --> 00:49:21.525
I'll figure it out on my own.

00:49:23.486 --> 00:49:25.048
You've got some nerve, huh?

00:49:25.196 --> 00:49:27.281
Guys, Zein is missing!

00:49:27.372 --> 00:49:28.372
Where is she?

00:49:28.612 --> 00:49:30.197
She told us to meet her here.

00:49:30.416 --> 00:49:31.821
Speaking of Bloody Night...

00:49:32.425 --> 00:49:33.552
so what's the plan?

00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:36.748
Are we going to lock
ourselves in the dorms again?

00:49:36.749 --> 00:49:38.500
For how long are we going to hide

00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:40.294
when the clock strikes 7:00 p.m?

00:49:41.587 --> 00:49:42.922
Zein, it’s 7:00 p.m.

00:49:45.508 --> 00:49:46.508
Shit!

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:51.055
There's this girl...

00:49:51.704 --> 00:49:52.996
I heard from some students.

00:49:53.021 --> 00:49:55.148
That she's hard headed and reckless.

00:49:56.072 --> 00:49:57.211
Keep an eye on her.

00:49:57.834 --> 00:49:58.834
Boo!

00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:01.799
Don't you have classes?

00:50:02.685 --> 00:50:03.876
What are you doing here?

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:08.864
Who are you?

00:50:08.889 --> 00:50:09.889
Ace Craige.

00:50:10.368 --> 00:50:13.121
The Supreme Student Government
President of Hell University.
