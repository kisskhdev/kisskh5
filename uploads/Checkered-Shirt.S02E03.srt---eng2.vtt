WEBVTT

00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:01.918
Uh

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:06.631
Minji, I told you it's not like that

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.301
No, no, seriously, it's not

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:12.512
I told you Jung-woo has a girlfriend

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.015
Yeah

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.726
No, he's my best friend

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.352
Why would he lie about something like that?

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:22.147
Jung-woo?

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.734
I heard he's doing well at the training center

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.069
Yeah

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.739
Got it

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.284
Don't talk about that rumor anymore

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.911
It's better to just let it be buried for now

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.873
Okay?

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.791
Yeah, okay

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.638
Haa... Park Jung-woo, seriously

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:13.448
Hyung, what on earth is going on?
Why can't I reach you?
Where are you... really...?
I'm worried, just contact me, please...

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.119
I finally realized it now

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.581
What I was holding onto and forgetting wasn't you, Hyung

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.459
But my...

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.128
Faith towards you, Hyung

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.144
5 Years Later

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:02.956
Excuse me...

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.584
Do you happen to have a girlfriend?

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:09.712
Ah...

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:15.885
That man

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.264
Is seeing someone

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.102
Ah... okay

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.739
Who am I seeing?

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:38.324
Me!

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.243
You're seeing me

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.995
Right here, right now

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.169
I came back from a business trip to Japan after two weeks

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.712
Give me some attention

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.088
We're going to see each other at the meeting anyway

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.631
Why bother calling me out?

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:58.011
Don't you get tired of seeing me?

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.934
You said this meeting is important

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.187
I'm busy preparing for tomorrow

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:10.148
Okay

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.608
Work excuse again?

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:14.694
But you know, right?

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.115
That I'm someone who doesn't take damage from rejection

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.451
Here we go again

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.579
Lee Han-gyul

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.456
Let's date

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.170
Seriously

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:34.964
Don't you get tired of saying that?

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:38.676
Nope, it's new every time

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:39.510
Because you

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.055
Still haven't accepted me yet

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.611
The language school dorm we lived in back in Tokyo

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.779
It's gone now

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.113
Really?

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:02.033
And the bench where you used to drink

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:04.494
And get all emotional until dawn, that's gone too

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:06.788
Everyone said

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.959
That you 100% came back after getting dumped in Korea

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.422
No, I just did that to sober up

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.176
You can't fool a ghost (Yeah, right)

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.389
Blowjob?

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.100
Well, the cocktail name is just like this

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.144
Hey, don't drink that

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:31.437
Why?

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:35.566
It's not your style

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:55.712
Ah, yes, Team Leader

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.509
Yes, of course

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:06.014
Yes, understood

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.643
I apologize

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.372
I've heard a lot about you

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:34.125
You're famous at the Incheon branch, aren't you?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.084
Not at all

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.670
Ah, here he comes

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.630
Our team's planner

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.548
Mr. Lee Han-gyul

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.939
I'm Park Jung-woo, and I'll be working on this project with you

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.403
I look forward to working with you

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:24.926
Ah, yes, Team Leader

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:28.137
Uh... I have some personal matters this time

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.099
How about assigning this project to another planner...?

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:33.893
He-hello?

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.020
Team Leader?

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.666
It's been a while

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:03.756
I didn't know you worked with our company for this long

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.843
Isn't that something I don't need to know?

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.694
I'll speak bluntly

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.946
I...

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.949
I feel uncomfortable with you, Assistant Manager Park Jung-woo

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.451
So, I would like you, Assistant Manager Park

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.578
To leave this team first

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.958
What's the reason for being uncomfortable?

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.252
You said you're a pro

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.672
Or

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:48.050
Is there any other reason you can't do it?

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.498
I missed you

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:34.222
Do you believe those words?

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.767
The look on your face right now, Assistant Manager Park

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.645
That is my reason

00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:45.191
It's not like we loved each other for a thousand years

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.527
I don't know why you're making that face

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.369
I hope I don't see you here tomorrow

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.422
I missed you too

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.675
