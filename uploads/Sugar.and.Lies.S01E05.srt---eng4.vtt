=Youth Staying in Aiye Town=

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.900
(Aiye South Street)

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.120
It feels like nothing here has changed.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.680
Grandma passed away a few years ago.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.720
Whenever I feel heavy inside,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.960
I come here to clear my head.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.360
Why not ask someone
to come with you?

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.200
Because some memories

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.720
are meant to be kept to myself.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.000
Then should I be grateful to you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.400
for sharing them with me?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.480
No need to thank me.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.280
It's just a contract.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.880
It ends when the time's up.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.080
What if I want to renew it?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.160
Then I'm in for good.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.670
B plus A.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.000
(Math)
Look.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.200
Guess what score I got.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.640
Ninety-nine points.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.880
So? Pretty impressive, right?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.280
But still,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.890
you should get a full score.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.360
Why's that?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640
Because only a fuul score

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.960
makes you the most solid winner.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.080
But what if I lose? What's the big deal?

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.160
You don't understand.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840
You can afford to lose,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.680
but I can't.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.600
Ding Daang.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.200
Ding Daang.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.960
This is...

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.040
Do you like it?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.360
Wanna give it a try?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.880
What are you trying to do?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.560
No.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.320
I don't like it.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.920
You don't like it?

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.360
Or you just want to forget the past?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.640
I don't really like these things.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.990
I don't like looking back either.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.080
So let's not bring it up.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.120
Ding Daang.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.080
How about we start fresh?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.920
Forget it then.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.200
Such a beautiful day today.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.240
Why'd you show up dressed like that?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.360
I came to work with you.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.240
If your dad sees you, we're in trouble.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.160
It's fine.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.840
He actually supports me earning money.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.880
But honestly, this outfit looks awful.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.280
Still, wearing the same thing as you

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.520
somehow makes it look nice.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.680
Delicious Tong Sui for sale.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.080
Don't miss out as you pass by.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.000
Here, miss.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.200
Delicious Tong Sui for sale.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.880
Don't miss out as you pass by.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.800
Don't miss it.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.400
Ding Daang.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.780
Do you remember this place?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.080
I remember.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.760
I used to

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.080
drink Tong Sui here
and sneak glances at you.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.480
One day, I found a chance

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.790
to start a conversation with you.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.640
I don't have a red dress.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.400
So the teacher wouldn't let me
join the contest.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.480
Miaomiao.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.520
It's not like you have to
join these contests.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.200
Let it be.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.640
But none of them dance better than me.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.440
If I get to compete,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.200
I'd totally take first place.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.480
Come on, Miaomiao.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.560
You're always reasonable.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.440
Just let it go, Miaomiao.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.400
Okay?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.760
Finish your drink
and get on with your homework.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.720
I just want a red dress.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360
Why do others get one?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.280
Why can't I get one?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.680
Hey,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.520
I've got a red dress at home.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.880
It's too small for me now.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.290
I'll bring it over for you tomorrow.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.720
Oh right,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.590
did Miaomiao come back with you?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.040
I remember her being just like you,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.640
good-looking and smart.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.600
Not yet.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.520
She's grown up now

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.320
and has changed quite a bit.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.920
Just like this place.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.880
Thank you.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.200
Try it.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.040
Does it still taste the same as before?

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.160
Some people and things can't be left behind

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.960
just because you want to.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.120
Our minds can only hold so much.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.280
Keep what's worth remembering.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.140
Let go of what's better left behind.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.840
Change what can be changed.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.800
And accept...

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.840
what cannot be changed.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.120
But life is yours to live.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.680
So why not live a life

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.540
you truly want?

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.400
What about your life?

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400
Is it what you want?

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.240
Yes.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.800
And I'm still after more.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.520
(Aming,)

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.680
(if the past really can't be revisited,)

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.920
(then maybe)

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.320
(we could still get to know each other)

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.240
(all over again as you wish.)

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.680
You're going to Mancheng for college.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.460
(Qing Bei-Sen University)
Will you come back?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.440
I'll wait for you there.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.120
When I make some money one day,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.880
I'll buy a big house in Mancheng

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.240
and bring Mom and my sister
to live with me.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.240
But my grades are terrible.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.480
I probably can't get into
a university in Mancheng.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240
Don't say that.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.920
As long as you're willing to study,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.560
I'll come back home

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.400
every summer break,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.800
working part-time and tutoring you.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.120
Really?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.440
Yes.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.040
Then...

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.520
when you go to Mancheng for college,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.720
will you get a girlfriend?

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.200
Of course not.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.280
Studies and making money

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.480
matters more.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.720
But what if another girl

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.880
insists on chasing you?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.560
Then I'll just

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.920
tell her I already have a girlfriend.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.560
In a bit,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.360
let's go check out Tianyi High School.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.920
I'm good with anything.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.000
I'll follow your lead.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.960
The two of us at Tianyi High School

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.200
must be well-known, right?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.160
One's famous for being good,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.560
and the other for being trouble.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.960
Is that Ding Daang?
The one with a major demerit record?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.080
I heard her family's loaded.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.160
Her dad got her a stepmom

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.280
and stopped caring about her.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.280
No wonder she's always causing trouble.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.000
Turns out she grew up without education.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.080
Say that again, I dare you.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.960
Did we say something we shouldn't?

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.280
He did find you a stepmother.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.040
Let's go.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.320
Back off.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.150
Come with me.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.080
Come on.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.520
Watch your language.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.480
Let me go.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.560
Top student,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.600
why help me out?

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.520
Aren't you afraid of their gossip?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.040
Not at all.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.560
Let me tell you something.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.800
I don't need your help.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.360
I'll deal with those crazy women.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.160
But are you truly happy living like this?

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.200
Listen to me.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.300
My mom passed away.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.520
And my dad couldn't care less.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.320
Do I even have the right to be happy?

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.760
I'll tutor you.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.600
Once your grades are up,
the gossip stops.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.800
Why are you helping me?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.920
Because...

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.960
you helped me once too.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.360
If you hadn't tutored me back then,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.400
I wouldn't have made it to college.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.120
Come to think of it...

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.560
If you hadn't lent me money often,

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.880
I might've dropped out of school
for work.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.880
So what now?

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.080
How about we both say thanks
to each other?

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.520
Ding Daang,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.120
thank you.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.200
Really, thank you.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
Where are you going?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.560
The beach.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.640
Do you remember who you spent

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.320
the first money you earned on?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.000
Who?

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.320
I don't remember.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.240
Where a man's money is,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.480
where his love is.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.200
I'm not after his money.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.050
Maybe,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.760
he's the one eyeing your money.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.440
A room full of parasites.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.880
After Miaomiao's breakup,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.240
she hasn't been doing great.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.040
You sure? You'll take the risk.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.840
You're more cautious than me now.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.320
The deposit's already in.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.320
