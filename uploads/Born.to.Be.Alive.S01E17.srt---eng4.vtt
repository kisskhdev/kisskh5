[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.200
[Episode 17]

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.700
It's for you to drink.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.039
I'm not Han.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.050
I'm not into it.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.200
I think you need a drink.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.490
You seem more mature now.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.360
You don't even argue with me anymore.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.900
You want to argue?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.790
It's no fun arguing with you.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.240
You never win anyway.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.420
Who could win against you?

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.120
Is it because

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.340
Shao Yunfei left?

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.970
Maybe,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.740
but not really.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:37.720
His report

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.280
got published, but so what?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.680
Besides us,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.200
hardly anyone cares.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.350
Of course it matters.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.800
Liu and Jiumei

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.780
came back

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.460
because they read his report.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.740
Every footprint

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.810
we leave here

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.630
is only visible to us.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.730
Bolamula

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.070
is an unknown world

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.710
to outsiders.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.360
Now that the report is out,

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.540
even if one more person sees it,

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:16.890
it means

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.150
we've taken another step forward.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.360
Maybe this can be

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.760
seen as a starting point.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.400
And that is enough.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.320
Shao Yunfei wrote in his report

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.829
that what our Mountain Patrol does

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.120
is essentially

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.370
one tree

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.000
shaking another tree,

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.430
one cloud

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.520
pushing another cloud,

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.020
and one soul

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.590
awakening another soul.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.880
Yet he himself wasn't awakened.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.900
Wasn't he?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.080
If he had been,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.820
he wouldn't have left.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.570
What counts as

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.579
truly leaving?

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.770
People are different.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.740
Some people think

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.950
life is too short

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.170
to stay in one place

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.020
for too long.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.750
But for us,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.170
burning out our lives

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.680
in one place

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.400
is living to the fullest.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.490
Neither is wrong.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.300
Bai Shao left.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.350
Shao Yunfei left too.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.250
In your life,

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.290
someone always has to leave.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.310
We'll all leave eventually.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.640
Alright, alright.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.370
Give it to me.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.580
Seeing you like this

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.380
reminds me of

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.570
when I was young.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.560
Back then, the County Hospital

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.159
didn't even have a building.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.070
There were just 3 tents.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.120
A female doctor

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.940
was assigned here from Nanjing.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.690
She was so beautiful.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.960
Many of our Tibetan young men

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.150
chased after her.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.410
I wonder who

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.780
she ended up marrying.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.650
Duo!

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.220
You must be drunk!

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.080
What did you call me?

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.750
You're the one who's drunk.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.770
Here's one!

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.159
Let me see!

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.550
The stem is so short.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.480
It must be thick.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.050
Be careful.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.430
How is it?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.350
The color is great.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.650
How many do we have now?

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.630
8.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.050
I don't have as many as you.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.100
I only have 5.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.520
If I could dig for Cordyceps every day,

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.480
that would be great.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.210
I wouldn't have to go to school.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.170
You and your dad

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.430
still don't talk much?

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.430
There's still no news

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.630
about your brother?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.930
You would know

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.400
if there were any news about my brother.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.280
Why ask me?

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.320
It's your fault.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.460
You had to hit a sore spot.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.880
Your Chinese has improved a lot.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.280
You have a way with words.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.850
Stop giving your dad the cold shoulder.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.480
I just don't get it.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.220
Why can't adults listen to

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.400
what kids want to say

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.020
and hear our thoughts?

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.690
They used to be

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.159
kids themselves.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.000
You don't listen

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.220
to your dad either.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.570
It's not that I don't listen.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.230
He just doesn't say anything.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.900
He always thinks
I don't understand anything.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.160
Anyway, you don't have a dad like that.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.620
You wouldn't understand.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.220
I—I'm sorry.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.700
I didn't mean it like that.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.260
When I was little,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.240
my brother and I

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.630
went to the neighboring village market.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.620
There was an opera performance.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.800
We got so absorbed in the show

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.690
that we lost track of time.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.560
It got dark.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.650
We got a good beating when we got home.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.740
My brother was crying beside me.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.500
That's when I thought

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.330
I needed to grow up fast.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.200
Once I grew up, I could go out and work.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:45.940
I'd run far enough away

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.090
so he couldn't hit me

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.910
or keep me in line again.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.270
But later I realized

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.460
having someone to keep you in line

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.790
is actually a blessing.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.390
Only people who care about you

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.990
would try to keep you in line.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.890
But by the time

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.980
I understood this,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.820
I was already grown up.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.100
What's your brother's name?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.860
Zhang Yuan.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.550
Zhang Yuan!

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.370
We will definitely find you!

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.900
Get up! Let's keep digging!

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.030
let's earn money to find your brother!

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.180
Let's go past them

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.030
and dig at the top of the slope.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.740
We're back!

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.770
-We're back!
-Ju!

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.270
You're back?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.450
Dad!

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:56.820
Captain.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:57.980
Thank you.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.580
Ju,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.320
any news about my brother?

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.660
No.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:05.730
Han.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.940
Have some water.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.320
Okay.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.000
Next time you go into the mountains,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.330
can you take me with you?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.700
You're too young.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.500
You can't go in.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.600
I've been in there before.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.620
Why won't you let me go?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.410
Yeah.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.480
Last time you went in,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.480
you almost died.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.670
Have you forgotten?

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.220
Here.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:27.120
Ju.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.000
That's enough.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.750
Can I drive?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.030
We just got back. We drove for 6 days.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.600
There's no gas left

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.720
for you to practice.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.530
We have gas.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.630
Where did you get it?

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.380
We dug Cordyceps

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.430
and herded sheep for others to earn money

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.530
and bought the gas ourselves.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.940
Yeah.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.050
Not bad.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.030
Impressive.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.980
Alright then.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.360
Don't drive too far.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.820
When you're done driving,

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.600
wash the car for me.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.530
Don't worry, Ju.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:01.960
Jiumei.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.110
Go with them later.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.500
Okay.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.410
Why is it always me?

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.500
What's wrong?

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.700
You're so lazy.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.410
This gas

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.040
should last 4 hours.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.410
I think more than that.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.390
800 kilometers

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.720
shouldn't be a problem.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.100
Captain.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.010
Here are the main events

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:27.670
from this period.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.870
I wrote them all down.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.620
Let me see.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.740
Han.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.100
Your family called to ask

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.620
how the blind date went.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.600
I'm thinking...

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.720
It didn't go well.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.110
Who asked you?

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.370
Bai Ju, what are you doing?

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.130
My coat is wet.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:45.940
I'm drying it.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:49.630
He.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.740
The usual—

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.800
Go to the county tomorrow

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.040
to settle accounts with Wangmu.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.510
Okay.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.910
She called to hurry us up.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:56.910
Twice.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:58.870
Okay.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.520
Most importantly,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.880
Shao called

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.890
a few days ago.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.820
The leaders
from the Provincial Department of Forestry

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.000
read his report
and took it very seriously.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.890
They allocated a special fund

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.290
for the Mountain Patrol—

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.840
100,000 yuan.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.000
100,000?

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.980
It'll be transferred to the county soon.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.410
Really?

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.550
We finally have money!

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.610
That's wonderful!

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.890
100,000?

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.390
If only it were 400,000.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.320
Then we could even buy

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.510
an imported Jeep.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.910
Keep dreaming.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.300
An imported Jeep?

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.200
Even if we could afford it,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.930
where would we get it repaired?

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.930
100,000 is already good enough.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.650
After paying everyone's wages,

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.860
we could even get

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.340
a second-hand Beijing Jeep. True.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.070
That's true.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.910
That's still better than the old cars

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.650
in the team

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.380
that can never keep up with the poachers.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.090
Exactly.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.590
Captain.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.240
Did Reporter Shao...

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.300
say anything else?

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.420
No, that's it.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.540
I forgot.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.530
Reporter Shao sent something

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.200
to Bai.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:20.820
Go get it!

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:23.530
How can he forget that?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.670
Silly boy.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.250
Here, Ju.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.830
What Shao wrote to Bai

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.740
is even longer than his report.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.250
These are all

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.850
Forestry Police documents.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.000
Not a single word

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.890
to Bai?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.740
Let me see.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:07.820
What are you looking for?

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.080
You can't read anyway.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:09.890
Why are you pushing me?

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:10.500
There must be something.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.430
Look carefully.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.580
Bai Ju.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:13.960
These documents

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.690
must be very important, right?

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.120
I basically covered everything

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.240
in my report.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.850
If I waited for him,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.010
it would be too late.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.010
If there's nothing else tonight,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.330
I'll go back to the county.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.790
I'll stay at home tonight.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.290
Is she upset?

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.260
I'm just going back to the bureau
to submit the report!

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.390
She has rabbit ears.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.860
You wrote this?

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.780
Yes.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.210
Look at this.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.630
What's written here

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.270
is about the same as mine.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.050
It's a bit better...

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.490
than mine.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.410
I have been in this position

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.270
for 3 years.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.910
I've been bringing this up for 3 years,

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.480
and every year it gets rejected.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.810
They never approved it.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.870
Why is that?

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.370
We both know the importance

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.150
of the Forestry Police, right?

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.210
So why do you think it is?

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.290
There's no money.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.970
Mom, I'm back.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.070
Bai Ji?

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.590
Mom, I'm back.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.270
Why didn't you lock the door

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.390
when you got out?

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.240
Chun!

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.280
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.980
Why are you back?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.670
You didn't even tell me
you were coming back.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.510
Why the surprise attack?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.410
Let me take a look at you.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.440
When did you get home?

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.650
I came in right before you.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:33.980
You guys.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.220
You didn't lock the yard door,

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.950
and you didn't clean the rooms.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.150
You're the model soldier.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.840
The first thing you did
when you got back was housework.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.980
Should I give you
a big red flower as a reward?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.710
Give it to me.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.310
Chun,

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.670
what merit did you earn this time?

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.730
What medal is this?

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.300
It's a commemorative medal.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:58.800
Commemorative medal?

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:02.790
Chun,

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.010
where are your epaulets and collar tabs?

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.690
I'm out of the military.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:19.220
Is it good, Mom?

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.700
It's delicious.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.640
It's good.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.500
You should have told us
you were coming back

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.470
so I could make dumplings for you.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.980
Your first meal back home

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.610
ended up with you cooking.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.970
And you.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.230
You came back even later than me.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.490
Mom, we got off work...

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.790
There will be plenty of chances
in the future.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.990
Dumplings are for leaving,
and noodles are for coming home.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.700
Bai Ju was just craving

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.430
the minced meat noodles I make.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.290
They are tasty,

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.700
but you're too biased, Chun.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.240
These two dishes

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.090
are both Ju's favorites.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:46.850
You didn't make
the "Three Braised Delicacies"

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:47.460
I like.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.250
I'll make it for you tomorrow.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.720
Okay.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.430
Tomorrow Bai Ji will cook.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.400
Show your cooking skills to your brother.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.730
Okay.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.670
My sister said

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.290
my cooking

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:56.500
has improved a lot,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.250
almost catching up with yours.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.070
That's enough.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.550
I was just encouraging you.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.290
Compared to our brother,

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.690
you're still far behind.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.050
Right.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:05.780
Chun.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.810
Why are you suddenly out of the military?

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:08.900
Didn't you say in your letter before

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.900
that you were going to get promoted?

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.220
Our cavalry battalion

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:12.940
has been downsized

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.810
into a company.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.290
Veterans like us

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.300
have all been demobilized.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.030
You're the last person

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.670
who should have been demobilized.

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.900
You've earned merits.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.010
Reducing its permanent positions

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.640
is part of

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.850
the military's modernization reform.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.000
It's not about individuals.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.400
I had to follow the organization's orders.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.330
You really see the bigger picture.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.280
So what's next?

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.810
Have you been assigned a work unit?

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.640
I have to wait for the notice.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.800
It won't be that fast.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.330
Should we go find Uncle Lin?

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.540
Let's keep things separate.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.350
Just because

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.950
I brought your brother

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:48.890
back from

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.320
the Tanggula Mountains,

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.460
Uncle Lin and Aunt Zhu

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.590
criticized me a lot,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.840
saying I was foolish.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.720
I think...

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.970
you could listen to his advice

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.410
about work.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.440
It's okay, Mom.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:01.980
It's not like

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.660
the local office won't assign me a job.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.270
I haven't been home

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.270
for so many years.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.220
Let me rest for a few days.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.680
Can we not talk about this?

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.400
Alright.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.790
Once your job is settled,

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.570
I'll help you out.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720
Help me with what?

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:19.850
What kind of girls

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.140
do you like?

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.500
There are a few

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.960
good ones in our hospital.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:26.680
What's your type?

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.770
What's your type?

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.810
Mom is asking you.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:29.810
Why are you asking me?

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:30.380
I'm asking you,

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.980
what kind of boys do you like?

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.740
I don't like anyone.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.670
Love

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.360
often ends in disappointment.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.250
Either you suffer

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.330
the boredom of ending up together,

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.350
or the pain

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.170
of never being together.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.000
Makes sense.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.180
What sense?

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.260
She really has a point there.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.170
Where did you learn that?

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.840
You are so pessimistic about love.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.730
From a novel.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.940
Which novel?

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.620
I forgot.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.700
Alright, stop reading those useless books.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.300
Eat up.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.710
After selling the cordyceps,
are you still buying film?

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.860
The camera is gone,

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.010
so I won't buy film.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.190
I'm buying

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.330
a Ruyi Horse Whip,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.110
just like King Gesar's

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.290
Lucky Horse Whip.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.320
Don't you already have a whip?

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.440
It's too old.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.500
Jiongxi and I

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.250
are participating in the horse race.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.070
Jiongxi can participate

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.160
in the race now?

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.350
You haven't ridden it for too long.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.940
Jiongxi runs

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.470
faster than lightning now.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.390
He even beat Sangje's champion.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.830
Alright, alright.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.760
Whatever.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.680
Did everything go well
in the mountains this time?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.890
The weather is getting warmer,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.420
so fewer people
are hunting Tibetan antelopes.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.140
More people

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.110
are panning for placer gold

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.710
and catching brine shrimps.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.090
That's a good thing.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.830
With fewer people hunting,

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.180
there are fewer guns.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.810
Have you been to

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.740
Dolma's place?

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.410
We didn't go there this time.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.820
We took the southern route—

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.850
Zhuoyuan Lake,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.040
Moon Goddess Lake,

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.210
and Pala Slope.

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:53.120
Still awake?

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:54.890
What are you doing?

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.020
Don't play too long.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.170
It wastes lamp oil.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.060
I'm going to sleep.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.330
Chun.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.940
Where are you going?

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.800
Mom told me yesterday

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.000
to make sure

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.000
you change

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:44.830
your bedding.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.090
She said if you keep putting it off,

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.590
it'll cause lice.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.360
I'm not that dirty.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.270
Where did you get this bike?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.310
From the agricultural station.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.770
I borrowed it from Suonan.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.070
It looks nice.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:00.770
Let's go.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.770
Get on.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.740
Carry this for me.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:04.410
Okay.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.450
Chun.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.550
Do you know how to ride a motorcycle?

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.220
Iron horses should be about the same

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.480
as real horses, right?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:17.900
Chun!

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.600
Slow down!

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.370
Not bad.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.270
Not too dirty.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:57.990
No lice yet.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.140
I told you.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.050
Mom's just worrying for nothing.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.700
Chun,

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:04.430
about the job,

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:05.430
what's your plan?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.770
Why don't you go to our bureau?

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.220
We can be police together.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.040
Wasn't Dad

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.050
transferred from the army to the police?

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.180
Dad was reassigned.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.330
I was demobilized.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.590
The Public Security Bureau is a good unit.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.990
I may not be able to get in.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.090
Isn't your Mountain Patrol
short of people?

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.380
How about I stay here?

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:30.940
If you come here,

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.060
I'll be happy, of course.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.280
I bet the Captain

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.450
will be happy too.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.560
But it's enough

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.820
that I jump into this fire pit alone.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.440
Let's not drag the whole family in.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.270
Fire pit?

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.440
Didn't you...

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.110
say you were satisfied working here?

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.870
I am satisfied,

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.810
but at least I still get a salary

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:53.850
from the bureau.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.670
If you work here,

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.340
even feeding yourself will be a problem.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.200
I'm afraid you won't even

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.240
be able to find a wife.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.500
You're exaggerating.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:04.960
Has that reporter from the province

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.700
gone back?

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.220
Why are you asking about him?

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.960
I mean,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:11.530
the publicity

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.460
he did for you guys—

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.450
did it help?

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.070
Hard to say.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.800
No one is counting on him.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.740
Will he come back?

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.480
I don't know.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.170
It has nothing to do with me.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.680
Officer Bai!

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:27.920
Bai Ju!

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.140
Come here!

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.220
Chun, I'm going down.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.070
What?

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.290
What?

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:45.720
Look at you all,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.090
smiling so slyly.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.630
We've decided.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.000
The future deputy captain

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.200
will be your brother.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.880
That traitor He Qingyuan—

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:58.480
let him be

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.230
County Mayor Lin's secretary.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.750
He always wants to...

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.920
Shut up!

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:04.090
Boring.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:04.660
Alright, alright.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.120
Stop it.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.790
Be serious.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:06.740
Bai.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.380
He's teasing you.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.220
But we all think

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.020
it's great your brother is here.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.240
Look, he can shoot,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.750
ride horses,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.870
and drive.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.740
It would be such a waste

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.090
if he didn't join the Mountain Patrol.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:19.780
-Am I right?
-Yes.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.710
I'm telling you,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.090
no one is allowed to tell the Captain

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.420
that my brother is back.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.160
Why?

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.570
Wouldn't it be good

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:26.250
to patrol with us?

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.440
My brother is a demobilized soldier.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.370
Why would he patrol the mountains?

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.350
The government will

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.280
assign him a job.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:37.910
Zhacuo, let's go.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.310
On my way here,

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.030
I smelled Tudan frying dough cakes.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.760
Come with me to get some. Hurry.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.640
Why don't you go yourself?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.460
Take more!

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:46.500
I always go to ask for food.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.560
He's not giving me any.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.620
You have more sway.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:49.910
Let's go, let's go.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.750
[Shao Yunfei]

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.310
Model soldier.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.330
Working again?

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.180
How's the lunch box business?

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.280
The business...

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.750
is okay.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.590
I just can't raise the price.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.720
Just breaking even.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.720
Small businesses thrive on

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.610
low margins and high turnover.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.470
That's not bad.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.970
Isn't Yan helping you?

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.330
Chun.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.790
Why did Second Sister

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.990
tell you everything?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.080
She mentioned it in a letter.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.690
So tell me about it.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.190
There's nothing much to say.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.240
She's a doctor.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.200
The boys around her

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.970
either came from big cities

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.480
or went to medical school.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.530
What am I?

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.700
To put it nicely,

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.630
I'm a small business owner.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.710
To put it bluntly,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.620
I'm just an unemployed young man.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.070
Yan said that?

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.160
Of course not.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.040
She wouldn't say that about me.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.200
All work is equally honorable.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.460
Every trade has its...

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.250
Chun, Chun.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.620
Go down and eat.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.000
I'll do this.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.720
I've got several

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.720
lunch boxes left.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.800
I'm not hungry.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.740
Let's just talk for a bit.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.280
Talk about what?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.790
Give me a pep talk?

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.170
It's always the same stuff,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.380
telling me to keep my feet on the ground,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.220
work hard,

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:06.700
and show some drive.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.350
I'd already

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.480
heard all that before I even went

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.260
to Tanggula.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.010
I hadn't even gotten

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:11.750
to Lin Daiyu's first appearance

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.520
in Dream of the Red Chamber

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.920
before I was called back.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:16.460
Chun.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.850
Times have changed.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.730
Drive alone isn't enough.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.240
You need to know

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.550
your own limits.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.070
Haven't you learned enough
from the setbacks

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.880
you've had?

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.440
Even if you could pick

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.480
any job now,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.110
what can you actually do?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.610
I want to open a restaurant.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.070
Even if

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.310
it just has 2 tables,

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.380
at least it'd be my own place.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.290
I'd be the boss.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.240
That way I'd have something to strive for.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.920
When I make money,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.050
I'll take care of Mom

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.620
and build her a nice house.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:52.620
Lin Jianshe never needs

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.310
to worry about finding a job.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.600
If I'd grown up

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.470
in his family,

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.270
I'd be doing better than him.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.800
I joined the army
and hadn't been relying on the family,

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.880
so my portion went to you and Bai Ju.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.070
You got to go to high school, right?

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.520
You chose to quit school

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.090
and didn't take the college entrance exam.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.930
Lin Jianshe,

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:15.830
no matter how bad he was,

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:16.630
got into a university

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:17.850
in the provincial capital on his own.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.450
Why compare yourself to him?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
What's the point?

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:35.750
Ever since I was a kid,

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:36.790
good things

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.510
either never

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.240
came my way,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:42.860
or gone

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.980
as soon as they did.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.890
Why am I always so unlucky?

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.170
Actually,
I was about to get promoted to officer,

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.140
but then the downsizing happened.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.700
I didn't expect it either.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:06.970
But

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.050
so what?

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.640
When trouble comes,

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.520
we just have to deal with it.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.860
I keep reminding myself

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.550
not to think I'm the most miserable

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:25.680
or unlucky person

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.450
in the world.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.670
Look at Mom.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.110
Before she was even 20,

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.090
she left Nanjing,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:34.740
her home,

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.290
and came to this poor place,

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.070
working and living in 3 tents

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.130
for 2 years.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.980
Have you ever heard her complain?

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.180
When life gets hard,

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.700
think about how people of their generation

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.830
made it through.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.590
Maybe that hurdle in your heart

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.590
won't seem so hard to cross anymore.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.240
What are you waiting for?

00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.850
Get to work.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.770
The sudden cutoff of the Manri River

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:16.290
has caused

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.980
huge trouble for our township.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.180
Our livestock numbers

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.270
had just started to rise.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.030
And now?

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.740
There's no water for them.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.470
Some have already fallen sick.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.960
Even drinking water for the herdsmen

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.290
is in very short supply.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:28.750
They have to search for water everywhere,

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.350
and conflicts have started.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.660
Some people even got physical.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.350
It was the people from your township
who started the fight.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.550
We didn't start it.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.120
We're downstream anyway.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:36.880
You guys ran out of water

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.140
and came here looking for it.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.510
What were we supposed to do?

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.830
You should go look upstream.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.900
There's no water upstream anymore!

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.140
Didn't you hear that just now?

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:43.900
Are you telling me
to go all the way to Geladandong

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.420
to find water?

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.530
That's not my problem.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.090
If there's another fight,

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:46.950
I can't handle it.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:47.550
I really can't.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.330
Alright, alright.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.160
Stop arguing.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.850
I didn't call you here

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.940
to argue,

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.810
but to figure out

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.500
why this river dried up.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.330
Normally, with the weather warming up,

00:32:58.330 --> 00:32:59.090
snowmelt from the mountains

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.530
should be increasing.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.660
So why has this river

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.880
run dry?

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.110
The cause of the drying up

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.370
hasn't been found yet.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.050
There's been a lot of talk

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.180
among the herdsmen.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.050
Some of

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.510
the older ones say

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.460
this is a warning from heaven,

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.140
a punishment

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.520
for something we did wrong.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.050
Alright.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.970
I got it.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.830
Regarding the herdsmen's beliefs

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.010
and customs,

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:22.890
we respect them.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.980
But what I want to know now

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.360
is whether you went upstream

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:26.970
to investigate

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.810
and if you found the point
where the river ran dry.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:29.570
We did.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.110
The cutoff point

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.810
is not far from Bolamula's boundary.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.240
Searching further inside

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.260
would be difficult.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.790
So you just stopped looking?

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.590
Keep looking!

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.640
County Mayor Lin,

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.350
everyone's busy trying to find water.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.480
There's no one left.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:46.810
County Mayor Lin,

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.100
our two townships

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.270
want to work together to drill a well,

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.150
but we now

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.030
have no money.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.270
We operate on a subsistence budget.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.600
Just getting by is hard enough.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.200
We really can't afford this.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.490
County Mayor Lin, our local official,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.200
could you ask the county finance office

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.730
to give us some support?

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:13.520
Do you have a...

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.650
budget?

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.739
About how much do you need?

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.280
I asked the drilling team.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.699
At least 100,000 yuan.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:41.760
Ask them

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.070
if 90,000 will do.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.770
I saw it.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.570
The application report

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.780
is right on my desk.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:48.989
Yes, yes.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.400
You don't need to explain it so...

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.400
Why is there only 10,000?

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:01.460
I'm asking you why

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.460
there is only 10,000.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.060
Because that's all there is.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.750
Reporter Shao told me

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.670
there was 100,000 yuan.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.060
That reporter has a loose tongue.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.440
I asked Li from the finance office.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.900
He said the same, 100,000.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.590
So I came here
to ask you, County Mayor Lin.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.030
Why did you

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.320
only give us 10,000?

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.610
Here.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.110
Sit.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.640
Let's talk about this.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.160
Here.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.580
Explain it clearly to me.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.380
Sit down first.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.800
I'll explain it to you.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.320
The Manri River,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.700
which flows through Quduo Township
and Gela Township,

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.430
has suddenly run dry recently.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.170
The water volume of this river

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.380
has always been stable.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.840
How did it suddenly dry up?

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.920
We don't know yet.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.460
Both people and livestock

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.190
have been seriously affected,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.670
and there have been some conflicts.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.110
Several people were injured.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.310
So the county decided

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.340
to drill a well for the two townships

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.840
to minimize the herdsmen's losses

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.970
as much as possible.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.050
But you know the county's

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.330
financial situation.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:13.590
We couldn't come up with the money

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.320
for drilling a well right away,

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.770
so we reallocated the funds meant for

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.370
the Mountain Patrol to them.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.480
For those two townships,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.800
that money

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.570
is a lifesaver.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.230
Wangjia and Pengcuo said

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.170
they would definitely thank you properly.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:28.780
Those two townships

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.090
owe you a big favor.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.410
They even said

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.500
they were going to
give your Mountain Patrol

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.070
cattle and sheep.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.960
I don't want their cattle or sheep.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.360
This isn't about favors.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.300
Funds must be used for
their specific purpose.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.010
Don't you know that?

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.280
I know, I know.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.450
But isn't this a special situation?

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.580
Even if I could wait,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.110
the herdsmen couldn't.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.830
Their cattle and sheep
couldn't wait either.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:48.390
It's true

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.440
I didn't

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.630
give you a heads-up in advance.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:51.830
Lin, I'm telling you,

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.400
even if you had given me

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.660
a heads-up about this,

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.150
I wouldn't have agreed.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.380
If you really can't accept it...

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:01.980
Here.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.440
Like I said before—

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.860
write a letter

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.870
and report me.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.500
Bring Li from finance along.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.760
He can be your witness.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:12.450
Lin,

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.000
are you playing dirty with me again?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.200
Who's playing dirty?

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.280
Who's playing dirty?

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.340
Who on earth is the one playing dirty?

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.000
Why was

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.730
Mazhi County

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.010
Economic Development Company

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.570
established in the first place?

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.950
To develop the economy!

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.070
And now?

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.230
Dalong County, our neighbor,

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.150
has made a lot of money from mining.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.900
Their county middle school

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.230
has built a new teaching building!

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.030
What about us?

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.310
Our herdsmen

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:34.390
can't even get clean drinking water.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.900
On one side are the herdsmen's
cattle and sheep.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.420
On the other

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.590
are the Tibetan antelopes of Bolamula!

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.050
Tell me,

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.680
who should this money go to?

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:42.090
Here.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.650
Take this chair.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.340
You tell me

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.880
how to handle this.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:48.810
And I'll go patrol the mountains.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.870
Let's swap places!

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.570
Pay back 2,000 to Wangmu first.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.390
Otherwise, next time,

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:31.250
she won't sell anything

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.950
to us.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.970
2,000 isn't enough.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.580
Then give her 3,000

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.200
Then pay everyone

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.390
3 months' salary.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.590
The rest

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.990
won't even cover

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.520
the gas for the next patrol.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.540
Cut the salary by 2 months.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.050
Yeah.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.840
That's fine.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.880
It won't make much difference
at this point.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.650
We haven't been paid

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.510
for a long time.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.210
Another two months won't matter.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.820
No.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.750
Pay it.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.540
Should we ask the public for donations?

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.720
That would be begging.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:14.980
What if we issue

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.450
a limited number of gold-mining permits

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.510
to the fossickers?

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.020
Charge for the permits?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.010
Isn't that supporting them

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.110
to go mining in there?

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.570
It's not supporting them.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:26.340
You can see it

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.500
as a

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:29.210
management measure.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:30.690
Although we let some people

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:31.610
go in to mine,

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.340
it also restricts those

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.420
without permits.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.130
Do you think that will stop them?

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.250
To put it simply,

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.780
they pay for permits,

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.190
and we use the money

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.690
to support the Mountain Patrol

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.340
stopping illegal mining.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.220
What's that called again?

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.010
Standardized management.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.730
Looks like you're becoming
County Mayor Lin.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.600
Comrade Duojie,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.750
don't let your personal feelings
get involved.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.250
Yes.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.820
Exactly that tone.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.730
Just like him.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.440
County Mayor Lin

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.360
is just doing his job.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.870
You know the situation

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:11.950
in the county.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.430
It's a heavy burden

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.950
for anyone to carry.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:19.860
Yeah.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.840
But placer gold is a national resource.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.070
The Mountain Patrol

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.480
doesn't have the right to issue permits.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.650
Then tell me,

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680
what should we do?

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.900
First,

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.460
I don't agree with issuing permits.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.280
That is shooting ourselves

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.300
in the foot.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.980
Once you start issuing permits,

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.380
those people

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.440
will have more loopholes to exploit.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.680
Let's hold on a bit longer.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:55.590
Now, Shao's report

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.720
has been published.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.440
Since
the Provincial Department of Forestry

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.700
allocated funds to us,

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:01.980
it shows that

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.540
they value our work.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.000
Next,

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.140
Next, when the reserve is established,

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.880
we'll get government funding.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:12.380
It will also be easier
to secure permanent positions

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.320
for the team.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.570
Then

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.350
we can hire more people.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.430
Wait until when?

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.040
At this rate,
the reserve won't even be established

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.040
before the Mountain Patrol is gone.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:26.450
You can't use the future
to guarantee the present.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:28.250
Right now, we need money.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.010
With money,

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.810
we could buy another vehicle

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.210
and recruit more people.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:34.920
That's such a huge area,

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.580
and with only 2 cars,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.910
how can we patrol it all?

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.130
Right now, not to mention recruiting,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:40.130
we can't even pay He Qingyuan

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.950
and the others' salaries.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:41.840
If in the future the Mountain Patrol

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.460
is left with just the two of us,

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.260
how are we supposed to do the job?

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.110
Even if there's only one person left,

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.390
we have to keep going.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.090
Stop talking like that.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:51.940
So lame.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.350
You don't allow anything.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.000
Maybe

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.420
you should just focus on
being Deputy County Mayor

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.550
and climb the ranks.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.410
When you become County Mayor,

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.880
it'll be your call.
