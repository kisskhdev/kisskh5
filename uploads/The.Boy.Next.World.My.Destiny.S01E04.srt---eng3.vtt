WEBVTT

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.510
Hey!

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.750
Hurry it up!

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.580
I'm working on it!

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.980
What are you guys doing?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.960
Hey, what are you looking at?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.080
What the hell is your problem?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.900
This is Fuu's car, isn't it?

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.360
You bastard...

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.710
Get lost!

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.380
What do you want?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.100
Get out of here!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
Damn it.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.850
As long as Fuu is safe,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.730
that's all that matters.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.679
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.430
Man, is it ever going to stop raining?

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.990
The car is right over there.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.230
- Thanks.
- Sure, get home safe.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.170
What's with this scratch?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.300
"The Boy Next World My Destiny"
(Episode 4)

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.050
Did you actually understand that movie?

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.850
Not at all.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
Oh, but...

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.879
that new basil cheese popcorn

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.060
was incredible, right?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.230
It tasted just like pizza.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.890
If you never get them,
why do you always come with me?

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.860
Because you're the one asking.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.080
So, how are things with Sara?

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.270
Sara?

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:36.086
What about him?

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.310
Where's this coming from?

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.650
Never mind.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.730
I get it now.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.410
Get what?

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.590
Why do you and everyone else

00:04:48.591 --> 00:04:50.240
keep asking me about him?

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.490
Because we're rooting for you.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.970
That guy

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.950
only has eyes for you.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.730
We're just happy for you.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.500
You're a great guy,

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.329
but you're way too gullible.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.730
You'll believe just about anything.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.410
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.300
No way.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.120
Isn't that exactly why he likes you?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.220
Sara's friends are pretty simple, too.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.330
Huh? You mean Taiga?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.050
Oh, it's raining.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.690
What's wrong?

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.600
It started pouring, and I was worried.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.350
You're going to get wet.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.020
It's fine.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.020
Wait, Sara...

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.680
Stop... wait a second.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.860
Put me down! Hey, let go!

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.850
You're freezing.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.140
What are you doing?

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.580
Be good and go take a shower.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.620
How am I supposed to
shower with my clothes on?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.480
It's not *this* Fuu's body
you want to see, is it?

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:49.630
Yeah, sorry.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.360
I was just worried about you.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.800
I know.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.500
You can go now.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.580
Sara.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.870
Fuu.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.460
Can I kiss you?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.340
Is it okay?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.080
You should leave.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320
I'm happy.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.360
About what?

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.360
Looks like we're on the same page.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.910
We are not.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.410
What are you even talking about?

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.580
You're always like this,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.980
teasing me every chance you get.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.960
First time?

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.310
Get out!

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.720
Just go already!

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.470
That's pretty scary.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.290
What do you actually know?

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.950
I know you've got secrets.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.500
Then again, so do I.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.790
Sara.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.390
Why did you choose the same uni as Fuu?

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.730
I'm surprised.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.250
I didn't think you were
the type to eavesdrop.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.020
How did you know?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.320
I asked, and you answered me.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.570
Right here.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.570
Are you joking?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.330
I'm not joking. It's the truth.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.860
Two years ago,

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.440
ever since the day I met Fuu,
I've been able to hear your inner voice.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.380
I won't tell a soul.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.970
Especially not Fuu.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.290
You should be the one to tell him.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.150
Is someone talking behind your back?

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.820
No way.

00:11:11.063 --> 00:11:12.983
I think I've just had a
cold since this morning.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.670
Oh, really?

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.520
- Yeah.
- You okay?

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:17.930
Yeah.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.970
You finally made your move, Fuu!

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.680
Huh?

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.030
Making out right in
front of the school gates.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.840
Word is you and the Ice Prince
are getting pretty hot and heavy.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.450
Every student here is jealous of you.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.119
Don't tell me you guys have
already gone all the way.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.630
Ouch! What was that for?

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.340
Stop asking Fuu such gross questions.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.860
Wait, a kiss? For real?

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.860
No, we weren't kissing in the street...

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.380
So you're saying
you've done it somewhere else?

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.580
Hmm?

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.300
Could you back off a bit?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.019
We're heading out.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.030
Oh, wait up!

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.750
Tell me everything! Now
I'm even more curious.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.390
- So what's the deal with you two?
- Let's go.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.060
- What's the deal?
- Bye!

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.390
Come on, tell me!

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.300
Did you eat something?

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.490
No, not yet.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.250
Are you hungry?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.080
- Yeah, I'm starving.
- Really?

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.510
- Yeah.
- You hungry?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.080
Starving.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.620
You're kind of incredible, Sara.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.620
Incredible?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.860
Top of the class,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.550
good-looking... you're
the star of the school.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.040
Are you fishing for a reward?

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.110
I'm not flattering you.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.319
Not just the Sara in this world,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.270
but the one in the other world too.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.940
If you'd met me in this world,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.990
would you still have fallen for me?

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360
Of course I would.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.510
Because you're so cute.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I am not cute.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.830
It's been a while, Master Sara.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.380
The Madam would like to see you.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.280
She wants you to join her for dinner

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.750
and hear how you've been.

00:13:23.643 --> 00:13:25.253
Don't worry about me.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.490
I can get back on my own.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.650
Get home safe.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.510
This way, please.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:25.399
(Sara: Let me know when you're home.)

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:32.900
(Sara: Is something wrong?)

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.790
The Chairwoman will be a little late.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.180
Would you like to rest in your room?

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:39.850
I'll stay here.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.320
I'm leaving as soon as I'm done eating.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:53.600
(Fuu: I'm home! Have a
nice dinner with your mom.)

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.300
That's so messy.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.850
Is that my fault?

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.090
You okay? Did you catch a cold?

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.800
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.780
Do you want to go home and rest?

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.080
But we have that group
project this afternoon.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.840
Don't worry, we'll tell the professor.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.930
Does Sara know?

00:15:16.163 --> 00:15:17.373
Did you tell him you're sick?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.750
No, he went back to his
family home yesterday.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Oh, but...

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.190
Yeah, I know.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480
I won't say anything.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.240
Alright, hurry up and
eat so you can go home.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.289
That's gross.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.980
It wasn't me.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.600
Where are you going?

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:49.710
I'm leaving.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:51.630
Please, wait.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.940
The Chairwoman has something to say to you.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.790
How much longer am I supposed to wait?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.440
I'm going back.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.020
The Chairwoman says

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.220
you've breached the contract.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.290
This is a test

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.680
to see if you'll follow orders.

00:16:16.703 --> 00:16:18.343
I think it's best if you just wait.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.080
How did you catch a cold?

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.600
Were you staying up late again?

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.050
Mom,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.150
I've been sleeping better lately.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.990
Because I have someone to say goodnight to.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.280
Oh?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.690
Since when did you have someone like that?

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.230
I'll tell you all about it
next time you're home.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.550
I really miss your tamagoyaki.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.540
Just kidding.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.609
I can make it myself now.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.260
Once I'm better, I'll
make a ton and eat my fill.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:24.890
Fuu...

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.420
I should probably get some sleep.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.300
You should get some rest too, Mom.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.040
Goodnight.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.420
My university grades are fine.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.680
I haven't done anything
to tarnish your reputation.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:08.840
And...

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.800
I'm talking about the agreement
to stay away from your father.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.770
- I never signed any such agreement.
- But you broke it, didn't you?

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.530
It's that man's influence, isn't it?

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.690
Keeping someone so beneath you around.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.080
What?

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.020
Fuu Yotsuba.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.219
That's none of your business.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.810
I'm the one who decides what's my business.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.510
Not you.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.680
Is that what he told you?

00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.076
Is that why you're talking back to me?

00:18:46.523 --> 00:18:48.093
I won't see my father again.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.540
I'm very sorry.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.950
Just do as I say.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.840
Because your life

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.760
belongs to me.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.580
Hello?

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.940
How was dinner?

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.270
What's wrong?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.430
Your voice sounds a little off.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.930
When are you coming back?

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.690
Are you feeling sick?

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.690
Oh, I'm fine. I'm great, really.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.080
Alright.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.530
I believe you.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.100
Is there anything you want?

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.170
Tamagoyaki.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.470
I'll bring some back.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.790
I'll call you later.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.590
Get some sleep.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.410
It's really not like that.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120
I know.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.070
Sara.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.530
Yeah?

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.760
Hurry back.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:58.720
I'm lonely.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:17.710
Excuse me.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.060
Master Sara has already left.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.790
I see.

00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:25.169
Is that alright?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.620
Let him enjoy his little taste of freedom.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.360
He'll be paying for it
for the rest of his life.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.510
Fuu.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.890
Fuu, I'm here.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.860
Sara.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.680
Thank goodness.

00:22:41.663 --> 00:22:42.863
I have a cold.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.800
Sorry I'm late.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:53.930
It's okay now.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.340
You've had a long day.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.460
Everything's going to be okay.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.730
That's a cheetah.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.820
Taiga senpai.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.640
Whoa! You scared the life out of me.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.070
Is this guy a ghost?

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.730
I thought I saw a ghost.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.490
I'm very much real.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:09.930
Want to touch and see?

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.130
Are you mocking me?

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.640
Stop messing with me.
