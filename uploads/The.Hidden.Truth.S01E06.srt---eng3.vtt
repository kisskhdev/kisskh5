00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.120
Run!

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.560
Come on, get down.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
What's that?

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.030
You all weren't adopted,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.720
that's why you're here.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.950
Move.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.350
It's for a performance.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.840
Just got back.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.750
Was it fun?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.990
No.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.150
Definitely not.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.350
What's wrong, Yimo?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.310
I had another nightmare.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.880
Don't be afraid.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.070
Yimo.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.680
Dad's here.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.070
Go to sleep.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.300

=Episode 6=

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.350
(Goodwood)

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.280
Sorry

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.840
about yesterday.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.120
I was drunk
and said the wrong things.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.760
I know in your heart,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.070
Yimo is your real daughter.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.790
Honestly,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.400
I envy what you two have.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.840
I want her to know

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.400
she's my real daughter.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.150
Not adopted.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.710
I just want her

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.280
to live a happy life.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.360
Yimo's a good kid.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.870
She'll understand your heart.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.840
In my life,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280
without Yimo,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.400
I'd have sunk long ago.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.800
She's the reason

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.430
I climbed out.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.750
So I only have one wish

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.400
that she's happy

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.000
and has a good future.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.310
As for me,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.240
I don't matter.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.430
You do matter.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.360
Ali,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.960
you matter a lot

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.030
to me.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.190
I hope my dad can be happy.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.120
You know

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.390
it hasn't been easy for him.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.430
Everything I do

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.510
is for his future.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.720
That's what a daughter should do.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.270
About Xiaoqian last time,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.430
I never thanked you.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.670
Here's to you.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.320
Go easy on the drinks.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.790
I'm fine.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.950
Did he give you trouble?

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.790
No.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.510
Did he scold you after?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.630
I get him.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.000
No. I don't.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.630
Since I came back,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.240
my dad has

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.070
been acting strange.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.560
Always making excuses to leave,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.270
then disappearing.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.310
The restaurant's not that busy, right?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.000
When I got there,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.360
he chased me away.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.390
I asked him,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.870
and he said nothing.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.880
Qiang,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.360
do you know what's going on?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.640
Yeah.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.270
If I don't know,

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.480
how could you?

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.560
I just hope

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.510
it's nothing bad.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.800
If something happens to him,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.360
what would I do?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.240
Don't. You've had too much.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.360
Easy.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.320
I'm fine.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.070
Qiang, I'm fine.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.270
Yimo, you're drunk.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.040
Listen to me.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.890
Drink no more.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.800
I'm fine.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.640
Really.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.720
Don't drink anymore, Yimo.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.870
You've had too much.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.110
Qiang.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.470
Qiang.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.950
You've been with my dad so long.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.360
I'm begging you.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.480
Please watch over him.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.160
Don't let him do anything stupid

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.800
or dangerous.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.320
Okay?

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.750
Dirty work's all on us.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.680
We don't even know where we're going.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.240
Covered up like this.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.840
What's he pretending for?

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.320
I don't know

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.600
if the pork's gone bad

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.200
or the beef's rotten.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.390
These people don't know

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.030
how to spend money.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.630
Qiang,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.440
ease up.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.120
Let's finish and get out.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.320
Finish what?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.750
Get out?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.710
Zhang Ming.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.080
Look at me.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.960
Get out?

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.710
Seriously?

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.910
Is that gonna cure your mom?

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.000
Gonna pull us out

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.240
of this hellhole?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.870
Stop talking.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.240
Hurry up!

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.680
Qiang,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.960
you're drunk.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.870
Shut up and work.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.150
Fine. I'll work.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.320
To hell with this!

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.440
Eat?

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.910
Go eat dirt!

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.000
What are you doing?

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.270
Stay still and don't move.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.480
Leave me alone.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.840
Get him!

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.710
Qiang!

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.580
(Welcome to Hongyun Restaurant)

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.840
Ali.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.990
What happened?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.600
We didn't even leave yet,

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.480
and he started drinking,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.390
then caused trouble there.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.270
I tried to stop him, but I couldn't.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.790
What did they say?

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.390
Didn't give us trouble.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.390
Just said you'd know what to do.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.000
Take him to the hospital.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.120
Don't let this get worse.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.440
Be careful.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.630
Okay.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.590
Hello?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.960
Master.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.390
We can now confirm

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.200
(Hongyun Restaurant)
Zhang Ming had direct contact

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.390
(Related item: sausage)
with the two dog thieves.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.120
We also found food containers

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.510
and Hongyun napkins at Liu Yan's.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.750
From what we know,

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.840
Liu Yan rarely ate out.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.320
I think we should shift focus

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.150
(Hongyun Restaurant)
to Zhang Ming and Hongyun Restaurant.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.080
The teahouse is suspicious too.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.600
The dog shelter bought large quantities

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.350
of the same sausage used in Liu Yan's case.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.960
Li Xu is the hidden boss

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.670
behind both the shelter and the teahouse.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.000
He can't be ruled out.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.120
Captain Zhao, we've verified Wang Yimo.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.120
Wang Yimo

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.440
is Hongyun owner's daughter.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.790
She's been to the shelter.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.910
She also connects Xiaoqian and the casino.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120
We can start with her.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.870
Master.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.240
She's Huahua.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.630
I don't know the details

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.550
(Hongyun Restaurant)
of the childhood trauma

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.440
that cost her memory,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.510
but I'm certain

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.030
she's a victim.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.480
If she were at fault,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.550
why come to me at all?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.200
She'd be trying to avoid me, right?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.390
I told you to keep an eye on her.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.320
Get information if you can.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.910
I never said arrest her.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.240
Come on. Keep up.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.480
Be good when you get there.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.120
I'll get you some reward.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.000
- Okay.
- Sit in the back.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.510
Huahua, get in.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.200
This has always been a knot for me.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.080
You know

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.320
I feel I owe her.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.840
I don't want to hurt her again.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.240
We've got plenty of ways

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.200
to work a case.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.240
You've got tons of tricks.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.480
We don't have to use her.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.440
You're crossing a line, kid.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.080
This is an investigation,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.670
not a game.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.790
If this really ties

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.480
to Hongyun,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.510
the sooner we know,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.720
the safer she is.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.110
Let me ask you.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.440
If she's really Huahua,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.150
really a Nude Banquet victim,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.720
how did she become Wang Li's daughter?

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.240
Have you thought about that?

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.440
About the banquet...

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.780
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.480
My people trashed your kitchen

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.110
and caused you real losses.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.320
I'm sorry.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.160
I'm here to apologize.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.390
Mr. Wang,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.310
you didn't handle this right.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.920
Forget the losses.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.920
Even meeting like this breaks rules.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.400
Mr. Li,

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.040
I've heard

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.790
that you're a straight shooter.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.920
Meeting you today,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.960
the reputation fits.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.270
Looks like we're cut

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400
from the same cloth.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.550
So let's be direct.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.840
Mr. Li,

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.680
don't get played

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.790
without knowing it.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:06.870
Mr. Wang,

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.550
I don't like beating around the bush.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.800
What's more,

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.070
I hate being lied to.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.030
Say it straight.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.160
Then I will.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.630
Bai

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.880
is a fraud.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.270
He hasn't been in Qingcheng long.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.350
No way he had that kind of capital.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160
No way

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.270
he made you that much money.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.030
It all came from me.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.870
You know?

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.110
One more thing.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.110
Do you know he's tied

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.630
to a murder?

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.200
I've been in Qingcheng forever.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.920
I know everyone and

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.270
everything here.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.400
So, Mr. Li,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.720
if you want stability, you work with me.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.160
Today, we don't talk anything else.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.480
Just your casino.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.640
I know it's currently set up

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.110
in an old grain warehouse.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.920
I want to move it

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.350
from the warehouse

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.480
into Hongyun Restaurant.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.280
Look,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.350
big names come here.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.240
We spruce it up.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.510
Great location,

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:24.960
lots of traffic.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.200
No suspicion.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.440
Why should I trust you?

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.960
Your business is solid.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.950
Giving it up?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.750
I'll take ten percent.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.880
We're both victims.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.160
We have to take back

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.440
what's ours

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.430
from Bai.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.720
Mr. Wang,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.070
what I hate most

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.200
is being lied to.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.270
I agree

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.000
to your proposal.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.720
I'll move my operation here.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.560
But,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.720
one condition.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.310
My business,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.200
you stay out of it.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.520
Deal.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:30.260
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.510
Old classmate, you've outdone yourself.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.640
If you were done,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.190
you should've said so earlier.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.240
I wouldn't have minded.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.070
Now it's holding things up

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.400
and getting messy,

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.030
it doesn't look good for you.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.830
It's just a kitchen.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.000
So what if it's wrecked?

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.430
I can pay.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.080
Old friend,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.790
there's new business now.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:05.830
Why not bring

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.880
your old classmate along?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.310
You've built quite a business now.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.720
I did play a small part in it, didn't I?

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.830
People should know when to be satisfied.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.550
I serve you ten dishes.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.000
Can you finish them?

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.440
When you had the chance before,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.350
you didn't act like this.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.190
And

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.830
how do you know

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.510
I can't handle it?

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.440
I'm already a dead man.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.270
What's there to be afraid of?

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.950
Bai,

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.590
this isn't the old days.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.110
Your luck

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.270
won't strike twice.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.520
Dude,

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.480
you're too tense.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.960
Second chances

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.590
aren't up to you.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.240
Relax.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.070
I'm not gonna eat you.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.070
After all these years,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.110
you haven't changed much.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.800
Mr. Bai,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.720
this really was an accident.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.440
Qiang drank too much.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.440
Had nothing to do with me.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.440
Mr. Bai.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.350
I know.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.400
I get it.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.830
But with all this noise,

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:47.670
it's hard

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.200
to smooth over.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.350
Mr. Bai,

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.000
just let me go.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.680
I'll do whatever you say.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.550
Really.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.390
I swear.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.910
Mr. Bai.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:00.830
Zhang Ming,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.510
you saved my life

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.920
back then.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.360
Why would I make things hard for you?

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.880
I came back for Wang Li.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.310
This isn't about you.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.480
Go home.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.510
I'll handle this.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.110
If anything comes up,

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.510
call me.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.830
Thanks, Mr. Bai.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.280
Zhang Ming.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.310
If I ever need you,

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.310
be sure to help me.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.480
Don't tell anyone

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.590
that we met.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.020
(Dalong)

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.590
Hello?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.360
No.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.320
Don't come over.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.110
Pick a place.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.240
I'll come to you.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.590
Bro.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.030
That building deal we talked about?

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.960
I think it's gonna work.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.240
Which one do we buy first?

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:24.960
Good question.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720
Come with me.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.160
Check out how tall it is.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.670
Ming?

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.160
Enjoy.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.000
Thanks.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.110
Small shops make the best noodles.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.400
Why aren't you eating?

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.920
That's because

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.070
you didn't order for him.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.480
Didn't you order for yourself?

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.830
I'm not hungry.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.550
Now it's awkward.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.750
Order something.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.630
Waitress.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.030
- Stop yelling.
- Waitress.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.960
I'm not eating.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.680
Get to the point. What is it?

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.640
Show it to Ming.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.590
Show it.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.390
Come on.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.310
Pig liver noodles, bro.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.640
Grab chopsticks, we'll share.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.310
What pig liver noodles?

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.960
The business plan.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.790
I told you to keep it in your pocket.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.630
How did you...

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.680
Got it, bro.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.460
(Dalong and Xiaohu's Business Plan)

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.840
Take a look.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.540
(The Scam-Busters Business Plan)

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.160
Do you get it or not?

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.400
What's this?

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.400
Live streams and short videos.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.240
I can't do this.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.240
You just don't get trends.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.790
What's a trend?

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.110
A trend means

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.350
even a pig can fly if it catches the wind.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.640
We're not flying

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.160
because we don't have you yet.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.520
Once you're in,

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.830
we'll go big together.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.160
I get what you want.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.680
But the restaurant isn't mine.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.750
Talking to me won't help.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.750
You may not be the boss,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.720
but you're management.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.310
Say a word to your boss.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.510
Wouldn't he give you face?

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.960
You wouldn't understand.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.960
Our boss is barely

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.640
keeping afloat himself.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.310
Your boss is drowning?

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.590
The restaurant's not so great.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.110
Not as good as the two of us.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.070
Just being honest here.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.000
Just say it. What do you want?

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.240
Spit it out.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.110
With our skills,

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.830
we aren't useless to you, right?

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.520
This thing here

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.110
has nothing to do with you two.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.190
Stop asking.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.400
Guess you still don't know our power.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.480
Listen up.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.200
Don't get cocky.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.240
That live-stream stuff

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.680
isn't real business.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.230
The things you had us do before,

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.350
weren't real work either.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.290
Especially the old lady.

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.400
That really scared us.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.200
Is that something you say out loud?

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.550
No brain at all.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.680
You act like a total pig.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.070
And still think pigs can fly.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.590
Relax, Ming.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:32.400
Let us think it over.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.480
You think it over, too.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.400
After all, this has to be run

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.240
on a big scale.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.520
It takes some time.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.760
Bro, we gotta go now.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.510
What's wrong?

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.200
I left my wallet at the bathhouse.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.310
My girl's photo's in there.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.510
Let's go. Hurry.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.510
Well,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.480
think it over, Ming.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.350
Come on.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.590
Later, Ming. Bye.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.200
How did you even forget your wallet?

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.960
Sorry, you haven't paid yet.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.400
Those two are getting out of control.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.400
I need to cut ties.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.400
If things go wrong, we'll get dragged in.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.950
Officer Tang.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.590
Master.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.440
From Zhang Ming meeting the brothers...

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.910
Easy.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.110
I'm sure

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.160
he's the one pulling the strings.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.440
That explains

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.440
how two idiots

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.240
pulled off multiple dog thefts.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.400
Someone was behind it.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.110
And Zhang Ming called someone

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.070
for instructions.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.400
There's someone above him.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.160
He's the accountant at Hongyun.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.750
If he's being directed,

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:19.880
his boss Wang Li

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.310
can't be clean.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.160
Out of nowhere,
Wang Li became Huahua's father.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.400
What exactly happened?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.240
It's pretty suspicious.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.950
But Wang Li

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.030
isn't the only suspect.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.920
There could be others behind it.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.550
Why targeted Liu Yan?

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.480
Liu Yan

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.270
plus Bai's death...

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.270
That leaves either the attackers,

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.790
or the victims

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.750
whose fate is still unknown.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.720
Master.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.590
Could the one

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.240
behind Zhang Ming...

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.580
(A mysterious figure?)

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.000
We can't rule either out.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.550
But right now,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.790
(Hongyun Restaurant)
Wang Li is easier to reach.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.110
Got it.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.720
I'll meet Wang Yimo again

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.200
and try to get as much as I can

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.960
without spooking them.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.420
Hi, Tang.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.440
Sit. I ordered you a drink.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.640
Thanks.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640
You're not busy, right?

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.200
Was afraid I'd interrupt work.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.080
Not busy.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:11.000
I don't really have a job right now.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.160
My dad doesn't want me at the restaurant.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.200
I failed

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.830
helping my friend's shop too.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.440
So I'm basically unemployed.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440
On-call anytime.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.920
Don't say that.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.920
Why doesn't your dad

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.790
let you work at the restaurant?

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.240
He thinks I worked too hard for school.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.350
Got into a good college.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.920
Shouldn't be carrying plates.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.000
Nothing much, really.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.680
He doesn't bring me along

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.640
when he meets people.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.510
He wants me to find a proper job.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.070
Says he's worried I'd be tired.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.110
But working is tiring too.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.030
He doesn't get that.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.000
He means well.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.070
Has he met anyone unusual lately?

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.310
Anything different you've noticed?

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.720
Tang,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.270
did something happen?

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.590
Is this about my dad?

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.310
He didn't do anything.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.000
I...

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.070
This is just cop instinct.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:14.580
It's fine.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.440
Anyway, I know my dad's clean.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440
I trust him.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.590
The only odd thing.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.960
He promised

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.400
to go to Xinjing with me,

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.030
then suddenly said he couldn't.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.030
As for why,

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.880
I'm in the dark.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.880
I did see a man at the restaurant.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.680
Something felt off.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.270
He even said hi.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.720
Never saw him again.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.350
What did he look like?

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.190
Can you describe him?

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.400
Pretty ordinary.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.920
Just felt wrong.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.550
How did the staff react to him?

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.550
Not sure.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.750
He was leaving when I arrived.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.390
I see.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:12.960
You just graduated.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:14.230
Haven't seen much yet.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.230
Actually, public safety's good

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.280
these days.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.280
Quite safe overall.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.320
But still, stay alert.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.670
Keep yourself safe.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.280
That's why I call you
whenever something happens.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.280
Sorry about that.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.000
You did the right thing.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.760
Yimo,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.440
do you still remember

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.360
how your were adopted?

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.150
Not really.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.920
I always thought I was his real child.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.960
I heard

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.960
I was adopted,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.840
but my dad said it wasn't true.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.590
Besides, my dad really loved me.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.000
Growing up,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.590
nothing mattered more than me.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.550
Try to think harder.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.150
What happened before you lost your memory?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.190
Even tiny fragments would help.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.510
Like the welfare home.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.870
The kitchen.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.550
Next.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.920
The table.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.230
You're so skinny.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.710
I need some air.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.670
Sorry, Yimo.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.510
That was out of line.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.320
I didn't mean to bring this up.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.280
What happened to Huahua

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.590
has been stuck

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.670
in my throat for years.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.920
I keep thinking

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.230
if I'd been braver as a kid,

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:57.800
maybe things would be different now.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.600
Tang,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.400
did something happen to my dad?

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.630
He's a good man.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.710
He's never done anything bad.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.230
He loves me.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.840
I can't lose him.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.110
If you're checking him,

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.630
please make sure you get it right.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.120
I can't even imagine

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.800
him doing something wrong.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.550
Don't be afraid.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.640
Right now

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.360
it's just Zhang Ming

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.070
might be tied to the case.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.320
That's all I can say.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.320
If your dad were really a problem,

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.590
I wouldn't have brought you here today.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.870
Right?

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:03.550
Really?

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.990
Trust me.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.240
Get back.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.800
There's a market over there.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.800
Wanna take a look?

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.640
Let's go.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:35.260
(Starlight Camping Fair)

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.000
You can give it a squeeze.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.680
Tang,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.070
I wanna get you something.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.480
You've helped me so much.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.470
Here. It's for you.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.880
This doesn't count
as bribing a cop, right?

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.400
You said

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.920
you felt guilty.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.630
Then you buy me a gift too.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.070
We're even.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.670
Okay. Then…

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.510
This is for you.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.160
Thank you.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.720
Li,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.960
you said you're moving

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.590
and quitting the dog shelter too.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.510
That puts me in a tough spot.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.480
Mr. Bai,

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.960
you know,

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.110
in this world,

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.670
money's the only thing that's real.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.590
I'm doing this

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.190
for our long-term plan.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.440
If we keep playing small,

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.280
well,

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.030
when do we ever get big?

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:11.070
Right?

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.230
You know how hard

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.590
I got hit last time.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.150
If I don't fix this,

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.670
my men out there

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.030
are gonna go hungry.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.280
Yeah.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.110
We've worked together a while.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.000
You know what I'm capable of.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.480
Play it by ear.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.430
No problem.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.280
But sometimes an opportunity

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.550
can be a trap.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.550
Keep your eyes open.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.440
The way you put it

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.360
is interesting, Bai.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.960
You're my opportunity, aren't you?

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.630
Are you my trap?

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.880
I'm kidding.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.840
Look, I've thought it through.

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.760
Our old route

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.360
still works.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.230
But now there's a new model.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.000
You keep doing what you do.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.320
I'll give you a safer place to operate

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.590
and solid cover.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.550
It's a win-win. Why wouldn't we go for it?

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.400
Also,

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.670
I know you and Wang Li

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.230
don't get along.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.680
Right?

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.800
I'm with you. Always.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.760
I see.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:58.920
If you've got a plan,

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.590
we'll do it your way.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.920
That's the spirit.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.670
We're partners after all,

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.800
trust is everything, right?

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.070
But speaking of that,

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.320
about my last loss,

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.280
when can we settle that?

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:19.510
You know last time,

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.710
I pissed off some big shots.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.000
Greasing palms

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.230
cost me a fortune.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.880
That's not even the worst part.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.320
It makes everything harder going forward.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.470
Don't worry.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.840
If I say I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.400
And I'll even get you

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.870
a surprise.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.880
Man,

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.960
Bai, you've got real pull.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.480
I can't live without you.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.230
By the way,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.110
about that overseas investment,

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.230
I wanna pause it.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.070
Can you pull my money out?

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.760
I need it.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.280

Li Xu's moving everything

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:45.510
into Hongyun Restaurant.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.320
I'm hanging out with Wang Yimo.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:48.590
I asked her about it.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.360
She doesn't know the details, Master.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:51.510
She doesn't know?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.510
Her dad runs the place.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:54.440
How would he not know?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.840
Also,

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.280
I just saw the two dog thieves

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.840
live-streaming on Shopping Street.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:01.070
You're near,

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.280
so get over there quick.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.230
Watch Wang Yimo's reaction.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.800
See if they

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:06.800
know each other.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:08.550
Listen.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.070
You're working a case.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:11.840
Use your head.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.600
Hey,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.590
you're shorting the weight.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.630
That's cheating.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.960
Watch your mouth.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.550
I'm a small business.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:25.800
Can't take your crap.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800
Cut it out. Move.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.400
Who's talking nonsense?

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.360
I bought one kilo.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.480
You gave me this tiny bag.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.360
How's that right?

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:34.670
Bag size has nothing to do

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:35.840
with weight.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.670
I'm not selling cotton.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:38.840
Pears are heavy.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.680
Heavy?

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.760
Did you just say they're heavy?

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.960
So you admit

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.360
you pressed the scale, right?

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.510
You're twisting my words.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:48.960
That's not what it means.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.070
Buy it or leave.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.760
What do you mean by that?

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.620
(Dalong and Xiaohu)
What do you mean?

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:54.960
Forced sales now?

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:57.840
Everyone, look!

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.230
I'm shopping

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.030
and I run into a shady vendor.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.070
(Dalong and Xiaohu)
Now he's getting physical

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.000
and forcing sales.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.840
Stop pushing me.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.030
It's consumer justice, okay?

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.230
Look, everyone.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:11.280
Miss, come here.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.440
Don't pull me.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.760
That's your boyfriend?

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.710
You two look great.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:16.150
Help me judge this.

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:17.480
Look.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.960
A sweet couple

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.960
go out shopping

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.110
and get tricked by vendors like you.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.230
They'll go home and fight.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.480
Fight, they break up.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:25.510
Break up, no marriage.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:26.920
No marriage, no kids.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.800
No kids

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.070
doesn't fit the policy goals.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.030
You're basically against social progress.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:33.030
What proof do you have

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:34.550
he's shorting weight?

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:35.960
I've been watching.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.800
You two are the ones causing trouble.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:40.000
I see.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.190
Partners, huh?

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.360
Black-hearted, aren't you?

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.550
You psycho. Move.

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:48.550
That's ridiculous.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.360
Hands on me again, huh?

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.630
Hit me again.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.720
You think

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.670
I'll let you...

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.880
(Police)
I didn't hit him.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.400
Officer, why are you arresting me?

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.920
Everyone saw it.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.710
I didn't throw the first punch!

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:17.710
- You have to be fair.
- I didn't do it.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:18.760
Everyone saw it.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.440
Tang, I saw it.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.110
The vendor hit first.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.240
You okay?

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.280
I'm fine.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.150
I'm taking them in

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.150
to ask something else.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.030
I'm going.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.920
- Okay.
- Bye.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.870
Bye.

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.870
Drive.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.510
(Serve the People - Mao Zedong)

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.710
Officer, we'll come clean.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.440
Today was our fault.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.230
But it's for the data.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.000
We just wanted some hype.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.760
Nothing more than that.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:08.230
You seem pretty pleased.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.230
No, not at all.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.280
Just answer what you're asked.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.960
Stop rambling so much.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.840
Dog theft and poisoned bait.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.510
You've got the whole city freaked out.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:21.920
Talk.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.400
How much were you involved?

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:25.800
Dogs…

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.760
Yeah,

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.590
we did steal a few.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:30.600
But...

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.550
But poisoning? No way.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.800
That anesthetic dose,

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:35.950
it'd knock a small dog out

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.030
for like three to five minutes.

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:40.280
We stole a few before.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:41.550
We're done now.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.280
We're doing new media now.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.320
Then where were you two

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.630
from Sept 3rd to Sept 9th?

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.710
Sept 3rd…

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.880
I... I...

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.440
I don't track dates.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.510
I was with my brother.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:56.480
We're always together.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.000
We just wander.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:00.550
Anywhere.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:01.920
Did you go to Huacai Community?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.480
What?

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.070
Huacai Community.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.630
That area.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.280
Yeah, we went there.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.800
But officer, I swear,

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.150
we were just walking around.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.000
Didn't do anything.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:16.710
You got someone above you?

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.190
Someone directing you?

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.760
Zhang Ming?

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.760
He's like our big bro.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.070
We were gonna do something big,

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:26.800
but his boss said no,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.150
so he backed off.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.550
He's got a boss too?

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.230
Yeah. Sometimes he asks us

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.440
to snatch a dog or something.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.630
We always follow the orders.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.000
But we've never met him.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.840
Never saw his face.

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:39.400
This isn't a huge crime, right?

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:41.960
Their movements match,

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:43.960
but no purchase record or prints.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.880
Zhang Ming contacts them directly,

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:46.800
but they say

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.360
there's a boss above him.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.280
They're this loud.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.630
Who's behind them?

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.070
We've caught a lot of dog thieves lately.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.070
These two are the closest fit.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.840
What's up, Master?

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480
These two punks…

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.240
Look at this.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:07.480
This doesn't show a face.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:08.840
We can't confirm.

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.320
It's him. No doubt.

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:16.370
Get the whole team on this.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.440
Grab all shelter footage

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.190
for that window and a two-day buffer.

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.190
Cross-check it all.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.030
I want this guy found.
