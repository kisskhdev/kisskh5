WEBVTT

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.840
I dropped my car key into this pond.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.040
I guess you need to take responsibility.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.440
This is my personal contact.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.600
Would it be alright if I contact you romantically?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.680
Be my guest.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.000
Will you marry me?

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.760
Yes, I will.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.600
Crap!

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.240
Hey.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.840
You need to take your shirt off.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.040
You don’t want to get sick, do you?

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.640
When did you know
you wanted to marry Tim?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.640
I just know I want to be with him every day.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.720
Will you marry me?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.360
JEERAMONGKOLTHANUN

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.440
Ten billion?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.240
PLAY WITH HIS FEELINGS,
NOT YOUR OWN.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.240
DO NOT THINK PAI IS CUTE!

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.600
DO NOT FALL FOR THE TARGET
AT ALL COSTS!

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.920
Why should you hold back?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.280
We’re going to be married soon.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.400
To hell with it, then.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.360
Do not fall for your target.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.000
Hello?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.040
Oom?

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.080
Are you free tomorrow?

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240
I have a job for you.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.360
Alright.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.280
I’m here to officially ask for
Pai’s hand in marriage to Tim.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.160
It’s a pleasure.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.480
We have all seen how consistent Tim is.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.560
We have no objection at all.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.080
That’s right.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.480
Isn’t that right, honey?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.440
Thank you, Grandpa, and also
Papa and Mama.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.280
I am so grateful to hear that,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.280
especially after listening to Tim
bragging about Pai all the time.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.160
When they started dating,
Tim called me every day

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.480
asking about how his father used to
woo me when we were falling in love.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.880
He thought he’d use the same trick, I believe.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.800
Really?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.840
Maybe a little.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.160
Let me get some for you.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.520
Here, Mom.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.840
Thanks, love.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.360
But you don’t have to worry about me.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.800
You should take care of Pai.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.080
Excuse me. Can we have a fork?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.480
Auntie, Da Zhan is a grownup now.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.280
Why don’t you let him try using chopsticks
so he can finally use them?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.120
Oh, don’t you berate your cousin when
you have a boyfriend who does it for you.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.880
I’ll get some food for him.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.960
What do you want, Da Zhan?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.080
Har gow, please.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.480
Okay.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.240
Uh…

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.760
There you go.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.880
Thank you.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.560
Maybe I can teach you
how to use chopsticks later?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.600
Nah.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.800
No?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.920
Here.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.360
You’re giving me both fish collars?

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.280
Let me share one with you.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.200
Thank you.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
I’ll give you two more next time.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.800
I’m really sorry I can’t go with you today.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.640
Oh, it’s alright, love.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.040
You should spend time with your family.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.400
I’m already so happy today.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.760
I am overjoyed.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.320
I’ll be smiling all the way back to London.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.240
If Tim is ever bothersome,
you have to let me know, love.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.280
Of course.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.040
You’re going to be in trouble.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.440
Mom.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.720
Don’t you think it’s too soon to love Pai
more than your own child?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.680
What’s not to love about him, am I right?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680
Safe travel, Mom.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.040
Of course.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.360
I have to go for now.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400
I’ll see you later.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.320
Are you sure you’re alright?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.720
Umm.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.520
Everyone seems like
they’re in a good mood today.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.440
I don’t think there’ll be any cause
for headaches.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.320
Call me if something happens.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.040
Do not bottle it up all alone, you hear me?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.120
Just go.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.040
Your mother is waiting.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.320
Bye, then.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.920
Tim!

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.320
It’s too bad.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.960
If I wasn’t playing a rich lady today,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.320
I would have asked them to pack up
some of that mushroom soup for me.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.160
Good job today, Mama.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.160
And to think that was all unrehearsed.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.560
As expected of
the number one in the industry.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.680
Of course.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.440
In this line of work,
you need to be ready to take on any role.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.400
You do remember
what you said to them, though?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.560
You’ll meet them again
at the wedding, you know?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.720
Oh, I’m sure rich people don’t pay
any mind to every single small detail.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.560
Aunt Kia remembers everything.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.640
But that Pai kid is adorable, though.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.640
And I notice that Mr. Soepohn
smiles with his eyes when he talks to you.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.200
He seems to really adore you.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.400
Of course, he does.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.560
That’s the point of this whole scam.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.760
Honestly, though.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.360
Why don’t you just fall in love properly
and spend your life with him?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.680
I’d be insane to do that.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.960
If this whole thing ever came out,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.920
people like them would
totally have me ruined.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.720
It’s a shame, you know.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.880
You two have chemistry.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.720
Here is your paycheck.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.800
Fabulous.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.520
Thanks.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.640
- Bye.
- I’m off.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.200
How is North doing?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.200
Did he start working at the office?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.520
I’m still trying to coax him into it.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.840
You know how stubborn he is, Grandpa.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.560
Pai.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.920
North is a poor kid.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.480
I would never die happy
if I didn’t see him get his life together.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.320
He’s one of us, Pai.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.600
We can’t simply abandon him.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.400
Of course, Grandpa.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:15.960
Goodnight.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.840
(Hi, baby.)

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.160
Did you leave the airport?

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.280
(I’m still at the airport, actually.)

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.280
(Do you need me to pick you up?)

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.040
(I can leave right away.)

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.480
It’s alright.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.840
You should spend time with your mother.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.800
I’ll have a chauffeur drive me home.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.760
Alright.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.560
I’ll see you when I’m done here.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.240
Bye.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.080
You lie with a more straight face
than a lawyer like me, dude.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.080
I mean, I’d make a good lawyer.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.680
I could defend some criminals and steal your job.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.360
Nope.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.480
I won’t allow it.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.520
If you stole my job,
how the hell would I feed myself?

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.200
On shaved ice, apparently.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.360
And it’s good, too.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.360
But why don’t you hurry home
and keep up the scores with Pai?

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.240
Listen, dude.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.960
I know when Pai needs me,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.120
but I won’t let him get his way every time.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.400
This will keep him wanting me more and more,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.600
and doesn’t take me for granted.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.440
Sounds cool.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.280
But that’s a useless tactic for a lawyer.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.960
Use your brain sometimes.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.600
Hey.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.120
It’s late.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.400
I have to meet Airy tomorrow.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.040
Sure.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.280
But do think of Attorney Prem here
when your scheme falls apart.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.440
Don’t jinx me like that.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.200
You want me to tip the shaved ice
over your pants, dude?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.280
Don’t waste food like that!

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.160
Gotta go.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.200
- See ya.
- Good luck.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.760
Hello, sir.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.560
Same table?

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.400
Yes.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.440
Welcome.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.680
Hong.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.440
Airy, hello.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.360
Sit down.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.880
Hi there.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.720
Oh, Hong.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.160
Yes?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.360
You’re sitting so far away from me.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.880
It’s like you don’t even miss me.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.720
I just want to make sure you’re comfortable
in your seat, of course.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.960
Shall we try something new or
should I order your favorite dish?

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800
I want to try something new…

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.640
Oh?

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.640
Like you, Hong.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.040
Not only are you beautiful,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.160
but also funny.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.040
Of course.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.000
I spent a hundred thousand on you, I don’t
intend to just hold hands, you know?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.600
Airy, but you said I’m not like
your other sugar babies?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.480
You have to win me over first, remember?

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.360
Aren’t you a charmer?

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.160
I love it.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.080
Right.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.880
What would you like?

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.560
IN LOSSES

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.160
He did not make one bit of profit since day one?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.840
How come the place didn’t go out of business already?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.000
I was told Mr. North tided it over out of his own pocket.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.440
So much for ‘learning business by himself.’

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.360
If it went on like this, he wouldn’t learn
anything even in 10 years.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.480
Unreachable yet again.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.560
Bring him here right away, Nana.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.560
Of course, sir.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.640
You’re still busy?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.640
I’ll wait outside.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.440
You can stay, Tim.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.440
We’ll only be a minute.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.640
Just confess.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.200
You know you can’t hide it from me.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.560
Y–You…

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.720
You know?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.000
Nana told me everything.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.080
It was my fault for not telling you
before I went ahead with it.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.880
But…

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.680
I want you to be happy for me and my new relationship.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.840
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.600
What?!

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.280
- What?
- What?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.600
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.720
But who is…

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.160
Who is this Issara Preechajit guy?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.600
Alright.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.920
Whatever happens,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.800
at least I have some cash on me.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.760
My boy…

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.680
We’re going to be filthy rich!

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.880
NORTH

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.600
Hello, North?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.720
(U, hi.)

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.840
(Are you busy right now?)

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.760
(There happens to be an emergency.)

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.040
Oh.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.400
Pai, please calm down—

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.080
Who are you?

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.760
Where are you from? How old are you?
What do you do for a living?

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.440
Why did you marry my cousin without telling his family?

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:31.920
Huh?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.800
Calm down.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.040
How can I calm down?

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.560
North, what were you thinking?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.680
Were you drunk?

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.720
Call Attorney Vicha and we’ll get you divorced right now!

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.280
Divorce? I’m not getting a divorce!

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.320
This is exactly why I had to
get married without telling you, Pai!

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:45.960
You certainly did!

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.120
I’m a grown man!

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.560
I can think for myself!

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.760
If that’s the case, then tell me who he is
and how come you’re married to him!

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.760
Well, I…!

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.000
I don’t know.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.200
- North!
- Calm down, baby!

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.280
Pai, calm down.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.800
Uh, North and I met when we went hiking.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.520
We were lost in the woods together for a night.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.360
We thought we wouldn’t make it.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.520
But that night was beautiful. It really was.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.400
I knew right away that
I found the right person for me.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.760
I didn’t want to waste any more time.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.480
“Waste time”?

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.760
You think getting to know him
and meeting his family is a waste of time?

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.120
I told him not to!

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.800
But if you want to, Pai—

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.520
That’s Mr. Pai to you!

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:22.880
Mr. Pai.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.200
If you want to know me better, Mr. Pai,
I can tell you everything about myself.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.800
I’ll go and pay my respect to North’s grandfather, too.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:35.880
Pai.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.480
Grandpa and everyone else can’t know about this.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.960
Attorney Vicha as well.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:41.960
Why not?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.800
Imagine what would happen if Aunt Kia found out.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.040
It’s best we deal with this ourselves,
don’t you think so?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.760
Don’t tell anyone about this until I approve of it.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.800
As for this.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.240
Divorce is still an option.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.240
Don’t think you can make
any demands from my cousin!

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.000
Do you hear me?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.880
Of course, Mr. Pai.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.400
I’m going to the bathroom.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.400
Of course.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.160
It’s over there.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:34.680
Right.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.800
Are you alright?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.720
Are you okay?

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.800
I’m sorry.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.800
I was in a hurry and didn’t see you there.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.680
I’m sorry.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.560
It’s alright.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.480
I’ll be a minute.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.920
I’ll wait outside.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.240
You dropped this.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.360
I found it.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.880
Oh, thank you.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.280
You’re forgetful, aren’t you?

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.320
Excuse me?

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.200
Do you know what the number
at the bottom of the card means?

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.640
Are you okay?

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.760
Are you alright?

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.720
This number indicates how many times you have a new card issued.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.880
And yours says…

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.680
Wow.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.280
19 times.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.120
If it’s not because you’re forgetful,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.320
why else would it be?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.640
I’m sure I didn’t drop my wallet.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.640
For you to pick my pocket so easily
when you bump into me like that…

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.440
Do you usually ‘find’ a lot of wallets?

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.640
HEY, LOOK INTO THIS GUY FOR ME.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.920
I’m sorry, sir.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.000
Nana.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.000
Look U up for me.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.320
If there’s any suspicion that he could
be using North, let me know.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.360
Of course, Mr. Pai.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.120
Ah. Excuse me.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.400
Come here.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.120
I don’t understand North.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.200
What was he thinking to marry a total stranger?

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.120
You should be nice to him.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.360
Are you taking his side?

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.720
Of course not.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.040
I just want you two to talk nicely.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.760
So your eyebrows don’t have to
work overtime like this.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.840
I know.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.120
Mr. Pai!

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.680
Nana.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.680
I told you to knock.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.200
I wanted to ask about the papers
you need for today’s meeting.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.480
But I can come back later, sir.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.160
I think this room is big enough for two people.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.680
The kitchen is over there.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.160
I barely use it.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.000
The bathroom is beyond that.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.120
I see.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.520
This is all your stuff?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.280
Oh, yes. This is everything.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.360
I travel light.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.360
Shall we take a look at the bedroom?

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.480
Okay.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.200
This is my bedroom.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.880
Oh, I see.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.000
It’s big.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.360
Which side of the bed do you usually sleep on?

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.200
I sleep in the middle.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.040
But you can let me know which side you prefer.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.240
I’m okay with anything.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.480
I sleep in the middle as well.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.640
Oh?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.160
How about this?

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.240
Oh, U.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.760
What’s wrong?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.680
What are you thinking?

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.400
No, it’s just…

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.120
I’m thinking about what Pai said today.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.000
I couldn’t answer any of his questions.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.240
Maybe I really don’t know you well enough.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.360
North.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.000
Why don’t we get to know each other right now?

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.040
How fast we go… I’ll let you set the pace.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.200
Good idea!

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.080
Let’s go on a date!

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.760
Date?

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.760
Yeah!

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.280
U.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.040
What is that?

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.680
What are you hiding?

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.280
Here.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.920
What is that?

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.920
You’ll know soon.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.080
I have a plan for our date, though.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.360
I only need one hour.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.320
Alright.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.120
Good.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.200
Please.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.040
Thank you.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.480
Let’s put on a seat belt for your safety.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.760
You ready?

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.000
For a while now.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.600
Let’s go.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:45.880
Come on.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.120
Move your legs.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.040
Is there a hole in the middle
of your racket or something?

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.040
I’m gonna get serious now.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.560
Alright.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.760
North, you.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.480
Yes?

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.560
Is that the best you can do, U?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.080
Are you tired?

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.000
Breathe in and breathe out.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.080
Honestly.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.520
Not counting the hike,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.440
this is the most exhausted I’ve been.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
Did you have fun, though?

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.720
I did.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.440
But I thought we were getting to know each other.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.840
We’re doing that through sports.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.960
You’re strong-willed.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.920
You believe in your own strategies.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.400
When under a lot of pressure,

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.360
you let go of everything and just wing it.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.240
Am I right?

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.480
What about you?

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.240
Did you get anything on me?

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.240
Can we try again?

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.400
My eyes were only on the ball.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.280
You’re so amazing.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.080
You were playing and analyzing and still won.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.600
Did you use to be an athlete?

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.600
No.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.200
It’s just my mother taught me how to read people.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.040
That must be nice.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.280
I only got to live with Pai and Grandpa.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.800
They never taught me anything.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.080
All they did was scold and scold and scold me.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.520
Sometimes I wonder,
if I’m so much trouble for them,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.480
why won’t they just leave me alone?

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.400
Oh, North.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.560
Don’t say that.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.520
I’m sure they do it out of love.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.720
You’re so optimistic, U.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.760
You must have such a lovely family.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.600
Can I meet your family?

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.200
Uh…

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.960
I rented the same house.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.280
Remember, you’re a single mom
who works as an accountant.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.760
When I was in school,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.040
I was on scholarship
because I wanted to help financially.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.200
Also…

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.400
I believe in love at first sight.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.120
How does that have to do with anything?

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.120
I’m sure an amazing actor like you
will find a way to fit it into a conversation.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.480
Don’t screw up, Mama.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.360
This guy is my retirement plan.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.240
As if I ever screw up.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.520
But let’s talk about you.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.200
Did you clean things up on your end?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.640
On my end?

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.240
Nart, duh.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.920
She just got out of jail.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.520
If she knew you caught such a big fish,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.560
I don’t think she’d go down without a fight.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.840
In my entire career,

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.360
I never met anyone as talented
and as dangerous as your mother.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.360
Yeah, she fools me all the time.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.080
If she knew about this, I’m sure
she would just do what she always does.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.160
I really hate your mother, you know?

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.360
Who doesn’t?

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.280
Well, you.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.520
Come on in.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.040
Excuse me.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.040
Come in.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.320
-Make yourself at home, love.
-Yes.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.000
ISSARA PREECHAJIT

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.280
Oh.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.160
You also like the Honnomo plushies?

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.560
Wait, but…

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.120
I’ve never seen this model before.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.920
Oh.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.760
It’s a knock-off.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.400
My mother bought it for me.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.280
She found it at the mall
and didn’t know it was a knock-off.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.800
Old ladies, am I right?

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.680
How was I to know?

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.880
I wanted to buy a new one
now that I make my own money,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.120
the real thing, as well.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.080
But then, I realized I don’t want it anymore.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.920
You have to see this.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.880
This is unmissable.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.320
Look at these, love.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.240
This is adorable.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.640
This is his childhood photo album.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.400
See how chubby his cheeks are?

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.360
I’ve never seen U open up to anyone before.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:21.000
But you, North, makes him believe in love at first sight.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:22.920
Mom.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.120
You’re embarrassing me.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.400
Oh.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.000
I ordered some snacks.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.400
I’ll go get them.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.320
Of course.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.560
What was that?

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.000
It slipped out.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.040
Breathe!

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.520
Okay.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.080
Uh…

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.480
Guys.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.080
My name is Nart.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.160
I am—

00:31:59.160 --> 00:31:59.880
Auntie!

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.600
Aunt Nart.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.520
She’s my aunt.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.400
Auntie.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.640
That’s right.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.360
His Aunt.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.640
I see.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.960
Hello, Aunt Nart.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.680
Hello.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.600
What are you doing here, Mom?

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.240
What are you planning?

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.360
I…

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.200
I heard you’re quitting because
you’re getting married to someone.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.080
I just wanted to see
what kind of person had won you over.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.560
Congratulations.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.400
You’ll finally have a place to call home.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.560
I’m sorry

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.760
I couldn’t do a better job at raising you.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.760
I’m really happy for you.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.720
Do you…

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.080
have a place to stay?

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.600
Don’t worry.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.680
I’ll find some room to rent for the night.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.600
You can stay at my place.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.080
I’ll give you a ride.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.360
Let’s begin.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.160
Give me your hand.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.960
A strong fate.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.480
You are destined for great things.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.000
But you must be wary of
who you surround yourself with,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.080
since people are drawn to you
to take advantage of you.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.840
This is especially true during this time.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.440
He must be talking about U.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.080
Definitely.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360
Very possible.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.360
Your hand.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.680
What happened?

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.640
You look alarmed.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.880
They are soulmates.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.600
They have been soulmates in every lifetime.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.920
Though they don’t always end up together in all of them.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.880
But in every lifetime, they always find each other.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.400
In this one, though…

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.160
They will face a grand obstacle.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.080
If they’re able to get through the hurdle,

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.280
their love will be very strong.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.360
But if they fail to do so,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.560
the paths will diverge for good.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.960
But we’ve never even fought.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.000
Are you sure you were reading the right line?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.560
Pai!

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.640
How could you say that to Master?

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.600
Master.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.800
When is the best time for them to get married?

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.160
In four months.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.040
That is the most auspicious.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.240
So in the middle of the year?

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.600
Oh, but we’re opening a new branch
abroad during that time.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.760
We have Halloween, Christmas,
and the New Year at the end of the year.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.480
At the beginning of next year, there’s Lunar
New Year, Valentine’s, and Songkran.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.640
With that alone, we’re already
more than a year behind.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.360
When is my day off?

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.640
Your only days off are the 13th through to the 15th…

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.320
of next month.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.960
How about this?

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.000
We’ll pick the most auspicious day
between the 13th and 15th of next month.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.120
That sounds good.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.080
We’ll do that.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.360
We will not!

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.800
Master will find you the perfect day.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.840
Remember that our family is only here
because of Master’s great guidance.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.080
So the fact that I work hard to the point of
having only three days off this year

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.440
means nothing, then?

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.280
I just want to get married on my terms.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.640
Is that too much to ask?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.920
I’m literally helping you.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.640
I think this is it for today.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.400
Pai and I will talk about this.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.600
How arrogant of them.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.280
Do whatever you want, then!

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:03.960
Nana.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:04.800
Yes?

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:09.520
Sir?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.600
Don’t forget about what I told you to look into.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.400
I won’t, sir.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.480
You can’t even take one more step, love?

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.000
No, I can not.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.960
I’m so exhausted.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.480
Why does everything have to be so difficult?

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.400
Is it a bad day for you, baby?

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.440
So bad.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.160
Alright. Wait right here.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.720
Medium rare, per usual?

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:53.920
Baby.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.040
How did you know watching you cook
makes me feel at ease?

00:38:59.400 --> 00:38:59.960
I don’t know that.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.600
I just want to make you something delicious.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.600
If marriage really was between two people,
that would be nice.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I want to get married right now.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.120
Like North did?

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.280
I’m joking.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.680
I’ll have the bath running after dinner.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.280
We can try that new bath bomb.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:31.960
Let’s take a bath together?

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.440
You know, Mom,

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.200
you can actually stay as long as you want.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.200
You know I can’t stay put too long.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:31.160
I mean, those cops still found me even
when I was moving around so much.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.720
You don’t need to work anymore, Mom.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.720
I can take care of you.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.000
You can just have this room.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.400
You still like that thing?

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:02.600
Yes.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:10.200
Well, it was the last thing you gave me.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.360
I have to keep it.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:20.960
You told me to exchange some receipt for my birthday gift at the mall.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.520
That thing is what I got.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.520
When I came home, you were gone.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.200
I’m sorry.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.240
What?

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.680
Crap.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.280
Damn it!

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.280
It was my fault for trusting her.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.440
People are nothing but selfish.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.000
Don’t think that.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.680
There are good people out there.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.400
You know, I myself have let so many of my targets go.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.000
You?

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:18.680
It’s just…

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.520
I think some people, if they weren’t unfortunate enough to meet the likes of us,

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.680
are good people who can make the world a better place.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.880
How can you tell who those people are?

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.040
You’ll know when you meet them.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.560
You can tell when someone is incapable of hurting anyone,

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.760
and you can’t help feeling bad for hurting them.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.560
Even someone of your calibre went through something like that?

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.400
That’s why we set up the rule:

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.320
Don’t fall in love with the target.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.080
What are you doing?

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:37.720
Oh!

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.280
You said you were going to stay at your place.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.280
What are you doing, North?

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.800
I’m not doing anything.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.280
U—

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.240
What’s this?

00:44:59.280 --> 00:44:59.760
Open it.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.760
Surprise!

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.480
I got you this plushie since you said you wanted it

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.320
…as an apology.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.080
Apology?

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.360
Your family is so nice to me.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.920
My family is awful to you.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.920
So I thought I want to be extra nice to you to make up for that.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.240
It’s authentic, you know?

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.480
U, what’s wrong?

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.200
It’s just…

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.520
The real one

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.200
…is beautiful.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.440
Thank you, North.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.720
Thank you.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.240
Of course.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.120
It’s nothing.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.040
If I knew you’d like it this much,

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.080
I’d have bought ten more.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.040
Why did you want to meet me here?

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.720
You said this suspicious U guy took North to his family home in Sathon, right?

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.760
The estate agent turns a blind eye and rents this place out to scammers.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.760
Many of my clients have rented it.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.080
I asked the agent if it was rented recently.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.160
And it was.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.360
If he really was here, there must be something left inside.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.400
You want to talk to me?

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.880
Stop renting that house in Sathon.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.680
It’s overused.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.520
What are you talking about?

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.160
If you know that much, I don’t think we’re all that different.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.840
Let’s talk as people in the same line of work, shall we?

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.400
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.240
Exactly the same crap you’re pulling.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:43.880
Be respectful.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.240
I’m older.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.880
I’m also your in-law.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:49.840
Fine.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.400
Respect, it is.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.480
Let’s say, if you stay out of my way, I’ll stay out of yours.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.120
You watch my back.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.480
I’ll watch your back.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.840
And we can be on the same turf.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.400
Fine.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.400
I don’t trust you, though.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:13.680
Neither do I.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.280
Who is that for?

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.040
It’s a gift basket for Mr. North.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.320
What?

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.880
I’m sure U doesn’t love North.

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:43.880
I just need evidence.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.560
You’re gonna bug them?

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.400
Don’t you think this is too much, Pai?

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.480
This is nothing compared to the airtags in the bags
that are their wedding gift, sir.

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.000
Pai.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.760
If he proves to be trustworthy,

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.640
I’ll leave them alone.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.480
I just need to be sure first.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.640
(Code Red!)

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.360
It’s okay, U.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.040
I’ll get it.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:56.480
Okay.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.120
Who does Pai want me to give this to now?

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.600
That’s not the case, sir.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.920
This gift basket is for you to congratulate you on your newlywed life.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:18.920
“Congratulate” me?

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:19.440
Yes.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.480
He’s right across the hall.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.160
Why isn’t he here to “congratulate” me himself?

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.800
Oh.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.960
Pai is currently very busy.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.760
He feels that his initial reaction was exaggerated by his surprise,

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.120
but he’s okay with it now.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.920
May I come in and place the gift basket inside for you, sir?

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:43.920
Sure.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.240
Oh, no need.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.760
This looks gorgeous.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
I’ll take it from here.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.960
This, too?

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.360
Oh, she wouldn’t let go.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.280
Let me help.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:55.800
Right.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.320
Send our gratitude to Mr. Pai.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:57.800
Of course.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.480
Thank you.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.680
Do you need my help with that?

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.520
It’s alright, Nana.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:01.800
Thank you.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.240
I am more than happy to—

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:11.760
That was weird.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.040
Super weird.

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.800
I don’t think so.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.880
Maybe Pai really is happy for us.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.320
Oh, matching bags.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.440
Let me see.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.440
We can match.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:38.840
What’s wrong, U?

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.960
I think the zipper’s stuck.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.120
Can you help me with it?

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:43.800
Let me see.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.400
An airtag?

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.400
I guess Pai doesn’t want us to lose the bags, huh?

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.200
Oh, sorry.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.880
It’s alright.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:21.800
I’ll pick it up.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.600
Pai, you jerk!

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.880
Tim, where is Pai?

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:47.840
Uh…

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.720
What do you think you’re doing?

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.760
This is so disrespectful to me and my husband!

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.520
I’m worried about you.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.280
You don’t know who he is.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.360
How can you love him?

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.920
U and I are not inmates that need to be under constant surveillance.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.440
What will you have me do?

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.800
Nothing!

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.760
It’s my life!

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.360
It’s your life, but it’s my responsibility.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.560
If anything happens to you, they will blame me.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.640
They will blame you?

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.360
So you’re just trying to save your own butt?

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:35.000
Honestly, Pai, do you ever care how I feel?

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.160
Don’t say that.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.080
Why can’t I?

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.440
You can leave me alone now.

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:45.160
My life would be absolutely perfect without you in it.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:58.920
I’m done.

00:54:59.120 --> 00:54:59.920
- North.
- Let’s go, U.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.840
- Calm down.
- U, come on.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.640
- Talk to him nicely.
- U.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.360
North. North.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:21.680
Pai.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.640
I want to be alone right now.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.600
There’s no way I can let that happen.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.240
Come here.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.960
I’m never talking to Pai again.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.680
And he’s not allowed to talk to me, either!

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.600
I’m sure he’s just worried about you.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.160
But don’t you think that was too much, U?

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.800
Pai treats me like I’m his pet dog.

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.320
Might as well just get me a microchip.

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.160
Why are you laughing?

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.560
I’m boiling!

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.040
You’re adorable when you’re angry.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.560
Pai must have raised you really well.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.800
U, that’s not funny.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.200
Alright, I’m not teasing you anymore.

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.200
What are you gonna do now?

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.120
Can I talk to you?

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.560
Tim.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:31.280
Alright.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.760
But we talk here, in front of U.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.520
Please, do me a favor.

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.160
Will you apologize to Pai?

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:46.840
No.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.320
I didn’t do anything wrong.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.120
If that was all, excuse me.

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:51.800
North.

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.880
I am begging you.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.960
He… Pai is miserable.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.640
He refuses to eat.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.880
I’ve never seen him like this before.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.560
Pai cares about you a lot.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.720
I don’t know what to say to him.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.400
Can you, please, talk to him?

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.160
Is he really in such bad shape?

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:26.320
Pai!

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:27.440
Hey.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.280
Got caught up, did you?

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.320
Like hell I did.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.320
Pai.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.680
Are you sad because of what I said?

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.240
I’m sorry!

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.600
I didn’t mean to!

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.680
Are you not mad at me anymore?

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.520
How could I be mad at you?

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.480
Goodnight, Pai.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.520
Bye, Tim.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:17.520
Baby.

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.400
What did you say to North?

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.800
He’s usually very stubborn,

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.920
but he easily apologized this time.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.960
All it takes is telling them you’re sad and it gets everyone in a panic.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:30.920
No way.

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:32.760
Really.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.200
Well, when you’re sad, it’s…

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:45.760
What is it?

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.080
It’s funny.

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.000
You make a face like a little duckling when you’re sad.

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:54.760
Duckling?

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.200
Yeah.

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.880
Don’t be sad again, you hear me?

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:01.720
There.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.600
What was that for?

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.440
You called me a little duckling.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.400
You really look like one.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.560
Watch it!

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.080
I’m not talking to you anymore!

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.520
Baby!

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.480
Come back here!

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:13.640
What?

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.320
Where are you going?

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.720
I didn’t do anything.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.800
You hit me?

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.000
You won’t catch me!

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.440
Stop it.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:28.720
Do you surrender?

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.200
Alright!

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:29.920
You do?

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.480
I would like to invite you to dinner at home, Mr. Pai.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.000
Please, come in.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.280
Help me in the kitchen, then.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.720
How are you in love already?

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:02.920
You just met.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.080
Did it take you and Pai

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.400
a long time to fall in love?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.360
You’re blushing.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.960
This is like when we first started dating.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:17.200
I just happened to see the side of him that makes me feel protective over.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.800
It feels like I just got to know another part of you.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.120
I like it.
