{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:37.785
ONE MONTH LATER

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:40.465
Your Majesty.

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:41.705
At ease.

00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:48.225
You don't seem too well.

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:51.225
Do you need more days off?

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.465
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:55.345
I have been blessed by divine favor,

00:01:55.425 --> 00:01:57.345
and after the treatment,
I have made a great recovery.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.265
Even though I have
submitted my qilin badge,

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:04.105
I must not forget my duty
as the Deputy Director of Astronomy.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:07.065
I will do my absolute best
to meet your expectations.

00:02:08.864 --> 00:02:10.105
Great.

00:02:11.065 --> 00:02:12.345
We're at the end of the year.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.505
The year-end blessing ritual
is a major event.

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:17.985
It determines the peace of our nation
and the well-being of our subjects.

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:19.345
Prior to this,

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:21.185
we simplified the Winter Solstice Ceremony
due to circumstances.

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:24.265
And now, we must do our utmost
to prepare meticulously

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:27.785
for the Southern Suburb Ceremony.
It must be solemn.

00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:31.065
I hereby request that you assist
the Ministry of Rites

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:32.065
on behalf of your bureau

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:35.345
to exemplify our devotion
for our subjects.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:37.625
Much obliged.

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:41.665
You are a hardworking and dedicated man,

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:44.305
but you must take care of your body too

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:47.145
if you wish to serve me for the long term.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:52.185
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I will do everything I can.

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:16.225
Zhu Qing. Look at this place.

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:18.265
It's beautiful.

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.465
You see everything, including the palace
and the markets nearby.

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.865
On the west, you can
even see the Taiji Palace.

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:26.345
The Palace Servants' Quarters
are over there.

00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:28.065
The Imperial Medical Office is over there.

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:31.545
And that place should be
the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.785
I can't see it clearly.

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:34.625
It should be
the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.105
It's windy up here.

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:41.385
As you just recovered from your ailment
and are still weak,

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:42.865
let's head back.

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:44.905
When the cold wind

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:49.785
meets the remaining warm current,
snow will fall.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:53.665
The harsh wintry wind,

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:55.985
accompanied by heavy snow,

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:58.145
freezes the land.

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.625
- Winter is cold.
- Deputy Director.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:04.585
The end of the year is upon us.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.225
The old must be removed
to welcome the new.

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:10.905
We must organize
the ceremony that His Majesty

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:12.265
has been expecting properly.

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:14.225
We have many things to do.

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:16.384
The old must be removed
to welcome the new.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:26.065
After installing the heating pot,
even the corridor feels like spring.

00:04:26.145 --> 00:04:27.745
I don't feel cold at all.

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:31.665
How nice it is to be in the palace.

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:33.025
You have a heating pot
in the corridor too.

00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:35.745
Deputy Director,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.225
we only have this recently.

00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:39.585
They saw that the weather had turned cold,

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:41.905
so they specially added this.

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:43.985
The servants get to enjoy
the benefits too.

00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:45.425
We feel warm as well.

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:51.785
I see.

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:55.385
How thoughtful and generous
of His Majesty.

00:04:55.465 --> 00:04:57.425
Deputy Director Xiao, you probably have
to enter the imperial palace frequently.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:58.945
In this cold climate,

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:01.145
having the heating pot is reassuring.

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.225
You did all this for Mr. Xiao.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.745
Why can't you tell him?

00:05:08.345 --> 00:05:10.145
People said the heating pots

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:12.145
were mere considerations from His Majesty,

00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:15.145
but His Majesty and Consort Shu
don't even take that route.

00:05:15.225 --> 00:05:18.025
You are just worried about
Mr. Xiao's weak constitution.

00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.865
He's weak because of me.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:23.945
Besides, the heating pots
bring comfort to the servants too.

00:05:24.465 --> 00:05:25.465
It's not just for him.

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:29.305
I wonder who's more stubborn?

00:05:29.385 --> 00:05:31.745
You or Mr. Xiao?

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:33.705
However,

00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:36.825
I think Mr. Xiao misses you too.

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:38.065
That's his problem.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.025
This is…

00:06:08.545 --> 00:06:09.785
Consort Shu said

00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:13.305
that everything she had
was bestowed by Your Majesty.

00:06:13.385 --> 00:06:17.945
Only her hair is truly hers.

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:20.385
Hence, she gave it to Your Majesty,

00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:22.865
in hopes that Your Majesty

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.385
can grow old with her.

00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:32.705
Speaking of which,

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:34.585
she has always held an excellent banquet

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:37.305
after the Southern Suburb Ceremony.

00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:40.505
Get her

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:42.345
to hold it this year as well.

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:45.905
Understood. I shall relay the message.

00:06:48.705 --> 00:06:50.265
Look. Another winning hand.

00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:52.545
You caught it with your hands.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.785
Of course, you'll get a winning hand.

00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:58.625
No rules in the Chupu game forbid me
from catching with my hands.

00:07:02.425 --> 00:07:03.705
You've been in this chamber
for a while now.

00:07:03.785 --> 00:07:04.865
Why is your nose still red?

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:07.665
And your eyes too.

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:10.745
It's cold, and you have things to do.

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:12.585
You don't have to come here every day.

00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:15.985
When I was working
in the Palace Investigation Bureau,

00:07:16.065 --> 00:07:17.625
you asked me to spend more time with you.

00:07:18.225 --> 00:07:21.105
And now that I'm free, you are sick of me.

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:23.585
Oh, you!

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:29.105
You lost again. One horse left. Pay up.

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:40.185
I bear His Majesty's edict!

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:54.185
Given Consort Shu's gentle disposition,

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:58.025
His Majesty wants Consort Shu
to return at once

00:07:58.105 --> 00:08:01.665
to assist in the preparation
of the Southern Suburb Ceremony.

00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:03.745
Please make the necessary arrangements

00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:07.265
lest His Majesty be disappointed.

00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:08.945
Yes.

00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:16.465
It's the end of the year.

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:18.425
The banquet after
the Southern Suburb Ceremony

00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:19.465
is very important.

00:08:20.105 --> 00:08:22.785
Will you help me organize it?

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:25.705
I already come
to see you every day anyway.

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:26.785
I'd love to do this.

00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:32.025
{\an8}FUCHANG COUNTY PRINCESS MANOR

00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:19.985
Both the surface and the end

00:09:21.865 --> 00:09:23.785
of the universe are limitless.

00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:36.785
I know more than 100 stars.

00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:38.385
The Orion Constellation.

00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:39.505
The Big Dipper.

00:09:39.585 --> 00:09:40.465
The Gemini.

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:42.105
The Dubhe.

00:09:42.185 --> 00:09:43.105
The Merak.

00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:45.585
The Orion Constellation.

00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:47.905
The Gemini.

00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:50.185
The Big Dipper.

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:52.265
The Dubhe.

00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:55.265
The Merak.

00:09:56.825 --> 00:09:59.385
We're just sands
in the sea of the universe.

00:10:01.505 --> 00:10:02.865
Yet in the same universe,

00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:07.385
it's possible that two people
will never meet

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:10.985
each other.

00:10:19.545 --> 00:10:20.505
You're foolish.

00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:23.225
My question

00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:25.625
cost you 15 years of your life.

00:10:26.665 --> 00:10:29.385
Do you regret it?

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:35.745
I never regret the choice I made.

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:37.705
Besides,

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:42.785
I really want to answer
every question you have.

00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:08.065
‪ZI, CHOU

00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:34.505
THE MISALIGNED SEVEN STARS

00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:39.865
Greetings, Your Majesty, Consort Shu,
and County Princess.

00:11:41.065 --> 00:11:43.905
Your Majesty, the auspicious hour
has been decided accordingly.

00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:46.585
I came to invite Your Majesty
to sign with the cinnabar brush.

00:11:48.225 --> 00:11:51.905
My dear, since you are
organizing the banquet,

00:11:51.985 --> 00:11:54.305
you can sign it for me.

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:56.785
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.985
{\an8}TWELFTH MONTH OF THE YEAR OF DINGCHOU

00:12:34.825 --> 00:12:35.745
Don't go.

00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:37.985
Deputy Director Xiao!

00:12:38.065 --> 00:12:39.625
- Quick! Put out the fire!
- Put out the fire!

00:12:55.105 --> 00:12:56.025
Quick.

00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:57.225
Take him to the Imperial Medical Office.

00:12:57.305 --> 00:12:58.265
No need.

00:13:03.785 --> 00:13:04.825
I'm sorry.

00:13:04.905 --> 00:13:06.225
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

00:13:14.785 --> 00:13:18.425
This isn't your fault.
But the banquet is near.

00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:21.665
I do not wish to see another accident.

00:13:33.865 --> 00:13:35.505
Take Consort Shu back to rest.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:37.905
And tell the Palace Investigation Bureau
to come here.

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.025
Yes.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:41.785
Peiyi.

00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:42.785
It is a shocking event.

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:44.865
Please return and rest.

00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:47.025
You can count on me. Don't worry.

00:13:49.305 --> 00:13:51.185
Deputy Director Xiao,

00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:54.905
I count on you and Peiyi
to investigate this.

00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:57.385
I will do my best.

00:14:16.425 --> 00:14:19.025
Autopsy isn't my expertise.
After you, Your Ladyship.

00:14:23.785 --> 00:14:25.065
What is going on?

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:28.265
Your Ladyship? Mr. Xiao?

00:14:28.985 --> 00:14:30.105
What do we do now?

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.385
You're the boss. Are you asking me?

00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:36.065
I'm not working in the bureau anymore.
So I'm asking you.

00:15:07.425 --> 00:15:09.505
No unusual coloration
under the tongue or nails.

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:11.465
It's not poison.

00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:17.785
Bring him back and examine carefully.

00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:20.545
The banquet demands my attention.

00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:23.265
If there is nothing else,
I will take my leave.

00:15:37.865 --> 00:15:39.745
Mr. Xiao is so cold.

00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:43.105
It's good that he's keeping
some distance from me.

00:15:43.185 --> 00:15:44.905
Those near me will suffer misfortune.

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:47.025
Staying away is the best decision.

00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:51.185
That way, I don't have to worry
that he'll suffer any misfortune one day.

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.425
Don't jinx it.

00:16:06.985 --> 00:16:08.105
Are you all right, Deputy Director Xiao?

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:10.585
Coughing blood again?

00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:18.305
Quick.

00:16:19.585 --> 00:16:20.425
Eat this.

00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:32.705
I fear we'll have to ask Prosecutor Gu
to send us more medicine.

00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:34.025
You still need to take it.

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:36.945
Speaking of him, he has a noble soul.

00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:38.665
This is an expensive pill.

00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:40.545
It might cost his monthly wage.

00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:45.545
Is it very expensive?

00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:47.025
I don't know medicine, but I've picked up

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:49.265
a thing or two by working
with Deputy Director since young.

00:16:50.465 --> 00:16:53.185
The rhinoceros horn
and pearls in the pill cost a lot.

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:55.785
It can cure the blood-coughing symptoms
caused by a bloated liver.

00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:02.785
This thing perforated the intestines.

00:17:03.665 --> 00:17:05.424
There are blood clots in his abdomen.

00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:10.704
What is this?

00:17:12.944 --> 00:17:13.905
Iron caltrops?

00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:16.704
Do you know this?

00:17:17.785 --> 00:17:18.905
What is this?

00:17:18.985 --> 00:17:20.704
- This is…
- This is…

00:17:21.745 --> 00:17:23.944
- Is it for spinning threads?
- It seems too small

00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:25.905
for spinning threads.

00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:31.065
Perhaps it fell from a weapon?

00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:33.305
Yu Shishun. Shut it
if you don't know anything.

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:36.905
It's too small. I can't see it clearly.

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:39.465
No one will swallow an iron caltrop,

00:17:39.545 --> 00:17:41.625
regardless of how small it is.

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:43.705
That's easy. Just conceal the caltrop

00:17:43.785 --> 00:17:45.825
inside a pill or honey paste.

00:17:45.905 --> 00:17:48.705
They will be digested after two hours.

00:17:49.585 --> 00:17:50.945
{\an8}PRESCRIPTION

00:17:51.025 --> 00:17:53.105
{\an8}Minister Liu was haunted by anxiety.

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:55.665
He took a calming pill every day
to calm himself.

00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:58.385
This is the diagnosis and prescription
found on his table.

00:18:00.065 --> 00:18:01.105
Come with me.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.145
This is where he usually worked.

00:18:08.225 --> 00:18:10.985
He took the pills often,
so he placed them here.

00:18:11.745 --> 00:18:13.785
The pills were placed
in a high-traffic area,

00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:16.465
easy for unscrupulous parties
to tamper with.

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:25.985
They are indeed
the calming pills made in my shop.

00:18:26.745 --> 00:18:29.745
After we make the pills,

00:18:29.825 --> 00:18:31.505
the patient will come and retrieve them.

00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:34.705
But there's something wrong
with the pills.

00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:36.305
What's wrong?

00:18:36.905 --> 00:18:38.625
Miss, take a look.

00:18:40.105 --> 00:18:41.465
These two have a shell

00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:43.625
and this one doesn't.

00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:47.265
The shell-less one,
does it feel or taste any different?

00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:49.785
Yes, but not much.

00:18:50.425 --> 00:18:52.625
You're to take several pills at once.

00:18:52.705 --> 00:18:54.585
It'll be even harder

00:18:54.665 --> 00:18:56.985
to notice the difference
if you mix them when you take them.

00:19:11.705 --> 00:19:12.785
It's cold at night.

00:19:12.865 --> 00:19:15.665
Your Ladyship,
don't stand too long in the cold.

00:19:16.745 --> 00:19:18.945
I'm fine. It's not windy now.

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:22.985
I'm glad you're back, Your Ladyship.

00:19:23.065 --> 00:19:24.465
It makes me more confident
in the investigation.

00:19:25.825 --> 00:19:28.385
And you won't be if I don't come back?

00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:31.585
Haven't you been doing well?
You don't need me.

00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:35.505
Boss.

00:19:36.065 --> 00:19:38.705
Your presence is reassuring.

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:41.225
All the more reasons for me to leave.

00:19:41.905 --> 00:19:45.305
With me here,
you'll think you have a way out.

00:19:48.025 --> 00:19:51.025
Boss, are you not coming back at all?

00:19:53.065 --> 00:19:55.505
I got involved in this by chance.

00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:58.505
We'll see if I'll return for real
in the future.

00:19:58.585 --> 00:20:00.825
I still keep your things where they are.

00:20:00.905 --> 00:20:03.225
The bureau is as it was when you left.

00:20:03.825 --> 00:20:06.665
Everyone misses you.

00:20:21.785 --> 00:20:24.185
The eastern wind thaws the ice,
turning it into snow.

00:20:24.705 --> 00:20:27.145
As the cloud parts and the Sun appears,
the spring light feels gentle.

00:20:28.065 --> 00:20:31.265
The southern wind is mild,
and smoke rises from the wet soil.

00:20:31.865 --> 00:20:34.585
The drizzling rain does not cease,
signaling the hot summer.

00:20:38.065 --> 00:20:39.785
The western wind is strong,

00:20:39.865 --> 00:20:41.505
and the yellow leaves shed.

00:20:42.305 --> 00:20:43.865
As the sky is clear
and the clouds are thin,

00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:45.145
the autumn breeze feels cool.

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.905
The harsh wintry wind,
accompanied by heavy snow,

00:20:50.425 --> 00:20:53.465
freezes the land. Winter is cold.

00:20:56.905 --> 00:20:58.865
I forgot to move it.

00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:02.465
It sounds creepy at night.

00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:07.625
It points toward the north.
The wintry wind is harsh.

00:21:07.705 --> 00:21:09.745
I suppose it'll snow soon
in the Western Capital.

00:21:10.345 --> 00:21:13.585
I don't want you to be upset
when you see it.

00:21:16.465 --> 00:21:17.385
I'm fine.

00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:23.105
Years pass by as the wind blows.

00:21:23.185 --> 00:21:24.945
The season changes.

00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:27.705
Some people move on faster, some slower.

00:21:28.465 --> 00:21:30.505
But we all move on eventually.

00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:34.025
Keep it. I think it's nice here.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:40.705
FUCHANG COUNTY PRINCESS MANOR

00:21:40.785 --> 00:21:43.945
Your Ladyship, I have delivered
the thing you asked me to.

00:21:44.025 --> 00:21:46.985
But please don't ask me to do it again.

00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:49.665
I'm not good at lying.

00:21:54.945 --> 00:21:56.625
Your compass broke, didn't it?

00:21:56.705 --> 00:21:57.545
I know

00:21:57.625 --> 00:21:59.465
it belonged to your master,
so it meant a lot to you.

00:21:59.545 --> 00:22:01.705
I've been meaning
to find you a good replacement.

00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:04.025
I asked around

00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:05.825
and found this compass…

00:22:07.145 --> 00:22:10.145
that was used by Li Chunfeng.
I came to give it to you.

00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:14.905
Judging from Mr. Xiao's reaction,

00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:17.185
I think he figured out that I didn't buy

00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:19.105
the pills and the compass.

00:22:20.865 --> 00:22:22.025
Thank you, Gu.

00:22:22.105 --> 00:22:23.225
The restaurants in the Western Capital

00:22:23.305 --> 00:22:24.985
have begun offering
winter seasonal dishes.

00:22:25.065 --> 00:22:26.545
Pick one. It's on me.

00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:27.985
It's not that, Your Ladyship.

00:22:28.065 --> 00:22:29.585
It's not a hassle. I just…

00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:32.225
I understand. Thank you, Gu.

00:22:58.025 --> 00:22:58.865
Blood.

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:00.385
There's blood!

00:23:02.225 --> 00:23:03.065
Another victim.

00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:06.225
The victim is a performer
from the Music Office.

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:08.505
She was a musician from the Music Office

00:23:08.585 --> 00:23:11.505
called Su Zhuo'er. She was kind,

00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:12.945
definitely not a troublemaker.

00:23:14.905 --> 00:23:16.705
When was the drum placed here?

00:23:17.305 --> 00:23:20.465
These drums are here
for the dance performance at the banquet.

00:23:20.545 --> 00:23:22.345
They were placed here
more than ten days ago

00:23:22.425 --> 00:23:23.505
for our rehearsal.

00:23:24.265 --> 00:23:25.825
But no one was guarding

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.385
these instruments.

00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:29.145
PAVILION OF SONG AND DANCE

00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:37.865
The drum skin has been refastened,
in a very amateur way too.

00:23:38.825 --> 00:23:41.265
A musician knows to take
good care of their instruments.

00:23:41.345 --> 00:23:42.825
The culprit is unlikely to be a musician.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.345
Dismiss everyone. Keep the drum here.

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:47.705
Don't let anyone near it.

00:23:48.665 --> 00:23:49.745
Yes.

00:23:53.545 --> 00:23:54.705
The drum is huge.

00:23:54.785 --> 00:23:56.305
How could the culprit carry so much water

00:23:56.385 --> 00:23:57.865
in such a short amount of time?

00:24:00.345 --> 00:24:02.745
The copper pot, intended
for fire relief, contains water.

00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:05.945
The inside of the drum is clean.

00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:08.585
There's no blood or spraying pattern.

00:24:08.665 --> 00:24:10.105
The victim was inserted after she died.

00:24:10.705 --> 00:24:11.545
The culprit placed the body

00:24:11.625 --> 00:24:13.705
inside the pre-heated water
so that the blood slowly seeped out.

00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:16.985
Then, he refastened the drum skin

00:24:17.065 --> 00:24:20.145
and let the body be discovered
the next day.

00:24:23.385 --> 00:24:25.345
As for how he heated the water up…

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:32.465
Lime, I knew it.

00:24:33.865 --> 00:24:36.225
After putting the body inside the drum,
add some lime,

00:24:36.305 --> 00:24:37.625
and the water temperature will rise.

00:24:37.705 --> 00:24:39.545
Just enough for blood
to seep into the water.

00:24:44.145 --> 00:24:48.025
Go find out
who was with Su Zhuo'er last night.

00:24:49.265 --> 00:24:50.905
The ministers in the Music Office
must know something.

00:25:03.305 --> 00:25:05.145
You're quick.

00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:08.865
You hid the pots,
but you can't hide the smell.

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.985
Madam. Have mercy.

00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:16.865
Relax. I don't care if you drink alcohol.

00:25:16.945 --> 00:25:17.865
I'm here to investigate.

00:25:18.665 --> 00:25:20.145
But if you help me,

00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:22.265
I'll help you too.

00:25:23.785 --> 00:25:26.865
All right. I'll speak.

00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:27.785
- Come.
- Come.

00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:29.825
Cheers.

00:25:31.385 --> 00:25:33.065
- Come.
- People like us

00:25:33.145 --> 00:25:34.745
hold our drinks very well.

00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:36.025
Yet for some reason,

00:25:36.105 --> 00:25:37.585
we became drunk very quickly last night,

00:25:37.665 --> 00:25:40.505
as if the liquor was stronger than usual.

00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:42.665
Su Zhuo'er drank ten cups in one go.

00:25:42.745 --> 00:25:44.785
- When she left, she was very drunk.
- You're leaving already?

00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:46.985
Did she tell you

00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:48.705
where she was going
or who she was meeting?

00:25:49.745 --> 00:25:50.705
No.

00:25:50.785 --> 00:25:52.225
When she left at that time,

00:25:52.305 --> 00:25:54.065
she said nothing, and we never pried.

00:25:56.465 --> 00:25:59.425
Your Ladyship, I examined
the residence of Su Zhuo'er.

00:25:59.505 --> 00:26:00.905
This is the maid who shared
a chamber with her.

00:26:00.985 --> 00:26:03.305
The victim didn't even
unroll her bed last night.

00:26:03.385 --> 00:26:05.265
She probably was killed
before she returned home.

00:26:05.345 --> 00:26:09.105
Do you remember what Su Zhuo'er wore
when you last saw her?

00:26:10.145 --> 00:26:12.305
A small dark green coat.
A thick one at that.

00:26:13.185 --> 00:26:15.465
Your Ladyship,
anything wrong with her attire?

00:26:16.065 --> 00:26:19.105
It's winter, yet she wasn't wearing a lot.

00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:21.865
Where did her coat go?

00:26:24.185 --> 00:26:26.345
Her coat was left in the bushes.

00:26:26.425 --> 00:26:29.065
She was probably tackled down here.

00:26:29.145 --> 00:26:31.745
Perhaps someone forced himself on her.

00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:35.505
But there are no wounds
or signs of rape on her.

00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:38.825
Don't tell me she took off her clothes
and lay there.

00:26:38.905 --> 00:26:41.745
Old man once told me that during winter,

00:26:41.825 --> 00:26:44.105
drunkards were often frozen
to death naked by the street.

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:46.345
Under the influence of alcohol
and extremely low temperature,

00:26:46.425 --> 00:26:48.665
one might begin to hallucinate
and feel warm.

00:26:49.265 --> 00:26:51.385
They will begin removing their clothes
before they succumb to the cold.

00:26:51.465 --> 00:26:54.185
The culprit knows
the performers drink every night.

00:26:54.265 --> 00:26:56.545
He might even know the custom
that if one wants to leave early,

00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:58.545
one will have to drink
with everyone first.

00:26:58.625 --> 00:27:00.425
So, he tampered with the liquor.

00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:02.825
If the culprit appeared
during the pre-determined time,

00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:04.745
Su Zhuo'er wouldn't have died.

00:27:04.825 --> 00:27:06.105
What's cruel is that the culprit

00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:08.345
probably waited in the dark

00:27:08.865 --> 00:27:12.145
until Su Zhuo'er died from the cold.

00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:14.945
And then, he placed her body

00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:16.745
inside the drum and let her blood out.

00:27:17.665 --> 00:27:20.185
What kind of grudge deserves
such an elaborate plan?

00:27:22.105 --> 00:27:23.065
Your Ladyship,

00:27:23.145 --> 00:27:26.665
don't you think the culprit's motive
and actions are contradictory?

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:29.465
- How so?
- The culprit was careful.

00:27:29.545 --> 00:27:32.065
He killed Su Zhuo'er
without leaving a trace.

00:27:32.145 --> 00:27:33.505
Therefore, he must be quite discreet.

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:36.185
Yet he put her inside the drum
intended for the banquet performance.

00:27:36.265 --> 00:27:38.425
Doesn't that mean
he wants people to find out?

00:27:39.465 --> 00:27:41.945
This feels familiar, doesn't it?

00:27:43.305 --> 00:27:44.145
Liu Guanghan?

00:27:45.865 --> 00:27:48.905
The culprit hid iron caltrops
inside the victim's honeyed pills,

00:27:48.985 --> 00:27:50.745
killing him silently.

00:27:51.345 --> 00:27:53.785
Yet he also arranged it in a way
that Liu Guanghan

00:27:53.865 --> 00:27:55.305
would die before His Majesty.

00:27:55.385 --> 00:27:57.065
The death of both victims
is carefully planned,

00:27:57.145 --> 00:27:58.465
yet mysteriously arranged.

00:27:58.545 --> 00:28:01.985
He wants the body to be publicly displayed
without exposing himself

00:28:02.065 --> 00:28:03.465
or being suspicious.

00:28:03.545 --> 00:28:05.425
Are you sure it's done by the same person?

00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:07.585
But why?

00:28:08.465 --> 00:28:09.985
To sabotage the banquet?

00:28:12.145 --> 00:28:14.345
It's too early to jump to conclusions now.

00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:23.665
How come Peiyi isn't here?

00:28:24.825 --> 00:28:26.025
We had a game of Chupu just now.

00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:28.065
We toppled a cup of water
and she was all wet.

00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:30.545
I didn't want her to look improper
before Your Majesty,

00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:31.585
so I asked her to get changed.

00:28:33.385 --> 00:28:35.745
I see you have pretty much recovered.

00:28:36.545 --> 00:28:38.425
I have already made a full recovery.

00:28:38.505 --> 00:28:40.105
All thanks to Peiyi's company, of course.

00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:42.265
That little girl

00:28:42.345 --> 00:28:43.905
has been distraught lately.

00:28:43.985 --> 00:28:45.625
I'm glad you're keeping her company.

00:28:53.985 --> 00:28:57.625
Your Majesty. I'm worried about her too.

00:28:58.225 --> 00:29:02.105
While she often forces herself
to be cheerful before me,

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:04.425
I know she is miserable.

00:29:05.465 --> 00:29:07.465
She has suffered enough.

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:10.265
I don't want to see her like this.

00:29:11.025 --> 00:29:12.585
I understand your concerns.

00:29:12.665 --> 00:29:14.705
But she needs to deal
with her problem personally.

00:29:14.785 --> 00:29:17.865
Your intervention
might do more harm than good.

00:29:23.705 --> 00:29:24.545
Your Majesty,

00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:27.105
Deputy Director Xiao Huaijin is here.

00:29:30.265 --> 00:29:32.505
Greetings, Your Majesty, Consort Shu.

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:34.665
Great timing.

00:29:35.305 --> 00:29:38.145
I've been re-reading Zhuangzi lately.

00:29:38.745 --> 00:29:41.505
The line, "Today, I forego myself,"

00:29:41.585 --> 00:29:45.545
resonates with me deeply.
What do you think of that?

00:29:46.345 --> 00:29:47.345
I wouldn't dare comment.

00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:50.465
To be one with everything
is to discard your self.

00:29:50.545 --> 00:29:52.665
It means to forego
your self and your constraints,

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:55.465
let go of your obsessions
and return to your originality.

00:29:56.385 --> 00:29:57.745
I don't need your explanation.

00:29:57.825 --> 00:30:00.505
I want to hear your opinion about it.

00:30:01.265 --> 00:30:03.985
Can you recall what Ziqi
of the Southern City looked like

00:30:04.065 --> 00:30:05.465
when he forewent himself?

00:30:09.225 --> 00:30:11.505
He looked withered and emotionless.

00:30:12.425 --> 00:30:15.145
You look withered and emotionless too.

00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:17.345
Have you foregone your self?

00:30:21.025 --> 00:30:21.985
Your Majesty,

00:30:23.025 --> 00:30:27.025
Deputy Director Xiao just recovered,
and he's busy.

00:30:27.105 --> 00:30:31.185
When you're consumed by work,
you fail to see things clearly.

00:30:42.225 --> 00:30:43.745
Are you waiting for me, Mr. Xiao?

00:30:44.345 --> 00:30:48.305
Your Ladyship,
I have some questions for you.

00:30:51.385 --> 00:30:52.785
Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:54.785
After the banquet,

00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:57.745
I will request His Majesty again
to annul the marriage arrangement.

00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:02.945
The marriage arrangement
is the result of my willfulness

00:31:03.025 --> 00:31:04.305
and your bid for time.

00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:07.505
From now on, we will walk separate paths

00:31:08.025 --> 00:31:09.185
and have nothing to do with each other.

00:31:40.785 --> 00:31:41.745
Inspector Du,

00:31:42.785 --> 00:31:46.785
initially, I wanted to share
this pot of liquor with you

00:31:46.865 --> 00:31:48.065
during the wedding ceremony.

00:31:49.385 --> 00:31:52.905
But it seems like
it's just my wishful thinking.

00:31:54.585 --> 00:31:57.945
You worried that after she left you,
she'd be in trouble,

00:31:58.025 --> 00:31:59.305
and you asked me to look after her.

00:32:00.425 --> 00:32:02.225
I did try supporting her.

00:32:03.945 --> 00:32:05.345
I even fantasized

00:32:06.465 --> 00:32:08.025
growing old with her.

00:32:09.985 --> 00:32:11.425
But fate can be cruel.

00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:15.585
And in the end, I am where I am right now.

00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:20.065
I am selfish.

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:24.705
I've studied astrological charts,
both old and new.

00:32:25.705 --> 00:32:28.225
I know the name
of every star in the world.

00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:32.265
Yet I do not know

00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:35.345
the path ahead of me.

00:32:43.985 --> 00:32:45.105
Inspector Du,

00:32:46.425 --> 00:32:47.985
please provide some guidance.

00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:06.625
I see it now.

00:33:09.025 --> 00:33:11.585
You too think you placed the duty
on the wrong person.

00:33:13.545 --> 00:33:14.945
I failed you.

00:33:16.465 --> 00:33:17.705
I failed her.

00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:26.585
In that case,

00:33:28.905 --> 00:33:30.385
let's share this liquor.

00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:50.585
Inspector Du,

00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:53.745
you really are biased toward her.

00:33:55.145 --> 00:33:56.425
After what I said,

00:33:57.705 --> 00:33:59.905
you even refused
to drink the liquor I brought.

00:34:05.585 --> 00:34:06.505
Whatever.

00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:09.625
It's my fault.

00:34:16.105 --> 00:34:17.344
Stop!

00:34:17.425 --> 00:34:18.625
Help!

00:34:18.705 --> 00:34:19.545
Stop!

00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:22.385
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:34:22.465 --> 00:34:23.705
- Stop running!
- Stay right there!

00:34:23.784 --> 00:34:24.625
Stop running!

00:34:24.705 --> 00:34:25.585
- Stay right there!
- Stop running!

00:34:25.665 --> 00:34:26.784
Stop!

00:34:28.665 --> 00:34:30.705
- Stop running!
- Stop running!

00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:36.225
Capture them all.

00:34:36.304 --> 00:34:37.264
Wait.

00:34:40.744 --> 00:34:41.585
Greetings, Deputy Director Xiao.

00:34:41.665 --> 00:34:44.505
What did these people do
that you must use force on them?

00:34:45.945 --> 00:34:47.344
People have been holding
the ritual privately

00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:49.744
to summon Venus.

00:34:49.824 --> 00:34:52.105
This belief has misguided the people.

00:34:52.185 --> 00:34:53.344
Summon Venus?

00:35:00.425 --> 00:35:01.385
Deputy Director Xiao,

00:35:02.065 --> 00:35:03.785
it wasn't our intention
to capture the offenders in public,

00:35:03.865 --> 00:35:04.825
thus creating chaos.

00:35:04.905 --> 00:35:06.905
But similar things always happen.

00:35:06.985 --> 00:35:08.545
We do not have a choice.

00:35:19.145 --> 00:35:20.545
What is the summoning of Venus?

00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:22.985
Deputy Director Xiao,
are you aware of the nursery rhyme

00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:24.545
that's getting popular lately?

00:35:24.625 --> 00:35:25.785
Nursery rhyme?

00:35:25.865 --> 00:35:28.985
Five, four, three, two, one

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:31.865
Fire, water, earth, wood, metal

00:35:31.945 --> 00:35:35.065
As Venus soars above ground

00:35:35.145 --> 00:35:38.065
The divine beast's roar
Silences the dragon

00:35:38.145 --> 00:35:41.985
When Venus descends upon the palace

00:35:42.065 --> 00:35:45.065
The world will know true peace

00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:48.185
What an interesting nursery rhyme.

00:35:48.825 --> 00:35:52.625
The popularity of the nursery rhyme
comes with a rumor.

00:35:53.305 --> 00:35:55.705
After Consort Shu
earns His Majesty's favor,

00:35:55.785 --> 00:35:58.265
our nation hasn't had any war or disaster.

00:35:58.345 --> 00:36:01.025
They say when Consort Shu was born,

00:36:01.105 --> 00:36:03.265
Venus appeared during the day.

00:36:03.345 --> 00:36:06.385
And rumor has it
that Venus will appear again.

00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:09.385
Whoever could summon Venus
would rise before all else.

00:36:10.065 --> 00:36:12.785
Venus appeared when Consort Shu
was born? That is nonsense.

00:36:12.865 --> 00:36:14.065
That has never happened.

00:36:14.145 --> 00:36:15.665
Indeed.

00:36:15.745 --> 00:36:18.945
But the more mystical the rumor is,

00:36:19.025 --> 00:36:20.425
the harder it is to get rid of it.

00:36:20.985 --> 00:36:22.265
Look at these kids.

00:36:22.345 --> 00:36:26.225
Their parents brought them
to summon Venus.

00:36:26.305 --> 00:36:27.665
Ask them to get up now.

00:36:28.745 --> 00:36:29.745
Everyone, get up now.

00:36:33.865 --> 00:36:36.265
Everyone, when Consort Shu was born,

00:36:36.345 --> 00:36:37.905
Venus did not appear.

00:36:37.985 --> 00:36:39.505
Do not believe the rumors

00:36:39.585 --> 00:36:41.105
or you'll just be manipulated
by someone else.

00:36:48.705 --> 00:36:50.585
You see, Deputy Director Xiao.

00:36:50.665 --> 00:36:53.145
This has persisted for a while now.

00:36:53.225 --> 00:36:55.825
You see this in Chang'an and Wannian.

00:36:56.545 --> 00:36:57.825
We have stopped this many times.

00:36:57.905 --> 00:37:00.705
Not only is our effort futile,
the people are getting more fanatical.

00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:03.305
We do not dare to take
more drastic measures,

00:37:03.385 --> 00:37:05.265
so we have submitted an emergency report,

00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:07.345
pending instructions from our superior.
