(Stop that train now!)

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.940
(Go! Cut it off!)

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.420
(Alarm! Alarm!)

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.140
(Suri, Gis! Get in here!)

("Walter Defends Sarajevo")

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:15.980
Fang Muyang.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.180
Let's switch seats.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.080
No.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.271
I can see better from here.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.190
Come on.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.020
It looks the same from anywhere.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.940
Then why switch?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.410
I just want this seat.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.930
What's your deal sitting here?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.690
Come on.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.730
Let's trade seats.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.960
Stop pulling me.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.940
I want to sit next to Fei Ni.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.910
Why sit here?

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.160
Don't block the view.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.426
I'm not blocking anyone.
I just want to sit with Fei Ni.

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:43.120
I'll switch with you.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.460
(Drive straight to Višegrad.)

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.700
(Why not?)

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.500
(It's been a long time.)

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.660
(Can you blow it without dynamite?)

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.740
(Only the living get to see it.)

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.460
This is good.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.500
The fight's about to start.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.860
(Gis, maintain speed.)

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.530
Here it comes.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.020
Fang Muyang.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.180
(Jiangcheng Worker-Peasant Hospital)

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.410
You should head up.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.140
Let me walk you home.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.620
No need.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.440
If you do,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.620
we'll have to walk you back.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.180
By the time we're done, it'll be dark.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.500
See you.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.060
Ye Feng.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.630
Today was unexpected.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.220
I had no idea he'd show up.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.530
I'll pay you back for the ticket.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.910
No need.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.870
I can afford a movie ticket

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.400
for a hero who saved someone's life.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.810
But Fei Ni...

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.560
Don't you think

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.520
Fang Muyang might have feelings for you?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.120
Absolutely not.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.720
He lost his memory.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.030
He forgot a lot of things,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.850
even basic life skills.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.280
I've been taking care of him lately.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.520
That's why he keeps coming to me.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.370
Once his memory comes back,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.290
it won't be like this.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.230
I get that.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.320
But he's still a grown man.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.210
He's running to you for everything

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.550
and...

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.690
He doesn't seem to know boundaries.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.640
That's not good for you

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.730
or for us.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.860
So,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.110
I think you two should
stop seeing each other.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.160
You have a point.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.760
But actually,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.350
the factory assigned me
to look after him.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.710
And I promised Ms. Xu I would...

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.420
No.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.100
If we're together,

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:27.740
we have to be mindful of boundaries.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.250
As for my mom, don't worry.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.030
I'll talk to her.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.550
Then, it's settled.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.890
There was actually something else
I wanted to tell you.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.480
Fang Muyang interrupted earlier,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.420
and I almost forgot.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.560
Go on.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.770
My mom mentioned something a while back.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.230
For the past few years,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.310
you've been trying
really hard to get into college.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.510
I haven't given up.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.890
Here's how I see it.

00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:53.170
You want to go to college,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.460
so you can
land a good job after graduation,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.480
and find a good husband.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.850
But now you're with me.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.700
Whether it's you or your brother,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.010
my mom can help

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.130
you both find good jobs.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.800
So about college,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.920
if we get married,
maybe you could let that go?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.400
Think about it.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.330
If you do go to college,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.830
we'd just get married and you'd leave.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.515
What would be the point of that?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.890
Besides,

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.500
my mom would definitely want

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.080
her daughter-in-law at home.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.990
She'd love to have a grandchild.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.920
Fei Ni.

00:06:27.782 --> 00:06:28.826
What do you think?

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.420
We can talk about the future later.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.210
As for our relationship,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.090
Ms. Xu doesn't know yet, right?

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.940
How does she feel?

00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:39.893
How about this?

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.500
Come over for dinner sometime.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.130
Don't worry about her.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.600
She'll like you.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.260
And if you don't want to
stay in the workshop,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.640
I'll ask my mom

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.915
to transfer you to the office.

00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:50.880
But about college,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.010
do we have a deal?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.920
I...

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.810
I'll think about it.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.900
Alright.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.980
Let's head home.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.440
No need to walk me.

00:06:59.804 --> 00:07:01.010
It's not even on your way.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.060
All this back and forth...

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.060
Okay, I get it.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.330
I'll go then.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.515
See you at the factory.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.000
Okay.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.590
Bye.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.810
(He wouldn't come back)

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.980
(because he was afraid
you'd have nowhere to live.)

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.210
(I promise,)

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.390
(within three months,
my brother will marry you.)

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.620
(I'm just worried that chasing college)

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.980
(and taking care of that "hero")

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.060
(will cost you your future.)

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:43.620
(If we're together,
we have to be mindful of boundaries.)

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.900
(You two should stop seeing each other.)

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.540
(Whether it's you or your brother,)

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.850
(my mom can help)

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.010
(you both find good jobs.)

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.500
So about college,

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.600
if we get married,
maybe you could let that go?

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.690
(Jiangnan University,
Teaching Building No. 1)

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.500
Fang,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.690
this research project is highly valued

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.700
by the leadership.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.330
It's highly confidential.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.940
After careful consideration,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.330
the committee feels

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:17.790
you're not the right fit.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.230
But don't lose heart.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.370
(You did a lot of groundwork.)

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.730
(It won't go to waste.)

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.430
(Summarize your preliminary results)

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.490
(and hand them over to Ding Yang
from your dorm.)

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.310
Excuse me,

00:08:40.493 --> 00:08:41.970
how do I get to the Math Department?

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.950
Go inside and turn right.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.120
It's you.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.690
Do you remember me?

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.900
I don't.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.900
Private rooms have been crowded lately,

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.380
so Fang Muyang

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.680
was assigned here.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.530
Here, take a look.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.810
That's really well done.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.860
Thank you.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.360
Fei Ni's here.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.160
Fei Ni.

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:39.730
- Fang Muyang.
- You're here.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.300
You made me look too old.

00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:42.180
How is that old?

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.780
Fix it.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.915
There's not even a wrinkle.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.140
I'll redraw it another day.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.910
You're here.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.380
Yeah.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.660
I've got it.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.340
I'll do it.

00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:08.540
I'll make the bed.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:09.730
Leave it to me.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.537
I'll handle it.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.660
Tuck this side in like so.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.690
Fang Muyang.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.470
See? Nice and neat.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.250
What's wrong?

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.370
Nothing.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.330
I took the day off.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.410
I can take you out.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.060
All day?

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.300
Let's go see a movie.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:47.540
Okay.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.200
After the movie,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.850
we'll get you

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.440
some new clothes.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:53.570
Let's go.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.570
How many times have I told you?

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.780
Put the paint back when you're done.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.400
Otherwise, it gets everywhere.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.450
Got it?

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.210
Yeah.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.420
("Waves of the Danube")
(Romania)

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.000
You must've seen this before.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.610
Does it ring a bell?

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.330
Try to remember.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.460
(I thought I'd give it one last try.)

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.820
(Maybe something would come back.)

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.360
(Guess there's no hope.)

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.900
(Forget it.)

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.930
(Let this be a final goodbye.)

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.140
(Hongxing Supply
and Marketing Cooperative)

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.160
Let me see this one.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:12.960
That piece.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:13.680
Sure.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.040
Look.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.810
It just came in.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.950
How much is it?

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.590
Twenty yuan.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.570
Twenty?

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.060
Excuse me,

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.420
could you get that dress down for me?

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.020
Sure. The green one?

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.330
Yes.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:26.900
Alright.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.610
That's for girls.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.330
Nice and pretty.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.460
Boys don't wear dresses.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.020
Put it back.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.140
I'm not wearing it.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.380
It's for you.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.450
I'm not wearing it.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.730
I don't like dresses. Put it back.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.226
Well, I don't like sweaters, either.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.940
You'll freeze in winter without one.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.350
It's not winter yet.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.170
Trust me.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.440
We're getting the sweater.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.070
This one.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.210
My sister gave me the money.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.180
Trust me.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.260
Get the dress.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.810
The sweater.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.970
So which one is it?

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.060
The sweater.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:12:59.670
Wrap this up.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:00.770
Are you sure?

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.330
Sure.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.090
Pure wool, you know.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.940
Thanks.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.540
(Long Live the Great Unity)

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.530
Haven't you always wanted ice cream?

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.250
My treat today.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:11.970
Okay.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.610
No need for the menu.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.130
Two fried pork cutlets,

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:15.970
two borscht...

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.204
- That's enough.
- And two...

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.850
And one ice cream.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:19.730
Thanks.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.330
Just a moment.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.830
The pork cutlets here are great.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.940
And the borscht, too.

00:13:25.048 --> 00:13:26.280
I want you to try everything.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.530
You'll love it.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.060
Did something come back to you?

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:31.610
No.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.610
They're just like the ice cream,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.010
all right here.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.230
Here it comes.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:45.490
Thank you.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.380
Go on, try it.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:12.610
Fang Muyang.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.410
If you get your memory back,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.700
then my job will be done.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.970
Even if I don't get to go to college,

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:31.826
at least, I won't
owe your sister anything.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.450
We'll be square.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.040
No debts between us.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.090
Your fried pork cutlets.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.670
Thank you.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:14.650
By the way,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.890
you're almost fully recovered now.

00:15:17.248 --> 00:15:18.871
You can't stay in the hospital forever.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.600
You'll get sick just being here.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.226
Go to the Educated Youth Office.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.850
Ask them for housing.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.000
You're a hero,
and they won't ignore you.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:26.980
Okay?

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:28.900
Okay.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.140
Fang Muyang.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.050
Remember this.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.890
You saved four people

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.140
in a torrential storm.

00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:23.210
The Educated Youth Office
and the Textile Factory

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:24.740
are obligated to take care of you.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.810
Whatever difficulties you run into,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.440
anything you need, you can ask them.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.610
Personal matters

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.740
and work matters too.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.510
And as long as you're in the hospital,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.970
they owe you a bottle of milk every day.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.180
If the nurse forgets,

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.450
ask the head nurse for it.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.200
All your money's in here.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.200
Including what I owed you before.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.210
It's all inside.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.440
From now on,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.500
whether it's food or clothes,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.020
you need to budget.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.940
I taught you how.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.840
At the rate you spend,

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.580
you won't last a month.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.130
Got it?

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.630
You said a lot today.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.740
I didn't catch it all.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.270
Tell me again tomorrow.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.960
I'm not coming tomorrow.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.950
What about the day after?

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:18.680
Not then either.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.190
Or the day after that.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:23.830
I'm not coming anymore.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:26.370
Fei Ni...

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900
Is it because

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.910
I spent too much today?

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.490
If that's why,

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.290
I'll do it your way from now on.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.640
I'll be frugal.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.050
Look, I can wash my own clothes now.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.860
I sewed my buttons back on.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.110
I just can't quite tie my laces.

00:17:54.804 --> 00:17:56.950
Fine. I'll show you one more time.
Watch closely.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.010
Cross them.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.380
Loop it around.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.630
Pull it through.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.660
Tighten it.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.470
Pull snug.

00:18:15.671 --> 00:18:17.270
Is that how I taught you, Fang Muyang?

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.470
It's too hard.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.550
Teach me again tomorrow.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.980
Are you doing this on purpose?

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.170
Fei Ni.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.970
Don't be mad.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.010
Please don't be mad.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:35.900
I...

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.920
I'll learn tomorrow. I promise.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.690
Just come teach me again.

00:18:41.382 --> 00:18:42.880
I don't even want the money.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.980
You keep it.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:46.260
How long are you going to cling to me?

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.860
I'm not obligated
to tend to you every day!

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.240
I've taken care of you,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.660
and you still can't tie your shoes.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.420
How long are you going to hold me back?

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.250
Yes.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.450
I admit it.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.280
At the beginning, I used you.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.270
But I've taken care of you
all this time.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.250
I did my best.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.900
I never took a cent from you.

00:19:10.004 --> 00:19:11.380
I didn't get into college either.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.890
So we're even.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.600
I owe you an apology.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.270
I'm sorry.

00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:17.115
I shouldn't have dragged you into lying.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.940
I shouldn't have overestimated myself

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.182
and promised your sister
I'd see you through recovery.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.300
This is all on me.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.030
Fang Muyang.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.220
Right now,
I just want to focus on my own life.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.000
I'm disappointed in myself.

00:19:38.182 --> 00:19:39.920
I don't want
to disappoint my family too.

00:19:41.626 --> 00:19:43.271
Let's not see each other anymore.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.450
Fei Ni!

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.900
(Fang Mujing, 100 yuan)

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:34.210
(Fang Muyang!)

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:34.970
(Bad news!)

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:35.950
(Trouble at your house!)

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:39.730
(Yangyang,)

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.860
(don't blame your parents
for not taking care of you.)

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.820
(They had no choice.)

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.690
(Grandma can't stay with you anymore.)

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.480
(Grandma...)

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.000
(Fang Muyang.)

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.860
(You're no longer allowed to live here.)

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.730
(You leave tomorrow)

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.760
(for the countryside.)

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:16.530
(I'm leaving tomorrow.)

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.180
(We agreed
you'd hold onto this for now.)

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.970
(Treat it as a loan.)

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:19.510
(Forget it.)

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.290
(I'm not expecting you
to ever pay me back.)

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:22.860
(Fei Ni!)

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.270
Wait for me.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.360
I promise

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.010
I'll pay you back double.

00:22:36.137 --> 00:22:37.026
Alright.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.160
I'll hold you to it.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.850
Come down.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:25.970
Come down.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.290
Fei Ni.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:39.790
Why are you here again?

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.010
I told you

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.400
to stop seeing me.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.160
Why?

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:46.860
Because

00:23:48.404 --> 00:23:49.440
I have to set boundaries.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.290
Are you marrying Ye Feng?

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.260
Maybe.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.750
But don't worry.

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.530
Even if I'm married
and can't look after you,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.180
the factory will assign someone.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.640
Do you like him?

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.270
I wouldn't say I like him.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.450
But I don't dislike him either.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.080
He's a sensible choice for marriage.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.200
Steady job. A place to live.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.190
Anyway...

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.510
Anyway,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.820
a lot of people don't marry for love.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.250
Then why marry someone you don't love?

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.210
I have my reasons.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.560
My own difficulties.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.010
Only if I get married and move out

00:24:41.937 --> 00:24:43.900
can my brother come back
and get married.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.330
I owe him too much.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.710
Why did you come?

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.060
Fei Ni.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.740
If I get better,

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.260
will you still come see me?

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.280
If you get your memory back,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.550
then my job will be done.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.100
Even if I don't get to go to college,

00:25:17.204 --> 00:25:19.160
at least, I won't
owe your sister anything.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.050
We'll be square.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.660
No debts between us.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:24.290
Fang Muyang.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.560
Fang Muyang!

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:27.970
Fei Ni.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.160
Don't rush.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.250
Once I have a job and a home,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.200
I'll come find you.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.480
Before that,

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.160
don't marry anyone.

(Jiangnan University,
Teaching Building No. 1)

00:26:05.826 --> 00:26:06.770
What a coincidence.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.230
We meet again.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.580
Can I ask you something?

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.240
You teach math, right?

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.280
What are the odds

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.630
that two strangers run
into each other three times?

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.690
Less than 1.5 in ten million.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.250
Do you know
how I got that number?

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.410
I'm listening.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.330
I made it up.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.740
Because your premise is flawed.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.560
Is this really a coincidence?

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.630
You saw my work ID on the train,
didn't you?

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.110
You knew I teach here,

00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:54.160
and that I'm
in the Math Department.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.680
We met at the building entrance,

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.980
and here.
Are these really coincidences?

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.580
What exactly are you after?

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.960
I'm not after anything.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.900
And let me say this again.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.690
On the train, when your bag spilled,

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.920
it was an accident.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.760
I don't go through people's things.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.390
I have basic manners.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.180
Then why are you here?

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.320
Dr. Qu!

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.050
Professor Wu.

00:27:22.426 --> 00:27:23.770
Sorry to keep you waiting. Come.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.693
Have a seat inside.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.330
Get some water.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:31.980
Just a moment.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:32.980
Use this.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.720
I brought this tea back
from Beijing last time.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.180
Alright.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.540
So,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.230
how are your parents?

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.110
They're well.

Adjust the layout here.

These reader letters

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.940
are very representative.

Compile them later.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.350
We'll write back to these readers,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.180
and thank them for their suggestions.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:20.940
Got it.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.110
Excuse me.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:26.320
Hello.

00:28:26.537 --> 00:28:27.600
Who are you looking for?

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.720

I've done a few drawings.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.137
I'd like him to take a look.

We only accept submissions by mail.

President Fu doesn't
have time for walk-ins.

If the vice president's busy,
[*"Fu" sounds like "vice"]

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.250
the president will do.

Are you here to cause trouble?

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.930
Leave. Now.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.230
Or I'll have you escorted out.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.920
I'm not leaving.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.530
I'll wait for your president.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.590
Are you sick or something?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.240
Actually, yes.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.950
I'm still hospitalized.

President Fu.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:16.270
Perfect timing.

Come.

Let's talk inside.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:30.620
Make tea.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.920
Why is he calling him "uncle"?

Ms. Ding.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.860

looking for Professor Wu today?

Dr. Qu Hua.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.780
He's a neurosurgeon
at the People's Hospital.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.100
Very humble and approachable.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.710
He's unlike the other privileged men.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.360
He is?

00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.690
Professor Wu mentioned it.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.590
I heard

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.620
his father's a senior military officer,

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.720
and his mother serves, too.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.190
He comes from a top cadre family.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.380
Then how does he know Professor Wu?

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.430
They go way back.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.450
Professor Wu didn't elaborate.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.850
But this time,

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.130
I think their hospital

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.480
wants to build a statistics system.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.990
They need Professor Wu's help.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.610
They're talking in the admin office.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.850
I saw you two talking earlier.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.110
You don't know him?

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.760
Not really.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.120
We just ran
into each other on a train once.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.680
That's odd.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.250
He mentioned you to Professor Wu.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.900
It sounded like you were close.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.930
What did he say?

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.550
Nothing much.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.130
Just that you'd met a few times.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.730
And that you're good at math.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:57.400
Ms. Ding,

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.310
I forgot something.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.471
You head back to the dorm.

00:31:00.471 --> 00:31:00.940
Alright.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:01.820
See you.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.400
It's obvious

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.630
that your fundamentals are solid.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.010
You've built a strong foundation.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.180
Whether it's line work or color,

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.000
you have your own perspective.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.730
You've had talent
since you were a child.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.660
Your father never admitted it.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.450
I once made a bet with him

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.450
that one day, your achievements

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.320
would rival his.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.180
But now...

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.560
I haven't seen my dad in a long time.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.180
His last letter was six months ago.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.320
When you were unconscious,

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.870
I visited you at the hospital.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.210
After that, work just got too busy.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.730
Uncle Fu,

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.770
if you feel you owe me anything,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.520
then let me work here
full-time as an illustrator.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.640
You haven't changed a bit.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.420
If your father heard that,
he'd skin you alive.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:28.290
But...

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.420
I do appreciate

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.670
your straightforwardness.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.840
That said,

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.490
we have our rules.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.970
Even as president,

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.370
I can't bend them.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.140
You understand?

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.380
I do.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.140
How about this?

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.360
The newspaper and the magazine

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.560
are jointly running a training program.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.340
You enroll in that.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.100
After you finish,

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.050
you can draw serial comics
for the magazine.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.900
It won't be a formal staff position,

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.670
but the stipend

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.870
is quite decent.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.060
How long is the program?

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.650
About two months.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.900
What is it?

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.630
Are you short on money?

00:33:16.737 --> 00:33:17.893
How much do you need?

00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:18.510
I'll cover it.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.210
Uncle Fu,

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.630
it's not money I need.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:21.760
It's a job.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.870
Two months...

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.340
That should work.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:29.830
I'm in.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.130
Good.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.760
I'll make the arrangements.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.490
Uncle Fu,

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.720
I have one more favor.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.900
I've regained my memory,

00:33:43.182 --> 00:33:44.680
but could you keep it quiet for now?

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:45.920
Why?

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:47.840
Because right now,

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.160
I need to be a patient.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.290
What are you plotting this time?

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.490
Alright.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:33:59.380
I'll keep your secret.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:01.800
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:12.260
(Jiangnan University,
Teaching Building No. 1)

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:21.840
Dr. Qu.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.560
I owe you an apology.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.940
You've realized

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.271
that I had no bad intentions.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.610
I'll get going.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.450
Do you have time?

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.340
I'd like to take you to dinner.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.230
I think that works.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.340
Thank you.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.080
Dr. Qu.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.840
Let me formally apologize.

00:35:26.226 --> 00:35:27.830
Sorry for questioning your character.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:29.960
It's alright.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.410
Maybe I do look

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.700
like someone up to no good.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.090
I'm not great at jokes.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.160
Neither am I.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:00.720
May I know

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.350
what you said about me to Professor Wu?

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.530
Are you always this blunt?

00:36:06.582 --> 00:36:09.204
The shortest distance
between two points is a straight line.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:14.810
You're wondering

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.400
if I told Professor Wu

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.940
about the family photo

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.360
in your book, right?

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.530
So you did see it.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.910
Relax.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.550
I didn't say a word to Uncle Wu.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.610
I give you

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.130
my word as a doctor.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:41.920
Thank you.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:47.730
Let's eat.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.220
Are you free on Saturday?

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.210
Why?

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.970
I'll leave here Saturday afternoon.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.670
I want to look around in the morning.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.040
But I'm not familiar with the area.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.250
I might get lost and miss my train.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:16.650
I was hoping

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.490
that you could be my guide.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.670
(I heard)

a senior military officer,)

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.950
(and his mother serves, too.)

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.400
(He comes from a top cadre family.)

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.620
Alright.

Spread out.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.860
How's their training going?

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.700
Very motivated.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.540
Next month,

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.200
we'll definitely beat Factory No. 9.

Who's that girl?

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:13.180
Does she work here?

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:14.710
No.

00:38:14.804 --> 00:38:16.604
From Jiangcheng University, I think.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:18.900
She's been coming
to watch practice lately.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.780
So she's a college student?

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.490

Ms. Xu, I heard

Ye Feng

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.110
might be dating Fei Ni.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.880
Who told you that?

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.780
If he were dating,

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.770
I'd know about it.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:44.650
Don't spread rumors.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.000
Ye Feng's a man,
so it wouldn't hurt him.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.770
But you can't damage
a young lady's reputation.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.220
My mistake, Ms. Xu.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.380
I understand.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.780
Go to logistics.

Okay.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.010
Okay,

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.390
get back in there.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:02.420
You've rested enough.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.350
Focus.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:04.820

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.630
May I

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.470
take a look at that article?

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.900
Of course.

Fang,

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.300
the organization has
approved your medical discharge.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.460
But staying in the hospital long-term

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.940
isn't appropriate.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.970
Don't worry, though.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.280
We're already

00:41:22.293 --> 00:41:24.160
(Director Gao)
looking into a solution.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.740
Director Gao,
there's no need to deliberate.

00:41:27.848 --> 00:41:29.170
I don't have any special requests.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.740
Just a small room will do.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.250
A single-story place is fine.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.250
Near or far, it doesn't matter.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:40.860
Fang.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.830
I know you're a hero.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.340
It wouldn't be unreasonable
to ask for more.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.680
But we have real constraints.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:50.830
You see,

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.200
you're on your own.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.780
You can make do anywhere.

the old dorms will be reassigned

to those without housing
or stuck in temporary housing.

Director Gao,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.130
you read my mind.
