00:00:00.047 --> 00:00:01.717
(Child actors were accompanied by a guardian...)

00:00:01.787 --> 00:00:03.357
(and filmed in a safe, supervised environment.)

00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.667
Are you some kind of pervert?

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:23.607
We slept in each other's arms?

00:00:23.677 --> 00:00:26.507
Please stop that man! He's a stalker. A stalker!

00:00:27.617 --> 00:00:28.617
Hello, everyone.

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:29.747
(Episode 3)

00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:30.817
A pleasure to meet you all.

00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:33.817
Nice to meet you all. Yes, it's great to meet you.

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:35.457
Nice to meet you.

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:39.087
A pleasure to meet you all.

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:42.527
All right!

00:00:43.097 --> 00:00:46.897
- It's a pleasure to meet you all. - Isn't that him from the lobby?

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:49.097
A pleasure to meet you. Yes.

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:52.207
Good to meet you all.

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.947
- Please introduce yourself. - I am so doomed.

00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:09.057
Hello. It is a pleasure to meet you all.

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:12.487
He's a fellow alumnus from my time in Argentina...

00:01:12.587 --> 00:01:16.897
and a former global brand director who worked throughout South America.

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:18.167
Most recently, he worked...

00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:21.297
for the Argentinian meat processor, Asador,

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:23.467
where he successfully led their rebranding.

00:01:24.137 --> 00:01:27.007
Meat processing? So this industry isn't his background?

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.937
To be perfectly honest,

00:01:29.337 --> 00:01:31.747
I don't know the first thing about fashion or design.

00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:34.847
I'm pretty much a layman.

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:39.117
So I'll be counting on all of you for your support.

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:40.417
All right!

00:01:41.557 --> 00:01:43.157
Let's go!

00:01:45.727 --> 00:01:46.927
Let's go!

00:01:48.097 --> 00:01:49.757
- Let's go! - Yes.

00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:59.007
Oh, Ms. Gong Ju Ah?

00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.577
- Yes? - Follow me.

00:02:03.407 --> 00:02:04.607
Yes, Director.

00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:19.587
Aren't you surprised?

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:23.797
Yes. The office is quite simple, Director.

00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:25.727
I'm not talking about that.

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:28.297
Weren't you surprised to see me?

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:35.577
Why? Why would I be surprised, Director?

00:02:36.977 --> 00:02:40.777
Look at you, playing dumb. It's me! The pervert stalker!

00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:44.117
I don't know what you mean.

00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:46.417
I believe this is the first time we've met, sir.

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.517
So that's how you're going to play it?

00:02:53.187 --> 00:02:55.057
Is that my desk?

00:02:56.757 --> 00:02:59.267
I need to get to work.

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:07.007
Last Saturday evening, you saw me...

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.037
at the chicken soup restaurant in Ganghwa.

00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:11.607
You mistook me for a waiter...

00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:13.277
and said, "One soju, please." And now this?

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:15.177
That wasn't me, Director.

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:18.487
You even fell into the ocean. When I offered you my hand,

00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:20.487
you asked if we were dating. And now, you don't remember?

00:03:20.987 --> 00:03:22.187
I did not, Director.

00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:25.957
The samhap at Gaetdari Guesthouse? You said it was delicious.

00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:28.757
- You don't remember that either? - I do not, Director.

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:33.867
We...

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:36.867
Didn't you say we slept in each other's arms?

00:03:39.707 --> 00:03:40.767
I...

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:44.647
That never happened, Director. I said no, so if you continue this,

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:47.547
it'll make me uncomfortable. Please focus on your work.

00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:51.587
You startled me. Okay, whatever.

00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:54.347
Fine, you don't remember. Let's just get to work.

00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:02.397
Oh, contact HR and get the design team's staff files.

00:04:02.397 --> 00:04:03.397
Pardon?

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:05.997
Yes. One moment. Just a second.

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:09.767
The design team's personnel files...

00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:11.167
Is there anything else?

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:15.207
Yes, get the designers' portfolios and their performance reviews.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:16.837
Performance reviews.

00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:18.777
And bring back the clothes I lent you that day.

00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:22.447
Yes. I've already had them washed, so I'll bring them in tomorrow...

00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:34.057
Right. Of course.

00:04:34.387 --> 00:04:37.527
I gave you free food, clothes, and a place to stay,

00:04:37.897 --> 00:04:41.127
and in return, I was treated like a pervert and a stalker.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.237
And to top it off, a complete stranger.

00:04:44.837 --> 00:04:46.107
I'm sorry.

00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:47.537
But...

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:52.207
that was a private incident, so let's just agree to forget it.

00:04:53.277 --> 00:04:57.317
- You really mean that? - Of course, I do.

00:05:03.187 --> 00:05:06.757
Proposals for the design competition over the last three years...

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:10.027
- Compile them all, selected or not. - Yes, Director.

00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:13.927
Also, organise the FG lookbooks, ad visuals, and seasonal proposals.

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:15.867
Yes, Director.

00:05:23.307 --> 00:05:24.907
(Presidential Candidate Nomination Petition)

00:05:24.977 --> 00:05:28.947
- Here you are, sir. - Yes. Thank you.

00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:33.887
What are you going to do if your wife finds out?

00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:38.187
Come on, it's me. You think I can't handle my wife?

00:05:38.257 --> 00:05:39.557
That's right. You can't.

00:05:40.587 --> 00:05:41.927
I agree.

00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:45.697
But what's done is done. How can I undo it?

00:05:45.827 --> 00:05:49.167
It's not done. You can undo it. Give it here.

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:52.537
All we have to do is not turn this in, right?

00:05:54.607 --> 00:05:56.577
So I should just do nothing?

00:05:56.777 --> 00:05:58.647
What about the folks who have been here for decades?

00:05:58.707 --> 00:06:01.047
You want me to let them be evicted, so our Onjeong Market...

00:06:01.107 --> 00:06:03.247
can be used to help Bucket's political career...

00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:05.587
when I know his disgusting plan?

00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:08.017
- You'd just let that happen? - Of course not.

00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:10.957
But the vote is next week. Are you sure you can win?

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:12.127
Of course, I am.

00:06:12.487 --> 00:06:15.097
I'm the most popular guy in Onjeong Market.

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:18.097
Right?

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.427
Everyone here loves my brother.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:21.897
All right!

00:06:25.837 --> 00:06:29.377
You're unpopular at the market. You're going to lose, aren't you?

00:06:29.677 --> 00:06:32.707
I don't get how they knew to raid us at that exact moment.

00:06:33.177 --> 00:06:35.847
It's a bit of a surprise, I admit, but don't worry too much.

00:06:36.077 --> 00:06:40.287
How can we not worry, Se Ri? Will anyone even vote for him?

00:06:40.347 --> 00:06:42.557
Everyone hates him.

00:06:42.817 --> 00:06:45.827
He complains if stalls stick out, saying they're an eyesore.

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:48.497
He hassles shops with long lines to clear the area.

00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:51.257
He gets rid of bowls for stray cats, telling people not to feed them.

00:06:52.027 --> 00:06:55.037
- Even dogs bark when you walk by. - Hey!

00:06:55.097 --> 00:06:56.367
Dong Suk, please.

00:06:57.637 --> 00:06:59.907
Politics isn't about reading the public's mind.

00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:01.707
It's about shaping it.

00:07:02.037 --> 00:07:05.207
I'll stack the deck in our favour, so don't you worry, honey.

00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:10.147
Looks like she's dead set on becoming a councilman's wife.

00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:13.247
Dong Suk, my husband is destined to do great things.

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:14.447
We should aim higher than that.

00:07:16.357 --> 00:07:20.627
Honey, this time, I'll ask Father so we can spend some serious money.

00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:25.427
You have a very strange way of spending money.

00:07:25.497 --> 00:07:28.797
You never buy luxury goods. You just rent them like you're poor.

00:07:28.897 --> 00:07:31.567
What's the point? Trends go out of style so fast.

00:07:31.637 --> 00:07:33.367
Renting is a much more rational choice.

00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:37.077
Spending only has value...

00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:39.307
when the timing and the purpose are right, you see.

00:07:40.647 --> 00:07:41.847
I see.

00:07:42.477 --> 00:07:44.917
Come to think of it, for the other side to challenge you,

00:07:45.187 --> 00:07:46.847
their first worry will have to be money.

00:07:53.457 --> 00:07:54.957
Are you really doing this?

00:07:55.857 --> 00:07:57.527
And you! What were you doing? Why didn't you stop him?

00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:00.667
Why do you always take it out on me when it's his fault?

00:08:00.727 --> 00:08:03.967
Come on, Mom. You know this. To protect the market vendors...

00:08:04.037 --> 00:08:05.407
and avoid having to move...

00:08:05.407 --> 00:08:08.637
No! How many times must I tell you? Withdraw your candidacy now.

00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:14.247
Cat got your tongue? Not answering? Still being stubborn, aren't you?

00:08:14.917 --> 00:08:17.677
My gosh! Your slaps really sting. That hurts!

00:08:18.287 --> 00:08:21.517
I never thought my sons would act like this at this age.

00:08:21.587 --> 00:08:24.927
You're over 50. How could you still be so immature?

00:08:25.257 --> 00:08:28.027
When will you stop making me nag?

00:08:28.097 --> 00:08:31.357
Okay, Mom. I'll stop him, so please stop.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:34.697
You'll collapse at this rate. Calm down. Hey!

00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:36.997
- You need to go see your patients. - I know. Don't touch me.

00:08:36.997 --> 00:08:38.637
Your patients are waiting. Go on. Get going.

00:08:39.737 --> 00:08:42.537
- Come on, go! Go already! - But...

00:08:42.537 --> 00:08:45.247
- Mom, I have so much support... - Goodness. Go, just go.

00:08:45.307 --> 00:08:46.977
- But Mom, this... - Stop, that's enough.

00:08:48.617 --> 00:08:50.117
Honestly...

00:08:51.617 --> 00:08:53.017
This is just ridiculous.

00:08:55.917 --> 00:08:56.917
(Global Strategy Proposal)

00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:03.427
What are you up to?

00:09:04.097 --> 00:09:06.127
I don't even know anymore.

00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:08.997
There's no rhyme or reason to the tasks he gives me. None.

00:09:09.397 --> 00:09:12.637
Hey, it sounds less like a job and more like a punishment.

00:09:12.807 --> 00:09:17.407
Don't tell me they expect me to be the director's permanent secretary.

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:21.177
No way. I'm sure it's just to help him out for the time being.

00:09:24.017 --> 00:09:26.247
Hey, you guys!

00:09:26.947 --> 00:09:30.187
The new director! I heard he's the VP's boyfriend.

00:09:30.557 --> 00:09:34.487
The VP is an only child. He'll marry her to take over.

00:09:34.827 --> 00:09:37.957
- Wow! Are you serious? - It's straight from an executive.

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:39.667
Hey, where did you hear that? Who told you?

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:42.667
So Hye, don't go starting baseless rumours again.

00:09:42.797 --> 00:09:45.037
What? I'm just repeating what I heard.

00:09:51.077 --> 00:09:54.577
Hey. What am I going to do? I went to the VP...

00:09:54.977 --> 00:09:57.417
and told her the director was a stalker and a pervert.

00:09:59.017 --> 00:10:01.887
It's just one thing after another. What are you going to do now?

00:10:03.057 --> 00:10:04.657
I should've just quit.

00:10:05.327 --> 00:10:06.887
I never should have come back.

00:10:13.567 --> 00:10:15.637
Last Saturday's live home shopping broadcast.

00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:18.097
Everyone who went in and out of the studio that day,

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:21.267
or visited in the days before. Check every single one.

00:10:21.637 --> 00:10:22.637
Understood.

00:10:32.417 --> 00:10:35.117
Do you really think someone tampered with the outfit on purpose?

00:10:36.017 --> 00:10:39.927
Maybe not, but we have to make sure.

00:10:40.487 --> 00:10:42.357
An innocent person was put in an awkward position,

00:10:42.657 --> 00:10:44.827
and Gong Ju Ah's entire team got fired.

00:10:45.767 --> 00:10:46.867
How can we just let it slide?

00:10:47.797 --> 00:10:48.837
Pacu Nacho.

00:10:49.237 --> 00:10:50.937
Seriously, what's the deal between you and Gong Ju Ah?

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:53.407
Can you just drop it, please?

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:56.907
Talk, or I'll tell everybody that Pacu Nacho is my boyfriend,

00:10:56.977 --> 00:10:59.847
and he's marrying me to take over the company. How about that?

00:10:59.907 --> 00:11:01.547
You've already done that.

00:11:01.547 --> 00:11:03.477
Everyone was glaring at me at the executive meeting.

00:11:04.717 --> 00:11:06.487
So just spit it out already.

00:11:06.947 --> 00:11:08.957
Before I start making up even more rumours.

00:11:14.087 --> 00:11:15.097
She was my first love.

00:11:15.327 --> 00:11:17.627
No way! When?

00:11:17.997 --> 00:11:19.527
Before you left? How old were you?

00:11:19.527 --> 00:11:21.567
I was in 9th grade, and she was in 10th.

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:23.567
So cute.

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.267
Does she even recognise you?

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:31.077
She didn't seem to. She called me a pervert and a stalker.

00:11:32.607 --> 00:11:33.907
This is getting interesting.

00:11:35.647 --> 00:11:37.877
This is just the drama my boring work life needed.

00:11:39.987 --> 00:11:41.017
Whatever.

00:11:48.187 --> 00:11:52.597
It's past 7pm. Where is he? He's such a slacker, I swear.

00:11:58.067 --> 00:11:59.137
Woo Jae? What's up?

00:12:00.707 --> 00:12:04.107
When am I getting off? I have no idea. Why?

00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:07.247
What?

00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:11.047
Dad's running for president of the Merchants' Association?

00:12:11.447 --> 00:12:13.447
You have got to be kidding me.

00:12:14.187 --> 00:12:15.817
Hey, Woo Jae, what about Mom? Does she know?

00:12:17.157 --> 00:12:21.227
No? Good. Make absolutely sure she doesn't find out. Okay?

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:26.927
Here's the draft of the contract. Review it and give me your feedback.

00:12:27.567 --> 00:12:30.037
This feels suspiciously rushed.

00:12:30.567 --> 00:12:33.607
Why do I get the feeling you just swapped the name on the contract?

00:12:34.237 --> 00:12:36.337
Man, you don't miss a thing.

00:12:37.307 --> 00:12:38.377
I knew it.

00:12:38.747 --> 00:12:41.107
It was originally supposed to be for Choi Seo Jin.

00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:43.347
So why the switch to me?

00:12:43.717 --> 00:12:46.717
- What happened with her? - She's got some serious issues.

00:12:48.217 --> 00:12:51.887
Her husband apparently took investments under her name...

00:12:52.427 --> 00:12:53.557
and gambled it all away.

00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:57.897
- Oh, my. - We're killing the stories for now,

00:12:58.597 --> 00:13:00.297
but it's only a matter of time before the story breaks.

00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:02.897
That must be a huge blow to her image.

00:13:03.237 --> 00:13:04.897
That's just how the industry is these days.

00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:06.737
It's not just the talent.

00:13:06.737 --> 00:13:08.737
Their families get dragged into it too,

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:12.077
and if one little thing goes wrong, it's a total media frenzy.

00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:17.047
Hold on.

00:13:18.787 --> 00:13:20.747
Hui Gyeong? What's going on?

00:13:22.817 --> 00:13:23.817
What?

00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:29.297
Are we sure about this?

00:13:30.097 --> 00:13:34.867
Honey, I think a husband and wife should never keep secrets.

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:36.667
Right.

00:13:37.197 --> 00:13:39.037
We did the right thing for my brother and his wife, right?

00:13:39.107 --> 00:13:42.537
Of course. If you'd kept it a secret and she found out later,

00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:46.577
- you'd have taken the blame for it. - Yes. You're right.

00:13:46.847 --> 00:13:47.847
We did the right thing.

00:13:56.787 --> 00:13:59.087
- Hey, Mom. - I already told you no.

00:13:59.857 --> 00:14:01.857
Do you really want Seong Mi to divorce you?

00:14:02.127 --> 00:14:04.227
Come on, I can just keep it a secret from her.

00:14:04.457 --> 00:14:05.467
What did you say?

00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:08.397
Okay, fine! I get it. Goodness gracious.

00:14:11.067 --> 00:14:12.067
Oh, dear.

00:14:15.877 --> 00:14:17.677
- What? - What? What is it?

00:14:17.977 --> 00:14:18.977
Is that Seong Mi?

00:14:20.507 --> 00:14:21.547
Yes.

00:14:22.847 --> 00:14:24.677
Yes, honey.

00:14:26.217 --> 00:14:28.517
Yes, okay. Got it.

00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:34.457
Who was it?

00:14:35.327 --> 00:14:36.497
Who snitched?

00:14:36.797 --> 00:14:38.827
- Was it you? You? - It wasn't me!

00:14:38.897 --> 00:14:39.897
It wasn't me, either.

00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:45.037
- Was it you, Mom? - Why? What did Seong Mi say?

00:14:45.237 --> 00:14:47.607
She said she's on her way to the clinic right now!

00:14:48.877 --> 00:14:50.577
You'd better get going now. Hurry.

00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:53.377
Dad, you're so dead.

00:14:53.647 --> 00:14:55.977
How could... Mom, this is on you!

00:14:56.717 --> 00:14:58.377
Man... I...

00:15:02.557 --> 00:15:04.917
I told you to just let them raise their rent, didn't I?

00:15:05.427 --> 00:15:08.357
I told you to stop worrying about the market.

00:15:09.157 --> 00:15:10.997
Seong Mi, please just hear me out.

00:15:11.257 --> 00:15:13.767
What? Merchants' Association President?

00:15:14.427 --> 00:15:18.467
- It's a fight for our livelihood... - Don't make me laugh!

00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:22.737
You have a saviour complex.

00:15:23.177 --> 00:15:26.747
You get your sense of self-worth from solving others' problems.

00:15:26.807 --> 00:15:28.347
It's a narcissistic compulsion.

00:15:28.777 --> 00:15:31.647
Okay, fine. I get it, but...

00:15:32.587 --> 00:15:37.317
Please, just this once, okay? Just let me do it my way. Please?

00:15:37.717 --> 00:15:40.387
- It won't even cost much money. - Do you think this is about money?

00:15:40.457 --> 00:15:44.297
- Then what is it about? - Director Song brought my contract.

00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:46.367
Do you have any idea what it says?

00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:48.937
If I start a scandal or leave the show...

00:15:48.937 --> 00:15:50.097
due to any fault of my own,

00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:52.207
my career will be over,

00:15:52.737 --> 00:15:55.107
and I have to pay a penalty equal to three times my fee.

00:15:55.707 --> 00:15:59.247
If you get tangled up in some fight over this election or whatever,

00:15:59.377 --> 00:16:01.307
it's going to affect me, too!

00:16:01.847 --> 00:16:04.977
That will never happen. Okay? I promise.

00:16:04.977 --> 00:16:07.117
When have you ever kept a promise?

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.087
So you really don't want me to do it?

00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:25.037
These are the endorsement letters I got from the merchants.

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:28.307
If you tell me to stop, I really won't do it.

00:16:28.577 --> 00:16:30.307
I've been trying to stop you this whole time.

00:16:41.187 --> 00:16:42.187
There. Happy?

00:16:44.717 --> 00:16:47.357
Honestly, I'm jealous of one thing when it comes to Yang Dong Ik.

00:16:50.327 --> 00:16:52.697
His wife always takes his side,

00:16:52.997 --> 00:16:56.467
and she's so supportive, so he can always hold his head high.

00:16:56.567 --> 00:16:57.837
I'm honestly jealous of that.

00:16:59.737 --> 00:17:00.767
Are you...

00:17:02.437 --> 00:17:03.837
Are you comparing me to her right now?

00:17:04.877 --> 00:17:08.077
- What? - If she's great, go live with her!

00:17:10.317 --> 00:17:11.347
No, that's not what I meant.

00:17:12.587 --> 00:17:16.387
My gosh, I shouldn't have said that. What was I thinking? Oh, boy...

00:17:16.457 --> 00:17:18.117
What am I going to do? Man...

00:17:24.597 --> 00:17:25.797
(Gong Myeong Jeong Dae Han Clinic)

00:17:25.867 --> 00:17:26.867
You scared me.

00:17:28.127 --> 00:17:29.167
Hello.

00:17:30.237 --> 00:17:31.337
What are you doing here?

00:17:31.397 --> 00:17:34.307
Oh, I was just heading home after a meeting with the PR agency,

00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:36.607
but I heard shouting coming from inside.

00:17:37.377 --> 00:17:40.607
- So you were eavesdropping? - Eavesdropping? No.

00:17:41.177 --> 00:17:43.677
Don't worry. I couldn't hear everything clearly.

00:17:43.947 --> 00:17:45.077
Like you didn't hear everything.

00:17:46.987 --> 00:17:50.187
I might've heard the part about you being jealous of me.

00:17:50.357 --> 00:17:52.557
Just a little? A tiny bit?

00:17:54.127 --> 00:17:56.697
Well, it's a good thing you stopped him.

00:17:56.957 --> 00:18:00.527
Dr. Gong as Merchants' President? Especially when you're struggling.

00:18:01.097 --> 00:18:02.567
Who said we're struggling?

00:18:02.897 --> 00:18:07.037
So, I'll just assume he's dropping out of the race.

00:18:07.407 --> 00:18:10.377
You are certainly the wise one.

00:18:10.777 --> 00:18:13.707
No point fighting a losing battle, right?

00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:15.847
A losing battle?

00:18:16.677 --> 00:18:17.677
See you around.

00:18:18.787 --> 00:18:21.517
(Gong Myeong Jeong Dae Han Clinic)

00:18:33.227 --> 00:18:34.997
What is it? What's wrong?

00:18:36.397 --> 00:18:38.097
Oh, I'm going to throw this out.

00:18:38.097 --> 00:18:40.167
I wasn't trying to glue them back together. I'm throwing these away.

00:18:40.237 --> 00:18:41.237
Honey.

00:18:42.437 --> 00:18:43.577
Are you really confident?

00:18:43.937 --> 00:18:44.937
What?

00:18:46.747 --> 00:18:50.277
Yes! I'm confident. I'll make sure it won't affect you.

00:18:50.277 --> 00:18:52.687
Not that. Are you confident you can win?

00:18:53.447 --> 00:18:55.687
I am. Of course, I am!

00:18:56.517 --> 00:19:00.027
Don't you dare lose. You have to win. Got it?

00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:02.257
Yes! Got it!

00:19:03.227 --> 00:19:05.097
- Seong Mi, thank you. - My gosh.

00:19:05.797 --> 00:19:08.267
- Go away. - Okay, I'll leave you alone.

00:19:08.797 --> 00:19:10.037
But really, thank you.

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.037
Yes!

00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:15.807
You really let him do it?

00:19:16.407 --> 00:19:19.577
I thought you'd be against it. What made you change your mind?

00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:23.277
Just look how happy it makes him.

00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.217
Thank you so much, Seong Mi.

00:19:27.647 --> 00:19:31.257
Mom, I checked the campaign budget, and it really won't cost much.

00:19:31.787 --> 00:19:32.887
That's a relief.

00:19:32.957 --> 00:19:34.787
I thought of a few more items and added them,

00:19:35.057 --> 00:19:37.157
and it looks like we'll have to make the promo materials ourselves.

00:19:37.697 --> 00:19:41.497
- I can help with that. - Thanks, sweetie. Really?

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:46.107
Right. Where do we even start? Posters? No, the campaign promises?

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:48.267
Yes. Let's do the promises first. Right?

00:19:49.507 --> 00:19:51.177
Oh, man. I'm so nervous!

00:19:52.347 --> 00:19:54.007
Dad, calm down.

00:19:54.877 --> 00:19:57.917
I can't help it. I'm just so happy.

00:19:59.987 --> 00:20:02.917
Pledges... What should I do first? Any good ideas?

00:20:02.987 --> 00:20:04.957
- Just come up with five. - Five of them?

00:20:05.017 --> 00:20:07.057
- Five should be enough. - Well...

00:20:07.127 --> 00:20:09.127
(Taehan)

00:20:13.527 --> 00:20:14.527
Oh, boy.

00:20:15.397 --> 00:20:16.967
You're here already, sir.

00:20:17.197 --> 00:20:21.167
From now on, stop by Latte Monde and get me a Choco Chip Frappuccino.

00:20:22.707 --> 00:20:23.707
Sure.

00:20:23.837 --> 00:20:27.147
With low-fat milk, 1 mocha syrup, and 1 espresso shot.

00:20:28.147 --> 00:20:31.117
Add an espresso shot... Yes, I'll go get it now.

00:20:31.177 --> 00:20:33.517
Blend half the chips. For the topping, use the rest,

00:20:33.517 --> 00:20:35.887
with extra whip. Add a drizzle of chocolate syrup.

00:20:37.687 --> 00:20:38.827
Yes, sir.

00:20:44.427 --> 00:20:47.267
Set up a snack station. I need it for brainpower and sugar.

00:20:47.627 --> 00:20:48.627
Yes, sir.

00:20:48.627 --> 00:20:51.597
Every Monday, list restaurants for lunch that week.

00:20:51.867 --> 00:20:55.007
Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Western. Ensure a balanced mix.

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:56.877
They must have a rating of 4.5 or higher.

00:20:57.677 --> 00:20:59.047
Yes, sir.

00:20:59.877 --> 00:21:01.977
Air out the office three times a day.

00:21:01.977 --> 00:21:03.017
For the diffuser...

00:21:05.547 --> 00:21:07.017
Use a eucalyptus-based scent.

00:21:07.887 --> 00:21:08.887
Yes, sir.

00:21:11.257 --> 00:21:12.257
And...

00:21:12.687 --> 00:21:15.427
Dust everything to keep the air clean.

00:21:15.727 --> 00:21:17.497
- Yes, sir. - Right away!

00:21:17.757 --> 00:21:18.757
Yes, sir!

00:21:37.117 --> 00:21:38.477
Bring me the work I assigned you yesterday.

00:21:39.017 --> 00:21:40.187
Yes, sir.

00:21:41.317 --> 00:21:43.017
Here are the documents you requested.

The title font has no impact. Change it to Gaeseong Art, size 36.

00:21:51.097 --> 00:21:52.097
Do it over.

00:21:53.197 --> 00:21:54.567
Yes, sir.

00:22:00.237 --> 00:22:02.937
This is hard to read. Widen spacing, underline for stress.

00:22:03.007 --> 00:22:05.237
Also, it feels more balanced when the page count is even.

00:22:06.247 --> 00:22:08.207
- Do it over. - Yes, sir.

Always staple these diagonally.

00:22:22.627 --> 00:22:24.697
Otherwise, the angle is all wrong when you turn the page!

00:22:24.757 --> 00:22:26.267
Do it over!

00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:27.867
Yes, sir.

00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:36.307
It was just a dream.

00:22:51.417 --> 00:22:52.457
Done.

00:22:58.257 --> 00:22:59.697
Good morning, sir.

00:23:00.827 --> 00:23:03.897
- You're here already? - Yes. I cleaned and aired it out.

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:06.267
I also stocked the snack station and set up the diffuser.

00:23:10.477 --> 00:23:12.547
From now on, you don't have to clean my desk.

00:23:13.377 --> 00:23:15.777
- I'm sorry? - I should clean my own desk.

00:23:16.147 --> 00:23:17.377
Oh, okay.

00:23:17.677 --> 00:23:20.647
What coffee can I get you? A Chocolate Chip Frappuccino?

00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:23.087
I should make my own coffee, too.

00:23:25.317 --> 00:23:28.387
Do you need any supplies, then?

00:23:28.997 --> 00:23:31.697
I already put in a request with Support for what I need.

00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:33.867
I see.

00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:35.997
What's this?

00:23:36.067 --> 00:23:38.697
Here are the files you asked for. They're in reverse date order,

00:23:38.697 --> 00:23:40.337
so you can start with the most recent ones.

00:23:41.407 --> 00:23:45.077
You did all this in one day? You must have stayed late.

00:23:45.137 --> 00:23:46.277
Yes, well...

00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:50.777
Sorry, I didn't call you yesterday.

00:23:50.777 --> 00:23:52.487
I went apartment hunting after the executive meeting.

00:23:52.917 --> 00:23:56.887
Tell me what you're looking for. I can look into it for you, sir.

00:23:57.557 --> 00:24:00.187
Why? That's my personal business.

00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:03.657
Right.

It's already been three hours.

00:24:45.967 --> 00:24:47.237
Has it been that long already?

00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:51.207
- Well, should we go get some lunch? - Sure.

00:24:51.607 --> 00:24:54.347
Gyeongmun's has good soft tofu stew, and so is the pot rice at Cheonghae.

00:24:54.407 --> 00:24:58.977
Suwonjang has great jjamppong. Laura's Grill has good Western food.

00:24:59.117 --> 00:25:00.447
What about pork cutlet?

00:25:00.947 --> 00:25:02.787
Pork cutlet is my favourite.

00:25:03.257 --> 00:25:04.417
Pork cutlet?

00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:09.857
There's a place nearby. Should we go?

00:25:11.897 --> 00:25:12.897
Never mind.

00:25:13.797 --> 00:25:15.997
Checking out restaurants is a personal hobby of mine.

00:25:15.997 --> 00:25:17.267
Let's not mix business with pleasure.

00:25:17.937 --> 00:25:18.937
What?

00:25:32.587 --> 00:25:35.857
Seriously? You just sat there for three hours?

00:25:36.217 --> 00:25:37.387
I know, right?

00:25:37.857 --> 00:25:41.187
I was totally prepared for him to get his revenge.

00:25:41.487 --> 00:25:42.957
But he's not giving me a hard time at all.

00:25:43.327 --> 00:25:47.167
Clever. He knew you'd be prepared, so he held back?

00:25:47.227 --> 00:25:50.967
That's what I'm saying. He's as unpredictable as ever.

00:25:51.597 --> 00:25:54.107
- I'll have to be extra careful. - Hello.

00:25:55.567 --> 00:25:59.177
- Do you mind if I sit here? - Not at all. Please, have a seat.

00:26:07.917 --> 00:26:08.917
There we go.

00:26:12.087 --> 00:26:14.157
- Enjoy your meal. - You, too.

00:26:16.427 --> 00:26:18.227
- What? - Just eat.

00:26:29.207 --> 00:26:31.477
The food in our cafeteria is incredible.

00:26:32.107 --> 00:26:37.017
I thought lotus root would be chewy, but it's wonderfully crisp.

00:26:37.077 --> 00:26:40.947
And you get that hint of ginger. Truly the work of a master chef.

00:26:45.927 --> 00:26:48.987
But isn't a one-hour lunch break...

00:26:49.057 --> 00:26:50.557
a little stingy, Seong Min?

00:26:51.057 --> 00:26:52.057
Pardon?

00:26:53.267 --> 00:26:54.597
Me?

00:26:56.197 --> 00:26:59.367
Shouldn't you have time to eat, take a little walk,

00:26:59.437 --> 00:27:02.067
grab some coffee, and chat for a bit, too?

00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:05.377
That's how you come back refreshed and work more efficiently.

00:27:05.837 --> 00:27:07.607
- Right, So Hye? - Pardon?

00:27:08.307 --> 00:27:09.317
Right.

00:27:12.417 --> 00:27:13.417
Go on, eat.

00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:17.217
Just eat.

00:27:31.867 --> 00:27:35.137
- He knows everyone's name already. - I know, right?

00:27:35.637 --> 00:27:38.037
He only heard them this morning. When did he have time to learn them?

00:27:38.977 --> 00:27:42.207
What do you think he's trying to do, winning everyone over?

00:27:43.477 --> 00:27:48.087
Maybe he just wants to get along. He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.

00:27:49.357 --> 00:27:51.187
I can't let my guard down for one second.

00:28:35.627 --> 00:28:37.967
- What meds are you taking? - Why are you here?

00:28:38.037 --> 00:28:39.637
I came to see you, silly.

00:28:42.707 --> 00:28:45.137
Seriously, what's wrong? Why are you taking medicine?

00:28:45.137 --> 00:28:46.707
It's just for a headache.

00:28:46.807 --> 00:28:50.017
Seriously! How dare you get sick without my permission?

00:28:50.017 --> 00:28:52.017
If you keep showing up, I'm switching study cafes.

00:28:52.077 --> 00:28:55.547
It's no use. I'd find you no matter where you hid.

00:28:57.017 --> 00:29:00.287
Eun Bin, don't you have any dreams?

00:29:00.357 --> 00:29:03.327
Try something with a future. Or get a hobby, at least.

00:29:03.397 --> 00:29:06.567
Hey, I'm an influencer, you know.

00:29:06.627 --> 00:29:09.027
You can't be an influencer with 250 followers.

Hey, that's a lot of followers!

00:29:10.937 --> 00:29:13.437

00:29:14.937 --> 00:29:17.777
Right. Good for you. It's good to be positive.

Gosh, I'm so torn. Who do I root for?

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:35.887
My dad or yours? That is the question.

00:29:36.127 --> 00:29:37.657
Root for your own dad.

00:29:39.367 --> 00:29:41.727
Hey, do you want me to be your spy?

00:29:42.467 --> 00:29:45.537
- What? - Like the movies, risking it all.

00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:48.407
I'll leak my dad's campaign strategy to you.

00:29:50.277 --> 00:29:52.037
So what's the strategy?

00:29:52.747 --> 00:29:55.747
If I tell you, we'll start dating today. Deal?

00:29:58.517 --> 00:30:02.417

00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:03.417
And you call yourself educated?

Yes, cross your arms for me. Perfect. Fantastic. That's great.

- Have some water, honey. - Okay.

00:30:20.967 --> 00:30:22.977
With you here, I feel like I can do anything.

00:30:23.607 --> 00:30:25.177
So handsome.

00:30:27.307 --> 00:30:32.047
Now a smile, with a determined pose! Great. Yes, that's it.

00:30:32.147 --> 00:30:35.747
Yes, that's it. Fire in your eyes. One, two, three! Look at the camera!

He's just amazing.

00:30:51.497 --> 00:30:54.067
A simple headshot was all we needed.

00:30:54.067 --> 00:30:56.177
He's not running for the National Assembly.

00:30:56.207 --> 00:30:59.607
So why spend all this money on a Merchants' Association vote?

00:30:59.607 --> 00:31:02.147
If we're going to do it, we should do it right.

00:31:02.977 --> 00:31:05.117
Dong Ik, did you see the budget from the PR firm?

00:31:05.547 --> 00:31:08.487
What's all this about merchandise? And hiring a singer? It's too much.

00:31:08.687 --> 00:31:10.887
Why did you tag along just to nitpick everything I do?

00:31:13.827 --> 00:31:15.387
I wonder what the other side is up to.

00:31:16.597 --> 00:31:18.627
Well, what could they possibly be doing?

00:31:19.697 --> 00:31:21.067
- Nice! - Oh, come on in.

00:31:21.127 --> 00:31:22.527
That's it, great expression.

00:31:22.867 --> 00:31:24.167
- Yes, it's a pleasure. - This is so great!

00:31:24.237 --> 00:31:26.767
- Nice! - Hey, that's so you. Smile!

00:31:26.837 --> 00:31:28.637
- Okay. - Bow.

00:31:28.637 --> 00:31:30.137
You're always welcome! Yes. Goodness.

00:31:30.207 --> 00:31:32.847
That's it! Applause! Again, greet them.

Oh, my. You're looking so much better.

00:31:36.777 --> 00:31:38.447
- Shake his hand! - Right, a handshake.

00:31:38.517 --> 00:31:39.917
- With warmth! - Oh, my.

00:31:39.987 --> 00:31:41.917
- Yes, get a tight shot. - You'll feel better in no time.

00:31:41.987 --> 00:31:45.057
Could you get a little closer? Yes, great.

00:31:45.157 --> 00:31:48.387
All right, that's great. Give us a smile. One, two, three!

Yes, this one's got a great feel. The sign shop will give us a deal.

Okay.

- Let me see. - Is this really going to be enough?

00:32:07.747 --> 00:32:09.617
I heard the other side hired professionals for everything.

00:32:09.747 --> 00:32:12.577
Please. It's just for the Merchants' Association election.

00:33:54.817 --> 00:33:58.357
ultimately, my job is to resonate with people.

00:34:09.767 --> 00:34:11.097
(In front of elevators)

00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:13.737
(West entrance)

00:34:13.807 --> 00:34:15.367
(B1 parking lot)

00:34:18.237 --> 00:34:21.007
I passed on the CCTV footage from that day to the new director.

00:34:21.307 --> 00:34:22.407
You gave it to the director?

00:34:23.147 --> 00:34:24.877
Why would he need that?

00:34:26.647 --> 00:34:27.647
Why do you ask?

00:34:28.087 --> 00:34:31.657
If we find there's an issue, it's for the company to handle.

00:34:32.887 --> 00:34:35.087
Don't you worry about it, Ms. Gong. Just focus on your work.

00:34:36.527 --> 00:34:38.397
Okay, thank you.

00:34:44.037 --> 00:34:46.807
What is with that unpredictable, thoughtful side of his?

00:34:47.407 --> 00:34:49.737
He's more dedicated to his work than I thought, too.

00:34:50.237 --> 00:34:51.237
Ms. Gong?

00:34:52.137 --> 00:34:54.847
- Yes, sir? - I was looking at your portfolio,

00:34:54.907 --> 00:34:58.677
and it had a raw sensibility and a strong experimental vibe.

00:34:58.977 --> 00:35:03.587
Your new work's more conventional. Is there a reason for that?

00:35:05.187 --> 00:35:09.087
For big brands, sales come first. And you have to minimize risk,

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:11.527
so it's hard to inject my own personal style into it.

00:35:11.857 --> 00:35:13.397
You have to follow the brand's direction.

00:35:14.067 --> 00:35:16.327
That makes sense.

00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:25.677
My new car was delivered today. Can I give you a ride home?

00:35:26.137 --> 00:35:28.677
Isn't your hotel nearby, sir?

00:35:28.847 --> 00:35:32.117
Oh, I'm actually going to visit my family today.

00:35:32.347 --> 00:35:34.117
It's on my way, so I can just drop you off.

00:35:35.147 --> 00:35:38.717
But do you even know where I live?

00:35:42.957 --> 00:35:46.767
I saw your HR file. You live in Onjeong, right?

00:35:47.227 --> 00:35:49.167
Yes, that's right. Onjeong.

00:35:49.627 --> 00:35:53.437
- So your family lives near Onjeong. - Yes.

00:35:53.937 --> 00:35:55.867
I see.

00:36:10.957 --> 00:36:12.017
There we go. Perfect.

00:36:17.897 --> 00:36:20.897
- This is delicious. - How is it? Good?

00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:23.367
Yes, it's a feast fit for a king.

00:36:23.437 --> 00:36:27.007
- You should cook like this often. - Tell me about it.

00:36:28.267 --> 00:36:30.307
Why are you all sitting around while Se Ri does everything?

00:36:30.637 --> 00:36:32.277
No, that's not it.

00:36:32.637 --> 00:36:35.647
We were working this whole time. We just sat down for a break.

00:36:36.717 --> 00:36:40.347
Grandpa, I need to buy some new filming equipment.

00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:41.917
Could you give me some money?

00:36:42.947 --> 00:36:44.557
Are you out of your mind?

00:36:45.287 --> 00:36:48.287
You've graduated, so get a job. What's with this "filming?"

00:36:49.427 --> 00:36:52.697
Come on, Dad. Go easy on her. She's your only granddaughter.

00:36:52.757 --> 00:36:54.697
Quiet! And that goes for you, too.

00:36:56.497 --> 00:36:57.697
You're all a bunch of leeches.

00:36:58.167 --> 00:36:59.437
- Grandfather! - Dad!

00:37:00.607 --> 00:37:03.067
Here you go, Father. I was just about to bring you some.

00:37:03.137 --> 00:37:05.607
- Have some while it's hot. - Give me more.

00:37:05.737 --> 00:37:09.447
Not yet. We're waiting for Hyun Bin. Just have a taste for now, Father.

00:37:09.977 --> 00:37:10.977
Fine.

00:37:11.717 --> 00:37:13.987
Auntie, why does Grandfather hate us so much?

00:37:14.247 --> 00:37:17.557
Hey! Do you really have to ask? You take after your mother who left,

00:37:17.657 --> 00:37:21.027
and I take after my mother who left. That's why he can't stand us.

00:37:21.357 --> 00:37:23.597
It's so frustrating. He only ever dotes on my stepmom.

00:37:24.357 --> 00:37:25.927
If only you two were half as good as Se Ri,

00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:27.497
I'd spoil you rotten.

00:37:27.827 --> 00:37:30.067
Great, Dad's starting his usual spiel.

00:37:30.637 --> 00:37:32.137
She saved me when I was on my deathbed,

00:37:32.237 --> 00:37:35.667
and she's the one who made our family into what it is today.

00:37:43.247 --> 00:37:44.517
What's with Grandpa?

00:37:57.027 --> 00:37:59.257
How long has it been since you last visited your family home?

00:38:00.067 --> 00:38:04.067
I believe you said you moved out when you were a teenager.

00:38:04.337 --> 00:38:07.267
Oh, I did move back for a bit for my military service.

00:38:07.767 --> 00:38:09.037
So after I was discharged...

00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:10.907
I guess it's been about ten years?

00:38:11.177 --> 00:38:12.507
I see.

00:38:13.447 --> 00:38:14.907
That must feel a little awkward.

00:38:15.907 --> 00:38:18.447
Tell me about it. I don't really want to go,

00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:21.517
but they know I'm back in Korea, so I have to show my face once.

00:38:23.457 --> 00:38:27.157
Maybe because it's been so long, I'm actually a little nervous.

00:38:30.457 --> 00:38:32.597
In that case...

00:38:33.057 --> 00:38:36.537
To help you relax, could I ask you a question?

00:38:36.597 --> 00:38:37.597
Sure, anything.

00:38:38.397 --> 00:38:41.607
How did you end up getting into branding?

00:38:43.837 --> 00:38:47.707
I've always liked making obscure things shine.

00:38:48.507 --> 00:38:52.917
When I saw unloved brands, pushed aside and forgotten,

00:38:53.787 --> 00:38:55.447
that didn't belong anywhere,

00:38:55.987 --> 00:38:58.217
I saw a reflection of myself, just drifting.

00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:11.397
Thank you for the ride.

00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:14.567
- Go on in. - Yes. Drive safe.

00:39:37.457 --> 00:39:39.057
This place hasn't changed a bit.

00:40:08.027 --> 00:40:09.027
Hey, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:40:10.057 --> 00:40:11.497
What are you doing on this street, you jinx?

00:40:11.857 --> 00:40:14.367
You're an embarrassment. Didn't we tell you to move?

00:40:15.127 --> 00:40:16.967
Your grandma had an affair, and your mom cheated on your dad.

00:40:17.197 --> 00:40:18.197
Have you no shame?

00:40:18.937 --> 00:40:21.707
Hey, I bet every girl he dates is going to cheat on him, too.

00:40:25.837 --> 00:40:26.847
What was that? Darn...

00:40:27.747 --> 00:40:29.777
What do you think? You little...

00:40:30.747 --> 00:40:32.217
I'm Gong Ju Ah, his saviour.

00:40:33.077 --> 00:40:34.147
Whatever.

00:40:34.147 --> 00:40:37.617
How dare you punks cause trouble in our sacred alleys? It's assault!

00:40:37.617 --> 00:40:40.457
We didn't assault anyone. You're the one who hit us.

00:40:40.457 --> 00:40:42.927
Hey, verbal assault is still assault!

00:40:43.287 --> 00:40:45.797
You guys started it, so I was just defending him.

00:40:45.857 --> 00:40:47.167
You rotten little punks!

00:40:47.827 --> 00:40:52.297
If you ever mess with him again, I'll tear you limb from limb.

00:40:53.097 --> 00:40:56.567
They call me the Hyena of Onjeong. Why?

00:40:57.307 --> 00:41:00.377
Because once I sink my teeth in, I never let go.

00:41:00.977 --> 00:41:01.977
Like this!

00:41:03.177 --> 00:41:04.717
What the... Hey, let's go.

00:41:11.087 --> 00:41:12.717
Are you okay, Hyun Bin?

00:41:13.627 --> 00:41:15.287
Yes, Ju Ah.

00:41:17.327 --> 00:41:19.027
It's the adults' fault.

00:41:19.627 --> 00:41:21.027
It's not your fault at all.

00:41:21.897 --> 00:41:24.467
Okay. Thank you.

00:41:25.537 --> 00:41:27.837
What should we eat to make you feel better?

00:41:29.407 --> 00:41:31.137
I heard a great new pork cutlet spot just opened.

00:41:32.277 --> 00:41:33.307
Do you like pork cutlets?

00:41:33.947 --> 00:41:34.947
Yes.

00:41:35.477 --> 00:41:36.477
I do.

00:41:38.017 --> 00:41:39.017
Let's go.

00:41:53.357 --> 00:41:54.427
I like you.

00:41:55.267 --> 00:41:56.667
It's not the pork cutlets I like.

00:41:57.567 --> 00:41:59.967
It's you, Gong Ju Ah.

00:42:24.457 --> 00:42:25.457
How have you been?

00:42:26.527 --> 00:42:27.697
You still recognise me, don't you, Grandpa?

00:42:27.997 --> 00:42:28.997
You little brat.

00:42:29.427 --> 00:42:32.467
Seeing as you recognise me, you haven't lost your marbles yet.

00:42:32.767 --> 00:42:35.107
You look a lot older, though.

00:42:35.467 --> 00:42:36.467
What was that?

00:42:37.177 --> 00:42:39.177
Looks like all you've learned is how to be bratty.

00:42:40.207 --> 00:42:42.077
Enough wandering around. Move back home.

00:42:43.177 --> 00:42:45.047
No thanks. Not until after you're gone, Grandpa.

00:42:45.447 --> 00:42:46.477
Before I die...

00:42:47.987 --> 00:42:51.317
- You little brat! - Man, I'm hungry.

00:42:51.887 --> 00:42:53.627
I'm hungry. I might as well eat before I go.

00:43:17.577 --> 00:43:21.217
If I knew Stepmother cooked so well, I would've never studied abroad.

00:43:22.217 --> 00:43:23.287
Thanks for the compliment.

00:43:24.887 --> 00:43:27.327
You're the eldest son of this family.

00:43:28.587 --> 00:43:30.297
No more of this nonsense.

00:43:31.027 --> 00:43:32.897
Become a Korean medicine doctor like your father.

00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:35.667
Father, why are you bringing this up now?

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:37.637
Do you even know how old Hyun Bin is?

00:43:38.637 --> 00:43:42.007
Father, Hyun Bin... You know the Taehan Group, right?

00:43:42.637 --> 00:43:43.877
He's a director at that huge corporation.

00:43:44.237 --> 00:43:45.237
And what about it?

00:43:46.877 --> 00:43:48.477
- Water. - Yes.

00:43:51.977 --> 00:43:54.387
I have absolutely no intention of becoming a Korean medicine doctor.

00:43:54.687 --> 00:43:56.717
Nor do I intend to inherit the clinic.

00:43:57.017 --> 00:43:58.917
And I'm not coming back to this house, so...

00:43:59.317 --> 00:44:02.227
Please, stop serving him and eat something, Stepmother.

00:44:02.887 --> 00:44:04.997
Dad, don't you have hands?

00:44:05.257 --> 00:44:06.997
Do you think you're a king from the Joseon era or something?

00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:11.697
Just stop. You should eat, too.

00:44:12.397 --> 00:44:13.397
I'll take care of myself.

00:44:14.507 --> 00:44:17.537
Really, it's okay, Hyun Bin. I don't mind.

00:44:17.877 --> 00:44:20.447
You haven't been here in a while. Let's eat with a smile, okay?

00:44:21.277 --> 00:44:22.747
What do you have to smile about?

00:44:23.077 --> 00:44:26.217
Why do you think he stays away? It's your fault.

00:44:26.447 --> 00:44:29.717
I let it go when you were a kid, but come on.

00:44:29.817 --> 00:44:31.457
How can you still be so disrespectful?

00:44:31.887 --> 00:44:34.257
She's raised you since you were in grade school.

00:44:34.527 --> 00:44:35.527
Grow up, Yang Eun Bin.

00:44:38.197 --> 00:44:39.197
You.

00:44:40.397 --> 00:44:43.467
While you were away, did you stay with that mother of yours?

00:44:44.137 --> 00:44:45.137
Father.

00:44:45.667 --> 00:44:47.137
Why are you bringing that woman up?

00:44:47.837 --> 00:44:50.877
There's no way the woman who left her own kids would've contacted him.

00:44:51.437 --> 00:44:52.977
I'm the one who reached out to her. We met.

00:44:55.607 --> 00:44:57.017
So that's it.

00:44:58.217 --> 00:45:01.887
That's why you're so arrogant. You think someone has your back.

00:45:03.047 --> 00:45:06.657
Did she tell you to ignore us? Is that why you haven't reached out?

00:45:07.157 --> 00:45:11.097
- Seriously, where does she live? - I don't know.

00:45:11.997 --> 00:45:16.827
We only wrote while I was abroad. I met her once during my service.

00:45:17.297 --> 00:45:18.297
What did she say?

00:45:18.897 --> 00:45:21.007
What on earth did she say to you?

00:45:21.507 --> 00:45:23.137
She told me never to contact her again.

00:45:24.707 --> 00:45:28.047
- What? - She said I look just like you two,

00:45:28.477 --> 00:45:31.077
and that I remind her of that misery,

00:45:31.077 --> 00:45:32.247
so she never wants to see me again.

00:45:35.947 --> 00:45:39.017
Did you really have to say that in front of Grandfather?

00:45:39.417 --> 00:45:41.187
Stop making things so hard on Stepmother.

00:45:41.187 --> 00:45:42.687
You don't want another divorce.

00:45:42.857 --> 00:45:46.157
- What was that? - Wrong. My dad and brother...

00:45:46.227 --> 00:45:47.827
treat her incredibly well.

00:45:48.297 --> 00:45:51.397
She waits on them hand and foot. Of course, they should.

00:45:52.237 --> 00:45:55.437
Wait, why are you taking her side? If Dad had never remarried,

00:45:55.507 --> 00:45:57.107
you wouldn't have had to go study abroad.

00:45:57.177 --> 00:46:00.277
Hey! If he hadn't remarried, who would have raised you two?

00:46:00.347 --> 00:46:01.347
Was I supposed to?

00:46:01.847 --> 00:46:05.147
After my mom left, I did all the housework.

00:46:05.247 --> 00:46:08.487
I was the one who had to take care of my brother and our father.

00:46:08.717 --> 00:46:10.047
So? Did you raise my kids?

00:46:10.757 --> 00:46:13.687
You ran off and married, didn't you? She's the one who did the hard work.

00:46:13.757 --> 00:46:15.487
Hard work? What did she do?

00:46:15.487 --> 00:46:17.727
He studied abroad, and I grew up on my own!

00:46:17.797 --> 00:46:20.997
Come on, everyone, that's enough. Let's just eat.

00:46:21.067 --> 00:46:22.967
It's a special occasion. Why are you all doing this?

00:46:23.797 --> 00:46:25.967
Hyun Bin, go on and eat. Okay?

00:46:28.537 --> 00:46:30.337
I was really looking forward to a home-cooked meal,

00:46:31.477 --> 00:46:32.577
but I've completely lost my appetite.

00:46:45.187 --> 00:46:47.687
Right. My phone. Go wait in the room.

00:46:49.587 --> 00:46:54.067
You must study Korean medicine. You heard what Hyun Bin said, right?

00:46:55.367 --> 00:46:57.337
He said he's not interested in the clinic.

00:46:57.937 --> 00:46:59.567
And your uncle wants to go into politics.

00:46:59.897 --> 00:47:04.137
So if you just get into that school, the clinic will be yours. Got it?

00:47:05.277 --> 00:47:08.677
Hey, are you listening to me or not?

00:47:09.447 --> 00:47:11.177
So Hyun Bin's really not moving in?

00:47:12.047 --> 00:47:13.277
That means we won't get kicked out, right?

00:47:13.677 --> 00:47:16.847
I'll stop him. He hated it here. He can't just waltz back in.

00:47:17.217 --> 00:47:18.217
Exactly.

00:47:28.897 --> 00:47:31.197
I wish you would stay and live with us here in Korea.

00:47:31.767 --> 00:47:34.137
I want to be a real mother to you.

00:47:34.867 --> 00:47:37.067
You can, for as long as I'm in Korea.

00:47:37.677 --> 00:47:40.237
Really? Then I can help you find a studio apartment...

00:47:40.307 --> 00:47:41.907
and bring you home-cooked meals?

00:47:43.577 --> 00:47:45.647
I'll even give you the passcode to my front door.

00:47:45.947 --> 00:47:47.787
Wow, that's so exciting!

00:47:49.447 --> 00:47:52.857
Why didn't you ever have kids of your own?

00:47:53.457 --> 00:47:54.987
You would've been a great mom.

00:47:58.397 --> 00:48:01.127
So I could pour all my love into you and Eun Bin.

00:48:03.697 --> 00:48:06.237
Dad's a lucky man.

00:48:08.867 --> 00:48:12.777
Don't be too hard on your father. He's just starved for affection.

00:48:13.537 --> 00:48:14.877
He wants to be loved by people...

00:48:15.247 --> 00:48:18.177
and respected. That's why he's getting into politics.

00:48:18.447 --> 00:48:22.047
- Then he should act respectably. - I'm going to make sure he does.

00:48:22.587 --> 00:48:25.617
I'm going to make him whole.

00:48:27.427 --> 00:48:28.427
Thank you.

00:48:42.207 --> 00:48:43.307
Did Hyun Bin leave?

00:48:44.407 --> 00:48:47.747
If you were happy to see him, you didn't have to be so harsh.

00:48:51.277 --> 00:48:52.317
What's wrong?

00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:54.547
Do I...

00:48:55.717 --> 00:48:56.917
make your life difficult?

00:48:58.087 --> 00:49:00.257
What a thing to say. That's not like you.

00:49:01.587 --> 00:49:02.987
The way I doubt you,

00:49:03.527 --> 00:49:04.997
track your location and everything...

00:49:06.197 --> 00:49:07.227
Do you hate me for it?

00:49:08.027 --> 00:49:09.367
Hate you? Of course not.

00:49:09.797 --> 00:49:11.967
I know exactly why you do those things.

00:49:15.237 --> 00:49:16.267
I...

00:49:17.707 --> 00:49:19.407
I'm never, ever going to leave you.

00:49:20.107 --> 00:49:23.577
You of all people know what my life has been like.

00:49:24.247 --> 00:49:27.117
I love this house. And I love you so much.

00:49:27.747 --> 00:49:29.647
So don't you worry.

00:49:47.167 --> 00:49:49.667
My goodness. What is this?

00:49:59.247 --> 00:50:00.587
(Novagen)

00:50:03.087 --> 00:50:04.317
Why is this...

00:50:08.627 --> 00:50:12.327
Ma'am, come and get some lunch. We're having gimbap...

00:50:14.927 --> 00:50:16.067
Where did she go?

00:50:16.827 --> 00:50:18.497
Maybe she went out campaigning with the others?

00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:21.867
Tell me, Hui Gyeong.

00:50:22.537 --> 00:50:24.237
Why are you on birth control?

00:50:25.207 --> 00:50:26.937
The thing is...

00:50:27.777 --> 00:50:29.047
Go on. What is it?

00:50:30.107 --> 00:50:31.847
I don't want to have children.

00:50:35.447 --> 00:50:36.987
Is this about money?

00:50:37.517 --> 00:50:39.917
Are you putting it off because money is tight?

00:50:40.757 --> 00:50:43.327
- If that's the case, I can... - No, that's not it.

00:50:44.327 --> 00:50:45.457
If it's not that, then what is it?

00:50:46.157 --> 00:50:47.297
The thing is...

00:50:48.267 --> 00:50:50.837
I'm just scared, and I'm not sure I can raise a child.

00:50:53.897 --> 00:50:55.567
How long have you felt this way?

00:50:57.507 --> 00:50:58.837
Since before we were married.

00:51:00.907 --> 00:51:05.147
Then why didn't you tell Dae Han? You know how badly he wants kids.

00:51:05.547 --> 00:51:07.817
I know. If I told him I didn't want one,

00:51:07.887 --> 00:51:09.787
I was afraid he wouldn't marry me.

00:51:12.817 --> 00:51:17.087
Mother, can't you please just pretend you don't know?

00:51:17.527 --> 00:51:20.527
What happens between a couple is their own business.

00:51:20.997 --> 00:51:22.027
Right?

00:51:26.267 --> 00:51:28.637
- Thank you. - We'd appreciate your support.

00:51:29.167 --> 00:51:31.307
Hello! I'm Gong Jeong Han, number two.

00:51:31.307 --> 00:51:33.407
- Vote for number 2. - Number 2.

00:51:33.477 --> 00:51:36.647
I'm Yang Dong Ik, number one. I'm counting on your vote!

00:51:36.907 --> 00:51:38.117
- Hello! - Sir, you should come by...

00:51:38.177 --> 00:51:40.747
- for a check-up. - Gong Jeong Han, number two.

00:51:40.747 --> 00:51:42.547
- Please vote for number two. - Thank you.

00:51:42.617 --> 00:51:44.357
Remember to vote for number one!

00:51:44.957 --> 00:51:48.227
- Candidate number two. - It's organic. I'm Yang Dong Ik.

00:51:48.287 --> 00:51:50.127
- Yes, thank you for your support. - Remember, vote number two.

00:51:51.197 --> 00:51:53.357
- Darn it. - This guy, seriously...

00:51:54.767 --> 00:51:57.997
Hello, everyone! I'm Yang Dong Ik, number one.

00:51:58.197 --> 00:51:59.797
With your precious votes...

00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:02.807
Please vote for me! I am candidate number two,

00:52:03.037 --> 00:52:04.337
- Gong Jeong Han. - Gong Jeong Han.

00:52:04.407 --> 00:52:05.637
- Gong Jeong Han. - Gong Jeong Han.

00:52:06.077 --> 00:52:08.447
- Number two. - Hey!

00:52:08.847 --> 00:52:10.207
Get lost, all right?

00:52:10.277 --> 00:52:13.017
I was here first. You're the one who cut in.

00:52:13.077 --> 00:52:16.517
- Cut in? This little punk... - "Little punk?"

00:52:16.587 --> 00:52:18.187
- That's right, punk. - Of all the nerve.

00:52:18.257 --> 00:52:20.217
- If you had half a brain... - Seriously...

00:52:20.287 --> 00:52:23.087
- Bring it on. - You two aren't fighting, are you?

00:52:23.087 --> 00:52:24.797
- Who's fighting? - No.

00:52:24.957 --> 00:52:26.757
Where did you pop up from?

00:52:26.857 --> 00:52:30.367
With both your families in the race, I've been put on high alert.

00:52:30.427 --> 00:52:33.337
I was here campaigning first,

00:52:33.537 --> 00:52:35.967
and this man came and blocked my path.

00:52:36.607 --> 00:52:38.677
You think you own this street?

00:52:38.737 --> 00:52:39.737
Stop fighting!

00:52:39.737 --> 00:52:41.547
I told you. You avoid dog poop out of disgust, not out of fear.

00:52:41.607 --> 00:52:43.407
- Let's go. - Poop smells scary.

00:52:43.407 --> 00:52:45.447
You're running out of fear.

00:52:45.517 --> 00:52:46.777
- Hey, Dae Han. - Yes?

00:52:46.847 --> 00:52:48.387
Do you hear a big mutt barking somewhere?

00:52:50.857 --> 00:52:52.217
- Good grief. - You little piece of...

00:52:52.287 --> 00:52:55.457
- Calm down. Everyone's watching. - Hey, stop.

00:52:55.527 --> 00:52:58.527
- Unbelievable. - Hey, you promised not to fight.

00:52:58.597 --> 00:53:01.797
- Yes, you're right. Hello, ma'am! - Go. Let's go.

00:53:01.867 --> 00:53:04.967
- My gosh! - That jerk! I ought to...

00:53:05.097 --> 00:53:09.167
What are you doing? We must root out these bad people!

00:53:09.237 --> 00:53:11.437
Yes. The expert on local commerce and wellness!

00:53:11.507 --> 00:53:14.977
- I'm Yang Dong Ik, number one. - Gong Jeong Han. Good to see you.

00:53:15.047 --> 00:53:18.617
- Right. - Please. Just one yogurt drink?

00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:24.157
How pathetic. We're giving out herbal health kits.

00:53:24.587 --> 00:53:26.957
- Here you go. - Thank you.

00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:28.757
Give one to your chief, too.

00:53:28.987 --> 00:53:31.957
- Yes, thank you so much. - Here, have another one.

00:53:32.027 --> 00:53:33.657
- No, that's all right. - No, I insist. Take them all.

00:53:33.727 --> 00:53:36.127
- You really don't have to. - It's no problem.

00:53:36.197 --> 00:53:37.637
- All right, have a good day. - You, too.

00:53:37.697 --> 00:53:40.067
- Have a great day! - Thank you.

00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:44.067
We're even having a guest singer perform at our event.

00:53:44.437 --> 00:53:46.277
You think hiring a singer will suddenly make you popular?

00:53:46.437 --> 00:53:47.707
Sounds like someone's jealous.

00:53:48.047 --> 00:53:51.377
I actually went around the market and polled people.

00:53:51.447 --> 00:53:52.817
Every single one of them said they're voting for us.

00:53:53.147 --> 00:53:56.247
- Really? - Yes, you'll see for yourself. Bye.

00:54:01.757 --> 00:54:03.157
Hi, son.

00:54:05.197 --> 00:54:07.797
I've been running all over town looking at apartments for you.

00:54:08.397 --> 00:54:11.597
I just popped into a coffee shop to take a break and have a drink,

00:54:11.967 --> 00:54:14.237
and I was wondering if I could see you for a minute.

00:54:15.407 --> 00:54:16.407
Yes.

00:54:17.637 --> 00:54:19.937
Okay, I get it. Good luck with your meeting.

00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:22.277
Okay. Have a good day.

00:54:37.087 --> 00:54:38.897
- Not bad, right? - It's nice.

00:54:39.727 --> 00:54:41.727
Then you'll turn this way and exit...

00:54:48.937 --> 00:54:51.677
These experts are really great people.

00:55:03.917 --> 00:55:06.557
- Should we do that? - I like it.

00:55:07.757 --> 00:55:09.557
- Good, right? - Yes.

00:55:53.137 --> 00:55:56.037
What's she doing here in Seoul?

00:55:57.037 --> 00:55:59.907
- What, you know her? - What? No.

00:56:02.877 --> 00:56:04.147
So you go like this...

00:56:06.047 --> 00:56:08.317
Every time sales dropped, there was...

00:56:08.317 --> 00:56:10.287
talk of cuts in the Fashion Division.

00:56:10.687 --> 00:56:12.987
And since we settled for staff cuts every time,

00:56:13.417 --> 00:56:14.857
the only designers left...

00:56:15.857 --> 00:56:17.027
are all of you in this room.

00:56:18.797 --> 00:56:21.097
If you can't increase sales next season,

00:56:22.167 --> 00:56:23.967
I won't be able to protect you any longer.

00:56:27.497 --> 00:56:28.937
If I may, though.

00:56:29.967 --> 00:56:32.307
Is the reason for this drop in sales...

00:56:32.637 --> 00:56:35.477
Is it really fair to blame it all on the designers?

00:56:36.307 --> 00:56:40.417
Even when they reuse old designs each season with no urgency?

00:56:41.217 --> 00:56:44.787
All they ever do is change a button or move a pocket.

00:56:45.217 --> 00:56:48.657
Because even when we come up with new ideas, at the executive review,

00:56:48.727 --> 00:56:50.957
the board always chooses the safe and uninspired designs.

00:56:51.697 --> 00:56:54.797
I looked through the portfolios of the designers here.

00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:59.197
Ms. Kim So Hye, you have a talent for clever takes on formal designs.

00:56:59.637 --> 00:57:03.707
Mr. Jo Seong Min won the top prize at the Arco Street Competition.

00:57:04.777 --> 00:57:09.047
And yet, they repeatedly submit rehashed, similar designs.

00:57:09.277 --> 00:57:12.917
Doesn't that imply the system is stifling their talents?

00:57:14.847 --> 00:57:15.947
And your point is?

00:57:19.587 --> 00:57:21.227
Director.

00:57:21.327 --> 00:57:23.727
As director of the Fashion Division,

00:57:23.727 --> 00:57:26.157
I ask you to please reevaluate the review system.

00:57:28.197 --> 00:57:29.997
And I am also requesting a budget increase.

00:57:39.177 --> 00:57:41.047
I'll discuss it with the other executives.

00:57:50.987 --> 00:57:53.617
Director Yang, are you sure that was a good idea?

00:57:56.227 --> 00:57:58.727
Tell me about it. You don't think I'm going to get fired, do you?

00:57:58.927 --> 00:58:01.897
My stuff from Argentina hasn't even arrived yet.

00:58:06.767 --> 00:58:09.867
Thanks for defending our team, the ugly duckling of Taehan.

00:58:09.937 --> 00:58:11.177
We're truly grateful.

00:58:12.877 --> 00:58:14.647
As you all know,

00:58:14.647 --> 00:58:17.547
I'm no expert when it comes to fashion or design.

00:58:17.917 --> 00:58:20.917
But I am confident in my ability to redefine a brand's value,

00:58:21.117 --> 00:58:25.857
boost its competitiveness, and create sustainable growth.

00:58:26.617 --> 00:58:29.587
Moving forward, I'll listen to you, and we'll face challenges together,

00:58:29.757 --> 00:58:33.557
so the people wearing your clothes can be happy.

00:58:34.057 --> 00:58:36.667
I'll be right there with you, working through it all,

00:58:37.397 --> 00:58:38.467
and helping in any way I can.

00:58:47.877 --> 00:58:51.477
So, on that note, what do you say to a team dinner tonight?

00:58:51.577 --> 00:58:53.677
My gosh. That sounds great!

00:58:53.977 --> 00:58:57.087
- Let's go! - Let's go!

00:59:00.987 --> 00:59:02.257
He's the best!

00:59:03.057 --> 00:59:04.157
You're the best, Director!

00:59:08.727 --> 00:59:12.767
(Sunny Korean Medicine Clinic)

00:59:12.837 --> 00:59:13.837
- Dong Suk. - Hurry, come in.

00:59:13.897 --> 00:59:15.707
It's so crowded outside. What are you doing here?

00:59:15.767 --> 00:59:17.607
Hey. Where have you been?

00:59:17.737 --> 00:59:21.307
Apartment hunting for Hyun Bin. Why? I'm sure Dong Ik knows.

00:59:21.377 --> 00:59:24.677
It's not that. I heard something.

00:59:24.747 --> 00:59:28.947
I was asking around the market. Everyone's voting for Mr. Gong.

00:59:29.147 --> 00:59:33.757
- Is that right? - "Is that right?" Is that all?

00:59:33.857 --> 00:59:36.287
Don't you realise what a crisis this is?

00:59:36.987 --> 00:59:40.827
It seems luck is on our side.

00:59:40.927 --> 00:59:43.227
What? Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

00:59:43.967 --> 00:59:45.867
You'll see, Dong Suk.

00:59:48.967 --> 00:59:50.967
- Yes. - Dr. Han.

00:59:52.237 --> 00:59:54.907
- You haven't seen it yet, have you? - Seen what?

00:59:54.907 --> 00:59:58.517
The photo of you and Director Song. It's all over the community forums.

00:59:59.147 --> 01:00:00.147
What?

01:00:06.987 --> 01:00:10.727
They're saying, "How can a cheater be an expert on family matters?"

01:00:11.157 --> 01:00:14.427
The comments are blowing up, telling you to leave the show.

01:00:19.997 --> 01:00:21.207
Look at this.

01:00:22.137 --> 01:00:23.137
Look at this.

01:00:23.407 --> 01:00:26.607
What is going on? Don't tell me...

01:00:27.037 --> 01:00:28.607
Your wife isn't having an affair, is she?

01:00:30.147 --> 01:00:31.317
Dr. Gong!

01:00:31.577 --> 01:00:33.417
The whole market is in an uproar.

01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:34.947
They're asking if Dr. Han is cheating.

01:00:35.147 --> 01:00:36.147
For real?

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:39.287
Someone anonymously posted a picture on the Onjeong Market forum.

01:00:39.587 --> 01:00:42.027
They say, "How can he be president if he can't control his own wife?"

01:00:42.327 --> 01:00:43.527
They're saying you should drop out of the race.

01:00:43.987 --> 01:00:45.897
Hey, what about Mom? Does she know?

01:00:46.427 --> 01:00:47.427
Probably.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:49.827
- Oh, no. - Hey.

01:00:49.897 --> 01:00:50.897
Jeong Han!

01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:55.167
- You should be fine after two days. - Okay.

01:00:58.877 --> 01:01:03.507
Rumour has it your doctor daughter-in-law is having an affair.

01:01:04.647 --> 01:01:08.617
Oh, goodness, there must be some kind of misunderstanding.

01:01:08.687 --> 01:01:11.357
Your husband ran off and left you after his affair,

01:01:11.457 --> 01:01:14.587
so your daughter-in-law shouldn't do the same. Right?

01:01:14.727 --> 01:01:17.387
Ma'am, that's a misunderstanding. Really.

01:01:18.127 --> 01:01:22.867
Doctor, you need to watch your wife. When a woman is too successful,

01:01:23.197 --> 01:01:25.137
she's bound to cheat.

01:01:25.637 --> 01:01:28.007
Oh, Ma'am! Goodness...

01:01:28.407 --> 01:01:30.267
Well, I'm leaving.

01:01:35.547 --> 01:01:36.907
What is going on?

01:01:37.847 --> 01:01:40.177
I don't really know myself.

01:01:40.717 --> 01:01:42.087
Good grief.

01:01:46.457 --> 01:01:47.657
Oh, Seong Mi.

01:01:48.627 --> 01:01:49.657
Yes, Mother.

01:01:50.427 --> 01:01:54.327
He's a director I work with. Jeong Han knows him, too.

01:01:55.227 --> 01:01:57.097
We were discussing a TV show...

01:01:57.567 --> 01:01:59.797
and looking at reference footage together.

01:02:00.737 --> 01:02:02.807
I guess someone took a picture and posted it online.

01:02:03.967 --> 01:02:06.507
Please, don't you worry about it. I'm on my way.

01:02:07.377 --> 01:02:08.377
Okay.

01:02:15.687 --> 01:02:16.917
Hey, Director Song.

01:02:17.847 --> 01:02:20.657
This is so ridiculous I actually have to laugh.

01:02:22.027 --> 01:02:23.327
I know, right? Tell me about it.

01:02:23.787 --> 01:02:25.727
I'm already getting calls from reporters.

01:02:26.397 --> 01:02:28.267
Anyway, I'll handle it and clear things up.

01:02:28.697 --> 01:02:30.397
Okay, got it.

01:02:30.827 --> 01:02:33.837
Listen, Seong Mi. I was reading the comments, and...

01:02:34.597 --> 01:02:36.567
Are you separated from your husband?

01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:40.777
No, we just live apart during the week for work.

01:02:40.837 --> 01:02:43.147
The commute's a killer, so I stay in Seoul.

01:02:43.777 --> 01:02:45.947
- Why? - Well...

01:02:45.947 --> 01:02:47.947
The higher-ups are making it an issue.

01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:49.987
They've suddenly told me to put your contract on hold.

01:02:50.987 --> 01:02:53.987
- What? - I'll call you after my meeting.

01:02:54.657 --> 01:02:55.657
Okay.

01:02:56.227 --> 01:02:58.097
Of all the crazy things...

01:03:03.897 --> 01:03:05.797
Who on earth could have taken that photo?

01:03:08.707 --> 01:03:09.737
What?

01:03:13.637 --> 01:03:14.847
It couldn't be...

01:03:18.117 --> 01:03:20.847
It's Jae Geun. You know, our old classmate Song Jae Geun.

01:03:22.487 --> 01:03:25.617
I know. I'm not worried about an affair.

01:03:27.087 --> 01:03:28.557
Thanks for that, at least.

01:03:28.787 --> 01:03:31.557
But what about your work? Is everything okay?

01:03:31.997 --> 01:03:34.697
The network is trying to do damage control,

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:37.827
but the contract's been put on hold.

01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:40.537
Oh, man...

01:03:41.707 --> 01:03:44.437
This is exactly why I told you not to run for the election.

01:03:44.937 --> 01:03:46.937
- What? - I told you to go for it,

01:03:46.937 --> 01:03:48.447
so I guess it's my own fault.

01:03:49.977 --> 01:03:52.817
Wait, are you saying this is my fault?

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:54.347
Yes, I am.

01:03:54.817 --> 01:03:57.847
Yang Dong Ik's wife is the one who posted that picture.

01:03:58.157 --> 01:04:01.657
- What? Are you sure? - I'm positive.

01:04:01.957 --> 01:04:05.227
She saw me with Director Song this afternoon.

01:04:05.397 --> 01:04:08.267
So she saw you two, took a photo, and posted it just like that?

01:04:08.327 --> 01:04:09.867
Exactly.

01:04:10.997 --> 01:04:15.337
I knew she was something else. She's completely nuts, isn't she?

01:04:16.707 --> 01:04:17.967
Unbelievable.

01:04:18.707 --> 01:04:22.607
Is she trying to ruin my career over the stupid merchants' election?

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:25.147
I am not letting her get away with this.

01:04:31.487 --> 01:04:33.357
- Beer. Yes, coming right up. - Thanks.

01:04:33.357 --> 01:04:35.257
- Okay, two, three. - Thanks for all your hard work.

01:04:35.327 --> 01:04:36.387
Thank you.

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:39.227
Wow, this meat is great. It's so good.

01:04:39.297 --> 01:04:41.597
Sir. Over in Argentina,

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:42.927
what do you say when you make a toast?

01:04:46.197 --> 01:04:49.607
- Cheers! - Cheers!

01:04:49.607 --> 01:04:51.337
Bravo!

01:04:51.577 --> 01:04:52.577
All right.

01:04:57.247 --> 01:05:00.177
- That's a good one. - So good.

01:05:00.247 --> 01:05:03.887
- It really is. - Drink up. We've had it so rough...

01:05:14.527 --> 01:05:18.597
- Are you drunk? - A little. I'm just in a good mood.

01:05:19.537 --> 01:05:20.737
And why are you in such a good mood?

01:05:21.507 --> 01:05:25.437
Because you're a nicer person than I expected.

01:05:27.137 --> 01:05:30.377
I honestly thought you were going to get revenge on me.

01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:32.977
Man, what kind of person did you take me for?

01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:35.917
I'm not the kind of guy who goes around seeking revenge.

01:05:36.887 --> 01:05:38.257
I know, right?

01:05:39.987 --> 01:05:43.457
When you suddenly showed up, all dressed to the nines,

01:05:43.587 --> 01:05:45.427
you have no idea how surprised I was.

01:05:47.697 --> 01:05:51.697
And when you made your entrance with that Hyun Bin theme music,

01:05:51.767 --> 01:05:53.337
that was hilarious.

01:05:55.137 --> 01:05:59.277
Good. I'm glad it landed. It's a little joke I like to pull.

01:06:01.407 --> 01:06:04.207
I actually know someone named Hyun Bin, too.

01:06:04.477 --> 01:06:05.477
Yang Hyun Bin.

01:06:07.217 --> 01:06:10.987
We lost touch after he went abroad a long time ago.

01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:15.187
Is that right?

01:06:15.887 --> 01:06:18.757
That's right. You're a Yang too.

01:06:19.357 --> 01:06:21.057
What's your Korean name?

01:06:26.837 --> 01:06:27.867
Yang Hyun Bin.

01:06:34.607 --> 01:06:38.747
Come on. Stop joking around. Seriously...

01:06:40.447 --> 01:06:44.487
So what about this Yang Hyun Bin? Was he your first love or something?

01:06:45.057 --> 01:06:47.557
- No, of course not. - Really?

01:06:48.257 --> 01:06:51.727
Yes. It would be a disaster if he were my first love.

01:06:53.297 --> 01:06:54.357
Why is that?

01:06:54.897 --> 01:06:56.097
Because we're enemies.

01:06:58.467 --> 01:06:59.567
Enemies.

01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:02.837
His family and my family...

01:07:02.967 --> 01:07:05.307
are sworn enemies.

01:07:05.777 --> 01:07:08.277
It's a blood feud passed down through generations.

01:07:17.987 --> 01:07:19.157
Excuse me.

01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:20.417
Honey...

01:07:21.957 --> 01:07:22.987
Me?

01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:27.827
- You told me not to fight. - Let go. I have nothing to lose.

01:07:29.097 --> 01:07:30.697
No, wait. Hey...

01:07:32.997 --> 01:07:37.537
- Can I help you with something? - Look at you, playing innocent.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:40.677
- Aren't you out of line? - What? Out of line?

01:07:40.977 --> 01:07:42.047
Who do you think is out of line here?

01:07:43.007 --> 01:07:45.547
What's with this guy now? Unbelievable.

01:07:45.617 --> 01:07:49.547
I don't care how desperate you are. How dare you go after my family?

01:07:49.617 --> 01:07:51.957
My gosh. Excuse me? What on earth are you talking about?

01:07:52.017 --> 01:07:55.627
- You were in Seoul, weren't you? - Excuse me? So rude!

01:07:55.687 --> 01:07:58.397
You're the one who took that picture and posted it, aren't you?

01:07:59.227 --> 01:08:00.297
Do you have any proof?

01:08:00.597 --> 01:08:03.897
- What? - No, forget it. I'll handle this.

01:08:03.967 --> 01:08:06.567
You can't just accuse someone without any proof.

01:08:07.037 --> 01:08:08.737
- Let's go. - The nerve of her...

01:08:08.807 --> 01:08:09.807
- Unbelievable. - Why, that...

01:08:10.067 --> 01:08:13.577
No, I'll take care of it, okay? Don't get worked up. Let's go.

01:08:14.477 --> 01:08:17.307
That's enough. Let's go. Let's go home.

01:08:19.017 --> 01:08:21.747
Seong Mi.

01:08:22.087 --> 01:08:23.447
Seong Mi, hey.

01:08:27.387 --> 01:08:29.127
- My gosh. - What are you doing?

01:08:31.227 --> 01:08:34.327
- Seong Mi. - Goodness. I think she's lost it.

01:08:34.357 --> 01:08:35.767
- Seong Mi, you... - My gosh!

01:08:36.127 --> 01:08:38.497
- You... - She's crazy! What to do? Hey!

01:08:38.497 --> 01:08:41.037
- What do you think you're doing? - What's this? A fingerprint?

01:08:41.197 --> 01:08:42.207
Excuse me!

01:08:44.067 --> 01:08:46.507
You just stole my phone, didn't you?

01:08:46.577 --> 01:08:49.477
Seong Mi, just give the phone back and then we can...

01:08:49.547 --> 01:08:52.747
- My. What are you doing? - Hey, Han Seong Mi! Let go of her!

01:08:52.817 --> 01:08:53.947
- Let go! My gosh. - You jerk!

01:08:54.017 --> 01:08:56.617
- You dare touch my wife? - What? That's hilarious.

01:08:56.617 --> 01:08:58.287
- Hey! What's wrong with you? - You'd better control your wife!

01:08:58.287 --> 01:09:00.517
- Don't push! - Get your hands off my wife.

01:09:00.587 --> 01:09:02.587
- Let go! - Unbelievable.

01:09:31.247 --> 01:09:34.187
(Recipe for Love)

01:09:34.517 --> 01:09:36.687
So, what do you think of her now? Still into her?

01:09:38.257 --> 01:09:40.627
I may be sitting down right now,

01:09:40.697 --> 01:09:44.467
- but pretend I'm on my knees. - Crazy witch.

01:09:45.437 --> 01:09:48.907
- What? - I'm paying for my stepmom's error.

01:09:48.967 --> 01:09:50.437
Have you completely lost your mind?

01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:54.407
- Such a devil's tongue. - Let's forget this and play fair.

01:09:54.677 --> 01:09:57.577
How could they do this to such a handsome face?

01:09:58.207 --> 01:09:59.247
It was you, wasn't it?

01:10:00.247 --> 01:10:01.517
You're not going to let this slide, are you?

01:10:02.317 --> 01:10:03.347
Of course not.
