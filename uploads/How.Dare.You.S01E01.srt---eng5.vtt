hit even harder.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.270
[Yu Wanyin]

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.070
Since there's no way to avoid it,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.900
I might as well turn passive
into proactive.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.870
In the book, Yu Wanyin was the one
who got schemed to death.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.120
But now that I'm here,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.970
you'll have to step aside,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.050
because I'm the one
holding the ultimate script.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.330
Hey, you...

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960
Eunuch An, right?

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.320
May I ask,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.790
this bedchamber service—

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.990
are there any rules or protocols for it?

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.950
Your Highness, please stop teasing me.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.050
I'm saying I don't have much experience.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.790
Then I guess I have even less.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:24.580
[Yongyan Hall]

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.790
[Plan A: Seize the female lead position
and win the male lead's heart]

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.120
The whole process is already planned out.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:53.870
With my experience as a corporate drone,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.600
[Plan B: Gain the new client's trust
(the tyrant)]

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.240
there's no way

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.900
I can't curry favor
with this legendary tyrant.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.270
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.400
Your Majesty,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.040
Concubine Yu is here.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.750
Greetings, Your—

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.390
Get out.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.270
How could—

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.000
Drag her out.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.030
This scene wasn't in the original story!

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.840
I can't fail before I even begin!

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.670
Your Majesty!

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.200
Your Majesty, at least look at me once!

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.000
-If she doesn't stay to serve me,
-I don't want to die!

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.200
she's to be executed?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.320
Wait, bro.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.130
You're the Emperor.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.210
Why are you asking the guards?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.320
Your Majesty, spare us!

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.080
Forget it.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.400
Let her stay.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.870
All of you, leave.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.480
Yes.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.440
This...

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.360
Well...

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.440
What's...

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.240
going on now?

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.910
Does a villain

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.570
really need to be this good-looking?

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.870
This author

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.300
must be obsessed with good looks.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.240
Hey, you.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.180
Con-Concubine Yu.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.880
Make yourself a bed on the floor

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.550
and make do for the night.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.870
Make a bed on the floor
and make do for the night?

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.120
But...

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.780
"Hey, you."

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.570
"Hey, you."

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:27.750
He called me

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.670
"hey, you"?

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.640
Isn't that a modern expression?

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.150
Could it be

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:36.120
he's also...

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.920
Your Majesty.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.000
are...

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:54.790
you?

[Xiahou Dan]

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.630
Fine,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.630
thank you,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.080
and you?

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.720
[Yongyan Hall]

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.960
Has Concubine Yu come out yet?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.630
Eunuch.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.840
Not yet.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.440
[Yongyan Hall]

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.370
In the past,
concubines got scolded away instantly,

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.870
but this one has managed to stay so long.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.570
She's quite something.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.490
I transmigrated here just 2 hours ago.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.480
At that time,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.500
I was lying on a cruise,

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.870
soaking up the sun

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.600
and drinking champagne.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.030
Suddenly a stupid notification
popped up on my phone,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.490
recommending this novel.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.530
One blink later,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.720
here I am.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.910
Two hours ago,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.320
I was on the subway
heading home from work.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.450
It was already dark.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.400
So how could you be sunbathing?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.240
Were you

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.850
across the Pacific?

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.840
I was on vacation.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.040
You're not one of those
legendary alpha bosses, are you?

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.600
Whether I'm an alpha, I don't know,

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.870
but I am a boss.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.240
My life

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.930
is pretty comfortable.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.360
Damn it!

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.440
How did I end up transmigrating

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.480
to a place without even a bath heater,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.340
waiting to die with a brain tumor?

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.630
Calm down first.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.480
Your migraines
might not be caused by a tumor.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.750
If it were a tumor pressing on a nerve,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.450
there should be other clinical symptoms.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.329
Really?

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.569
I'm just guessing.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.440
Try to think positively.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.349
What if someone poisoned you
with a slow-acting toxin?

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.109
You're quite good at comforting people.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:14.839
My pleasure.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.400
So have you actually
read this novel or not?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.260
What exactly is my situation now?

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.240
I did read it,

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:23.270
but I skimmed through it,

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:24.720
not very carefully.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.160
Simply put,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.120
your name is Xiahou Dan.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.980
Your mother hates you.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.830
Your brother Prince Duan hates you.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.030
Your concubines hate you.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.400
Your ministers hate you.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.060
The entire country hates you.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.070
According to the original story,

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.870
I hate you too.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.030
Gosh.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.240
What on earth

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.100
did I do that was so unforgivable?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.500
Can I have some grapes?

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.930
Help yourself.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.660
Thanks.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.920
The Empress Dowager
isn't your birth mother,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.780
so she didn't raise you properly.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.230
And you suffer from migraines.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.400
[Migraine]

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:01.490
You've been stubborn, brutal,
and bloodthirsty since childhood.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.780
[Stubborn]

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.620
[Brutal]

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.830
[Bloodthirsty]

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.430
The loyal ministers in court

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.570
were either executed or exiled by you.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.830
You also implemented
a bunch of terrible policies

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.200
that caused widespread public outrage.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.000
According to the original plot,

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.880
near the end,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.880
you'll be killed by Prince Duan

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.140
in the name of justice.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.310
How exactly did I die?

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.920
I think...

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.980
you got assassinated.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.240
The later plot was too boring,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.770
so I skipped several pages.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.830
You can still smile
knowing you're going to die?

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.030
Now I believe

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.960
you really are a boss who's seen it all.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.640
Who says I'm going to die?

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.270
Aren't I the Emperor?

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.310
Can't I just kill everyone
who gets in my way?

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:54.440
That won't work.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.480
Your power has already been

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.480
mostly stripped away
by the Empress Dowager.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.480
It won't be easy to kill Prince Duan.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.600
Moreover,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.070
Xiahou Bo and Xie Yong'er

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.160
are the chosen ones in the original story.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.800
All the main storylines

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.200
[Transmigrated:
The Devil's Beloved Consort]

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.550
are designed to serve them.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:06.740
If we kill the protagonists,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.680
[Transmigrated:
The Devil's Beloved Consort]

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.960
it would be like
cutting this story in half.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.220
Whether we can survive

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.770
will become uncertain.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.410
What about you?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.440
You don't seem

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.420
to be a good person either.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.740
I'm certainly not.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.800
I'm a villain.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.670
The book barely mentions me.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.350
I was sent by my family

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.680
as a pawn.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.290
Anyway, after you died,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.010
I was buried along with you.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.160
That won't do.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.240
Don't you have any other proposals?

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.880
Come on.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.880
You really think you are my client?

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.280
Asking me for proposals?

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:49.830
What we can do now

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.040
is to control variables bit by bit,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.640
see if we can trigger any consequences,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.770
and then make plans.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440
That makes sense.

still be a transmigrator?

If this guy is also a transmigrator...

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:06.720
Greetings...

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.550
Then his acting skills...

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.110
Your Highness.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.550
Have reached their peak.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.160
"These stars
are not the same as last night's.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.930
For whom am I standing
in the midnight wind and dew?"

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.440
My Lady,

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.530
I don't quite understand.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.510
But you should stay away from this pool.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.840
Last time when you fell into it,

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.450
Physician Xiao said
you were practically...

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.280
Don't worry.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.180
It won't happen again.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.550
Drown again?

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.490
How could that be possible?

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.200
Silly Ling,

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.050
the Xie Yong'er you speak of
is already dead.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:55.920
You're all just 2D characters

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.590
in the novel

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.350
"A thousand trees blossoms at night
in the East."

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.920
The story has only just begun,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.250
but I've already finished the whole book.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.130
Xie Yong'er,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.380
your kindness
can't buy you peace in this world.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.200
Let me avenge you.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:13.960
My Lady, are you upset

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.720
because of Consort Yu?

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.680
Consort Yu?

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.950
Oh, right.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.400
That woman Yu Wanyin
has already been promoted to Consort.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.070
According to the book,

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.550
she was supposed to be thrown
into the Cold Palace by the tyrant.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.720
But why?

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.010
Could it be that my arrival

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.760
caused the plot to go off track?

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.210
My...

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:35.680
It's alright.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.330
I'm the woman who holds the script.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720
In the original story, Yu Wanyin

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.520
ran into Prince Duan right here.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.840
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.490
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.030
Your Highness, it was my honor to hear

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.630
your pipa performance
in the grand hall today.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.580
It was truly...

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.890
unforgettable.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.510
Just a minor skill.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.280
I've embarrassed myself before you,
Your Highness.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.640
I don't often come to the inner palace.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.300
I wonder if there's a path here

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.080
that leads to Changsheng Hall.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.220
It's getting late.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:14.830
I'm afraid you might take a wrong turn.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.890
May I guide you there, Your Highness?

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.010
Please.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:25.880
Yu Wanyin,

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.850
your main storyline belongs to me now.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.040
-Pick out all the bad leaves.
-Yes.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.930
-Clean them thoroughly.
-Yes.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.640
There's fuzz on this.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:09.960
Be careful.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.630
Yes.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:12.800
Everyone, hurry up.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.960
His Majesty and Her Highness
are waiting.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.840
Yes.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.060
[Yongyan Hall]

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.400
What a feast!

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.760
Is your head really hurting that badly?

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.360
The original owner's brain
isn't working well.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.560
The pain must have scrambled his brain.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.600
Don't say such depressing things.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.050
There's nothing a hot pot can't solve.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.510
About tonight's palace banquet—

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.510
what do you think?

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.880
This Xie Yong'er is definitely

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.030
a transmigrator.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.470
But as for Prince Duan...

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.320
I really can't tell.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.940
Since Prince Duan is here too,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.860
Concubine Xie,

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.320
play again

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.680
so Prince Duan

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.530
can appreciate it as well.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:23.760
What a beautiful jasmine flower.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.230
Fragrant and lovely on every branch.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.730
Play another piece

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.690
to celebrate

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.040
Prince Duan's triumphant return.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.000
So,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.800
Prince Duan
probably isn't a transmigrator.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.800
Not necessarily.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.080
What if he just doesn't like music?

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.930
My granduncle is like that.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.400
You should have done

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.400
a set of radio calisthenics for him.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.560
Perhaps he

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.070
would've lost his composure right there.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.150
Wouldn't that expose my identity
to the enemy?

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.010
I'm not stupid.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.890
Actually,
whether he's a transmigrator or not,

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.960
I have a solution.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:15.880
What is it?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.180
I'll be a prince

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:18.670
and give him the throne.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.480
It's not that simple.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.110
In the original story,
Xiahou Bo held a deep grudge against you.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.320
The throne means nothing
compared to his hatred.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.850
He's on a path of vengeance.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.280
But we are brothers.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.410
Aren't we siblings?

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.160
Half-brothers, actually.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.660
And your mother

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.760
had his mother killed.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.960
Then the Empress Dowager—

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.000
your stepmother—

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.490
made him your study companion,

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.960
humiliating and tormenting him

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.070
in every way.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.000
That does sound miserable.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.920
And with the same royal bloodline,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.480
in terms of looks, presence,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.510
talent, and cunning,

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.360
you just can't compete with Prince Duan,
Xiahou Bo.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.760
You're moody and just living for pleasure.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.780
The world belongs to the capable.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.170
What right do you have
to waste your place?

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.920
I...

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:01.880
Wanyin,

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.640
I was trying to comfort you.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:06.110
Why...

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:07.960
Why did you insult me?

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:12.840
Sorry.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:13.740
CEO Dan.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.760
My professional habit kicked in

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.550
and I started giving
character backgrounds.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.070
Well, according to you,

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.430
if he's a transmigrator,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.190
then we might have a chance to reconcile.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.150
But if he's not,

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.150
then only one of us

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.070
will get to live?

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.190
Exactly.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.000
You've finally sorted out
the relationships.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.050
That makes my head hurt even more.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.020
Xie Yong'er, the chosen female lead—

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.440
I can't see her true abilities.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.240
Xiahou Bo, the chosen male lead—

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:56.700
transmigrator or not,
he's not someone to be trifled with.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.020
As for this Xiahou Dan,

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.630
I haven't seen
anything exceptional about him yet.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.560
And he even seems a bit unreliable.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.510
Plus, with this headache problem,

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:05.840
how long can he hold out?

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.970
If I team up with him,

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.550
can we really take down Prince Duan?

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.880
[Xiahou Bo] [Xie Yong'er] [Consorts]
[Xiahou Dan] [Yu Wanyin]

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.630
Do you think

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.590
I should try to win over Xie Yong'er?

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.010
She's the chosen one

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.710
and an important ally to Prince Duan.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.400
If she's on our side,

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.760
things would go much smoother.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.880
And think about it—

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.070
we're all transmigrators.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.670
Who doesn't want to survive?

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.920
If we can talk it out,
what's left to fight over?

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.850
Don't you agree?

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.140
Then go and make contact with her.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.740
So what am I supposed to do?

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.400
You...

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.880
I need to think about it.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.120
What's that burning smell?

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.090
Pleasing His Majesty isn't easy.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.880
Perhaps behind closed doors,

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.540
she has some special methods.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.840
Makes sense.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.800
Hurry! Hurry!

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.510
The pot is burning!

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.310
Water! Water!

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.480
-I deserve to die!
-I deserve to die!

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.140
From now on,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.550
no one is allowed to enter this door.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:20.530
Get out!

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:21.480
Yes!

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:28.910
What's wrong?

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.560
Your acting's pretty good.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.670
When it comes to business,

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.510
you always have to put on a bit of a show.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.710
It's all something
I learned through practice.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.110
I know what you can do now.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.290
Go turn someone to our side.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:43.710
Who?

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.150
Xu Yao.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.000
This Xu Yao...

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.980
is Prince Duan's strategist.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.080
He's extremely talented
and exceptionally clever.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.490
It's been 5 years.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.880
[Xu Yao]

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.540
When will my father's false charges
be cleared?

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.190
Bodhisattva, please bless my father

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.720
with health and longevity,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.570
so he may one day return to the capital.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:08.840
Treasonous!

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.080
I've wasted my trust in you!

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.440
Then as you wish,

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.480
your entire family
will be exiled 3,000 li away.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:14.870
Without my decree,

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:15.360
[Senior Minister Xu]

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.630
you shall not return to court!

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.410
The reason he sided with Prince Duan

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.070
was that you

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.790
exiled his father, Senior Minister Xu.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.280
His father was a loyal
and upright official,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.190
yet you trusted slander,
pinned a false charge on him,

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.590
and casually banished him
to a barren land.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.820
Xu Yao was supposed to go with him,

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.190
but Prince Duan secretly saved him,

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.030
had him change his name and identity,
and hide in his residence

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.960
as a strategist.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.240
It's said he never gave up

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.110
and has been quietly running around

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.230
trying to bring his father back.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.800
Father.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.440
It's about Senior Minister Xu.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.970
Please come inside to talk.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.840
Then I'll just tell Xu Yao directly,

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.500
"I can bring your father back,

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.670
on the condition
that you swear loyalty to me."

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.550
Wouldn't that solve it?

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.800
It's not that simple.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.440
He would still harbor hatred

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
and question you,

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.520
"You!

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.250
Why did you misjudge right and wrong,

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.070
causing my father
to suffer unjust accusations?"

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:13.760
I...

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.360
was just a mad king,

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.710
blinded and deafened by others.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.030
Loyal or treacherous—

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.190
isn't it all decided by a single memorial?

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.550
Your Majesty, you knew full well that
Grand Tutor Wei was spouting nonsense,

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.480
yet you still believed the slander

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.430
and exiled him.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400
Xu Yao, oh, Xu Yao.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.290
Even today, you still think

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.880
it was that wretched old man
who slandered your father!

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880
He's not that old.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.850
Xu Yao, oh, Xu Yao.
Even today, you still think

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.110
it was that brat
who slandered your father!

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.640
He's not that young either.

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.920
Xu Yao, oh, Xu Yao.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.880
Even today,

00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:00.650
you still think it was that bastard
who slandered your father!

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.070
You...

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.340
You're talking nonsense!

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.590
If a devil wears human skin,

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.370
how can you be sure you can tell

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.580
whether it's human...

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.440
or a devil?

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.990
With such acting skills,

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.280
it'd be a waste

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.560
if you don't become an actor.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.280
You...

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.150
look different somehow.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:51.390
This is called corporate drone makeup.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.920
Gentle, kind, and hardworking.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.230
I'm going to extend an olive branch
to Xie Yong'er later.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.320
Looking approachable

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.450
makes it easier to close the distance.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.360
Women.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.840
You also look

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.490
somehow different.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.410
Since I'm going to
turn Xu Yao to our side,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.900
shouldn't I create

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.630
a bit of contrast as well?

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:19.000
Men.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:37.840
This way.
