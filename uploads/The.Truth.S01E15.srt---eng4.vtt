=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 15=

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:19.496
We need to hurry up. Hurry.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:22.057
You guys are a bit slow.

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:23.737
(No-Name Diner)
Quick. Hurry up.

00:01:23.737 --> 00:01:24.737
We've got to move fast.

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:33.016
- If I knew it was for dumplings,
- I'll place them right here.

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:34.737
I'd have hauled a truckload over.

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:36.057
Way too messy.

00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:36.656
Let me do it.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.656
That's different.

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:39.337
You...

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:44.216
You've got too much filling.
It won't seal.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:45.177
It'll definitely leak.

00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:46.977
Way too much.

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:48.416
Do it like this.

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:54.057
This is a proper dumpling.

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:55.817
Yours isn't great. Pretty average.

00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:57.416
Exactly.

00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:59.337
How could it compare to Little Qian's?

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:01.576
Right, Little Qian?

00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:12.737
You're still mad at him?

00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:25.337
When are we
ever finishing these dumplings?

00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:26.256
Huh?

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:27.656
You can take a break.

00:02:27.656 --> 00:02:28.536
We've got plenty here.

00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:30.297
Just keep wrapping.

00:02:30.297 --> 00:02:32.417
Just wrap until there's enough to eat.

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:33.897
It's the thought that counts most.

00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:36.137
The thought?

00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:38.096
How many have we wrapped?

00:02:38.297 --> 00:02:38.776
Wait.

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:39.897
M-More than 20.

00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:40.577
Where to?

00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:41.376
Little Qian.

00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:42.536
She's leaving.

00:02:45.737 --> 00:02:47.857
A-Are you all really this cold?

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:02.137
Ziwu,

00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:04.617
Ms. Hu, director
of the neighborhood office.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:05.457
You remember her?

00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:07.617
I remember.

00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:10.017
A new young guy just started there.

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:11.857
He's quite well-rounded.

00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:13.337
Want to meet him?

00:03:16.297 --> 00:03:17.897
Don't miss this chance.

00:03:18.216 --> 00:03:19.297
You could meet him.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.496
How's your dad's follow-up exam going?

00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:32.936
No results yet.

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:38.096
Did you get a new nanny?

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:40.096
Yes.

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:42.137
How's the adjustment period?

00:03:42.696 --> 00:03:43.376
It's okay.

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:53.536
Jing.

00:03:54.216 --> 00:03:55.776
I've got a paper deadline coming up.

00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:58.017
My schedule's pretty tight.

00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:00.696
Maybe next time?

00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:02.057
But thank you anyway.

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.256
Please thank Ms. Hu for me too.

00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:05.496
If there's a chance later.

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:06.976
Alright.

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:10.216
Quick. Take these.

00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:11.457
Where'd you go?

00:04:11.976 --> 00:04:12.857
Left without a word.

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:13.376
Come on.

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:14.417
I was anxious.

00:04:14.417 --> 00:04:15.816
My clumsy hands couldn't help much.

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:17.048
You bought so many dumplings?

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.217
Shrimp dumplings.

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:19.336
Okay.

00:04:20.057 --> 00:04:22.057
I'll accept them then.

00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:24.057
You're welcome.

00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:25.576
Ye Qian's friend is mine.

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:27.537
Okay, I'll take them inside.

00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:30.576
I-I've got some here too.

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:32.376
So many?

00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:33.777
Should be enough.

00:04:33.777 --> 00:04:34.617
No need to wrap more.

00:04:34.737 --> 00:04:35.977
They'll make the last batch.

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:37.376
Jing.

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:39.096
- Boil these too.
- Take them over.

00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:39.737
Okay.

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:41.617
Together.

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:52.576
Here.

00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:53.496
Long, thank you.

00:04:53.496 --> 00:04:54.496
The last portion.

00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:55.256
Great, thanks.

00:04:55.256 --> 00:04:55.857
Enjoy.

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:56.256
Okay.

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:02.977
Take your time.

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:15.456
I've got it all set.

00:05:17.177 --> 00:05:17.737
Okay.

00:05:18.496 --> 00:05:19.417
Wait for me a sec.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.537
How's the soup?

00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:23.617
Any left?

00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:24.777
All distributed.

00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:29.696
You take Little Zhao home later.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.576
It's on your way.

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:32.057
I'll return the car to Lei.

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.496
Little Qian will take you home later.

00:05:38.857 --> 00:05:39.777
Thank you.

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:40.936
You brought me here today.

00:05:40.936 --> 00:05:42.217
I know what you want.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.537
You want me to make up with him.

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:51.537
Wait a second.

00:05:57.016 --> 00:05:58.177
Since we're here today,

00:05:58.177 --> 00:05:59.737
let's get everything out in the open.

00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:03.696
After all these years,

00:06:04.016 --> 00:06:06.657
I've never hidden my feelings for you.

00:06:07.737 --> 00:06:09.657
I know how you feel about me.

00:06:09.977 --> 00:06:11.336
There's someone in your heart.

00:06:12.537 --> 00:06:14.537
But people have to move forward.

00:06:15.177 --> 00:06:17.136
Friends can take things
to the next level.

00:06:18.617 --> 00:06:20.297
I'm asking you one last time today.

00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:25.016
Would you consider giving me a chance?

00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:34.136
I'm sorry.

00:06:37.977 --> 00:06:38.816
All these years,

00:06:40.696 --> 00:06:42.456
I've only ever seen you as a friend.

00:06:50.417 --> 00:06:53.217
You take the car back to Lei.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.016
(Occupied; Welcome to Yunxi)

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:08.256
What have all these years gotten me?

00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:11.297
If I weren't clinging to him,

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:13.977
he'd never come looking for me.

00:07:17.057 --> 00:07:19.297
Didn't you say you're still young,

00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:20.777
wanting to give it one more shot?

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:22.256
Now you're giving up?

00:07:22.256 --> 00:07:24.417
Then I'd just be fooling myself.

00:07:24.417 --> 00:07:27.097
I know he still has feelings
for Chen Yumo.

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:31.936
He treats me like I'm invisible.

00:07:38.537 --> 00:07:43.657
Feelings are something you can't force.

00:07:44.857 --> 00:07:46.016
Oscar Wilde once said,

00:07:46.097 --> 00:07:48.057
"True love means
even after they're gone,

00:07:48.057 --> 00:07:49.417
you can still love someone new."

00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:52.297
You need to look at the bigger picture.

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:54.417
Someone better is out there for you.

00:07:59.617 --> 00:08:01.016
Why are you crying again?

00:08:01.136 --> 00:08:02.057
Don't cry.

00:08:03.857 --> 00:08:04.456
Don't cry.

00:08:31.537 --> 00:08:32.657
It's been a long day.

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:34.616
Head home and rest.

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:38.616
Qiming,

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:44.096
do you really think
I should go on blind dates?

00:08:45.616 --> 00:08:46.616
Just go meet them.

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:47.856
See if you click.

00:08:48.297 --> 00:08:49.417
What if none suits me?

00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:51.976
Then don't force it.

00:08:53.017 --> 00:08:54.456
Social compatibility matters.

00:08:55.137 --> 00:08:56.976
A woman shouldn't
marry beneath her status.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.297
Go home.

00:10:48.184 --> 00:10:51.256
(Zhang Ziwu)

00:11:57.537 --> 00:11:58.497
Give me another one.

00:12:13.137 --> 00:12:13.936
That one.

00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:25.456
T-That's enough already.

00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:28.177
Can't you just grab any outfit?

00:12:29.177 --> 00:12:32.177
Why so much fuss
for meeting an ex-boyfriend?

00:12:37.497 --> 00:12:38.336
Let me try that one.

00:13:28.856 --> 00:13:29.616
Are you okay?

00:13:33.297 --> 00:13:34.336
Bao Hei's watching.

00:13:41.017 --> 00:13:41.897
How about this one?

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.576
Are you going all in?

00:13:47.537 --> 00:13:50.297
They won't believe it
unless I make it real.

00:13:53.816 --> 00:13:56.537
Do you mean Bao Hei or Ye Qian?

00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:01.216
Same thing.

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:06.297
I'll take this one.

00:14:34.377 --> 00:14:36.537
Huo is quite a character.

00:14:37.616 --> 00:14:39.696
He lets his woman hit on another man.

00:14:40.537 --> 00:14:41.936
He's something else.

00:14:42.936 --> 00:14:44.017
How's the southwest?

00:14:46.057 --> 00:14:49.897
They're getting hit hard over there.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:53.936
There was
a cross-border operation recently,

00:14:54.736 --> 00:14:56.377
right around when they contacted us.

00:14:56.616 --> 00:14:58.616
They almost took down
Huo's entire operation.

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:03.616
No wonder they're rushing
to cooperate with us.

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:05.696
Looks like

00:15:07.177 --> 00:15:10.976
they're showing their hand
to that young cop.

00:15:15.897 --> 00:15:16.936
Should we give them...

00:15:21.816 --> 00:15:22.576
Interesting.

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:26.336
Sure. Let's add to the fun.

00:15:36.816 --> 00:15:37.497
Name?

00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:40.696
Zhao Junxin.

00:15:42.537 --> 00:15:43.216
Age?

00:15:44.297 --> 00:15:45.096
39.

00:15:46.576 --> 00:15:47.297
Occupation?

00:15:48.177 --> 00:15:48.936
Caregiver.

00:15:51.537 --> 00:15:52.497
Why did you kill?

00:15:54.816 --> 00:15:55.576
Revenge.

00:15:57.936 --> 00:15:58.856
For whom?

00:15:59.777 --> 00:16:00.576
My son.

00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:05.377
There was a conflict between your son
and Liao Guangyong, Jiang Yuzhen?

00:16:05.856 --> 00:16:07.936
Liao Guangyong killed my son.

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.257
So I stabbed him to death.

00:16:11.017 --> 00:16:12.216
That's an eye for an eye.

00:16:12.657 --> 00:16:16.497
As for Jiang Yuzhen, the nanny,

00:16:18.936 --> 00:16:20.336
I didn't plan to kill her.

00:16:21.336 --> 00:16:22.856
She shouldn't have blocked my way.

00:16:28.336 --> 00:16:31.897
How exactly
did Liao Guangyong kill your son?

00:16:33.297 --> 00:16:34.497
Eight years ago,

00:16:35.297 --> 00:16:39.657
Liao Guangyong killed my son
in a drunk driving accident.

00:16:40.216 --> 00:16:44.017
He also ruined my leg in that crash.

00:16:46.657 --> 00:16:47.657
Explain in detail.

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:51.657
Don't want to.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.576
Watch your tone.

00:16:54.537 --> 00:16:56.736
Confess now,
and you might still get leniency.

00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:58.816
If you refuse to answer...

00:16:58.816 --> 00:17:01.936
What more can you do? Take my life?

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.176
So be it.

00:17:10.737 --> 00:17:12.616
By reviewing
the traffic department's records,

00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:15.057
a traffic accident did occur
eight years ago

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:18.176
at the intersection of Xing'an Road
and Longshan Avenue in the old town.

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:19.937
The incident occurred at 1:00 AM.

00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:23.457
A BMW SUV lost control
and crashed into the traffic light.

00:17:23.816 --> 00:17:26.816
It struck a mother and her son
waiting for a taxi by the roadside.

00:17:26.816 --> 00:17:28.297
One dead, one critically injured.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.737
The injured one was Zhao Junxin.

00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:31.336
How old was the child?

00:17:32.336 --> 00:17:33.816
Three years old. Died instantly.

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:36.057
The investigation

00:17:36.057 --> 00:17:38.737
found that the BMW driver, Li,
was driving under the influence.

00:17:39.576 --> 00:17:40.737
After the incident,

00:17:40.737 --> 00:17:42.777
he didn't flee the scene
but called the police.

00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:45.576
He also took responsibility
fairly proactively.

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:48.096
He was detained on suspicion
of dangerous driving

00:17:48.297 --> 00:17:51.737
and compensated the victims
a total of 500,000 yuan for damages.

00:17:54.057 --> 00:17:56.777
What does this accident have to do
with Liao Guangyong?

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.176
The owner of that BMW
was Liao Guangyong.

00:17:59.176 --> 00:18:00.656
Li was Liao Guangyong's friend.

00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:02.777
It's said Liao Guangyong
lent him the car.

00:18:03.537 --> 00:18:05.376
In that case,
unless the car itself was faulty,

00:18:05.656 --> 00:18:08.816
Liao Guangyong, as the owner,
wouldn't be liable.

00:18:08.937 --> 00:18:11.176
This case also made the local news
at the time.

00:18:11.336 --> 00:18:12.457
Not exactly because of that,

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:14.257
but because Zhao Junxin claimed

00:18:14.616 --> 00:18:16.616
that Li wasn't the one actually driving.

00:18:17.257 --> 00:18:20.057
She said Li was paid
by the real driver to take the fall.

00:18:20.457 --> 00:18:23.057
And she claimed
the real driver was Liao Guangyong.

00:18:24.777 --> 00:18:26.616
Did Zhao Junxin have any evidence

00:18:27.376 --> 00:18:28.576
to make that claim?

00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:32.376
If she had evidence, she wouldn't
have had to make such a fuss.

00:18:32.856 --> 00:18:35.737
Liao Guangyong was the owner
of the Yongguang Supermarket chain.

00:18:35.896 --> 00:18:37.136
He was a local celebrity.

00:18:37.136 --> 00:18:38.856
The traffic police took it seriously,

00:18:38.856 --> 00:18:42.697
but they couldn't find direct evidence
supporting Zhao Junxin's story.

00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:44.457
Zhao Junxin's memory wasn't reliable

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:45.497
because she was injured.

00:18:45.497 --> 00:18:47.656
There were no cameras due to road work.

00:18:47.816 --> 00:18:49.096
Anything from inside the car?

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:50.576
Airbags? Fingerprints?

00:18:51.057 --> 00:18:54.576
And was Liao Guangyong in the car?

00:18:55.497 --> 00:18:57.136
Look, the airbags didn't deploy.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.937
Liao Guangyong was indeed in the car.

00:18:59.257 --> 00:19:00.497
But it was his car,

00:19:00.497 --> 00:19:01.737
so that doesn't prove much.

00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:04.537
Liao Guangyong claimed
he was drunk and asleep

00:19:04.737 --> 00:19:06.416
and knew nothing in the passenger seat.

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:11.096
So how was this matter settled?

00:19:11.856 --> 00:19:14.096
Zhao Junxin's husband
gave an interview to the media.

00:19:14.217 --> 00:19:16.416
He said Zhao Junxin
was overwhelmed by grief,

00:19:16.576 --> 00:19:18.576
implying that she wasn't
thinking straight

00:19:18.576 --> 00:19:19.777
and her words were dubious.

00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:22.616
Zhao Junxin accepted Li's compensation.

00:19:30.856 --> 00:19:32.816
I knew about the car accident.

00:19:33.136 --> 00:19:35.656
But I never imagined
it was because of that.

00:19:37.537 --> 00:19:40.176
When you were asked
about Liao Guangyong's relationships,

00:19:40.176 --> 00:19:41.176
why not mention it?

00:19:42.737 --> 00:19:44.176
I didn't think it mattered.

00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:46.576
After all, Liao wasn't the one driving.

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:50.176
And the necessary investigations
were done back then.

00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:51.937
The compensation was paid.

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:53.737
So many years have passed.

00:19:54.057 --> 00:19:55.656
I genuinely never considered it.

00:19:57.017 --> 00:20:01.376
Has Zhao Junxin had any contact
with Liao Guangyong over the years?

00:20:04.656 --> 00:20:07.656
Not to my knowledge.

00:20:09.457 --> 00:20:14.257
Can you contact that Li guy
who borrowed your husband's car?

00:20:15.737 --> 00:20:16.937
He was Liao's friend.

00:20:16.937 --> 00:20:18.096
I don't really know.

00:20:20.856 --> 00:20:23.017
You were partners for life, right?

00:20:24.217 --> 00:20:25.537
Liao Guangyong is dead.

00:20:25.937 --> 00:20:28.656
You don't seem sad at all.

00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:35.737
He's gone.

00:20:37.017 --> 00:20:38.297
What's the use of being sad?

00:20:39.537 --> 00:20:40.416
Besides,

00:20:42.017 --> 00:20:44.656
he was about to start a new family
with someone else.

00:20:47.777 --> 00:20:48.696
I just feel

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.576
a bit sorry for Jiang.

00:20:52.697 --> 00:20:53.376
Jiang Yuzhen?

00:20:55.096 --> 00:20:56.326
She meant well,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.096
going to visit Liao in the hospital.

00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:03.297
How long did Jiang Yuzhen work
as a nanny

00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:04.176
in your family?

00:21:06.096 --> 00:21:07.096
Over ten years.

00:21:08.816 --> 00:21:10.816
And when she went to work for Song Ying,

00:21:11.096 --> 00:21:11.977
it didn't bother you?

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:14.937
Would you believe me
if I said it didn't?

00:21:16.576 --> 00:21:17.656
It's just that Liao

00:21:17.896 --> 00:21:19.257
insisted she go over there,

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:20.737
saying he liked her cooking.

00:21:22.136 --> 00:21:25.217
And Miss Song, daughter of a professor,

00:21:25.856 --> 00:21:27.616
had never lifted a finger
to do housework.

00:21:27.937 --> 00:21:29.057
She needed care.

00:21:30.697 --> 00:21:31.856
As for me,

00:21:32.176 --> 00:21:32.977
my son was away.

00:21:32.977 --> 00:21:33.977
I was all alone.

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:35.856
Not much work needs to be done.

00:21:39.017 --> 00:21:41.896
Regarding Jiang Yuzhen's
family situation,

00:21:42.977 --> 00:21:43.937
how much do you know?

00:21:46.297 --> 00:21:49.937
Her husband passed away
from illness over a decade ago.

00:21:51.057 --> 00:21:52.217
She also had a son.

00:21:52.217 --> 00:21:54.257
I often heard her mention him,
called Tian.

00:21:57.376 --> 00:21:59.217
I'm not too sure what job he does.

00:21:59.977 --> 00:22:01.136
Anyway, she lived with him.

00:22:01.136 --> 00:22:02.457
He hasn't gotten married yet.

00:22:09.896 --> 00:22:11.297
I didn't expect you to come.

00:22:13.576 --> 00:22:15.376
You asked. So I'd be here.

00:22:17.416 --> 00:22:18.576
You trust me that much?

00:22:19.777 --> 00:22:21.017
That's never changed.

00:22:23.656 --> 00:22:24.297
Come on.

00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:38.336
Have some soup.

00:22:38.576 --> 00:22:39.896
You rushed to get here.

00:22:39.896 --> 00:22:40.937
You must not have eaten.

00:23:03.376 --> 00:23:04.376
Do you remember this?

00:23:05.257 --> 00:23:06.616
I remember when we were young,

00:23:06.856 --> 00:23:08.737
you chose the same pattern for me.

00:23:08.896 --> 00:23:10.697
But when I saw it the other day,

00:23:10.977 --> 00:23:13.057
I felt it looked similar in some ways

00:23:13.057 --> 00:23:14.257
yet different in others.

00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:17.257
The old pattern was on top.

00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:19.257
Now it's moved to the chest.

00:23:20.057 --> 00:23:20.816
It doesn't matter.

00:23:21.376 --> 00:23:22.537
To me, it's all the same.

00:23:24.977 --> 00:23:26.017
Essence unchanged.

00:23:27.176 --> 00:23:28.096
The pattern changed,

00:23:29.297 --> 00:23:30.737
but that's because of time.

00:24:33.737 --> 00:24:36.697
It'd be really strange
if they didn't do something.

00:24:39.224 --> 00:24:40.136
There's surveillance.

00:25:58.217 --> 00:25:59.136
How much have you had?

00:26:01.112 --> 00:26:02.057
- Stop.
- I haven't...

00:26:02.057 --> 00:26:02.937
Haven't been drinking.

00:26:02.937 --> 00:26:04.697
Can't you see I'm eating the food?

00:26:08.017 --> 00:26:08.656
Bring more wine.

00:26:08.656 --> 00:26:09.616
Get me another jug.

00:26:09.816 --> 00:26:10.616
No. No more.

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:11.497
Don't bring any more.

00:26:12.576 --> 00:26:13.497
Who even are you?

00:26:13.737 --> 00:26:14.937
What gives you the right?

00:26:15.457 --> 00:26:16.257
You're nuts.

00:26:16.497 --> 00:26:17.616
I'm your friend. Alright?

00:26:17.616 --> 00:26:18.297
Have some water.

00:26:18.457 --> 00:26:19.576
No. Get lost.

00:26:20.497 --> 00:26:21.257
Hey, you...

00:26:21.977 --> 00:26:24.856
Don't think that because I like you,
you can do this and that.

00:26:25.136 --> 00:26:26.457
What 'this and that'?

00:26:27.136 --> 00:26:28.856
Like whoever you want.

00:26:29.257 --> 00:26:30.896
Wine! Now!

00:26:30.896 --> 00:26:31.896
No more wine, waitress.

00:26:31.896 --> 00:26:32.896
Check, please.

00:26:33.497 --> 00:26:34.896
No more drinking. Really.

00:26:34.896 --> 00:26:36.497
Be good. You really can't drink anymore.

00:26:36.697 --> 00:26:38.096
Excuse me. How can I help you?

00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:39.457
Bring wine!

00:26:39.457 --> 00:26:40.737
Ignore her. Check, please.

00:26:40.737 --> 00:26:41.497
How much?

00:26:43.816 --> 00:26:44.576
How much is it?

00:26:45.257 --> 00:26:47.096
Sir, your total is 2,100 yuan.

00:26:48.977 --> 00:26:49.816
How much?

00:26:49.977 --> 00:26:50.737
2,100.

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.977
Maybe just put it on Zhao's tab?

00:26:55.977 --> 00:26:56.896
Put it on her tab.

00:26:57.856 --> 00:26:58.457
Thanks.

00:27:01.977 --> 00:27:03.217
Come on. Let's go.

00:27:03.217 --> 00:27:04.057
They're closing.

00:27:05.816 --> 00:27:07.737
Drank away
over half a month's salary of mine.

00:27:07.737 --> 00:27:08.896
Oh, my.

00:27:09.616 --> 00:27:11.217
Come on. Let's go sing.

00:27:11.257 --> 00:27:12.816
Sing what? It's so late.

00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:13.697
Let's go home.

00:27:13.896 --> 00:27:16.057
No. I have to show off my singing voice.

00:27:16.336 --> 00:27:17.616
My singing style.

00:27:17.616 --> 00:27:19.537
You absolutely must hear my high notes.

00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:20.497
- Stop.
- It's amazing.

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:27.257
I knew all along

00:27:27.816 --> 00:27:28.977
what you people do.

00:27:32.737 --> 00:27:33.737
The red wine, the drinks,

00:27:34.497 --> 00:27:36.497
(and that bowl of soup tonight.)

00:27:38.257 --> 00:27:39.457
Such fine ingredients,

00:27:40.816 --> 00:27:42.497
ruined by adding the chemical garbage.

00:27:43.217 --> 00:27:43.896
What a waste.

00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:48.497
Are you a mole?

00:27:51.376 --> 00:27:53.576
If I said I'm not, would you believe me?

00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:57.416
If you were in my shoes,

00:27:57.977 --> 00:27:58.816
would you believe it?

00:28:00.576 --> 00:28:01.856
You have no reason not to.

00:28:02.937 --> 00:28:04.497
It's not like I've never touched

00:28:04.896 --> 00:28:06.217
the things you gave me.

00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:08.856
I just never expected

00:28:10.376 --> 00:28:12.257
that with so many ways to make money,

00:28:13.416 --> 00:28:14.816
you'd choose this path. Why?

00:28:17.856 --> 00:28:20.257
Do you believe that if I wanted to,

00:28:21.257 --> 00:28:22.416
I could arrest you now?

00:28:23.457 --> 00:28:24.497
Do you believe

00:28:26.856 --> 00:28:28.096
I'll shoot you right now?

00:28:40.816 --> 00:28:41.656
No, you won't.

00:28:44.896 --> 00:28:46.017
What exactly do you want?

00:28:57.257 --> 00:28:58.336
You came to me

00:28:59.257 --> 00:29:01.777
because you know Chief Lin
of the Narcotics Bureau is my uncle.

00:29:02.217 --> 00:29:03.697
If you want to do it in Wannan,

00:29:04.816 --> 00:29:07.616
I'm the only one who can help you.

00:29:09.336 --> 00:29:10.497
Do you need my help?

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:25.656
In the Narcotics Bureau,

00:29:25.937 --> 00:29:27.537
there actually is a chief surnamed Lin.

00:29:27.977 --> 00:29:30.457
But I don't know the exact relationship
between them.

00:29:32.297 --> 00:29:33.257
Look into it.

00:29:34.497 --> 00:29:35.057
Right away.

00:30:01.937 --> 00:30:03.497
I'll consider your proposal.

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:05.576
I'll notify you when it's time.

00:30:11.737 --> 00:30:12.497
Yumo,

00:30:15.297 --> 00:30:19.816
whoever you are, I won't mind.

00:30:28.497 --> 00:30:29.977
Your Chen Yumo died long ago.

00:31:08.777 --> 00:31:09.737
The bait's been out.

00:31:10.457 --> 00:31:11.737
Bao Hei must've received it too.

00:31:15.096 --> 00:31:15.697
Understood.

00:31:26.457 --> 00:31:27.176
Who is it?

00:31:39.017 --> 00:31:39.856
Why are you here?

00:31:40.977 --> 00:31:42.376
Can't I come to your place?

00:31:44.297 --> 00:31:45.257
What about the dorm?

00:31:46.497 --> 00:31:48.217
Worried I didn't go back to the dorm?

00:31:49.777 --> 00:31:50.537
You went drinking?

00:31:51.656 --> 00:31:52.457
Yeah.

00:31:52.737 --> 00:31:53.457
I show up

00:31:53.457 --> 00:31:54.777
wherever I'm needed.

00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:57.656
I think wherever Han Zhao is,

00:31:57.656 --> 00:31:58.977
you show up.

00:32:01.297 --> 00:32:02.336
Have some breakfast.

00:32:03.336 --> 00:32:04.697
Where did you go last night?

00:32:06.217 --> 00:32:07.537
KTV.

00:32:08.576 --> 00:32:11.336
Little Zhao fell asleep
singing in the KTV.

00:32:11.336 --> 00:32:12.697
I couldn't wake her up.

00:32:12.977 --> 00:32:14.457
So I figured we'd just sleep there.

00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:18.336
You just slept there?

00:32:20.896 --> 00:32:22.977
Did you get Han Zhao drunk on purpose?

00:32:23.176 --> 00:32:24.977
What nonsense are you talking?

00:32:25.297 --> 00:32:26.680
I, Si Yuanlong, swear to heaven

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.576
that I would never
exploit anyone vulnerable.

00:32:28.576 --> 00:32:29.777
Especially not Little Zhao.

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:32.096
Speak up.

00:32:32.896 --> 00:32:33.896
Why are you here?

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:39.576
I came because I missed you.

00:32:39.576 --> 00:32:40.937
I freshened up a bit

00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:42.297
and brought you food.

00:32:42.297 --> 00:32:43.376
We'll go to work together.

00:32:43.457 --> 00:32:44.017
Fried dough?

00:32:44.336 --> 00:32:45.057
I've eaten.

00:32:46.697 --> 00:32:47.856
You have 15 minutes.

00:32:49.856 --> 00:32:50.697
Half an hour.

00:32:51.616 --> 00:32:52.576
14 minutes.

00:32:52.697 --> 00:32:53.336
Okay.

00:32:58.336 --> 00:32:59.697
I divorced her long ago.

00:33:00.376 --> 00:33:01.017
What?

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:03.457
What trouble did she cause now?

00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:05.376
When did you divorce?

00:33:06.648 --> 00:33:07.616
Five or six years ago.

00:33:09.616 --> 00:33:10.376
The reason?

00:33:11.777 --> 00:33:12.656
Couldn't make it work.

00:33:16.656 --> 00:33:18.297
Let's talk about the car accident.

00:33:18.416 --> 00:33:19.576
We lost our son.

00:33:20.176 --> 00:33:21.576
She ran around causing trouble.

00:33:23.816 --> 00:33:26.096
She quit her job
and abandoned her family,

00:33:26.656 --> 00:33:27.777
including the elderly.

00:33:28.336 --> 00:33:29.697
She acted like she was possessed.

00:33:30.937 --> 00:33:32.896
If I hadn't stopped her back then,

00:33:33.497 --> 00:33:35.297
she wouldn't
even have taken the compensation.

00:33:35.656 --> 00:33:37.896
She kept demanding
explanations and the truth.

00:33:38.297 --> 00:33:39.217
Darn truth.

00:33:42.297 --> 00:33:44.656
Zhao Junxin is a bit obsessive, right?

00:33:45.297 --> 00:33:46.856
That's just how her personality is.

00:33:47.616 --> 00:33:48.937
After the accident, it got...

00:33:51.416 --> 00:33:53.336
Anyway,
I couldn't talk any sense into her.

00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:57.376
Originally, we planned
to have another child.

00:33:57.856 --> 00:34:00.217
But who knew
her body couldn't handle it?

00:34:00.217 --> 00:34:01.176
She couldn't conceive.

00:34:03.576 --> 00:34:04.737
All because of that accident.

00:34:05.057 --> 00:34:07.656
If only I'd known,
I should've demanded more money.

00:34:12.057 --> 00:34:14.256
Anyway, what's done is done.

00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:19.256
Instead of living comfortably,

00:34:20.256 --> 00:34:21.296
she had to be obsessed.

00:34:21.857 --> 00:34:22.817
I couldn't help her.

00:34:23.296 --> 00:34:24.817
Have you been in contact recently?

00:34:25.017 --> 00:34:26.497
No, we haven't spoken in ages.

00:34:29.817 --> 00:34:30.576
Dad,

00:34:30.776 --> 00:34:33.616
Mom says it's time to leave now.

00:34:33.937 --> 00:34:35.216
Alright, coming right now, son.

00:34:37.417 --> 00:34:39.696
If there's nothing else,
let's end it here for now.

00:34:39.928 --> 00:34:41.457
I'll take my kid to tutoring class.

00:34:41.857 --> 00:34:42.457
Okay.

00:34:42.817 --> 00:34:44.176
Alright, bye.

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.817
The police came to his door,

00:34:53.897 --> 00:34:54.776
but he never asked

00:34:54.776 --> 00:34:56.377
what his ex-wife did.

00:34:56.537 --> 00:34:57.176
Captain Leng,

00:34:57.696 --> 00:34:59.696
do you think he knows something?

00:35:00.897 --> 00:35:03.256
Investigate
his recent activities thoroughly.

00:35:04.337 --> 00:35:04.897
Yes.

00:35:17.776 --> 00:35:19.296
Is this the place, Ye?

00:35:19.537 --> 00:35:20.696
Are you sure?

00:35:21.576 --> 00:35:23.497
I drove Jiang Yuzhen back here
the other day.

00:35:23.497 --> 00:35:24.136
It's here.

00:35:25.057 --> 00:35:26.656
Geng Tianchou is really something.

00:35:26.776 --> 00:35:27.857
His mom died.

00:35:27.937 --> 00:35:28.817
But he didn't show up

00:35:28.817 --> 00:35:29.776
or answer his phone.

00:35:30.736 --> 00:35:33.296
Miao Xiaolan provided
Geng Tianchou's phone number?

00:35:33.432 --> 00:35:35.736
We didn't find a phone
among Jiang Yuzhen's belongings.

00:35:35.736 --> 00:35:36.736
Probably left it at home.

00:35:37.017 --> 00:35:38.017
Then Miao said

00:35:38.017 --> 00:35:40.497
Jiang once gave her
an emergency contact.

00:35:40.497 --> 00:35:41.296
It's her son.

00:36:00.296 --> 00:36:01.136
Geng Tianchou.

00:36:04.017 --> 00:36:04.736
Police.

00:36:12.457 --> 00:36:13.497
Officers, come on in.

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:14.337
This is my place.

00:36:14.337 --> 00:36:15.216
Well,

00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:16.817
I'm just tidying up here, see?

00:36:16.817 --> 00:36:17.937
Move it all out.

00:36:17.937 --> 00:36:18.616
Wang,

00:36:18.857 --> 00:36:19.656
move all this stuff.

00:36:19.656 --> 00:36:20.457
I've got guests.

00:36:20.457 --> 00:36:21.857
There's not even room to stand.

00:36:22.857 --> 00:36:23.776
Get all of this out.

00:36:24.176 --> 00:36:25.256
Okay, right away.

00:36:25.256 --> 00:36:26.296
Hurry. Thanks.

00:36:26.296 --> 00:36:27.136
Thank you.

00:36:27.136 --> 00:36:27.736
Thank you.

00:36:28.616 --> 00:36:29.337
Faster.

00:36:30.017 --> 00:36:32.096
Such a tiny place
packed with so much junk.

00:36:34.216 --> 00:36:35.017
Officers,

00:36:35.017 --> 00:36:36.857
t-this is all our place here.

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:40.616
You needed something from me?

00:36:43.937 --> 00:36:46.256
Do you know where your mom,
Jiang Yuzhen, went?

00:36:46.817 --> 00:36:48.656
Didn't she visit the old man
in the hospital?

00:36:50.256 --> 00:36:51.096
After that?

00:36:52.216 --> 00:36:52.977
After that?

00:36:54.656 --> 00:36:55.977
She didn't contact you yesterday?

00:36:56.616 --> 00:36:57.296
No.

00:36:58.656 --> 00:36:59.977
You didn't contact her either?

00:37:00.537 --> 00:37:01.216
No.

00:37:01.776 --> 00:37:03.256
You don't usually call your mom

00:37:03.256 --> 00:37:04.537
or send her a text to check in?

00:37:04.817 --> 00:37:06.017
Why call when there's nothing?

00:37:06.017 --> 00:37:07.296
Phone bills are pricey.

00:37:08.537 --> 00:37:09.897
Let's sit over there and talk.

00:37:09.897 --> 00:37:10.857
Let's go inside.

00:37:10.857 --> 00:37:12.096
Let's sit here.

00:37:12.256 --> 00:37:13.096
It's too hot.

00:37:13.457 --> 00:37:14.776
Come on. Let me clear this spot.

00:37:14.776 --> 00:37:15.616
It's such a mess.

00:37:15.776 --> 00:37:16.417
Sit here.

00:37:16.417 --> 00:37:17.576
Please have a seat.

00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:18.656
Let's sit and talk.

00:37:19.417 --> 00:37:21.136
Let me get you some water.

00:37:21.136 --> 00:37:22.616
You've worked so hard. Here.

00:37:22.857 --> 00:37:23.537
Here.

00:37:24.057 --> 00:37:24.457
Thanks.

00:37:24.457 --> 00:37:25.216
No problem.

00:37:25.457 --> 00:37:26.377
Here, officer.

00:37:27.377 --> 00:37:28.057
No need.

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.216
Sit. Let's have a quick chat.

00:37:41.817 --> 00:37:42.817
Do you know her?

00:37:43.417 --> 00:37:44.256
No.

00:37:44.857 --> 00:37:45.616
Haven't seen her?

00:37:46.057 --> 00:37:47.616
No, I haven't. Who is it?

00:37:53.296 --> 00:37:56.616
Do you know about your mom's employer,
Liao Guangyong, and his family?

00:37:57.977 --> 00:38:01.736
My mom has worked for them
for quite a long time.

00:38:01.736 --> 00:38:03.817
When I was little,
my mom was their nanny.

00:38:03.817 --> 00:38:06.937
Even earlier, she worked
at the supermarket they ran for a while.

00:38:06.937 --> 00:38:08.616
Back then, Yongguang only had one store.

00:38:09.736 --> 00:38:10.616
How are things?

00:38:11.576 --> 00:38:12.576
Alright, I guess.

00:38:12.576 --> 00:38:14.096
After all those years.

00:38:17.216 --> 00:38:18.256
Do you know Song Ying?

00:38:19.377 --> 00:38:21.537
You mean the old man's mistress?

00:38:21.817 --> 00:38:23.417
I know of her but don't know her.

00:38:24.656 --> 00:38:26.176
How's your mom with her?

00:38:27.656 --> 00:38:28.937
Just so-so, you know.

00:38:29.497 --> 00:38:30.736
Heard she was quite spoiled.

00:38:30.736 --> 00:38:33.096
Even needed my mom
to twist the cap off her water bottle.

00:38:33.096 --> 00:38:35.160
No idea what she even had hands for.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.080
From your mom's return
the day before yesterday

00:38:37.976 --> 00:38:39.448
to her hospital visit yesterday,

00:38:40.337 --> 00:38:41.776
was there anything unusual?

00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:43.897
What could be unusual?

00:38:43.897 --> 00:38:45.368
Just the usual stuff.

00:38:45.368 --> 00:38:45.868
Well...

00:38:47.128 --> 00:38:49.136
I didn't pay much attention.

00:38:50.457 --> 00:38:52.136
Was Jiang Yuzhen at home
during that time?

00:38:55.256 --> 00:38:57.337
Yes, probably.

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:00.176
Was she or wasn't she?

00:39:01.696 --> 00:39:03.776
My mom was usually here,
sorting through her junk.

00:39:03.776 --> 00:39:05.537
I played on my phone
in my room, door shut.

00:39:05.537 --> 00:39:06.817
I didn't notice.

00:39:07.696 --> 00:39:09.776
Why didn't you answer
when the police called you?

00:39:09.857 --> 00:39:11.736
I didn't know your number.

00:39:11.736 --> 00:39:13.696
Besides, who answers
unknown numbers these days?

00:39:13.696 --> 00:39:14.857
What if it's a scammer?

00:39:19.696 --> 00:39:20.497
Geng Tianchou,

00:39:22.377 --> 00:39:23.857
we are formally notifying you.

00:39:24.857 --> 00:39:28.457
Yesterday afternoon, a stabbing incident
occurred at Central Hospital.

00:39:29.208 --> 00:39:30.424
Your mom, Jiang Yuzhen,

00:39:32.056 --> 00:39:33.208
has unfortunately died.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.296
The case is still under investigation.

00:39:38.256 --> 00:39:40.776
We will notify you
once there are new developments.

00:39:47.656 --> 00:39:49.176
Do you have your mom's cell phone?

00:39:50.656 --> 00:39:52.136
She didn't give it to me.

00:39:55.288 --> 00:39:57.528
Alright. Thank you for your cooperation.

00:40:05.296 --> 00:40:06.937
Officers, take care on your way out.

00:40:07.576 --> 00:40:09.296
I won't see you out.

00:40:09.576 --> 00:40:10.377
It's alright.

00:40:12.817 --> 00:40:13.977
What the heck?

00:40:14.256 --> 00:40:16.776
I heard Jiang Yuzhen
doted on her son exceptionally.

00:40:16.776 --> 00:40:18.017
Worked tirelessly to raise him.

00:40:18.017 --> 00:40:19.256
Gave him everything he wanted.

00:40:19.256 --> 00:40:20.017
And what happened?

00:40:20.696 --> 00:40:22.696
Just proves
'mother's love, son's failure.'

00:40:26.616 --> 00:40:27.537
What about this?

00:40:27.537 --> 00:40:28.096
What is this?

00:40:28.096 --> 00:40:29.696
It's been banned by the state for ages.

00:40:29.817 --> 00:40:31.897
It's highly toxic.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.976
- Let's not throw it around.
- Yes.

00:40:33.976 --> 00:40:35.136
Then what should we do?

00:40:35.937 --> 00:40:36.736
Let's keep it safe.

00:40:36.736 --> 00:40:37.616
Can't just toss it.

00:40:37.616 --> 00:40:39.136
Yes, let's wrap it up securely.
