00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.550
Gentlemen,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.710
I know you can't wait.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.280
Our amazing team

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.640
is getting tonight's surprise ready for you.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.280
Everything here

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.560
will be something you've never

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.280
experienced before.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.680
Great.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.460

(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.220
(Personnel Files)

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.780
Meeting time.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.870
What's with you? Come on.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.000
Liu, give us the rundown.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.780
The information is solid.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.960
The two dog thieves confessed everything.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.030
There's a direct link

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.400
between Hongyun, the shelter, and the casino.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.990
Let's grab Zhang Ming.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.030
Bring him in and interrogate him.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.400
That'll connect all the dots

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.140
and lead us to the key evidence.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.150
We can't arrest him yet.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.710
We don't know how deeply
Zhang Ming is involved.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.280
If he doesn't know much,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.090
bringing him in won't help.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.030
It'll only make them lie low,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.680
and then it'll be harder to find evidence.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.680
If he is a key figure,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.240
arresting him now will tip them off,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.960
and the real people behind it

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.360
will disappear.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.800
You're overthinking it.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.240
Zhang Ming directly contacted the thieves.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.960
The dog poisoning caused chaos citywide.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.360
They're the main culprits.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.680
We meant to play the long game.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.910
But after we arrested them,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.120
things turned out differently.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360
Clearer, actually.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.800
Don't think I don't know

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.090
what you're worried about.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.710
Whether you like it or not,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.750
Wang Li is a suspect in this case.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280
As for whether it hurts Wang Yimo,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.590
that's not our concern right now.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.560
I'm not thinking about anything else.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.240
I want Zhang Ming arrested,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.150
held down,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.030
and questioned.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.470
Same as the two thieves.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.350
Make him name the guy,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.840
and we close the case.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.960
It's not the same.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.680
Those petty crooks barely knew anything.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.120
Them giving key info was luck.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.600
You've been after it.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800
Did you find it?

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.120
That was coincidence.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.030
You can't base actions on coincidence.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.360
Here's what we do.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.870
Coordinate with local and traffic police.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.420
Expand surveillance coverage.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.840
Put these key people

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.590
under watch.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.040
Once we have enough evidence,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.680
we take them all down at once.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.880
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.350
Yes, sir.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.180
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.310
Extra dishes on the house.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.840
Enjoy.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120
What's this about?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.560
Around here,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.040
most customers are regulars.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.070
You two must be new.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.830
Thanks for coming.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.560
Food okay?

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.590
Yeah, it's good.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.710
Pretty good.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.380
Wouldn't come every day if it wasn't.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.400
Good.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.190
If you like it, come often.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.160
Thanks for the support.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.230
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.080
Eat up.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.360
I've never seen those guys downstairs.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.910
These past few days,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.390
they show up for lunch and dinner.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.360
We should stay alert.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.560
Ali,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.160
you think something's off?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.680
Could be cops.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.630
Could be Bai's people.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.310
Last time you two trashed his kitchen,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.480
is there something you didn't tell me?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.200
No.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.680
I didn't do anything.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.510
Probably not.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.000
Probably?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.040
What do you mean, probably?

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.520
No.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.480
I just thought it over carefully.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.840
There's nothing.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.560
Things are sensitive right now.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.750
Don't hide anything from me.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.000
If something happened, tell me.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.430
Stay sharp.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.750
Are you doing okay now?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.110
Yeah.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720
Is Dad treating you well?

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.270
Yes.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.000
You can't keep missing payments.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.080
One more time

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.720
and if the system cuts you off,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.480
you won't be able to buy cold meds.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.220
(Ward 4)

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.580
(Wang Yimo)

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.870
Sorry,

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.670
the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.150
Please try again later.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.900
(Wang Yimo)

(Zhang Jiali)

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.150
Hello, the number you dialed...

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.020
(Contacts)

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.860
(Bai)

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.910
If anything comes up,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.280
call me.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.790
If I can help, I will.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.900
(Bai)

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.870
Ali, Zhang Ming went into the casino.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.440
Should I keep following?

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.470
No.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.800
Go home.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.110
Don't come back either.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.800
Okay.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.590
Mr. Bai,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.960
I'm in trouble.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.320
The police might come for me anytime.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.200
I don't know what your plan is,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.000
but I'm still useful.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.840
I can help you.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.150
But I need money.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.120
I need a lot of money

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.200
to take my mom away.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.350
Sit.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.960
Ming.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.680
No need to rush.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.320
The police haven't found you yet.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.800
I can handle

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.750
your problem.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.840
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.200
This is...

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.030
Found a companion for the mute.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.350
Nice.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.040
What's his disability?

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.720
His name's Zhang Ming.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.630
He's Wang Li's accountant.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.360
Back when the clubhouse kitchen
got smashed up,

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.840
he was there too.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.550
Didn't I tell you?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.670
I'll cover your losses.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.750
That's why I brought him today.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.840
Mr. Bai,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.470
what does this mean?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.600
You want me to pay?

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.120
Qiang smashed the kitchen.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.030
I tried to stop him, but I couldn't.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.440
Didn't you say you'd help me?

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.080
Now you want me to pay?

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.550
I don't have money.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.840
Not a cent.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.670
Okay, sit, sit.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.680
Sit down.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.000
Who said you're paying?

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.950
I told you it's got

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.200
nothing to do with you.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:03.910
Why are you so nervous?

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.030
Then what are you two doing here?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.360
Talking over each other

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.220
and putting on a show?

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.150
You think I'm stupid?

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.840
Just give me a straight answer.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.120
Is he paying?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.720
Or should I sell him to settle the debt?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.800
Say it.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.990
Neither.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.720
He won't pay a dime.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.440
But with him around,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.600
someone else will.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.790
You're negotiating with Wang Li, right?

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.120
Take him with you to Hongyun later.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.040
I'll come after.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.040
Then,

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.790
you'll understand.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.200
Always so mysterious.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.440
Where are you going?

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.320
Why not go together?

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.360
Things are tense right now.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.630
Too many people draws attention.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.390
Relax.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.710
I'm not running.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.630
Pointless.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.870
Mr. Bai.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.800
Don't worry.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.240
Once it's done,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.250
however much you want,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.670
I'll give it to you.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.470
Thanks, Mr. Bai.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.030
Why aren't we going together?

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.030
What are you waiting for?

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.720
They're figuring out how to deal with me.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.240
We'll go in later.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.960
Give them time to talk.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.960
They're plotting against you,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.360
and you're sleeping here?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.550
You're telling me what to do?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.790
They think cooperating

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.030
means they can cut me out.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.150
Give them some space and time.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.070
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.360
You'll see soon enough.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.660
(A mysterious figure?)

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.320
Okay.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.630
Got it.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.840
Captain Zhao.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.200
Everyone's in position.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.680
Good.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.990
Master.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.960
Are we wrong

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.200
about Wang Li?

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.790
If he's tied

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.790
to Liu Yan's case,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.000
his movements and connections don't match.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.910
If it's the Naked Banquet Case,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.650
we don't have solid evidence.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.960
I've told you so many times,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960
stop chewing on pen caps.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.320
Put anything in your mouth.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.390
How old are you?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:25.990
Liu.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.150
Wang Li's profile.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.580
(Class of 1990,
Huaxin Middle School, Qingcheng)

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.440
Look here.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.440
Wang Li in middle school.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.280
This guy.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.480
Bai Qiming?

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.920
Bai?

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.750
He and Wang Li were classmates.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.260
(Class of 1990,
Huaxin Middle School, Qingcheng)

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.160
Mr. Li,

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.960
what's this about with Wang Li?

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.510
Do you know what Bai wants?

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.750
You two better give me an answer.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.390
My name's Bai Qiming.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.840
Just call me Bai.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:44.910
Give me five minutes.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.840
If you're not interested after that,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.750
you can throw me out anytime.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.510
(Bagong Dog Shelter)
Say something worth my time.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.930
Or, neither of you is leaving.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.040
Mr. Li,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.240
I came with sincerity.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.160
Give me an account number.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.680
I'll wire you 200,000 right now.

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:08.110
Consider it

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.110
a meeting gift.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.510
Looks like you're serious.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.680
Get to the point.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.240
What do you want?

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.680
Live-stream dog sales.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.000
Cut loose the small stuff at the casino.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.510
Who's buying dogs on livestreams?

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.880
The shelter doesn't make money.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.400
Not losing money would be a win.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.480
I'd make more

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.440
renting this place out.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.750
That's called an information gap.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.480
Livestreaming isn't just about selling dogs.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.830
It's about selling emotion.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.750
Round up a few hundred stray dogs.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.400
The worse they look, the better.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.550
Trigger donations
from so-called animal lovers.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.270
Make netizens think you're doing charity

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.440
and good deeds.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.510
The key point is

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.270
once your income

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.720
gets traced,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.270
it's illegal money.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.920
Here comes my resources.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.640
I take part of your earnings

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.200
and invest it overseas.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.720
When that money comes back,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.070
it's completely clean.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.480
And the returns are huge.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.720
Those foreign ventures

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.200
are easy money.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.860
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.860
(Welcome)

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.800
Let's go.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.340
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.500
Captain Zhao,

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.830
our stake-out just caught

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.790
Zhang Ming and Li Xu went
into Hongyun together.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.400
How did those two end up together?

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.960
Zhang Ming's ties to them just got closer.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.700
(Teahouse Shareholder;
Shelter Shareholder)

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.520
Mr. Wang,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.510
you seem in a good mood.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.920
Enjoying the view?

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.440
He came with me.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.670
But don't ask me.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.720
I don't know why either.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.040
Ming.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.150
Yes.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.770
Make some tea.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.670
Okay.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.080
Exactly.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.510
My guy came along with you.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.940
It wouldn't be right for me to ask.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.070
Seriously.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.910
What's up with you?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.270
Why dragging things out?

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.920
Didn't I just say that earlier?

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.590
I don't know, stop asking me.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.200
Got it?

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.320
Relax.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.240
Someone will explain it to you later.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.480
Fine.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.480
Let's talk business.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.160
The cooperation.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.110
What do you think?

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.350
Here's what I think.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.240
I think your restaurant

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.170
doesn't need major changes.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.830
Once I'm involved,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.310
we'll just renovate

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.760
the private rooms on the third floor.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:07.880
VIP reception.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.510
My business

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.910
stays the same.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.590
We maximize profits.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.960
Think long term. What do you say?

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.920
Whatever you need, say it.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.830
I'll do it.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.870
Ali.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.480
Since we're partnering,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.880
shouldn't we

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.640
sort things out too?

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.030
I still have

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.750
some accounts to sort out.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.550
Once I do,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.350
it'll be handled.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880
Greetings, my friends.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.030
You two met for tea and didn't invite me.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.480
That's cold.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.090
What are you doing here?

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.080
Why?

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.030
You can talk to Mr. Li

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.960
but I can't know about it?

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.960
What we talked about

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.750
is not about you.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.760
Today,

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.440
I don't have time for you.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.480
Ming,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.560
see him out.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.590
Bai,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.070
you send me ahead
just so you can show off?

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.910
Seriously?

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.920
Does it make you feel special

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.240
to have everyone waiting on you?

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.040
Mr. Li,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.960
stop undermining me.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.790
You two needed to talk.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.510
I shouldn't be involved.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.310
I was giving you space.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.200
Right, Mr. Wang?

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.350
Fine. Since everyone's here,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.200
let's stop hiding things.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.240
Let's put it all on the table today.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.840
That's better, isn't it?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.400
Should've done this earlier.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.640
See?

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.590
If everyone had this attitude,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.680
we'd be fine already.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.720
All right.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.920
I'll be blunt.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.440
I have a way to compensate your losses.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.110
Right here.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.920
Ask him for the money.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.310
That's your solution?

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.680
You're insane.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.440
If I were going to ask him for money,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.700
I wouldn't need you to tell me.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.270
He owes you money.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.790
Not just for trashing the clubhouse.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.880
He owes you big money.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.720
Can you just say it clearly?

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.670
I can.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.350
Once I do, you'll get it.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.240
The shelter money.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.790
Did you receive it all?

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.000
I don't know what you two talked about,

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.200
but for your safety,

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.480
the livestream money

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.550
was never put in your account.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.790
You know that, right?

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.390
So,

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:10.750
Wang Li and I worked together

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.440
and temporarily

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.440
routed the money to him.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.920
To this day,

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.000
he hasn't given me a single cent.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.240
What did you say?

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.680
I don't understand a word.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.070
But I get one thing.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.590
You're both scammers.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.830
I hate being lied to more than anything.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.640
Now I know why you made me come early.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.480
Fine.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.590
Today,

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.200
if this doesn't get cleared up,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.310
if there's no conclusion,

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.720
nobody leaves this room.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.550
Mr. Li, don't get angry.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.960
I would never lie to you.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.030
What he said

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.160
has nothing to do with me.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.830
Nothing to do with you?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.840
Zhang Ming,

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.750
give me the card you withdraw money from.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.640
All the livestream money went
into Zhang Ming's card.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.880
He's your guy.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.240
And you're saying
it has nothing to do with you?

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.560
Ali,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.560
this…

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.480
this card…

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.510
the money in it…

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.680
I… I don't know what kind of money this is.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.920
I made a withdrawal.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.550
But honestly, I have no idea.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.080
I swear

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.190
this is the first time I've seen it.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.350
You can check the bank records.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.480
That can't lie.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.780
(Self-Service Bank)

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.540
Please take your cash.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.110
All right.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.110
(Self-Service Bank)
Then let's check.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.440
See who withdrew the money.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.590
(Cash)
Zhang Ming,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.790
I only kept the card because I trusted you.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.240
Please retrieve your card.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.030
How dare you touch this money?

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.790
All this time,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.860
how much did you and your boss
skim off me?

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.030
(Self-Service Banking)

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.350
You used my trust.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.680
You lied to me. To everyone.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.320
You set me up.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.440
You framed me, Bai.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.010
You think you're worth
the effort of a setup?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.250
Don't forget.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.480
You called me first, asking for help.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.510
Why don't you ask your boss

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.670
where that money

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.070
actually went?

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.720
Mr. Bai…

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:51.880
Mr. Bai… Ali…

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.030
Mr. Li, my... my mom is sick.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.030
I can't get into trouble.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.800
If I do,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.270
she's done.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.070
You're all big bosses.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.160
Please let me go.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.640
You're all big shots.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.110
Don't hold it against me.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.880
I'm begging you!

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.240
I finally get it.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.400
Both of you are scammers.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.240
Every last one of you.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.320
Bai,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.680
our deal is easy to settle.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.080
Wang Li,

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.750
our business is easy, too.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.030
But whatever's between you two,

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.030
I don't care.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.590
I only want my money.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.760
Understand?

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.110
As for your mess,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.920
I'll give you time to sort it out.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.400
If you can't,

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.480
this time next year,

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.110
you'll be six feet under.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.000
Bai,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.790
you won

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.320
this round.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.760
Name your terms.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.630
Terms?

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.270
Think you're qualified to talk terms?

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.790
Look at you now.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.510
Even your right-hand man of ten years

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.590
dares to betray you.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.750
What do you have to bargain with?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.510
I'll ask you one last time.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.200
What do you want?

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.550
Not telling you.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.110
I'll kill you!

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.880
So we're playing dirty now?

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.270
No more pretending now.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.590
None of you are walking away from this.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.070
No one is getting out alive.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.200
We go down together.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.270
Together!

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:06.590
Ming,

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.480
do you know how big a mess you've made?

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.950
I do.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.160
If my mom weren't sick,

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.830
I wouldn't be this desperate for money.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.240
You needed money.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.510
You should've told me.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.070
Instead, you went behind my back

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.270
and did all this.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.550
What was I supposed to do?

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.190
Ali,

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.160
I told you before.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.400
Did you listen?

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.030
If you hadn't dragged me
into working with Bai,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.070
would it have gone this far?

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.640
I warned you

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.640
right after the first job.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.400
But you went crazy.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.920
And now you blame me?

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.550
I'm an accomplice at worst.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.720
Let's not tear each other apart.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.720
What do you mean?

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.000
You know what I mean.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.000
I'm turning myself in.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.550
Why should all your dirty deeds

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.200
end up on my head?

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.390
Calm down.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.510
It's not that bad yet.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.330
I can still figure something out.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:51.920
Figure out what?

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.830
You keep

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.070
figuring things out,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.880
I'll die without even knowing how.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.520
Easy.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.430
Easy.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.350
Think about your mom.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.440
If we all go down,

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.680
who takes care of her?

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.200
Don't talk about my mom.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.030
I'll take the fall.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.680
Then someone will look after her.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.750
You need money, right?

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.110
I've got

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.880
500,000 in cash at home.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.120
I'll give it all to you.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.510
Right now.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.520
Wait for me.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.630
Wang Li.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.920
Stop lying to me!

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.160
At this point,

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.400
we're tied together.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.560
I'm doing this

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.440
for my daughter too.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:52.870
Wait for me.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.720
For your daughter, huh?

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.780
(Wang Yimo)

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.550
Sorry,

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.200
the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.900
Darn it!

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:35.630
Wang Yimo.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.030
You and your dad

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.350
are same darn kind.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.830
Use me and dump me.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.200
Listen. I'm at the restaurant right now.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.960
You fix this now.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.400
Or I call the cops.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.310
Don't think I won't.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.630
Liars!

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.160
