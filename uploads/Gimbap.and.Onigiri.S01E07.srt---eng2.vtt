{\an8}‪RAMUNE

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:24.921
{\an8}- Shige.
- Yeah?

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.047
{\an8}- Please try this.
- Okay.

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.509
Is this kinpira?

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:31.094
Yes.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.641
Yeah, I think it's good.

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:38.184
Thank you.

00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:44.858
You've stopped… making Korean appetizers.

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:46.276
Huh?

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:49.571
Our customers loved them.
They were really good.

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:51.698
Sorry…

00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:58.913
- Can I get a refill on my shochu?
- Yes.

00:00:58.997 --> 00:00:59.873
A shochu refill.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:00.874
Okay.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:07.088
Welcome.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:09.549
Good to see you!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.601
Welcome.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:21.603
Hello.

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:23.188
I brought the files
that I was talking about.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.816
- I'll get a drink and wait for you.
- Okay.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.302
SCORCHED RICE FLAVOR

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:05.772
It's not working at all…

00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.331
Did you eat?

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:31.297
You don't have to come here every day.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:36.928
I have tomorrow off,
so I can hang out with you all night.

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.103
Let's go.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:03.598
Here.

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:05.808
Thanks.

00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:16.277
That's right, you can't do spicy, huh?

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:17.862
It's too spicy.

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:33.836
Jun-ho, your eyes are half closed.

00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:39.217
We should head home soon.

00:04:45.556 --> 00:04:47.350
What's wrong?

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.353
I'm sorry.

00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:52.647
Can I borrow you for a bit longer?

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:56.734
I just had so much fun today.

00:05:02.532 --> 00:05:04.158
When I'm alone,

00:05:04.242 --> 00:05:07.078
I can't stop thinking about Taiga.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.253
Just one more drink. Please?

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:16.170
It's on me.

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:17.922
Okay? Just one more.

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:19.715
- Shall we?
- Let's go!

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.267
{\an8}The sports magazine Clayton
is holding an anniversary party.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.184
{\an8}CLAYTON'S ANNIVERSARY PARTY

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:34.814
The editor-in-chief of this magazine was
at the reception you did the other day.

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:35.731
I see.

00:05:35.815 --> 00:05:40.319
The soup that you served…

00:05:40.403 --> 00:05:41.737
um…

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:42.697
Dak gomtang?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.408
That's the one!
He really liked your dak gomtang.

00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:48.286
He wants you to serve that
at this party too.

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:50.037
What do you think?

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.710
Is there a problem?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.379
No, it's fine.

00:05:58.462 --> 00:05:59.922
I'd love to do this.

00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:01.382
I'm glad.

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:05.052
- I'll ask Shige too. And I'll read this.
- Okay.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.932
I almost forgot.
Did you get notified about the reunion?

00:06:11.017 --> 00:06:11.851
Yeah…

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:16.063
You won't be coming again this year?

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:19.859
Yeah…

00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:49.847
Are you serious…

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:06.364
I can't anymore…

00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:07.615
Let's break up.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.101
ITO SHINTARO:
SO ARE YOU COMING TO THE REUNION?

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.148
I wanted you to look at me

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:45.903
I wanted you to pay attention to me

00:07:45.987 --> 00:07:51.033
Will you please stay by my side?

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:54.745
I like you

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:58.040
She really doesn't try to hide
that she's sad about the breakup.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:00.835
I wish I could be that open.

00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:06.549
Hey…

00:08:06.632 --> 00:08:08.175
You're not going to ask Rin out?

00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:11.596
You like her, right?

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:17.351
As long as Rin is happy,
that's all that matters.

00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:19.437
Really…

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:23.107
You can't be the one to make her happy?

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:24.900
Please…

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:27.194
Stop!

00:08:37.163 --> 00:08:38.581
Put it on here, please.

00:08:38.664 --> 00:08:40.374
Thank you.

00:09:07.693 --> 00:09:08.778
I like you.

00:09:15.284 --> 00:09:17.745
"I like you." Or something like that?

00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:26.879
Sorry for poking fun at you.

00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:39.141
Rin only sees me as family.

00:09:40.643 --> 00:09:42.019
If I tell her how I feel,

00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:44.438
she will have no one else

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.733
to rely on in Japan.

00:09:51.028 --> 00:09:52.154
Hey…

00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:55.157
Want me to take Rin home?

00:09:56.784 --> 00:09:57.660
What?

00:09:58.327 --> 00:09:59.954
She can sleep at my place.

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:05.376
Thank you.

00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:09.505
To be honest, I didn't think

00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:13.134
I could stand to hear her say,
"Taiga" anymore.

00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:17.638
I see…

00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:32.236
Smells good…

00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:44.498
You're awake? Want to eat?

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.584
Yeah.

00:10:47.209 --> 00:10:48.377
I will.

00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:55.885
It's ramyeon!

00:10:56.927 --> 00:10:58.637
Ramyeon?

00:10:58.721 --> 00:10:59.680
Like ramen?

00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:01.098
Yeah.

00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:04.518
There are a lot of words that are
similar in Japanese and Korean.

00:11:04.602 --> 00:11:07.062
Really? Like what?

00:11:07.146 --> 00:11:11.233
Family, promise, ignore, impossible, free.

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:13.652
Wow, I understand all of them!

00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:15.529
That's funny.

00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:22.703
Taiga also learned Korean words for me…

00:11:25.456 --> 00:11:27.958
All right, all right.
Forget about that for now.

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:31.962
The ramen is ready,
so get eggs from the fridge.

00:11:43.098 --> 00:11:44.350
But you know…

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.645
I'm kind of envious

00:11:47.728 --> 00:11:52.608
of how you're so
honest with your feelings.

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:53.984
Huh?

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:56.737
I mean,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.907
I think you're very fortunate
to be able to openly express

00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:02.576
your love for something.

00:12:03.702 --> 00:12:04.745
You think so?

00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:07.998
I've never thought about that.

00:12:08.791 --> 00:12:10.167
Well,

00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:13.921
you and I come from different backgrounds.

00:12:15.172 --> 00:12:16.382
Backgrounds?

00:12:16.924 --> 00:12:17.925
Yeah.

00:12:19.468 --> 00:12:21.845
What I want to say
is that you're very lucky.

00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:26.934
All right, the ramyeon is ready.

00:12:27.518 --> 00:12:28.602
Let's eat.

00:12:28.686 --> 00:12:29.853
- Yeah.
- It's hot!

00:12:42.908 --> 00:12:44.243
Sakumoto?

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:45.494
CHIEF MANAGER SAKUMOTO EIJI

00:12:45.578 --> 00:12:48.038
I work for a company called
Neo Meal Japan,

00:12:48.122 --> 00:12:51.375
and specialize in nutrition planning
and meal management for athletes.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.465
CONNECTING ATHLETES' MEALS
TO FUTURE PERFORMANCE

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.804
{\an8}NUTRIENTS MAKE UP THE BODY
STRENGTH COMES FROM DAILY MEALS

00:13:07.266 --> 00:13:12.563
{\an8}SAKUMOTO EIJI

00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:23.365
The President's Award?

00:13:25.743 --> 00:13:26.910
That's right.

00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:33.042
She's on a roll.

00:13:35.169 --> 00:13:37.171
Hey, Rin. Have you seen this?

00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:39.256
What?

00:13:40.049 --> 00:13:43.552
As expected,
Amane won the President's Award.

00:13:44.136 --> 00:13:46.347
It's no surprise, I guess.

00:13:47.264 --> 00:13:48.766
There's an interview too.

00:13:48.849 --> 00:13:51.518
{\an8}I don't know what my strength is but…

00:13:52.227 --> 00:13:55.105
{\an8}I have never lost the urge
to create something,

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:57.733
{\an8}or forgotten the excitement.

00:13:57.816 --> 00:14:02.279
When I'm creating something,
I can't think about anything else.

00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:04.573
I don't even feel the need to eat…

00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:08.702
These are the kind of people
we call "creators," huh?

00:14:09.286 --> 00:14:11.705
I bet she's never run out of ideas
of what to make.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.505
If you had
an infinite amount of time and money,

00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:21.382
what would you like to create?

00:14:23.801 --> 00:14:24.927
Rin?

00:14:25.761 --> 00:14:26.929
Is something wrong?

00:14:28.138 --> 00:14:29.223
Huh?

00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:32.059
Um…

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:34.979
Sorry…

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.815
Rin?

00:14:47.616 --> 00:14:49.034
All right.

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:05.467
I'm glad you got the day off today!

00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:07.970
Sorry for replying so late.

00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:13.434
Hey, everyone. Long time no see.

00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:18.272
- Man, that's brutal.
- Poor guy.

00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:20.733
He got an endorsement and he's a reserve?

00:15:24.236 --> 00:15:26.196
Hey, it's Taiga!

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.033
- It's been so long!
- You never hang out with us!

00:15:29.116 --> 00:15:30.534
- Have a seat!
- Excuse me.

00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:35.497
- Oh right, you guys haven't seen him, huh?
- We haven't!

00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:37.458
- I have, here and there.
- What? Really?

00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:40.044
I went to ask because I didn't know.

00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:44.465
- But it had nothing to do with it!
- It didn't!

00:15:44.548 --> 00:15:46.800
- He just said that randomly.
- I know.

00:15:46.884 --> 00:15:49.178
They're different from back then,
aren't they?

00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:50.471
Yeah.

00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:54.266
When we were in college,

00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:56.393
we were all rivals.

00:15:56.477 --> 00:15:58.812
So we always felt tense around each other.

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:04.068
Not just me, but probably all of them.

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:12.242
Maybe I should have come here earlier.

00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:18.540
People aren't as involved
in your life, as much as you think.

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:19.958
Yeah…

00:16:21.543 --> 00:16:23.712
And now was just the right timing,
I think.

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:28.133
You look like you're doing
much better now compared to before.

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:32.262
Isn't that because you found
something you want to do?

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.389
Well…

00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:37.309
If that's the case,

00:16:38.435 --> 00:16:40.771
it wasn't my own doing.

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:43.273
It was Rin.

00:16:44.024 --> 00:16:45.442
It's thanks to her.

00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:50.864
I was able to see things more positively
about myself.

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:54.993
I see.

00:16:55.077 --> 00:16:56.870
Things are good with your girlfriend, huh?

00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:01.875
Not really, actually.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.965
What? You broke up?

00:17:10.175 --> 00:17:11.260
I'm not sure.

00:17:11.343 --> 00:17:13.512
I don't know, but…

00:17:14.888 --> 00:17:15.722
But?

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:18.475
It's nothing.

00:17:50.716 --> 00:17:53.343
‪TANOMI

00:18:03.228 --> 00:18:04.563
So good!

00:18:05.397 --> 00:18:07.733
Your cooking is the best!

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.776
It's so delicious!

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:16.825
{\an8}That's delicious.

00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:21.496
The flavors are incredible.

00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:24.249
Thank you.

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:27.377
Why don't you deliver some to Rin
before you go to the party?

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:43.018
{\an8}JUN-HO

00:18:43.602 --> 00:18:46.355
I've been working hard
to become an animator.

00:18:46.438 --> 00:18:49.900
But you can't become one
just because you want to, right?

00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:51.193
I don't know.

00:18:51.276 --> 00:18:53.654
I want to believe in my talent
and challenge myself.

00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:13.340
Taiga…

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:35.904
You're Rin's…

00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:38.782
- Long time no see--
- You guys broke up.

00:19:40.284 --> 00:19:41.618
What do you want?

00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:47.874
You didn't even bother contacting her.

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.294
So what are you here for?

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.548
Sorry…

00:19:56.383 --> 00:19:57.509
I just…

00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:01.013
wanted to see her.

00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:04.057
What?

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.314
I came here today
without even thinking about…

00:20:12.774 --> 00:20:16.111
what to say if I actually saw Rin.

00:20:17.779 --> 00:20:19.072
To be honest,

00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:20.907
I still don't know.

00:20:24.786 --> 00:20:25.829
But…

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.709
I thought that maybe
she would smile if she ate my cooking.

00:20:32.044 --> 00:20:33.670
That thought overpowered everything else.

00:20:39.217 --> 00:20:40.093
In the end…

00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:44.473
I didn't have the courage to see her.

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:47.893
I'm pathetic.

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:55.484
Rin is…

00:20:59.613 --> 00:21:01.114
a precious…

00:21:07.704 --> 00:21:09.039
little sister to me.

00:21:10.499 --> 00:21:14.753
So if you can't be responsible,
don't come near her ever again.

00:21:56.461 --> 00:21:57.963
Check the rest for me, okay?

00:21:58.046 --> 00:21:58.964
Yes.

00:21:59.047 --> 00:22:02.717
CLAYTON'S ANNIVERSARY PARTY

00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:05.220
Enjoy.

00:22:05.303 --> 00:22:06.346
Thank you.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.765
I'm cutting weight for my match right now,

00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:11.393
so it's really helpful
to know what's in the food.

00:22:11.476 --> 00:22:14.938
I can imagine.
Managing your diet must be hard.

00:22:15.021 --> 00:22:16.523
It really is.

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:19.901
But this tastes good
and it's filling. I like it.

00:22:20.652 --> 00:22:22.529
Thank you. I'm glad.

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:25.073
You're eating too much.
Leave some for everyone else.

00:22:25.157 --> 00:22:27.075
Jeez, let me eat.

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:28.201
I'll come back.

00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:33.790
What do you want to try?

00:22:34.291 --> 00:22:35.709
I'm good.

00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:37.502
You're full already?

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.857
Good to see you, Mr. Sakumoto.

00:22:59.399 --> 00:23:03.236
I'm Hase.
Ito introduced me to you a while ago.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.613
I remember.

00:23:05.739 --> 00:23:07.908
May I have some too?

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.202
Yes, of course.

00:23:19.836 --> 00:23:20.795
Enjoy.

00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:23.798
Thank you.

00:23:39.189 --> 00:23:41.441
It has a very deep flavor.

00:23:43.526 --> 00:23:44.861
Thank you.

00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:46.446
I had heard

00:23:46.529 --> 00:23:49.741
that this dish was a hit last time,
so I was excited to try it.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:52.744
Yes, but…

00:23:53.286 --> 00:23:55.830
I changed it a bit from last time.

00:23:57.082 --> 00:23:58.291
The truth is,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.878
I used your website as a reference,

00:24:02.462 --> 00:24:07.217
and tried to make something that could
deliver both good flavor and nutrition.

00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:09.261
Really?

00:24:11.554 --> 00:24:14.683
But why did you choose a Korean dish?

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.894
Do you have a connection with Korea?

00:24:19.813 --> 00:24:22.274
No, um…

00:24:24.192 --> 00:24:28.238
I guess you could say I was influenced
by someone important to me.

00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:45.338
Hello?

00:24:46.715 --> 00:24:48.341
You finally picked up.

00:24:49.592 --> 00:24:50.593
Sorry.

00:24:52.137 --> 00:24:53.638
Did you eat the food I left for you?

00:24:54.514 --> 00:24:55.432
Huh?

00:24:56.224 --> 00:24:57.726
It's hanging on your doorknob.

00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:01.938
Thank you.

00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:05.483
I'm sure that it will lift your spirits.

00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:09.154
Bye.

00:25:19.205 --> 00:25:22.459
IF YOU LIKE ME, EAT IT.

00:25:23.376 --> 00:25:28.715
To you
I hope I can be like the setting sun

00:25:29.716 --> 00:25:35.472
A fleeting, beautiful memory

00:25:36.139 --> 00:25:42.896
May our precious days of youth

00:25:42.979 --> 00:25:46.816
Remain in your heart
Like a gentle painting

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.612
Filled with color

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:01.998
And you, to me, a green, sorrowful melody

00:26:02.082 --> 00:26:08.546
That softly echoes in a corner of my heart

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:14.928
I wish to be one of the stars

00:26:15.011 --> 00:26:21.476
{\an8}That make your beautiful eyes
Shine eternally

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.686
- Thank you for the food.
- May our

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.483
Precious days of youth

00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:30.110
Remain in your heart

00:26:30.193 --> 00:26:32.237
- It's delicious.
- Like a gentle painting

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.199
Filled with color
To you

00:26:36.282 --> 00:26:40.412
I hope I can be like the setting sun

00:26:41.329 --> 00:26:47.001
A fleeting, beautiful memory

00:26:47.585 --> 00:26:53.550
May our precious days of youth

00:26:54.509 --> 00:26:57.846
Remain in your heart
Like a gentle painting

00:26:57.929 --> 00:27:02.225
Filled with color

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.477
Like a gentle painting

00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:11.234
Filled with color

00:27:22.912 --> 00:27:25.248
That was so moving!

00:27:25.331 --> 00:27:26.541
I didn't understand anything,

00:27:26.624 --> 00:27:28.209
but was that a love song?

00:27:29.127 --> 00:27:30.128
Yes.

00:27:31.254 --> 00:27:34.549
But for me,

00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:39.053
it's a farewell song, in a way.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.515
Thank you for the food.

00:27:49.481 --> 00:27:52.400
{\an8}SLIDE TO ANSWER

00:27:53.943 --> 00:27:55.987
Yes? Hello?

00:27:57.864 --> 00:27:59.365
Yes, that's correct.

00:28:01.159 --> 00:28:01.993
What?

00:28:10.543 --> 00:28:11.836
Good work, Taiga.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.047
You too, Masumi.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:16.591
Want to get some drinks after this?

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.010
No, I think I'll pass today.

00:28:19.093 --> 00:28:21.638
Okay. Maybe next time, then.

00:28:26.142 --> 00:28:27.435
Masumi.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.275
I really appreciate you
choosing me for this event.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.321
I was happy to be able
to engage with athletes

00:28:38.404 --> 00:28:40.365
in a different way than my college days.

00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:42.742
Yeah.

00:28:43.284 --> 00:28:47.163
I'm happy, too, to hear those words
coming from you.

00:28:47.997 --> 00:28:49.165
Thanks.

00:28:49.249 --> 00:28:50.208
Yeah.

00:28:56.631 --> 00:28:57.674
Hey…

00:28:58.591 --> 00:28:59.509
Huh?

00:29:00.093 --> 00:29:04.013
I'm sorry. I'm starting to like you again.

00:29:06.057 --> 00:29:07.141
What?

00:29:08.351 --> 00:29:10.854
I'm telling you,
because I don't want any more regrets.

00:29:11.938 --> 00:29:15.775
I do feel bad telling you this when things
aren't going well with your girlfriend.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.363
I feel like,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.366
this time,
we'll be able to support each other

00:29:23.449 --> 00:29:25.577
and make things work.

00:29:29.414 --> 00:29:30.623
Support?

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:32.458
Yeah.

00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:34.544
Back then,

00:29:35.253 --> 00:29:38.006
I ignored your passion for track,

00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:39.966
and rushed you and hurt you.

00:29:42.218 --> 00:29:45.013
All I wanted was for you to say…

00:29:46.306 --> 00:29:49.225
I wish you would've accepted me,
even just for a second.

00:29:49.809 --> 00:29:51.019
Sorry.

00:29:52.562 --> 00:29:54.272
It's too difficult for me.

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.192
I don't need an answer right away.

00:29:59.444 --> 00:30:00.445
Just think about it.

00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:03.531
Bye. Thanks for everything.

00:30:24.636 --> 00:30:28.097
{\an8}RIN

00:32:34.724 --> 00:32:36.309
Taiga, I'm sorry.

00:32:40.605 --> 00:32:41.564
Rin!

00:32:50.907 --> 00:32:52.492
{\an8}Finally, I found you!

00:32:52.575 --> 00:32:53.534
{\an8}Thank goodness.

00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:55.369
Why?

00:32:56.954 --> 00:32:59.499
Rin? What's the matter?

00:33:11.844 --> 00:33:12.887
Are you okay?

00:33:26.025 --> 00:33:27.151
Taiga,

00:33:28.444 --> 00:33:30.655
why are you so nice?

00:33:32.156 --> 00:33:33.199
What?

00:33:35.034 --> 00:33:37.161
I said hurtful things to you.

00:33:38.663 --> 00:33:40.206
Well that's…

00:33:41.332 --> 00:33:43.417
because I made you say them, in a way.

00:33:46.462 --> 00:33:47.588
I…

00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:50.299
was too dependent on you.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.845
Thinking about my future
made me anxious and irritated,

00:33:54.637 --> 00:33:56.806
and I took all of it out on you.

00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:01.644
I'm really sorry.

00:34:08.317 --> 00:34:09.944
When I was in a rut,

00:34:10.903 --> 00:34:13.030
you never criticized me.

00:34:13.114 --> 00:34:16.576
You acknowledged my feelings
and encouraged me, remember?

00:34:18.786 --> 00:34:20.163
But when it was my turn,

00:34:21.789 --> 00:34:27.003
I pressured you and hurt you.

00:34:28.838 --> 00:34:29.964
I'm really sorry.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.974
Your words…

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.101
Your smile…

00:34:43.811 --> 00:34:47.899
Everything about you gave me strength.

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:52.653
So this time,

00:34:53.863 --> 00:34:56.991
I want to support you.

00:35:00.995 --> 00:35:02.121
I don't want…

00:35:05.124 --> 00:35:06.751
to let you go yet.

00:35:08.794 --> 00:35:09.795
That's…

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.507
how I feel.

00:35:19.764 --> 00:35:20.932
Earlier,

00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:26.479
a person from an advertising agency who
praised my work at the cultural festival,

00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:28.314
called me.

00:35:29.565 --> 00:35:32.652
They asked if I wanted
to start working as an intern.

00:35:34.737 --> 00:35:36.322
That's great!

00:35:37.198 --> 00:35:38.783
Good for you!

00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:44.288
I wanted to tell you, Taiga.

00:35:46.165 --> 00:35:48.292
Whether I'm feeling sad,

00:35:49.168 --> 00:35:51.254
or feeling happy, or anything,

00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:55.758
the first person I think of is you.

00:35:56.842 --> 00:35:59.011
Everything brings me back to you.

00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:05.434
I like you, Taiga.

00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:25.329
Me too.

00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:28.749
I was thinking about you the whole time.

00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:35.464
I'm sorry for breaking up with you.

00:36:44.056 --> 00:36:45.057
Rin.

00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:52.356
Will you go out with me again?

00:36:56.652 --> 00:36:57.737
Yes.

00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:11.792
You're hungry?

00:37:13.419 --> 00:37:14.587
I'm hungry.

00:37:23.012 --> 00:37:24.263
{\an8}Look, Rin!

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.350
{\an8}It stopped raining.

00:37:47.995 --> 00:37:49.872
{\an8}- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:57.129
It's good.

00:37:57.213 --> 00:37:59.340
We finally got to drink it.

00:37:59.423 --> 00:38:01.759
Taiga, thank you for the dak gomtang.

00:38:01.842 --> 00:38:03.344
It was really kkulmat!

00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:07.264
{\an8}But did you know your Korean message said,

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:11.227
{\an8}"If you like me, eat it"

00:38:12.478 --> 00:38:13.354
{\an8}in a commanding tone?

00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:14.730
{\an8}What?

00:38:14.814 --> 00:38:15.815
{\an8}It's okay

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:19.235
{\an8}if you want to act like a cocky guy
once in a while.

00:38:19.318 --> 00:38:20.152
{\an8}Let's go.

00:38:22.029 --> 00:38:23.155
{\an8}Where to?

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:24.198
{\an8}Home.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.866
{\an8}What?

00:38:28.369 --> 00:38:29.995
{\an8}Hey, wait!

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:33.999
Are you making fun of me?

00:38:34.083 --> 00:38:34.917
It's a compliment.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.419
I like that about you.

00:38:36.502 --> 00:38:38.003
- Hey!
- Move.

00:38:38.087 --> 00:38:39.213
How stupid can you be?

00:38:39.296 --> 00:38:40.589
{\an8}It's almost sad.

00:38:40.673 --> 00:38:41.507
{\an8}THIS DRAMA IS FICTION AND ALL CHARACTERS
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTIONAL

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:42.967
{\an8}Thank you.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:43.926
