00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.520
Had enough to eat?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.240
Want another bowl?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.080
Sure.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.400
Let's pack up and head back soon.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.120
Not staying here tonight?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.680
You actually want to stay?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.640
There are mosquitoes.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.220
Aren't you scared?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.360
Alright.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.800
Stop messing around.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.240
Let's go home.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.160
I'm not joking.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.600
I really don't want to leave.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.280
(Sorry, Boss)

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.880
(Your Keep Love shows)

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.000
(this is the best way
to boost the Romance Score)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.040
(and to catch the sunrise on time.)

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.520
You don't think it's too cramped in here?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.840
Just one night.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.200
What's wrong?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.080
Planning to play soccer in there?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.720
There's a snake!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.400
Where?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.440
Just kidding.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.400
Alright, it's fine now.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.720
Aming.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You seem…

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.320
actually a bit different.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.480
Different how?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.040
Hard to say.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.200
It's just…

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.560
a feeling.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.080
Is that good or bad?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.040
I can't tell either.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.200
I'll keep trying.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.280
What's up?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.120
I'm tailing my stepmom.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.800
I think she's seeing someone

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.000
behind my dad's back.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.440
I have to find solid proof.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.820
You skipped class again.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.200
How did you know?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.760
Didn't see you at morning exercise.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.360
Studying is just too boring.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.660
I want to watch the stars on Mount Nan.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.600
Want to come with me?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.000
Whatever.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.520
Alright, fair enough.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.640
But you have to agree to one thing.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.480
What thing?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.840
No skipping classes.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.560
And no lying.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.560
What happens if I lie?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.120
If you lie to me...

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.840
If you lie to me,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.320
we're not friends anymore.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.280
Alright, no lies.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.120
So, that means you'll come.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.980
(Utopia)

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.360
Miss Gu.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.080
Let's go over tomorrow's script.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680
Mr. Zhou,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.840
I don't work outside work hours.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.400
Then can we make this your...

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.640
dating time?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.720
A straight pitch
can still be a bad shot.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120
Take it easy.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.720
You're not worried about
your best friend?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.440
If you have that much energy,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.480
you should be more concerned about Boss.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.640
Yeah.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.800
True enough.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.080
Neither of them is easy to handle.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.440
I really hope

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.800
their back-and-forth

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.720
lasts a bit longer.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.960
That way,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.800
my stay in Mancheng

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.880
will be extended.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.040
Cheers.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.120
Alcohol, at the right moment,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.960
can totally boost emotions
through the roof.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560
But your Keep Love didn't tell you that

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.560
it only works
if both people feel the spark.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.840
You feel it yet?

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.400
Childish.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.120
Stupid.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.000
Boss, what's the Wi-Fi password?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.740
(Forget It Bar. Note: No Wi-Fi here,
phones get no signal.)

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.360
With that setup,
do you even get customers?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.640
Aren't you a customer?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.000
How am I supposed to pay later?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.640
It's fine, on the house.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.400
Is this place some kind of charity?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.200
Depends who asks.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.280
Do I look broke to you?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.040
You look cool.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.000
Has anyone told you
you're kind of pretentious?

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.760
You scared me half to death.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.880
I thought you'd fallen asleep.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.080
Why don't we

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.680
sleep a bit longer?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.200
Hand me the phone.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.100
If you keep making noise,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.840
I'm going to…

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.240
Aming,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.000
do you remember

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.960
that summer
when I'd just gotten into college?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.480
We snuck away to travel together.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.280
I couldn't bring myself to

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.840
spend the money you earned from working.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.600
So we took

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.560
that green train for hours and hours.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.240
It was exhausting.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.000
I even twisted my ankle.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.800
You carried me around for a few days.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.680
You carried me everywhere.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.080
Even to watch the sunrise.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.760
Back then, you told me,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.800
you'd always keep me safe.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.640
Do you still remember that?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.220
Later on, I studied hard

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.840
and got into a university in Mancheng.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.160
I thought moving to Mancheng

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.440
meant we could be together forever.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.320
I thought I could leave that home behind

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.040
and never look back.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.840
But I didn't expect

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.160
you'd walk away halfway through.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.400
Years have passed since then,

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.080
and it's still just me,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.600
going in circles, stuck in the same place.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.120
The truth is, being with Hu Yitong

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.360
was about fulfilling my dad's last wish.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.400
Only by getting married

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.560
could I receive the inheritance.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.560
I really waited for you a long time

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.760
until six months ago.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.720
I just told myself,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.400
it's time to let go.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.680
Aming,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.880
tell me,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.320
why couldn't you come back earlier?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.520
Honestly,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.280
you're all passion and fire,

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.840
while she's calm as still water.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.640
Maybe you should just let it go.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.320
This might have gone wrong.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.520
Why can't people just believe

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.480
what's right in front of them?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.300
But Keep Love showed

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.840
(Success Rate)
the success rate is 99%.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.760
Too bad you're that unlucky one percent.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.040
Then create an exclusive strategy for me.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.040
I have to win her over.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.960
Boss will go after you.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120
As part of the deal,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.120
I'll keep quiet about you liking Boss.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.600
Plus two more grand.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.800
So what if I like him?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.120
I don't need him to feel the same.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.900
Then how about this?

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.190
(Checked the screen 10 times in 5 mins)

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.460
(Admiration Rate: 70%)

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.960
- Had fun?
- It was okay.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.560
Don't forget why you're back to Mancheng.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.440
It's not for love,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.600
but for work.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.440
And don't you forget,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.760
livestreaming is your job,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.660
not a company-funded date.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.840
Boss.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.560
Did you find something?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.560
Numbers don't lie.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.760
I'll say this once.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.080
What's wrong?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.600
I thought you ditched me.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.600
Why would I?

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.640
My phone's dead.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.560
Grab a charger.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.800
It's not time yet.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.720
You can't leave.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.340
You're not letting me go.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.040
Then I'm staying.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.320
Crazy that we looped all the way back here.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.120
The weather today…

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.560
We probably won't see the sunrise.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.240
If you don't believe me,

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.640
let's make a bet.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.240
What's the bet?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.920
If...

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.000
the sun does rise,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
you give me a kiss.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.760
And if it doesn't?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.080
Then I'll kiss you instead.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.960
You're so silly.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.680
Do you remember

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.840
that time we went to see the sunrise?
