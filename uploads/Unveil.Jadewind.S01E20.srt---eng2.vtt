{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:36.505
You don't know
I once learned from a master.

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.105
She's way better than you are
at this food-clash trick.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:45.745
First you meant to harm me,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:48.545
then you used banned drugs
and killed the birth mother.

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:50.305
What are you after?

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.505
Just delivering babies

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:56.265
and doing good to earn merit.

00:01:56.905 --> 00:01:57.945
If you won't say,

00:01:58.025 --> 00:01:59.225
I'll have to ask

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:01.345
my well-read friend here.

00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:02.265
Wuren.

00:02:02.345 --> 00:02:04.705
In Dvaravati, there's a dark art.

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:07.505
They turn babies into gu kids,
feeding them with tainted blood.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.545
Then they do evil for their master.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:12.265
Using dark arts to take lives,

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:13.665
how does the law sentence it?

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:17.185
No pardon. Death. Executed on the spot.

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:19.745
Are you raising a gu for Xu Daoyin?

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:23.865
I've never even heard
of such a heartless dark art.

00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:24.945
How would I dare do that?

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.185
Where did you take that baby?

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:30.625
It lost its mother right after its birth.

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:33.305
So we sent it to Vitality Hall
to be cared for by a wet nurse.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.945
Mr. Xu is generous, kind at heart,

00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:39.025
and he's never meant harm.

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:40.905
Your Ladyship,

00:02:40.985 --> 00:02:43.105
please don't misunderstand us.

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:46.305
So you're saying we got it wrong?

00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:49.385
You're full of it!

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.545
What makes you say that?

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.665
This woman colluded with Xu Daoyin,

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.785
using this manor as a cover,
to rob and kill!

00:02:58.865 --> 00:02:59.865
That's nonsense!

00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:03.785
Your Ladyship, could he be
the killer in this manor?

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:06.225
That's right.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.465
Now it's your turn!

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:13.505
Lady Yue.

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:24.065
After such a huge mess here,
you can still deliver on time.

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:26.345
Wu family's money wasn't wasted!

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:28.385
Madam, you haven't left yet?

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:30.385
You think sending her away

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.945
would keep your filthy deal with Xu

00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:34.345
from being exposed?

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:43.665
This so-called business of Mr. Xu

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:47.265
is timing a baby's birth to a set hour,

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:50.105
to fix a patron's missing element,

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:52.385
and bring luck, not bad omens.

00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:57.945
You should've left earlier!

00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:14.585
- Don't let Lady Yue get away!
- Got it!

00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:26.025
Help out already!

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:00.705
Nice moves!

00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:05.705
Investigating Commissioner Su Kuangyuan.
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:12.585
Thank you for your help.

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:17.065
Shouldn't you be thanking me
for thinking ahead

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:18.465
and calling reinforcements in time?

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:19.665
Just as expected.

00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.305
Your Ladyship,

00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:26.025
Lady Yue likely took
the secret passage and got away.

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:28.585
Where's the exit?

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.465
Tunnels run all through the manor,

00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:32.705
with many exits leading everywhere.

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:34.225
I don't know.

00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:37.025
There should be blueprints.

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:39.505
Xiao…

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:41.785
Xiao's been with Mr. Xu over three years.

00:05:41.865 --> 00:05:43.945
He's the one Mr. Xu trusts most.

00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:47.145
After Xiao came,
they started building the tunnels.

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:48.305
Where is he?

00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:50.625
Since Mr. Xu vanished,

00:05:50.705 --> 00:05:52.665
Xiao's been praying at the living shrine.

00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:15.785
{\an8}WITHIN MISFORTUNE, FORTUNE RESTS
WITHIN FORTUNE, MISFORTUNE WAITS

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:21.825
To keep the manor's fortune flowing,

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:24.425
Mr. Xu built several secret tunnels.

00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:27.345
The tunnels all connect,

00:06:27.425 --> 00:06:28.505
with many entrances.

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:31.385
But the exits are not complicated,

00:06:31.465 --> 00:06:32.945
just well hidden.

00:06:34.065 --> 00:06:37.025
They're at the spots I marked.

00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:41.425
Most exits seal perfectly tight.
Can they be opened from outside?

00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:45.065
Of course they can.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:46.865
Metal begets water.

00:06:46.945 --> 00:06:49.745
This exit is near the stream,
so there must be white marble nearby.

00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:50.745
That's where the mechanism is.

00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:52.465
Same for the other exits.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:53.665
Just follow
the five elements' generating cycle

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:55.145
and you'll find them.

00:06:56.585 --> 00:06:58.585
Just as you said, sir.

00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:00.305
Once you find the mechanism,

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:01.705
turn it right three times,

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:03.665
and the exit will open.

00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:06.465
Split up and search.
Signal if you find anything.

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:10.985
Chasing killers isn't your strength.
Where are you going?

00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:14.985
That mechanism is interesting.
I'm going to take a look.

00:07:21.265 --> 00:07:25.105
If there's nothing else I can help with,

00:07:25.185 --> 00:07:26.785
I'll take my leave.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:34.585
Let's go check on Madam Wu.

00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:48.225
This baby isn't full-term yet

00:07:49.145 --> 00:07:51.145
and doesn't even have the strength to cry.

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:55.465
- You may leave.
- Yes, Madam.

00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:01.065
Your Ladyship, please sit.

00:08:10.225 --> 00:08:11.625
The night my uncle was killed,

00:08:12.345 --> 00:08:14.465
- were you really drugged unconscious?
- Don't slander Madam!

00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:22.785
You can tell I hated him to the bone.

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:29.825
The year something happened
to your family,

00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:32.705
my husband suddenly
claimed illness and quit office.

00:08:33.505 --> 00:08:35.664
I knew it wasn't what he wanted,

00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:37.264
but I didn't press.

00:08:37.345 --> 00:08:39.585
I went with him back to Ping'en County.

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:41.264
CHUNMING GATE

00:08:42.345 --> 00:08:44.385
That house in Ping'en County

00:08:44.465 --> 00:08:46.505
was my family's ancestral property.

00:08:47.265 --> 00:08:49.825
We settled down there, living quietly.

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:53.705
And I had a knack for business.

00:08:53.785 --> 00:08:56.905
Before long, I built up an enterprise.

00:08:57.425 --> 00:08:59.585
Life there was even more comfortable

00:08:59.665 --> 00:09:01.305
than in the Western Capital.

00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:06.545
After a year, I became pregnant

00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:09.545
and handed the business to him.

00:09:10.585 --> 00:09:13.305
Back then, nothing went smoothly.

00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:16.745
All our hard work was about to be wasted.

00:09:16.825 --> 00:09:18.665
My husband tried everything

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:21.225
to save the business, but nothing changed.

00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:23.945
That's when he began worshiping Mr. Xu?

00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:26.425
He worried about the business,

00:09:26.505 --> 00:09:28.305
gloomy all day.

00:09:29.505 --> 00:09:30.905
Until one day,

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:33.505
the house suddenly filled
with gongs and drums.

00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:35.305
Later I learned

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:38.505
he had brought home a statue.

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:51.665
Master,

00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:56.025
what is this?

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:00.985
My lady, what are you doing here?

00:10:01.985 --> 00:10:03.225
You're with child.

00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:04.905
Don't offend the Immortal

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:06.145
with any trace of blood.

00:10:06.225 --> 00:10:07.825
- Master…
- My lady…

00:10:09.305 --> 00:10:10.265
- Madam.
- My lady.

00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:12.145
- Master!
- Step aside for now.

00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:16.705
He was devout to Mr. Xu,

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.945
burning incense and chanting daily.

00:10:20.785 --> 00:10:22.545
Even his clothes, food, and routines

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:24.785
followed Mr. Xu's instructions
to the letter.

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:27.825
But with me,

00:10:27.905 --> 00:10:32.225
he was kinder than before,
looking after me in every way.

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.745
And he was eagerly awaiting
the baby's birth.

00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:37.505
My lady.

00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:39.145
Stay back!

00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:42.785
Careful, I'm covered in blood.
I might offend you!

00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:43.705
My lady.

00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:47.065
I panicked just now
and spoke without thinking.

00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:48.945
I made you angry.

00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:51.345
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

00:10:52.305 --> 00:10:53.225
My lady.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:56.545
Mr. Xu is truly powerful.

00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:59.145
He can bless our unborn child

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.545
to be safe and easy to raise.

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:02.265
He can also bless our business

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:04.065
to reach the next level.

00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:07.465
Master,

00:11:07.545 --> 00:11:09.985
business is made by people.

00:11:10.065 --> 00:11:12.145
If worship and incense

00:11:12.225 --> 00:11:13.705
could make wishes come true,

00:11:13.785 --> 00:11:16.025
then everyone would just do it.

00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:19.585
You always scoffed at spirits and omens.

00:11:19.665 --> 00:11:22.505
How could you believe
such lowbrow nonsense?

00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:24.465
My lady.

00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:27.585
Better safe than sorry.

00:11:27.665 --> 00:11:30.305
My lady, just focus on the pregnancy.

00:11:30.385 --> 00:11:32.985
Pretend our home
doesn't have that scripture hall.

00:11:39.425 --> 00:11:41.025
That was because of Xu Daoyin?

00:11:43.305 --> 00:11:47.305
To support Mr. Xu, he spent a fortune.

00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:48.785
I didn't care about that.

00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:52.305
What moved me
was how much he cared for me.

00:11:53.225 --> 00:11:56.225
But since he believed a pregnant woman

00:11:56.745 --> 00:11:59.425
could offend the deities with blood,

00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:02.705
how could he suddenly change

00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.545
and be so attentive to me?

00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:08.865
Back then,

00:12:08.945 --> 00:12:11.025
I never noticed that part.

00:12:11.985 --> 00:12:13.025
Then that child…

00:12:18.465 --> 00:12:19.425
By that logic,

00:12:19.945 --> 00:12:21.225
he brought Wu Mujin home

00:12:21.745 --> 00:12:23.585
soon after you miscarried.

00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:28.705
He admitted Wu Mujin was a bastard,

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.305
afraid I'd mind.

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:33.345
At the time,

00:12:33.865 --> 00:12:37.905
I felt ashamed that I couldn't
carry on the Wu line.

00:12:37.985 --> 00:12:39.225
So I accepted the child.

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.345
Who's the mother?

00:12:42.265 --> 00:12:43.265
I never asked.

00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:45.225
He never said either.

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:46.985
He raised the child

00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:49.265
alone in a side courtyard

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:52.945
and even set up
some strange formation there.

00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:56.865
The child looked frail and pitiful,

00:12:56.945 --> 00:12:58.625
but he told me not to worry.

00:12:59.505 --> 00:13:01.825
Still, it felt wrong.

00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:04.865
So I had Wu Lie look into it in secret.

00:13:12.865 --> 00:13:15.225
I found out that child
wasn't just a bastard.

00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:17.865
Master was after his own smooth fortune,

00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:19.985
so he had Xu Daoyin find poor women

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:22.705
to bear him children with lucky fates.

00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:25.625
In Vitality Hall at the manor,
there were many pregnant women.

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:29.225
Under the guise of cultivation,

00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:31.825
Xu Daoyin was secretly doing dirty deals

00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:34.785
for rich merchants and landlords.

00:13:34.865 --> 00:13:37.305
To make the babies
be born at the chosen time,

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:39.065
they forced medicine down the mothers!

00:13:39.145 --> 00:13:41.425
Most of the mothers were already weak

00:13:41.505 --> 00:13:43.945
and couldn't withstand such strong drugs!

00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:46.225
But to get the babies,

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:47.825
they cared nothing for the mothers!

00:13:48.625 --> 00:13:50.625
Wu Siping's crimes go even further!

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.905
He even laid hands on his own wife.

00:13:55.545 --> 00:13:57.665
So Madam, you had
a premature delivery too?

00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:03.705
Not until Wu Lie

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:07.745
brought back from the manor
the dregs of Tuohua Decoction

00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:09.825
did I realize

00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:13.305
what he made me drink before

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.865
wasn't a pregnancy tonic at all.

00:14:16.745 --> 00:14:19.665
He wouldn't even spare
his own wife and child.

00:14:20.465 --> 00:14:22.665
Madam, why didn't you expose him?

00:14:23.825 --> 00:14:24.865
I tried.

00:14:25.545 --> 00:14:26.745
But he said

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:29.105
it was all for the family's business,

00:14:29.185 --> 00:14:32.145
so I could live in luxury.

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:34.505
He wept and begged my forgiveness.

00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:37.225
I wanted to leave him,

00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:39.585
but old feelings remained.

00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:40.745
Besides,

00:14:41.265 --> 00:14:42.625
if I left,

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:45.665
that child wouldn't live much longer.

00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:49.065
So you secretly switched
the medicine Mr. Xu gave Wu Mujin

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.825
and had Wu Lie disrupt
the layout of the side courtyard,

00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:53.985
all to protect him.

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:02.905
I know.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:05.505
My husband has gone mad.

00:15:06.345 --> 00:15:09.265
Even if Mujin's health improved a little,

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:12.785
he'd suspect his fortune
would weaken because of it.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:15.945
If business hit a snag,

00:15:16.025 --> 00:15:18.025
he'd take it out on Wu Mujin.

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:21.385
I didn't dare let
Wu Mujin get too healthy,

00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:23.065
but I feared he'd die.

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:27.985
Then how did you learn

00:15:28.065 --> 00:15:29.505
about that baby just now?

00:15:32.145 --> 00:15:33.945
I saw he wasn't as harsh

00:15:34.025 --> 00:15:35.545
to Wu Mujin as before,

00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:38.945
and he had people
renovating another house.

00:15:39.945 --> 00:15:41.145
He wouldn't say it,

00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:44.185
but I knew he wouldn't
do that for no reason.

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:47.745
Mujin's birth mother is already missing.

00:15:48.545 --> 00:15:51.825
Now I'm afraid another woman
is about to suffer.

00:15:53.225 --> 00:15:56.145
All because of his greed and selfishness.

00:15:58.185 --> 00:15:59.985
All these years,

00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:04.825
I've wished the evil he did
would come back on him.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.985
I wanted him dead.

00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:12.265
But I couldn't do it.

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:16.385
I'm not that smart and not that brave.

00:16:17.385 --> 00:16:19.065
All I could do

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:22.385
was find a way to take that woman away

00:16:22.465 --> 00:16:23.585
before she gave birth.

00:16:24.745 --> 00:16:26.185
But your husband

00:16:26.265 --> 00:16:27.985
wouldn't let you know Liu's due date.

00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:30.785
The new house is finished.

00:16:31.505 --> 00:16:34.145
He planned to come
to Qingtan Town these days.

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:35.945
That's when I knew

00:16:37.545 --> 00:16:38.705
the time was near.

00:16:39.585 --> 00:16:42.385
Madam feared they'd use
Tuohua Decoction to induce labor,

00:16:42.465 --> 00:16:43.705
so she told me to come early.

00:16:44.665 --> 00:16:46.425
Who knew Master would meet with disaster?

00:16:47.025 --> 00:16:50.025
And I lost some time trying to confirm

00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:51.545
who the mother was

00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:53.345
and couldn't stop Lady Yue.

00:16:54.065 --> 00:16:55.745
But Wu Siping…

00:16:57.825 --> 00:17:01.385
really should taste
Tuohua Decoction himself.

00:17:29.025 --> 00:17:29.985
It's dusty here.

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:32.425
Lady Yue likely
didn't leave from this way.

00:17:47.305 --> 00:17:48.865
Mr. Su found nothing either.

00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:50.305
Let's check elsewhere.

00:17:52.065 --> 00:17:53.105
Wait.

00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:06.905
Mr. Xiao.

00:18:37.665 --> 00:18:38.825
What's this?

00:18:39.545 --> 00:18:40.385
A signal marker.

00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:43.465
If I'm not wrong,

00:18:43.545 --> 00:18:46.465
every junction in these tunnels
has one of these markers.

00:18:46.545 --> 00:18:48.705
Beak pointing down means it's blocked.

00:18:48.785 --> 00:18:50.825
Beak pointing forward means it's safe.

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:53.145
Someone was signaling Lady Yue.

00:18:53.225 --> 00:18:55.065
Warn Su Kuangyuan
to check the other exits.

00:18:55.665 --> 00:18:56.905
Alright.

00:18:59.185 --> 00:19:00.385
- Follow me.
- Understood.

00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:17.985
Madam Wu hates her husband,

00:19:18.065 --> 00:19:19.265
but she's too soft-hearted.

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:22.145
She's not the killer.

00:19:23.945 --> 00:19:26.105
My uncle's death
was almost the same as Liu's,

00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:28.545
upper body hanged from a beam above,

00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:30.305
lower body soaked in fresh blood.

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:34.225
The killer must've seen
how the mother died

00:19:34.305 --> 00:19:35.785
and used this to take revenge.

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.705
That means

00:19:38.305 --> 00:19:40.065
the killer is likely
connected to Wu Mujin.

00:19:41.065 --> 00:19:42.945
We need to find out fast
where Wu Mujin's birth mother is.

00:19:45.065 --> 00:19:45.985
I'll go see the midwife.

00:19:54.745 --> 00:19:56.025
Mr. Xu said

00:19:56.825 --> 00:19:59.905
as long as we help these women give birth,

00:19:59.985 --> 00:20:02.665
we'll build up merit and ascend sooner.

00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:05.105
We were forbidden to ask

00:20:05.185 --> 00:20:06.905
about the mothers' identities.

00:20:06.985 --> 00:20:09.985
I truly didn't mean to hide anything.

00:20:10.865 --> 00:20:13.825
If you want to ascend,
why go through all that trouble?

00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:17.665
I'll help you.

00:20:19.465 --> 00:20:20.665
This decoction…

00:20:21.745 --> 00:20:23.105
You've brewed it so many times,

00:20:23.905 --> 00:20:25.065
but you've never tasted
it yourself, have you?

00:20:25.825 --> 00:20:28.505
That's not for us to drink.

00:20:30.345 --> 00:20:31.425
Oh, I almost forgot it.

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.305
Before drinking it…

00:20:37.305 --> 00:20:38.145
My lady!

00:20:38.225 --> 00:20:39.665
…you have to bleed a little first, right?

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:41.465
Spare me, my lady!

00:20:41.545 --> 00:20:42.625
Please!

00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:44.265
I don't know anything…

00:20:44.825 --> 00:20:46.265
I don't know anything!

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:47.785
Let's see…

00:20:48.385 --> 00:20:51.265
Where should I start to do it best?

00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:53.265
My lady, spare me!

00:20:53.345 --> 00:20:54.265
Spare me!

00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:57.145
I… I'll talk!

00:20:57.225 --> 00:20:58.345
I'll talk…

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.545
Stand up and speak.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.865
Thank you, officer lady!
Thank you, officer lady!

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:03.545
Thank you, my lady…

00:21:04.945 --> 00:21:06.185
Get up.

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:08.665
I'll tell you…

00:21:10.385 --> 00:21:11.545
I…

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:12.985
truly don't know

00:21:13.065 --> 00:21:16.105
who was the mother
bearing the child for Master Wu.

00:21:17.265 --> 00:21:20.665
But these poor women in Vitality Hall

00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:22.145
weren't pregnant by accident.

00:21:22.225 --> 00:21:25.545
They were here to bear children
for those patrons with money.

00:21:25.625 --> 00:21:28.425
As long as they give birth on time,

00:21:28.505 --> 00:21:30.225
the deal is settled.

00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:33.265
After that, they have nothing to do
with those patrons ever again.

00:21:33.345 --> 00:21:36.705
If they want kids,
why not have their own wives bear them?

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:42.425
To make the child

00:21:42.505 --> 00:21:44.585
be born at an auspicious hour,

00:21:44.665 --> 00:21:47.025
nearly every mother-to-be

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:49.905
had to take
this Tuohua Decoction to induce labor.

00:21:50.705 --> 00:21:53.745
But it's terribly harmful.

00:21:53.825 --> 00:21:55.545
Those rich households

00:21:55.625 --> 00:21:58.385
can't bear to make their own women
suffer like this.

00:21:58.465 --> 00:22:01.425
Some also fear

00:22:01.505 --> 00:22:05.625
the wife's powerful family,
so they won't risk it.

00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:07.785
So these women

00:22:07.865 --> 00:22:10.025
should suffer this and take the risk?

00:22:14.305 --> 00:22:15.145
We've checked.

00:22:15.225 --> 00:22:16.705
All the exits show the same signal,

00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:19.185
nor is there any trace of Lady Yue.

00:22:19.265 --> 00:22:20.105
Maybe

00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:22.105
- she was never in the tunnels?
- No.

00:22:29.945 --> 00:22:30.785
They follow the Celestial Market pattern.

00:22:31.665 --> 00:22:32.785
Okay, Mr. Xiao.

00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.545
The northeast
is governed by the Butcher's Star.

00:22:45.625 --> 00:22:46.985
It rules over slaughter.

00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:51.065
Those signal markers
were meant to lure her into a death trap.

00:22:51.145 --> 00:22:52.225
But there's no exit

00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:53.705
in the northeast.

00:22:57.585 --> 00:22:58.425
Follow me.

00:23:03.025 --> 00:23:03.945
Keep up.

00:23:06.265 --> 00:23:07.385
At daybreak,

00:23:07.465 --> 00:23:09.185
you can leave the manor.

00:23:10.625 --> 00:23:12.665
Leave… the manor? Where would we go?

00:23:14.505 --> 00:23:16.345
Home, of course.

00:23:16.425 --> 00:23:19.265
Xu Daoyin is missing,
and Lady Yue got away.

00:23:19.345 --> 00:23:21.465
You won't have to bear children
for them anymore.

00:23:21.545 --> 00:23:23.585
We can go home… We can go home now…

00:23:23.665 --> 00:23:25.665
But the baby's already inside me.

00:23:25.745 --> 00:23:27.105
How can I just not give birth?

00:23:29.065 --> 00:23:31.305
Go home and rest.

00:23:31.385 --> 00:23:34.265
When you're full-term,
give birth in peace and safety.

00:23:34.345 --> 00:23:36.465
You can't end up like Liu tonight,

00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:38.345
dying in childbirth.

00:23:39.105 --> 00:23:40.305
How do we raise them?

00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:42.785
Lady Yue's gone.

00:23:43.305 --> 00:23:45.705
Where do I get my money?

00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:47.425
What about our pay?

00:23:48.025 --> 00:23:49.145
What about the baby?

00:23:51.065 --> 00:23:53.345
Miss, what are you doing?

00:23:55.265 --> 00:23:57.225
I already have three kids.

00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:59.945
I was counting on this one

00:24:00.025 --> 00:24:01.265
to earn money and get by.

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:02.985
Now…

00:24:03.705 --> 00:24:05.465
you're sending me back like this?

00:24:06.065 --> 00:24:06.945
My husband

00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:08.625
will beat me to death.

00:24:09.945 --> 00:24:11.785
He'll kill me!

00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:13.625
I can't live!

00:24:14.345 --> 00:24:16.185
I can't live!

00:24:23.385 --> 00:24:25.305
A friend from my village knew

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:27.865
how poor we are.

00:24:28.745 --> 00:24:30.145
She told me this manor

00:24:30.665 --> 00:24:32.425
had work that paid well,

00:24:32.505 --> 00:24:34.345
so I came with her.

00:24:36.545 --> 00:24:38.425
But only after I got here

00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:41.985
did I learn it was birthing for the rich.

00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:46.585
At first I refused.

00:24:48.105 --> 00:24:49.025
But Lady Yue said

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:51.825
if we delivered the baby,

00:24:51.905 --> 00:24:53.145
we'd get ten strings of coins.

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:54.825
That's what she told us too.

00:24:54.905 --> 00:24:56.425
Yeah, she told us the same.

00:24:56.505 --> 00:24:59.185
Once you're pregnant,
you get three strings.

00:24:59.265 --> 00:25:01.665
After birth, you get seven more.

00:25:01.745 --> 00:25:03.865
Better than starving outside.

00:25:03.945 --> 00:25:05.225
Liu San and Lady Yue

00:25:05.305 --> 00:25:06.545
told my husband

00:25:06.625 --> 00:25:08.345
an immortal gave Mr. Xu a dream,

00:25:09.505 --> 00:25:11.185
and I was chosen to serve at the manor.

00:25:13.105 --> 00:25:14.145
After a year,

00:25:14.785 --> 00:25:15.785
I'd be sent home.

00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:17.865
Your family even believed

00:25:18.385 --> 00:25:19.625
that kind of talk?

00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:22.385
With three strings of coins up front…

00:25:24.585 --> 00:25:26.145
of course they'd believe.

00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:30.465
Tuohua Decoction is extremely risky.
Weren't you afraid of dying in childbirth?

00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:34.345
Fine then.

00:25:37.425 --> 00:25:40.505
Understood. Rest here for now.

00:25:41.025 --> 00:25:42.705
I'll handle what comes next.

00:25:44.625 --> 00:25:45.625
Take care of them.

00:25:46.265 --> 00:25:47.105
Understood.

00:26:10.745 --> 00:26:11.785
Don't run around.

00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:34.105
Lady Yue knew about the tunnels.

00:26:34.865 --> 00:26:36.265
She knew them well.

00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:42.625
But the killer knew better
all the hidden tricks inside.

00:26:42.705 --> 00:26:44.865
All he had to do was flip
the signal markers,

00:26:44.945 --> 00:26:46.305
wait at the exit,

00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:47.385
and effortlessly

00:26:47.465 --> 00:26:49.425
lead Lady Yue into his killing trap.

00:26:49.505 --> 00:26:51.505
The bell tower isn't far from the exit.

00:26:51.585 --> 00:26:53.905
Looks like when he killed her,
he'd already planned

00:26:53.985 --> 00:26:55.185
to leave her here.

00:26:55.265 --> 00:26:56.825
The bell ringer would find her
at the Hour of Yin.

00:27:02.865 --> 00:27:04.225
Strangled.

00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:06.825
The scene wasn't nearly
as bloody as before.

00:27:06.905 --> 00:27:09.025
The killer went easy on Lady Yue?

00:27:10.105 --> 00:27:11.865
Maybe he was pressed for time.

00:27:17.745 --> 00:27:20.265
She must've torn it off from the killer
during the struggle.

00:27:20.985 --> 00:27:22.185
The killer is injured.

00:27:23.545 --> 00:27:24.945
This gauze smells of incense.

00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:28.745
We just can't tell
if it's from Lady Yue or the killer.

00:27:28.825 --> 00:27:30.505
Wu Siping, the patron,

00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:32.425
Liu San, the conman,

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:34.585
and Lady Yue, forcing labor, are all dead.

00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:37.065
No reason to spare Xu Daoyin.

00:27:39.465 --> 00:27:41.905
Could Xu Daoyin
already be silenced and buried?

00:27:41.985 --> 00:27:45.025
The killer drew attention
with those three deaths

00:27:45.105 --> 00:27:47.585
to expose all their wicked deeds.

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:48.825
Why would he let Xu Daoyin live?

00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:57.465
Xu Daoyin was superstitious.

00:27:57.545 --> 00:27:59.745
The "money-direction" window
would never be opened.

00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:09.825
LIVING SHRINE

00:28:34.065 --> 00:28:35.105
Who's in there?

00:28:37.745 --> 00:28:39.025
- Break the door?
- Wait.

00:28:45.425 --> 00:28:46.265
It's a magnet!

00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:16.025
Mr. Gu.

00:29:36.385 --> 00:29:37.745
His belly is packed with gold cakes.

00:29:38.345 --> 00:29:39.905
They must be offerings from patrons.

00:29:39.985 --> 00:29:40.945
And his teeth

00:29:41.025 --> 00:29:42.345
show signs of breaking.

00:29:43.705 --> 00:29:46.865
The killer forced the gold cakes
into Xu Daoyin's mouth.

00:29:46.945 --> 00:29:48.465
He clenched his teeth and fought,

00:29:49.585 --> 00:29:50.945
and his teeth got snapped.

00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:54.465
The killer's hand was likely bitten.

00:29:55.145 --> 00:29:56.465
The lock is controlled by magnets.

00:29:56.545 --> 00:29:58.505
When the magnetic ball
drops into the slot, the door opens,

00:29:59.305 --> 00:30:01.105
but it also triggers a mechanism above,

00:30:01.185 --> 00:30:02.825
cutting the string holding a dagger.

00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:05.945
With his belly stuffed with gold cakes,
he was weighed down in pain.

00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:07.305
All he wanted was a quick death.

00:30:07.385 --> 00:30:08.945
If someone cracked the lock,

00:30:09.465 --> 00:30:10.825
the moment the door opened,

00:30:10.905 --> 00:30:12.265
he could grab the dagger

00:30:12.345 --> 00:30:13.665
and cut himself open.

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:16.945
But if no one found him here,
he'd only die in swollen pain.

00:30:17.025 --> 00:30:19.465
He deliberately hid
the northeast exit on the map.

00:30:19.545 --> 00:30:20.625
I should've known it was him.

00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:24.025
So, the incense smell you caught
on the gauze in Lady Yue's hand

00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:24.985
came from Xiao?

00:30:25.065 --> 00:30:26.705
He killed those four.

00:30:27.305 --> 00:30:29.025
So it really is tied to Wu Mujin.

00:30:31.025 --> 00:30:33.025
I couldn't bear children.

00:30:33.105 --> 00:30:35.585
My husband brought him home from outside.

00:30:37.945 --> 00:30:40.265
My daughter made it for me.

00:30:40.345 --> 00:30:41.265
Find Xiao now!

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:47.745
Did you see someone leave?

00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:49.945
A man, 40 or 50,

00:30:50.025 --> 00:30:51.065
dark-skinned,

00:30:51.145 --> 00:30:52.945
- with a black birthmark on his temple?
- Yes.

00:30:53.865 --> 00:30:55.425
He left two kes ago.

00:30:56.425 --> 00:30:58.345
I told you to lock down the manor!
Why did you let him pass?

00:30:58.425 --> 00:31:00.425
He… He was riding your horse.

00:31:00.505 --> 00:31:03.345
He said it was on your orders
to go for help.

00:31:05.025 --> 00:31:05.865
Mr. Xiao,

00:31:05.945 --> 00:31:08.145
my fast horse runs
hundreds of miles a day.

00:31:08.225 --> 00:31:10.785
In two kes,
he'd be long past Qingtan Town,

00:31:10.865 --> 00:31:11.825
beyond chasing.

00:31:11.905 --> 00:31:13.065
Don't worry.

00:31:13.145 --> 00:31:14.425
I'll get your fast horse back.

00:31:26.025 --> 00:31:28.585
Xiao took the shortcut on horseback.
Can we really catch him

00:31:29.105 --> 00:31:29.945
taking the waterway?

00:31:31.385 --> 00:31:32.985
The west wind is strong now.

00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:35.585
We're going with the current
and riding the wind as well.

00:31:36.185 --> 00:31:38.785
No matter how fast your horse is,
it can't outrun us.

00:31:44.545 --> 00:31:46.625
Xiao's left thumb web and back of hand

00:31:46.705 --> 00:31:48.265
have old scars,

00:31:48.345 --> 00:31:50.225
and his right middle finger
has a long scar too.

00:31:50.305 --> 00:31:52.585
They're marks left
from years of planing and sawing.

00:31:52.665 --> 00:31:54.185
He used to be a carpenter.

00:31:54.985 --> 00:31:57.425
And Xu Daoyin's fingers
are soft and delicate.

00:31:57.505 --> 00:31:59.185
No way he could build mechanisms.

00:31:59.865 --> 00:32:01.945
Xiao came to the manor three years ago.

00:32:02.025 --> 00:32:02.985
Before that,

00:32:03.065 --> 00:32:05.225
Xu Daoyin would sometimes
put on little "miracles,"

00:32:05.305 --> 00:32:07.425
but he never performed
the beheading trick.

00:32:08.025 --> 00:32:11.185
After Xiao arrived,
Xu Daoyin's "powers" improved overnight,

00:32:11.265 --> 00:32:12.545
and he trusted him for no reason.

00:32:12.625 --> 00:32:15.345
Tianruo even saw Xiao
repairing the altar mechanisms.

00:32:16.185 --> 00:32:17.865
Did you learn anything about Xiao's past?

00:32:18.665 --> 00:32:20.225
He rarely spoke of it.

00:32:20.745 --> 00:32:22.385
All we know is,
he has a daughter who's already married.

00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:27.625
Li Peiyi didn't go back
to the Western Capital.

00:32:27.705 --> 00:32:29.185
She detoured to Ping'en County.

00:32:29.265 --> 00:32:30.745
To see who?

00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:32.625
Wu Siping.

00:32:33.145 --> 00:32:35.145
He was Crown Prince's Left Guard Commander
15 years ago.

00:32:36.465 --> 00:32:37.745
One of the Crown Prince's men?

00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:39.825
What does he know?

00:32:39.905 --> 00:32:41.145
Not sure yet.

00:32:43.065 --> 00:32:44.665
Then eliminate them all.

00:32:45.665 --> 00:32:46.665
And Li Peiyi…

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:48.625
Since…

00:32:49.585 --> 00:32:51.945
she won't return to the Western Capital,

00:32:53.025 --> 00:32:54.585
then she doesn't have to.

00:33:20.705 --> 00:33:21.785
Good child.

00:33:23.265 --> 00:33:24.745
Grandpa's here to take you home.

00:33:48.425 --> 00:33:49.385
Back off!

00:33:49.465 --> 00:33:50.945
Or I'll take you all with me!

00:33:52.345 --> 00:33:53.185
Grandpa!

00:34:01.025 --> 00:34:03.265
Grandpa! Grandpa, don't die!

00:34:25.304 --> 00:34:26.185
Take him away!

00:34:34.465 --> 00:34:35.304
Grandpa…

00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:47.145
I killed them.

00:34:48.905 --> 00:34:50.145
All four of them,

00:34:50.665 --> 00:34:52.025
each deserved to die.

00:34:52.905 --> 00:34:54.705
Your daughter is Wu Mujin's birth mother?

00:34:54.784 --> 00:34:55.824
Yes.

00:34:55.905 --> 00:34:56.905
And she…

00:34:57.625 --> 00:34:59.105
They killed her.

00:35:01.425 --> 00:35:02.945
My daughter, Xiao Wan,

00:35:03.025 --> 00:35:06.225
married into the Suns in Qingtan County
seven years ago.

00:35:06.985 --> 00:35:08.905
I built secret mechanisms and tunnels

00:35:08.985 --> 00:35:10.425
for manors and estates.

00:35:10.505 --> 00:35:12.465
The jobs I took,

00:35:12.545 --> 00:35:14.225
some lasted months,

00:35:15.185 --> 00:35:16.705
some years.

00:35:17.785 --> 00:35:19.425
So I rarely saw her.

00:35:20.025 --> 00:35:22.625
When I went to Qingtan to see her
three years ago,

00:35:22.705 --> 00:35:25.505
- it had been so long since we last met.
- Hey, in-law!

00:35:27.505 --> 00:35:29.825
In-law, why… why are you here?

00:35:30.425 --> 00:35:31.625
I finished early.

00:35:31.705 --> 00:35:33.105
So I came to see you.

00:35:34.145 --> 00:35:35.305
Just a small gift.

00:35:36.305 --> 00:35:37.905
- Please accept it.
- You're too kind.

00:35:40.385 --> 00:35:41.225
Where's Wan?

00:35:42.945 --> 00:35:43.985
I…

00:35:45.585 --> 00:35:47.625
She… She's… in the back courtyard.

00:35:48.865 --> 00:35:49.705
Wan?

00:35:50.665 --> 00:35:51.625
Wan?

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.745
Wan? Wan?

00:35:55.825 --> 00:35:57.345
XIAO WAN, XIAO'S DAUGHTER

00:36:05.745 --> 00:36:06.745
In-law! In-law!

00:36:06.825 --> 00:36:09.305
We had no choice! We…

00:36:14.425 --> 00:36:15.345
Wan!

00:36:17.505 --> 00:36:18.785
Oh my…

00:36:22.585 --> 00:36:24.265
What have you done to her?

00:36:24.345 --> 00:36:25.625
Let her go!

00:36:26.585 --> 00:36:28.745
Father-in-law… Father-in-law…

00:36:28.825 --> 00:36:29.905
You…

00:36:30.985 --> 00:36:32.505
In-law, let me explain!

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:33.785
In-law, I… She…

00:36:34.945 --> 00:36:36.385
In-law!

00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:37.825
Xiao Wan's gone mad!

00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:39.265
Xiao Wan's gone mad!

00:36:47.265 --> 00:36:48.345
Wan?

00:36:49.065 --> 00:36:50.265
Wan?

00:36:57.665 --> 00:36:58.905
It's me!

00:37:06.745 --> 00:37:10.305
They said Wan was weak

00:37:10.945 --> 00:37:13.345
and miscarried again and again.

00:37:14.145 --> 00:37:15.345
Little by little,

00:37:16.585 --> 00:37:18.705
she started losing her mind.

00:37:19.425 --> 00:37:20.785
She kept saying

00:37:20.865 --> 00:37:22.865
she had a child.

00:37:22.945 --> 00:37:25.105
At first, they didn't mind.

00:37:25.185 --> 00:37:27.025
Until one day,

00:37:27.665 --> 00:37:29.465
Wan ran away from home

00:37:29.545 --> 00:37:30.785
and slipped into a rich family's house

00:37:30.865 --> 00:37:34.425
in the neighboring county
and tried to take their baby.

00:37:36.305 --> 00:37:37.385
In the end,

00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:40.145
they reported her to the authorities.

00:37:41.825 --> 00:37:42.825
We…

00:37:43.545 --> 00:37:46.785
We begged and pleaded
and finally talked her into coming back.

00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:49.985
But… after a few days, she ran off again.

00:37:50.745 --> 00:37:52.665
This time… she got beaten.

00:37:53.185 --> 00:37:55.705
We'd bring her back,
and she'd flee once more.

00:37:56.305 --> 00:37:57.905
This happened over and over.

00:37:58.625 --> 00:37:59.745
And her mind

00:37:59.825 --> 00:38:01.385
got worse and worse.

00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:04.145
We saw physicians and gave her medicine,

00:38:04.225 --> 00:38:05.585
but nothing worked.

00:38:05.665 --> 00:38:08.265
So she wouldn't cause trouble
or get beaten again,

00:38:08.345 --> 00:38:10.825
we had to lock her up.

00:38:10.905 --> 00:38:14.025
Yes. We had no choice.

00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:18.745
I can't leave Wan

00:38:18.825 --> 00:38:20.705
with the Sun family anymore.

00:38:21.345 --> 00:38:23.185
I want to take her home.

00:38:26.505 --> 00:38:27.625
Come.

00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:30.505
Come. Take care.

00:38:34.985 --> 00:38:35.865
Sit tight.

00:38:42.025 --> 00:38:44.665
But when we passed Ping'en County,

00:38:45.185 --> 00:38:47.585
Wan jumped off the cart and ran.

00:38:56.265 --> 00:38:58.345
Wan? Wan?

00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:08.825
Wan! Wan! Wan!

00:39:08.905 --> 00:39:10.105
Come on. Stop it.

00:39:10.185 --> 00:39:11.265
- Let's go home.
- My child!

00:39:11.345 --> 00:39:13.745
- My child's inside…
- There's no child here!

00:39:13.825 --> 00:39:16.385
This is someone else's home!
Someone else's home!

00:39:16.985 --> 00:39:18.105
Let's go!

00:39:23.465 --> 00:39:24.505
Here…

00:39:39.065 --> 00:39:40.585
My child…

00:39:42.745 --> 00:39:44.305
I'm not crazy!

00:39:44.985 --> 00:39:46.025
Father…

00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:48.305
That child looks like Wan.

00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:49.985
- I'm not crazy…
- It's really alike.

00:39:51.025 --> 00:39:52.585
I had to believe

00:39:53.105 --> 00:39:55.345
Wan was telling the truth.

00:39:55.425 --> 00:39:57.545
But before I could ask…

00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:58.545
Hey…

00:40:01.025 --> 00:40:02.105
Get away!

00:40:02.185 --> 00:40:04.505
- This is my child!
- Wan…

00:40:05.345 --> 00:40:07.345
Hey! What are you doing?

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.305
Young master, are you alright?

00:40:10.385 --> 00:40:11.425
Don't be scared.

00:40:16.385 --> 00:40:18.345
- Don't be scared.
- What's wrong with the child?

00:40:24.305 --> 00:40:25.225
Mujin.

00:40:26.625 --> 00:40:27.985
Tell me.

00:40:29.225 --> 00:40:30.945
Do you know this woman?

00:40:32.545 --> 00:40:33.465
Speak!

00:40:41.065 --> 00:40:41.945
No…

00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:47.665
He's not my child!

00:40:49.385 --> 00:40:50.665
He's not my child…

00:40:56.305 --> 00:40:58.465
I… I have no child.

00:40:59.785 --> 00:41:00.665
Wan!

00:41:02.945 --> 00:41:04.065
Wan!

00:41:04.145 --> 00:41:05.545
Wan!

00:41:06.665 --> 00:41:07.705
Wan!

00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:21.945
Wan!

00:41:25.345 --> 00:41:26.705
Wan!

00:41:27.905 --> 00:41:29.345
I can't swim.

00:41:29.425 --> 00:41:30.265
Wan!

00:41:30.345 --> 00:41:31.385
I couldn't save her.

00:41:31.465 --> 00:41:32.425
Wan!

00:41:32.505 --> 00:41:35.185
I just stood there, watching her…

00:41:35.265 --> 00:41:37.665
Watching her sink, little by little.

00:41:40.825 --> 00:41:42.665
You wouldn't understand that feeling,

00:41:44.265 --> 00:41:48.105
watching your only family
die right in front of you,

00:41:48.185 --> 00:41:51.545
and you can't do anything at all…

00:41:55.745 --> 00:41:58.305
So, you chose to avenge Xiao Wan.

00:41:59.585 --> 00:42:00.585
Yes.

00:42:00.665 --> 00:42:03.225
But finding Mr. Xu wasn't easy.

00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:04.665
Someone came to you.

00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:08.425
Tell the truth.

00:42:10.705 --> 00:42:12.905
I asked around near the Wu house.

00:42:14.065 --> 00:42:18.105
Wu Mujin was Wu Siping's illegitimate son.

00:42:19.225 --> 00:42:20.345
But the Sun family said

00:42:21.465 --> 00:42:23.505
Wan never had a child.

00:42:24.305 --> 00:42:25.705
The Sun family lied?

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:28.625
Yes.

00:42:31.385 --> 00:42:33.625
The night before Wan was buried,

00:42:34.225 --> 00:42:35.745
a woman came to me.

00:42:37.105 --> 00:42:39.265
She said she knew Wan

00:42:39.825 --> 00:42:41.585
and knew what she'd been through.

00:42:45.665 --> 00:42:47.385
That's when I learned

00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:49.665
soon after Wan married in,

00:42:49.745 --> 00:42:52.625
her husband, Sun Renyi, fell gravely ill.

00:42:53.385 --> 00:42:54.225
Physician,

00:42:54.825 --> 00:42:55.825
my son's condition…

00:42:57.905 --> 00:42:59.825
The medicine costs a fortune.

00:42:59.905 --> 00:43:01.385
The Sun family can't afford it.

00:43:03.465 --> 00:43:04.345
Renyi?

00:43:05.185 --> 00:43:06.105
Renyi?

00:43:06.185 --> 00:43:07.985
Renyi…

00:43:09.225 --> 00:43:13.825
Lady Sun heard Xu Daoyin was generous,

00:43:14.345 --> 00:43:16.665
so she took Wan to pray.

00:43:17.305 --> 00:43:19.225
Immortal, bless us.

00:43:22.105 --> 00:43:23.385
Don't worry.

00:43:23.985 --> 00:43:26.145
The Immortal will surely bless us.

00:43:27.145 --> 00:43:28.865
What's wrong with that girl?

00:43:28.945 --> 00:43:29.905
Reporting.

00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:33.025
That girl has a husband
gravely ill, no money for treatment.

00:43:33.625 --> 00:43:34.745
She came to beg Mr. Xu.

00:43:34.825 --> 00:43:36.585
She's been coming for a month straight.

00:43:36.665 --> 00:43:38.025
That's her mother beside her?

00:43:38.785 --> 00:43:40.265
No, it's her in-law.

00:43:42.785 --> 00:43:45.145
Tell her she can stay at the manor,
cultivate and build merit for a few days.

00:43:45.225 --> 00:43:47.785
After that, have her come see me alone.
