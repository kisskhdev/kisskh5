00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"Candy"

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
(Episode 5: I Like You)

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.240
Call the two of them over.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200
Hey.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.719
What are you two doing?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.040
Hurry up and get over here.

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:57.759
Yeah, come on.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.199
Look at all these ingredients here.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.439
Come on, quick!

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.799
Come on.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.079
Coming!

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.240
Let's go.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:04.439
I'm not going.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.519
Let's go.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.920
Let's go, Princess.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840
Let's go.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.640
Why is there so much stuff?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.079
Smells so good!

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.560
I'll go sit down then.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.239
You guys can do the grilling.

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.359
Okay.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.799
I'll do it then.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.319
Here.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:27.599
Do you even know how to grill?

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:28.599
It'll all get burnt.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.040
Stop being in the way.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:32.439
Like I want to be next to you.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:33.959
So annoying.

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.319
Lin Can, come quick!

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
Lin Can.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.239
Tell me...

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.760
do you have a crush on our Si Han?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.040
None of your business.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.079
Stop beating around the bush.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:51.879
Just say it already.

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:52.879
Yeah, come on.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
Nuan Nuan.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.039
You really don't know? Seriously?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280
Huh?

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.519
I don't know anything.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.760
Is there some...

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.000
gossip I don't know about?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.080
It's not about Si Han.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
Don't overthink it.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.759
Any more words...

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.640
and I'm taking you back to the city.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.200
Why isn't everyone starting?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680
How about a toast?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800
Cheers.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:24.879
Cheers!

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.960
Cheers!

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.319
She...

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
would like it, right?

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.199
Are you going to sleep?

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.759
Mm-hmm.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.919
What?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.599
Now you don't mind the...

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.759
poor conditions here?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.280
I'm dead tired.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840
Si Han said...

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.039
we're transplanting rice seedlings tomorrow.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:26.719
Back home,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.240
you had insomnia and couldn't sleep in a strange bed.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.279
Now you fall asleep in seconds.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.320
Remember to turn off the light when you get in bed.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.479
In the beginning,

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.199
you'd keep someone up all night,

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.639
not letting them sleep.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.840
Now that we've been together a while,

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.639
you don't even say a word.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:02.879
All you know is sleep.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400
Let go of me.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.600
Weren't you going to sleep?

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.240
Alright.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680
Be good.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.399
Sister Si Han.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:50.159
Why are you dressed like that?

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:53.639
You were so nice to that Wen Nuan Nuan today.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:56.360
I thought you liked her type now.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.920
Good thing I brought a lot of clothes.

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:00.519
How is it?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Do you like it?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480
Are you done?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.560
Yes.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.360
Then be good.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.519
Sleep.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.120
Report.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:11.639
Spit it out.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.519
Sleeping with clothes on...

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.079
isn't comfortable.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:18.959
Sleep on the floor then.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.480
Alright.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.319
The floor is too hard.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.720
The bed is much cozier.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:34.879
Is that okay?

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:36.639
One more question.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.240
Tonight...

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.839
can we cuddle while we sleep?

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.399
Who wants to cuddle you?

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:53.959
And another thing...

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:17.720
It feels so good...

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.920
Si Han, wait for me!

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:36.560
Didn't I say...

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.080
to wear these shoes when going out?

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.120
I'm not wearing those shoes.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.680
Unless...

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.640
you put them on for me.

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:46.079
Take them off.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120
Left foot.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.839
Let's go.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240
Mm-hmm.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.000
If she weren't here...

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:09.759
this trip...

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:10.879
would be perfect.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:15.839
Those are rice seedlings.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040
These are weeds.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.639
I don't care.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:20.879
They're both green anyway.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960
Let me see.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.320
Go away.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440
It's so beautiful here.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840
Too bad...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.400
we're leaving tomorrow.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.600
I'm gonna miss it.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
Yeah.

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:19.240
The sky is so bright here.

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.840
Even the smell of the grass is nice.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.799
If you like it...

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:27.079
we can just come often.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320
Mm-hmm.

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:38.200
Hey everyone~

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.600
Check out my look today~

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:42.039
Isn't it perfect for this countryside vibe?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.799
It's so scenic and lovely here.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.960
Tomorrow...

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.400
I really don't want to leave.

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.639
I hope I get the chance...

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:51.240
to bring you guys here to play someday!

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:52.879
Okay~

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.600
That's it for today's livestream!

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:56.159
Bye-bye~

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.519
Love you!

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.320
Finally, I'll be free of Lin Can tomorrow.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.480
I wonder who it was...

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.999
who begged and pleaded to come.

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:11.000
If it weren't for the production team...

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.400
crying and begging me to come,

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:13.599
who would want to be here?

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:15.519
Shorty.

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:16.679
Hurry up.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.919
You're the short one!

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:27.000
Hey.

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:30.000
What's wrong with you, Jiang Wan?

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120
Nothing's wrong.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.759
My teeth are just a bit itchy.

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:35.600
All these years...

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.800
you haven't changed at all.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320
Still a total princess.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.639
Right, right, right.

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:41.679
I haven't changed.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720
I'm a princess.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.159
Not like you.

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:46.200
Loving this one today,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480
and that one tomorrow.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.799
What's the relationship
between Lin Can and Wen Nuan Nuan?

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:50.799
Don't you know?

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:52.576
And you're still being a lapdog over there.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.840
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.440
I'm doing it for their own good.

00:10:57.392 --> 00:10:58.392
What,

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.119
you want me to be your dog again?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120
Slow down.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.039
Let go of me!

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.640
Wait, I'll carry you out on my back.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360
Si Han...

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.639
Actually...

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.320
Actually what?

00:11:23.695 --> 00:11:24.815
Actually, the mosquitoes here...

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.400
are even more annoying than Lin Can.

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:27.775
When I get back to the city,

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:29.320
I'm pampering myself from head to toe.

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:31.159
So fussy.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.039
Lin Can once had a fever of 40 degrees...

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.559
and still finished her work.

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:36.120
Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.440
I can't compare to your precious Lin Can in any way.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080
So sleepy...

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.559
Gonna catch up on sleep...

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:43.919
tomorrow when I get home.

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:45.000
So...

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.360
tonight...

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.080
are we still going to see the fireflies?

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:48.960
No.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.799
It's pitch black.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.320
What if I step on bugs?

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:54.313
You were always scared of the dark.

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:56.840
You'd cling to my hand during thunderstorms.

00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:59.519
My hand would be numb the next morning.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.639
Si Han...

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:03.399
Do you think...

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:04.559
we can ever...

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.799
go back to how we were?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.559
This isn't another planet.

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:09.919
If you want to come...

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:11.279
you always can.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.279
Right.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440
We definitely can.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.799
Look at those two carefree souls.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.320
Si Han, remember?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.360
We used to be like that too.

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:28.919
I remember.

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:29.799
But...

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.399
that was all in the past.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440
And now?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200
Now...

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.519
now, of course...

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:40.039
you're the big star,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.840
and I clean up your messes.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.519
You're my boss now, after all.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.519
Si Han...

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.200
You're still so annoying.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.480
Jiang Wan!

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.600
Don't you have legs?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.600
Making Si Han carry you?

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:57.960
Is Si Han your slave?

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240
Don't go too far.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.960
Lin Can!

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:00.960
None of your business!

00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:02.159
We're fine with it!

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080
Let's go, Si Han.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:05.600
Away from the dirt.

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:08.119
You two really are sworn enemies.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.519
Their relationship...

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.879
doesn't seem that bad, huh?

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.600
Stop looking at them.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.680
Nuan Nuan, look over there.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.560
Where are Nuan Nuan and Jiang Wan?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.600
They went around taking pictures.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.639
When did they get so close?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.440
Lin Can...

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:36.480
you and Nuan Nuan...

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.576
About what happened back then...

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.720
I already know the truth.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.879
So you forgive her for not seeing you off back then?

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.440
Maybe she had no choice.

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:54.799
Forget it.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.279
It doesn't matter.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.919
We've met again now.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120
I'm already very happy.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.279
Let's take it slow.

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:13.320
Jiang Wan.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:15.159
Where's Nuan Nuan? She's not with you.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.919
She's not answering her phone,
and she's not in her room.

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:19.799
Didn't she come back earlier?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240
She said...

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.360
she was going to call you
and Si Han to take photos.

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:24.919
She didn't.

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:25.720
I can't find her.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.799
It's getting dark.

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:27.919
She doesn't know the area.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.360
What do we do?

00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:29.120
Well...

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.520
let's all go look for her.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080
Hiding from me?

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.399
No...

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960
Wen Nuan Nuan!

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.919
Why did you disappear?

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:55.759
It's just...

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.759
I...

00:14:56.919 --> 00:14:57.919
'You' what?

00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:01.360
Do you know how worried I was
looking for you?

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.560
What are you doing hiding here?

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440
Originally...

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:09.879
I wanted to prepare a surprise confession for you.

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:12.679
But you...

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360
Well, great.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080
No surprise now.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240
Surprise?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200
Confession?

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:22.007
I heard what you said...

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:23.519
to Sister Si Han.

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:30.519
Xiao He...

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.480
I like you.

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:34.759
In the past...

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.279
now...

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.759
it's always been you.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.200
It will always be you.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.200
All these years...

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.320
we've missed too much.

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.279
Now...

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.519
will you still be with me?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.480
Nuan Nuan...

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600
Actually, before...

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.480
I didn't not wait for you.

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:07.279
Why did you stop playing?

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:08.919
Don't feel like it.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.360
You little brat!

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.240
Your dad spent so much on your piano lessons!

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.680
Why did you upset your dad again?

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:20.759
Get out!

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.600
Let me talk to my daughter properly.

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:35.679
I've said it before.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840
You belong to me.

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:38.879
Let go of me!

00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:41.039
Get out!

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:42.679
Let go!

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840
What's going on?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.720
This is the fine daughter you raised!

00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:59.200
She's a murderer!

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.240
You brat!

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.519
Look what you've done!

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880
Do you want him...

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.119
or me?

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:13.720
Raising you...

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.000
is worse than raising a dog.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.200
You drove him away.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.680
You'll be left with nothing!

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.079
If I just disappeared from this world...

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:35.359
would it even matter?

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:06.519
Xiao He...

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640
Xiao He...

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.559
Xiao He...

00:18:14.599 --> 00:18:15.599
Xiao He...

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680
Xiao He...

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480
Xiao He...

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.920
Xiao He, wake up!

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.559
Xiao He...

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.319
Xiao He, don't be scared.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720
I'll take you away.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.880
Tomorrow...

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.480
Auntie...

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:43.839
is taking me to live in another city.

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:45.839
After this...

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.039
we won't see each other much.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:49.799
It's okay.

00:18:50.599 --> 00:18:51.599
Xiao He...

00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:53.519
I want you to be free.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:55.960
To have a better life.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.160
From now on, you're on your own.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.280
Take good care of yourself.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960
Be well.

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:05.599
But I'll miss you.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:10.199
It's not like we'll never see each other.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.039
We'll just keep in touch often.

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:14.920
Tomorrow...

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.039
I'll see you off.

00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:17.839
You must wait for me.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.400
Okay.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240
I'll go now.

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:56.759
Xiao He...

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960
You've suffered.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480
Come with Auntie.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.720
We're going far away.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.160
Hide where no one can find us.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200
Mm-hmm.

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.559
Wait a little longer.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.640
Nuan Nuan will come.

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:08.799
There's no time.

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.039
We have to catch the bus.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200
Let's go.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.839
We've missed too much time.

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.599
You're finally back by my side.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400
No, that's not it.

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:24.680
It's my fault.

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:27.920
I always thought...

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.199
we were just good friends.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.680
It wasn't until you left that day...

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:36.559
that I realized...

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880
I like you.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.240
It's my fault for missing my chance with you.

00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:53.759
Nuan Nuan...

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.119
Let's never be apart again.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:00.759
Okay.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.400
Never be apart again.

00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:01.839
What,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
avoiding me?

00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:04.319
Not at all.

00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:05.559
Just thinking.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.720
Well...

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:08.999
why aren't you eating the instant noodles I made you?

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:16.039
Alright then.

00:22:16.407 --> 00:22:17.806
Handmade by yours truly...

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.039
super deluxe gourmet instant noodles!

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:21.680
Smell it.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.200
Delicious, right?

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440
Smells great.

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:26.160
I'll feed you.

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:27.359
Okay.

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:34.359
Is it good?

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.519
What did you put in it?

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:37.519
It's so tasty.

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:38.799
Have another bite.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440
Earlier...

00:22:57.759 --> 00:23:00.000
I saw Lin Can and Nuan Nuan...

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.960
When will we ever...

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.799
Xiao He...

00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:36.519
My little darling...

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.920
Mommy's here.

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:40.119
Open the door for Mommy.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.880
Xiao He...

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:47.440
You little brat!

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:49.880
Ungrateful good-for-nothing!

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440
You think...

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:53.039
you can get rid of your old lady?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Open up!

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.680
What's all the yelling?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480
Who are you?

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:01.839
What's all the noise so early?

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:03.319
Are you crazy?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.400
You don't know who I am?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.400
Some crazy woman.

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:11.559
Get lost!

00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:12.839
I'm here to find my...

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720
Xiao He.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
My own daughter...

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640
lives here!

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:19.039
The big star!

00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:22.119
Who do you think you are?

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440
Star?

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:24.799
You mean Lin Can?

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.240
She moved out long ago.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240
What did you say?

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:29.759
Her star faded, you know?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.480
The company took the apartment back.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.359
Lady,

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:33.759
go look somewhere else.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Don't cause a scene here.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200
You little brat!

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:39.159
I haven't even enjoyed the good life yet!

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.240
How dare her star fade!

00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:46.559
Where is she?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.400
Tell me!

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.680
Where is she?

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.500
(Easter egg)

00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:02.000
Nuan Nuan...

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:03.679
how have you been lately?

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.119
I found a part-time job this summer.

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:08.119
I can save up more money.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.800
I'll treat you to a big meal then.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440
Xiao He...

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.240
don't contact me anymore.

00:25:29.559 --> 00:25:31.680
The number you have dialed is powered off.

00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:33.359
Please try again later.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440
Back to work.
