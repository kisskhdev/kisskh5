WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.290
I'll join the cheer team.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.940
I want to help you, in any way I can.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.110
Your feelings would only trouble Ichinose.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.380
How can I surpass Ren?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.570
You have to believe you're giving up for a better cause.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.860
I don't like Ren anymore.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.400
I'm going to confess to Kinoshita after Sports Day today.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.890
[Hikarigasaki High School - Sports Day]

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.690
Students participating in Pole-Toppling,
please gather on the grounds.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.100
Alright, let's do this!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.890
You guys got this.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.820
I repeat, all students participating in...

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.290
I'll do my best.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.420
Especially if you're cheering, Kinoshita.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.380
What? What just happened?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.830
Ninako, you might have a chance!

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.040
Actually...

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.660
it's not like that with Ren.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.500
I don't know how to put it, but...

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.230
It's not like that anymore.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.080
- What do you mean?
- What's not like that?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.040
I just don't like him the same way anymore.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.320
But you were just saying you wanted to be his girlfriend!

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.300
Now, now, let's trust Ninako on this, okay?

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.600
What happened to being bothered by the possibility

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.700
of Kinoshita liking another guy?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.310
You're the one who said swaying her affections
makes it a non-issue.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.320
That wasn't meant to be advice.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.080
I don't want to lose her to anyone.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.800
On your marks, get set...

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.400
Well, I'm not backing down either.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.160
I'm knocking that pole down!

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.470
You guys got this!

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.720
Get it together, Ando.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.610
Damn it...

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.050
Go, go!

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.870
I wouldn't want to pull those two apart. Don't you agree?

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.630
I have to give up on him.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.260
I have to erase these feelings of mine.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.010
But...

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.020
My heart can't help but insist I love Ren.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.890
Each cheer squad will now be performing their cheer routine.
[Episode 5]

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.710
What's up, Kinoshita?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.680
You don't look so good.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.570
I'm just a bit nervous.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.240
You'll be fine. We practiced for this.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.290
You're going to show your crush
how hard you've been working, right?

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.980
Sir.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.550
Yeah.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.480
Kinoshita, it's time.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.620
Right.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.490
Alright everyone, let's go.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.230
Yes, sir!

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.040
I have to do my best. I chose to do this.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.160
- I see Ninako.
- Where?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.670
There, in the back.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.250
I see her!

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.770
Team D! We will now cheer!

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.310
For your victory!

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:58.700
Go! Go! Team D!

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.000
I have a crush on Ren.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But I can't tell him about it.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.130
My heart and my mind are totally out of sync.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.890
Why can't I say a thing to the people I care about?

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.600
I just want to preserve this status quo.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.020
I don't know what's right anymore.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.620
Kinoshita? Kinoshita!

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.220
Is she okay? Let's get her to Mr. Hoshina.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.860
Someone carry her to the nurse's office, quick!

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.250
How's Ninako?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.170
Mr. Hoshina says she's okay. She's just resting up now.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.510
- And Ren?
- He's going to wait for her to wake up.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.910
Alright.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.160
Where are you going, Takumi?

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.250
I have to get ready for the relay race.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.600
Right, good luck!

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.940
Who's the first-year who's passing the baton to me?

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.000
The first-year for team D?

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.080
That'd be me.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.550
What?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.500
But you weren't on the list of participants.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.680
I'm subbing in for the girl who was supposed to run.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.340
She got hurt.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.350
Yeah, right. What are you plotting now?

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.000
Mao!

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.620
I'm so, so sorry about this.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.920
It's fine. Stay off your leg, okay?

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.200
Yeah, I will. Good luck out there.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.850
Thanks.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.790
I'm sorry.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.100
You don't need to apologize.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.120
- No, that was totally...
- It's fine. Don't apologize.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.790
More importantly, was Ninako okay?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.430
She's resting up right now.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.910
But she'll be bummed when she wakes up.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.540
If our team loses, I bet she'd blame herself.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.220
We have to win.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.260
- Please, don't sabotage...
- I know.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.230
I'll run.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.250
I'll be heading back to our first aid tent.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.050
Okay.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.750
Looks like she exerted herself a bit too much.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.670
And all so her crush would see her working hard.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.760
She's an admirable girl, isn't she?

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.220
Kinoshita has a crush on someone at our school?

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.760
Yeah.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.420
I see.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.080
Is that a surprise?

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.050
Manabu said it was someone he didn't know,
so I assumed otherwise.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.670
I think that was a lie.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:37.120
I bet it's someone you, me, and Manabu all know well.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.430
On your marks, get set...

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.230
- You got this!
- Our team is in second place!

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.420
Go, go, go!

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.770
She's actually giving it her all.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.390
Mao!

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.800
You're almost there! You can do this!

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.850
Mao!

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.710
Great job.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.180
He's fast.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.430
He managed to pass two people!

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.560
Do you know where you are?

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.370
Sir, Kinoshita's awake.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.600
You're looking better already.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.880
What happened?

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.450
You collapsed during the cheer routine.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.470
Kinoshita?

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.040
I screwed up.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.750
A cheerleader fainted in front of the team? I can only laugh.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.670
I guess it's not worth trying something new after all.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.430
Sorry to make you worry about me.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.590
I'm going to rest here a bit longer.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.010
You should get back out there, Ren.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.120
Alright.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.050
Take it easy, okay?

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.220
I will, thanks.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.200
I haven't managed to accomplish anything I set out to do.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.760
I've only lied to all the people I care about.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.260
I hate this.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.430
I hate feeling like this.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.380
Just let me disappear.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.570
Mao!

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.240
Do your scrapes hurt that badly?

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.690
You should go to the first aid tent.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.660
I'm sorry.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.640
I told Ninako.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.880
About your past with Ichinose.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.160
I thought...

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.640
I thought if I told her, she wouldn't get any closer to him.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:04.670
I don't like Ren anymore.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.660
Everyone's so obsessed with Ren these days, aren't they?

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.590
Not me.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.420
I...

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.950
I like you, Takumi.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.470
What?

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.430
As we were dating...

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.970
I grew to like you more, and more.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:50.120
I realized love can bloom through a relationship, too.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.050
But when I saw Ichinose in that classroom...

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.960
I recalled how I used to feel about him.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.810
I had no idea what I was doing in the moment.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.730
I've regretted my impulsiveness ever since.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.640
Then why did you tell Ninako about my past with Ren?

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.550
Because I wanted to do something for you.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.220
And the only way I thought I could help,
was by getting in their way.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.670
I knew you would never forgive me.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.410
So I didn't think I'd care if you hated me even more.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.680
But when you called my name during the race...

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:03.830
I suddenly loathed myself for how little I could actually do.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.600
I'm sorry.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.700
Were you hurting this entire time?

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.020
Then we'll call it even.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:03.420
Now I know the girl I loved wasn't as coldhearted as I thought.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.240
And that's enough for me.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.870
I've had my share of regrets, too.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.620
I should have tried harder back then.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.930
Take care.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.370
Takumi.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.930
I haven't done all this for an entirely selfless reason.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:40.040
I want things to go well with you and Ninako,
so my own guilt will be alleviated, too.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.920
So please...

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.510
Please don't give up on Ninako.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.800
What a devious ally I have.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:17.610
This concludes the Hikarigasaki High Sports Day.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.670
I repeat.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:25.220
This concludes the Hikarigasaki High Sports Day.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.930
I'm sorry for the trouble and worry I caused you, Mr. Hoshina.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.160
Thank you for letting me stay here.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.010
"I hate feeling like this. Just let me disappear."

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.760
I had another patient say the exact same thing the other day.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.490
And he just won first place in the relay race.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.790
You'll find the confidence to run without hesitating. I promise.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.430
Kinoshita?

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.440
Are you feeling alright?

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.330
Yeah. I'm all better now.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.990
You know, our team ended up winning today.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.170
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.690
We owe it all to Ando.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.210
That's great.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.830
Kinoshita.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.690
I have something I want to tell you.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:35.930
Sorry, but I have to go apologize to the cheer team first.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.590
Kinoshita.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.230
I like you.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:00.210
Even if there's someone else you like, I want you to choose me.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.010
I love you.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.180
What he's saying to me now...

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.250
are the words I've wanted to hear all this time.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.050
Kinoshita, we're having an afterparty with the cheer team at...

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.500
Sorry.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.520
When do you think your afterparty will end?

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.040
I think we'll wrap up by 7PM.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.500
I'll wait for you at the station.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.820
Give me your response then.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.230
Listen, Ninako.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.580
Yeah?

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.280
- Did Ren...
- Could we get more chips?

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.760
And another glass of juice as well.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.280
Coming right up.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.190
Sorry to make you work today, Ando. You must be tired.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.710
I'm fine.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.530
Alright, team. It's almost 7PM, so let's wrap it up, yeah?

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.800
Yes, sir!

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.680
Any of you who wants to stay longer,
contact your guardians, okay?

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.180
Great work today, team.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.250
Sir, where did Ninako go?

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.330
She just left.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.240
Ninako!

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.600
Ando?

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.850
[Season 2 Finale]

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:39.610
[Next Episode]

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.400
I'm not leaving until you answer me.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.300
I feel my chest squeeze. I feel my heart ache.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.560
I feel tearful for no reason.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.150
And I feel pain, like something is stabbing through my heart.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.860
I found another reason to love him.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.630
[Epilogue]

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.200
Do you still feel a bit dizzy?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.710
No, I'm fine now.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.010
I'm just a bit uncertain.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:14.400
And here I told myself I wouldn't waver anymore. How pathetic.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.630
Folks who are sure of themselves are admirable,
but it's easier said than done, huh?

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.810
Do you ever find yourself wavering as well?

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.210
Of course.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.800
With my parents getting older,
I often wonder if I should be living closer to them.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:35.550
Or if I should quit this unstable job,
and return to being a regular office worker.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.650
Compared to your worries...

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.730
my anxieties about romance seem trivial.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:51.730
There's no ranking when it comes to what troubles people have.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:58.080
If this crush is weighing on your heart, then it matters to you.
