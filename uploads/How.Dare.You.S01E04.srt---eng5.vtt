[Episode 4]

[Changning Palace]

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.000
Your Highness, run!

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.890
It shouldn't be like this.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.200
This wasn't the plan.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:58.640
Xu Yao!

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.470
Don't die.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.070
Please.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.810
Your Highness,
do you really not understand?

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.710
Run!

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.360
Don't look back no matter who you meet.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.360
Stay alive.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.840
Are you hurt anywhere, Your Highness?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.910
Trust no one.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.570
Don't leave me.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.470
Don't leave me.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.090
I'm here.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.510
Your Majesty.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.480
The arsonists have been caught.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.560
Your Majesty, we're innocent!

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.560
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560
I am innocent!

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.520
We were just passing by.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.030
We saw the library was on fire.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.290
So we went to put it out!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.680
The library is in a remote location.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.800
It wasn't even your shift that day.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.260
What were you doing there?

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.800
Spare us, Your Majesty!

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.560
It wasn't me!

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.400
Spare us, Your Majesty!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.150
It wasn't me!

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.800
-Your Majesty, spare my life!
-Your Majesty, spare my life!

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.400
Kill them!

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.470
-Your Majesty, spare my life!
-Your Majesty!

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.270
Your Majesty!

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.230
Your Majesty!

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.760
-Your Majesty, spare my life!
-Your Majesty!

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.520
Please!

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.680
-Your Majesty, spare my life!
-Please spare my life!

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.250
Does it still hurt?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.760
Tissue...

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.320
Tissue...

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.250
Handkerchief!

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.530
Hurry! Handkerchief!

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.260
You can cry.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.200
It's okay to cry.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.360
You'll feel better after crying.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.140
Everyone from the library
has been rescued.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.730
The arsonists have been found.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.330
However,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.910
they're just scapegoats.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.310
I believe

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.950
they were acting on Xiahou Bo's orders.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.510
Senior Minister Xu has been brought back.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.390
To avoid Prince Duan's spies,

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.230
he's been temporarily placed
at a suburban house.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.640
When things settle down,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.930
we'll go see him.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.430
What about Xu Yao?

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.560
The coroner said

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.190
he died

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:49.870
in peace.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.030
Before the fire reached him,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.480
he had already died from poison.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.920
So

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.600
he didn't suffer again.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.760
Take the medicine first.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.880
It's not hot anymore.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.560
Just drink it

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.800
like water to reduce your fever.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.690
Thank goodness

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.610
you also came from another world.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.040
Otherwise I'd be all alone.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.870
I just said no one would harm you,

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.410
and then...

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.760
I'm sorry.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.740
I broke my promise.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600
You don't have to wait until the end.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.730
If it becomes too painful for you,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.240
I...

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.600
I mean...

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.530
I can send you out right now

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.210
to get away from this mess.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.909
Do you want to leave here?

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.560
I've recorded all

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.070
of Prince Duan's plans in a book

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.890
and buried it under the window
of his mansion's back kitchen.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.480
Don't go looking for it right away.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.950
Wait at least seven days.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.480
Xu Yao said he left a book

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.330
that can be used against Prince Duan.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.310
You mean...

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.430
We can't let Xu Yao die in vain.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.270
You mean

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.150
you don't need me to send you away?

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.960
Why is that your focus?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.630
I'm talking about Xu Yao's book

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.070
that can be used against Prince Duan.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.270
You've missed such an important point.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:45.840
Right.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:50.730
What...

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.360
What book?

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.280
Before he died, Xu Yao

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.480
said he had recorded Prince Duan's plans

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.360
in a book

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.280
and hid it right inside
the prince's mansion.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.590
He came specifically

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.040
to tell me about this.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.200
That's why,
despite being severely poisoned,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.530
he risked his life to bring this message
to me in the library.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.510
I can't believe I actually thought

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.370
our plan had succeeded back then.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.980
Xu Yao was kept in the dark
his whole life,

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.080
slaving away for his enemy.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.410
Is that somehow better?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.270
At least

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.440
he could determine his own fate,

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.390
unlike those

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.440
who have no control over their fate.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.320
No control over fate.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.920
Are you talking about Xu Yao

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.030
or yourself?

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.840
I mean

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.970
the road is winding

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.970
but the future is bright.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.350
You're right.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.330
The most important thing for us now

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.510
is to survive.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.360
Our main goal

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.120
is to survive.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.150
Who says you need to be
a warrior to win the game?

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.790
If we survive till the end,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.120
we'll have everything.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:18.480
Next,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.240
we need to play

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.150
a game of survival overtime.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.750
Do you understand?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.920
I understand.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.670
I fully understand.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.440
Survive.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.590
Survive!

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.240
Why won't His Highness
come to see me in person?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.100
Your Highness.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.600
His Highness is ill and cannot come.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.730
He's ill?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.050
How come?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.200
To be honest,

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.720
when the library caught fire that day,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.030
the one who escaped from the fire

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.290
was Consort Yu Wanyin,

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.520
and the one who couldn't escape

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.270
was His Highness's adviser,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.030
Xu Yao.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.960
What did you say?

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.090
Yu Wanyin and His Highness's adviser

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.600
were both in the library?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.390
Why didn't he tell me?

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.840
Is there something
he couldn't bring himself to say?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.900
He had intended to keep this from you,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.600
fearing that the more you knew,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.120
the more likely
you would get into trouble.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.740
Her Majesty now holds absolute power
and is at the height of her influence.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.630
She already sees His Highness as a thorn
in her side and targets him at every turn.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.960
That tyrant and his demonic consort

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.040
are also doing everything they can
to cut off His Highness's support.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.640
His Highness is now isolated
and without help.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.030
Your Highness,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.530
please take good care of yourself.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.390
His Highness has the world in his heart

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.790
and cares for all people.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.260
He's truly destined to rule this empire.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.040
Now he's hindered
by treacherous officials.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.050
How could I stand by and do nothing?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.280
Although I cannot often see him,

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.440
I

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.150
think of him constantly.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.810
Please, young man,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.850
deliver this letter to His Highness.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.410
It'll surely help him rise again.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.240
The library caught fire a few days ago.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.340
Is everyone all right?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.520
Your Majesty.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.320
The imperial physician said

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.550
that Consort Yu's burns were not serious,

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.270
but that day

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.320
after jumping from the third floor
into the water,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.780
she had also caught a cold.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.120
Thus, she had been running a high fever
for the past few days.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.840
Jumping from the third floor
into the water?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.510
She's quite brave, isn't she?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.030
Her external injuries have healed,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.230
but I fear the shock she experienced...

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.360
What about His Majesty?

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.480
Has he visited her?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.960
It was His Majesty who carried Consort Yu
back to the palace that day.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.600
But for some reason these past few days,

[Du Shan, Fine Fowls]
[Cheng Wen, Under the Blue Clouds]

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.310
[Li Yunxi,
Intoxicated in the Shade of Flowers]

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.310
In the storyline,

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.750
this is where scholars and poets

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:24.280
gather for elite meetings.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.440
See this sign?

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.570
These songs listed here

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.480
are performed by songstresses

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.680
who set the most popular poems to music.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.680
It's basically
the ancient version of a book launch.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.940
Whoever has their poem

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.040
sung by the most famous songstress

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.920
becomes the most celebrated person.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.270
Li Bai and his kind often did this.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.670
They were truly refined.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.660
Scholars and poets...

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.170
More like libertines than scholars,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.160
I'd say.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.160
Young man,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.270
you two look unfamiliar here.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.350
We heard Miss Hongyuan
is debuting a new song today,

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.830
so we came to join in the fun.

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.030
-No problem.
-Right?

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.200
We want to witness
the birth of a new talent.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.510
Gentlemen, please go upstairs.
The view is better there.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.080
Brother.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.730
Don't be shy.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.110
Enjoy yourself.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.570
Please.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.170
Let's go.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.240
Come on.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:23.930
Don't be shy.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.210
Why are you so familiar with this?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.960
If you draft more proposals

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.550
and create more presentations,
you'll understand.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.880
It's all part of the job.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.400
Beauty, I'm here!

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.510
Aren't you...

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:48.910
You...

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.680
You've already set everything up?

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400
As the president,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.060
I need to have the big picture, right?

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.250
[Du Shan, Fine Fowls]
[Cheng Wen, Under the Blue Clouds]

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.980
[Li Yunxi,
Intoxicated in the Shade of Flowers]

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.750
Everyone!

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.590
Miss Hongyuan has selected a poem

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.220
and composed a new melody.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.680
She will perform
after one incense stick burns down.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.930
Everyone, place your bets quickly!

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.110
[Fang Wenshui] [Cheng Wen]
[Li Yunxi] [Du Shan]

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.920
This is outrageous!

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.110
The art of poetry

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.150
should not be used for gambling!

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.930
I submitted my poem

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.000
so it would be heard throughout the land

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.310
and serve as
a remonstration to the emperor.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.440
The present emperor

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.850
is so incompetent.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.720
On our journey here,

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.970
through thirteen provinces,

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.310
we saw people
selling themselves to bury their fathers,

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.770
countless families begging on the streets.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.680
"While meat and wine go to waste
behind the vermilion gates of the rich,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.000
the poor is frozen to death
on an empty stomach by the roadside."

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.400
Such an incompetent ruler deserves to die!

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.170
Li is right.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.980
The prosperity now

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.830
-is nothing but an illusion
-Control yourself.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.270
-before the coming collapse.
-Control yourself.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:02.920
Nowadays

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.200
there's no one capable in court.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.260
The Yan State has been eyeing
the Great Xia covetously.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.000
Even

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.480
the tiny Qiang State

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.540
dares to violate our borders.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:14.680
I've heard

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:15.240
[Du Shan]

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.370
the emperor now favors Yu exclusively

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.270
and pays even less
attention to state affairs.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.470
That demonic consort

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.690
brings disaster to the country
and kills innocents

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.960
just like the infamous Daji.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.610
I heard her face

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.110
is as sharp-featured as a snake spirit's,

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.640
and her chin is so pointy
that it could peel a pear!

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.900
My chin can peel a pear?

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.270
I'll peel you now!

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.130
Control yourself.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.740
Control yourself.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.480
There's no need to speak like that.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.270
"The songstress knows not
the grief of the captive king."

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.170
Do they really sing of their own accord?

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:49.280
It's clearly those wealthy young masters

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.720
[Er Lan]

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.480
who splash out a fortune to request them.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.410
Why lay the blame on women instead?

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.200
This person's words make perfect sense.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.510
The most despicable
are those mindless lackeys

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.570
who aid the tyrant.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.510
They cow the loyal officials into silence

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.920
and let the treacherous ones
seize control of the court.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.790
If I pass the imperial exam, I'll
remonstrate at the cost of my life

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:06.680
and eliminate those lackeys first.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.030
Li.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.110
-Li is right.
-Control yourself.

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.970
-Let's control ourselves.
-You are our role model.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.160
You're always talking about death.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.400
It's such bad luck.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.200
Let's protect ourselves first

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.060
and plan our next move carefully.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.200
Come, young man.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.920
It's alright.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.450
Wait!

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.390
[Fang Wenshui] [Cheng Wen]
[Li Yunxi] [Du Shan]

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.000
Have some tea.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.400
Green shadows dance,
the phoenix branch sways.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:58.070
Alone it perches, no common bird stays.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.200
High on the parasol, a clear breeze blows.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.960
The noble bird chooses its tree,
spreads its wings and goes.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.960
The wise have eyes
to tell false from true.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:18.240
The loyal minister chooses a worthy lord,
with a faithful heart.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.200
The road to high glory lies ahead for all.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:33.720
Choose the good to abide with,
wait for the time to call.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.000
Great!

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.960
Excellent!

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.920
What I sang today

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.310
was composed by the talented Du Shan,

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:45.960
a piece called Fine Fowls.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.070
Du, it was you?

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:48.610
Congratulations!

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.480
Thank you.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.110
I never thought a slacker like you

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.110
could pen such incisive verses!

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.830
I'm flattered.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.310
Wonderful!

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.080
What's so wonderful?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.160
Don't you hear

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.890
this poem is mocking me
for not being a wise ruler?

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.960
I meant

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.720
what a beautiful lady.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.510
Relax.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.790
When people talk like that,

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.640
it means your tyrant image is solid,

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.750
staying true to the original character.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.480
It also shows

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.400
there are quite a few people
in the world who want me dead.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.880
Have you forgotten

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.540
what you came here to do today?

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.830
Have you found the person
you're looking for?

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.090
I...

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.500
How could I forget?

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:33.950
I'm still looking.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.290
I just skimmed through

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.000
the original novel.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.200
I can't remember the description

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.030
of this person's appearance at all.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.270
With so many people here,

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.530
can we really find him?

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:46.550
I remember

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.270
in the original book,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.450
you look a lot like your mother.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.270
Just stay like this.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.270
Stand right here.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.240
With your face

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.070
being the spitting image of your mother's,

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.130
I refuse to believe

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.900
that we can't find him,

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.810
or that he can't find us.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.310
Are you sure?

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.860
My mother looks like this?

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.980
Sorry.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.310
Just a moment.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.199
Come, let me tell you.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.170
That hurts so much.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.690
Just hurry and find him.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.440
That one definitely isn't him.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.050
Too fat.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.670
That one doesn't look right either.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.440
Too young.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.530
What about that one?

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.920
Looks too sleazy.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.639
A fine fowl perches only on a fine tree.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.230
Du, your words truly resonate with me.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.230
But where on earth is such a fine tree

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.710
to be found in this troubled world today?

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.440
Actually, we've long heard that

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.840
Prince Duan's
literary and military talents

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.480
far exceed those of the tyrant.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.280
Moreover, Prince Duan
is known for respecting the talented,

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.510
[Cen Jintian]

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.880
appointing people based on merit,
regardless of background.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.710
If we want to fulfill our ambitions,

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.230
perhaps...

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.360
This is treasonous!

00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.690
How outrageous!

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.850
Li!

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.280
-Even if the emperor is incompetent,
-Li!

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.190
he's still
the only legitimate ruler of the land.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.360
No matter how talented Prince Duan is,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.360
he should remain a subject.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.220
How could he overstep his bounds?

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.390
What's wrong?

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.310
Found him.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:17.110
Where?

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:19.890
It's him.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.140
How do you know?

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.190
Because

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.880
he has eyes
that don't belong to a corporate slave.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.890
And look at that old man's temples.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.650
In martial arts novels,

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.690
martial arts masters' temples

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.330
are always protruding.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.000
Only the elderly

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.370
and physically weak people

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.150
have sunken temples.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.370
My great-uncle was just like that.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.190
If I remember correctly,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.120
that person who doesn't like music

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.960
is also him, right?

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.760
You have a good memory.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.320
Anyway,

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.760
when he comes out,
you can test him and see.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.250
Why don't you go?

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.060
If I go, wouldn't I
just be walking to my death?

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.310
If anything happens to you,

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.170
your guards will all protect you.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:17.920
My guards...

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.850
He's coming out!

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:27.440
Sir.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.590
How many

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.800
waiters and servants do you have here?

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.170
Seven or eight waiters,

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.580
and roughly the same number of servants.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.800
Is there anyone

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.000
who just arrived in the past two years,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.110
over 40 years old,

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.330
and quite sturdy-looking?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.230
Why are you asking about this?

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.290
I just find your face quite familiar.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.890
What about me, in your eyes?

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.730
This bodes well.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.750
Meeting like this is fate.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.410
Since we've met,

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.160
why don't we be honest with each other?

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.630
Even if you're mistaken,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.810
there's no need to pull out a knife.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.070
A fight broke out!

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.280
Let's go.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.110
Hurry!

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.030
Look!

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.510
It seems like there's a fight upstairs.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.440
There really is.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:55.190
There's actually a fight upstairs.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.250
You haven't paid yet. Don't leave!

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.880
If you want to fight, do it outside!

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.940
Not in here!

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.320
Your guards seem rather incompetent.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.690
I mistook you for someone else.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.440
It's a misunderstanding.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.660
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.190
Sorry.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:35.030
Sorry.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.060
Sorry.
