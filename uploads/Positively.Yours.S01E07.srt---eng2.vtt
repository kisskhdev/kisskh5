Ah, I can finally breathe.

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:53.572
But the President can't come at all?

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:54.672
Well, yeah.

00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:56.205
Something came up.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:59.305
He's been acting like he was
going to come with you.

00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:01.438
I just don't like him.

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:04.472
Ah, forget it. It's not like we're
that kind of close anyway.

00:01:04.472 --> 00:01:06.238
I was planning to come alone
in the first place.

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:09.205
Ms. Jang Hui Won, please come
into the 3D ultrasound room.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:10.672
Okay.

00:01:10.672 --> 00:01:12.872
Guardian, please come in too.

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:16.072
Oh, guardian...

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:20.872
I'll just walk you to the door.

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:24.172
I'll watch your stuff, so don't worry.

00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:25.905
Okay.

00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:34.705
I get hot easily, that's all.

00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:35.872
I tend to feel warm inside.

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:37.572
Give this to me.

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:39.405
Thanks.

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:44.872
Is it over?

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:48.037
If you're still at the hospital,
I'm heading there now.

00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:56.138
Is he still concerned?

00:01:57.938 --> 00:01:59.605
You don't have to come.

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:01.705
It's all over.

00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:14.772
Why did I avoid them?

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:16.338
- Do you like Jang Hui Won?
- Here.

00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:19.505
I plan to confess to her seriously soon.

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:28.738
- Yes.
- Son.

Your father just woke up. Don't worry
about us here. Focus on your work.

No.

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:35.772
I'm not really needed.

00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:37.772
I'll go back to the hospital.

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:50.938
You're going to wear it out.

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:53.205
I've never seen anything like this before.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:56.438
So this is the 3D ultrasound?

00:02:56.438 --> 00:02:58.038
I can already see

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:01.305
the arms, legs, even the fingers.

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:04.972
Thanks for today.

00:03:04.972 --> 00:03:06.638
It must have been awkward at the OB-GYN.

00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:08.805
Does that really matter?

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:12.005
What matters more is that you're not anxious.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:13.005
Give me.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:14.738
Okay.

00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:19.938
I feel like I have a lot of memories
with you tied to tteokbokki.

00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:22.672
When I fought with my mom
and ran away from home,

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:25.905
you bought me tteokbokki.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.638
Right.

00:03:28.672 --> 00:03:30.438
I really liked that time.

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:32.138
Eating tteokbokki with you,

00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:35.238
talking about home, grades,

00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:38.172
and what we wanted to do with our lives.

00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:41.205
Well,

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:42.838
sometimes I think about this.

00:03:42.838 --> 00:03:46.338
If I went back to those days
with my current memories,

00:03:46.338 --> 00:03:49.205
wouldn't I have lived much better?

00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:52.205
If you went back with your memories,
what would you want to do first?

00:03:52.205 --> 00:03:53.572
Well.

00:03:53.572 --> 00:03:56.005
First, I'd improve my grades.

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:57.638
No, maybe buy a lottery ticket first?

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.372
What?

00:04:00.038 --> 00:04:01.372
How about you?

00:04:01.372 --> 00:04:03.738
Well, I...

00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:07.972
I...

00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:21.772
I would've confessed to you first.

00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:31.405
I kept regretting that

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:33.438
maybe I waited too long.

00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:37.805
But after being your guardian today,

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:39.938
I want to protect you even more.

00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:43.872
Min Uk.

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:48.838
Looking back, there wasn't
a single day I didn't like you.

00:04:50.338 --> 00:04:51.772
I thought about it a lot.

00:04:51.772 --> 00:04:55.038
Who needs to be by your side right now.

00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:57.805
Who should be there with you.

00:04:57.805 --> 00:05:01.538
I wish that person were me, Hui Won.

00:05:12.405 --> 00:05:15.005
Why does it have to be now?

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:16.838
Why now?

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:29.672
What brings you here at this hour?

00:05:29.672 --> 00:05:33.005
I came to see if you were still alive.

00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:35.538
Ta-da! A present.

00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:36.538
What is it?

00:05:36.538 --> 00:05:38.272
Take a look.

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:42.505
Wow...

00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:43.605
No way.

00:05:43.605 --> 00:05:45.972
I've never received
something like this before.

00:05:45.972 --> 00:05:48.072
Thanks, Mi Ran.

00:05:48.072 --> 00:05:50.738
It's so cute.

00:05:50.738 --> 00:05:52.105
Cute, right?

00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:53.938
I feel very proud.

00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:56.005
I bought it last time
when I went with Min Uk.

00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:58.438
I forgot to give it to you
when the three of us met.

00:05:58.438 --> 00:06:00.672
Oh.

00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:01.738
With Min Uk?

00:06:01.738 --> 00:06:05.105
Yeah. But, I don't know what he was
so unhappy about that day.

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:07.938
He barely even looked at the clothes
and left all the decisions to me.

00:06:07.938 --> 00:06:10.005
I shouldn't have brought him.

00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:13.105
Still, it paid off that I chose carefully.

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:14.205
Do you like it?

00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:16.305
Yeah.

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:18.538
But he really acted like that?

00:06:18.538 --> 00:06:19.872
Yeah, why?

00:06:19.872 --> 00:06:21.672
Oh, nothing. It's nothing.

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:24.538
Want something to drink?

00:06:27.772 --> 00:06:29.472
What's wrong with her?

00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:33.672
Why isn't he even replying?

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:39.172
Next is the story sent by Ye Ju.

00:06:39.172 --> 00:06:42.638
Hello, I'm an ordinary
office worker living in Seoul.

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:45.238
Ms. Jang Hui Won, please come
into the 3D ultrasound room.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.272
Okay.

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.505
Guardian, please come in too.

00:06:50.205 --> 00:06:52.438
Me, who openly opposed office romances,

00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:54.072
- Since when does he get to be her guardian?
- never expected it.

00:06:54.072 --> 00:06:56.672
And now, I'm in an office romance.
Actually, our first meeting was...

00:06:56.672 --> 00:06:59.138
Anyway, I'm glad the chairman is okay.

00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:02.372
I heard he's been eating well
since yesterday, huh?

00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:03.638
Who am I talking to?

00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:06.172
I'm lonely, so lonely.

00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:10.472
I thought we'd only have good days ahead,
but there's one thing that bothers me.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:15.272
My girlfriend's male best friend of 15 years.

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:16.305
Oh, that can happen.

00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:17.572
- Turn up the volume.
- Totally.

00:07:17.572 --> 00:07:18.605
- Higher?
- Let's continue.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.972
The problem is... Oh my.

00:07:20.972 --> 00:07:26.138
I recently found traces that my girlfriend
used to like this male friend.

00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:27.605
- After discovering those traces...
- Jeez.

00:07:27.605 --> 00:07:29.472
Opening Pandora's box won't help anything.

00:07:29.472 --> 00:07:31.405
It'll just be picking at a scab
and making things worse.

00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:34.472
He doesn't even know that?

00:07:34.472 --> 00:07:36.338
- Turn it off.
- You want it louder?

00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:37.838
- Are you deaf?
- And my girlfriend...

00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:39.405
I said turn it off, off!

00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:41.272
- Wait a second.
- Turn it off, I said off!

00:07:41.272 --> 00:07:42.672
Off! Off! Turn it off!

00:07:42.672 --> 00:07:46.138
If you keep yelling, I get tense,
and it won't work.

00:07:46.138 --> 00:07:48.472
- Ugh, seriously.
- There.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.872
So, to sum it up,

00:07:54.872 --> 00:07:59.672
Option A, where a thrilling
new love arrives with ale beer,

00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:01.872
and Option B, a familiar yet fluttering

00:08:01.872 --> 00:08:04.272
male-friend and female-friend concept.

00:08:04.272 --> 00:08:06.838
We have to choose between the two, right?

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:10.438
Content about male and female
best friends is trending these days,

00:08:10.438 --> 00:08:14.238
but which one best fits
our concept is the key.

00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:16.405
That ticklish feeling coming from familiarity

00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:18.538
might actually be perfect for us.

00:08:18.538 --> 00:08:21.105
What's fluttering,
and what's perfect, exactly?

00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:22.772
Isn't the target audience too narrow?

00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:24.172
For a mass-market advertisement,

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:27.305
would people without an opposite-sex
best friend even drink our beer?

00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:30.005
I think Option A, a new love coming your way,

00:08:30.005 --> 00:08:32.772
seems more realistic and much better.

00:08:35.813 --> 00:08:38.538
Let's take a short break now.

00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:46.372
I also vote for Option A
about new love coming your way.

00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:53.605
Option A is good.

00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:56.038

00:09:26.372 --> 00:09:27.405
Oh, that day?

00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:28.738
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you.

00:09:28.738 --> 00:09:29.938
Something urgent came up.

00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:31.338
It's okay.

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:36.338
Plenty of pregnant women
go to the hospital alone.

00:09:36.338 --> 00:09:38.505
Alone?

00:09:38.505 --> 00:09:41.038
That very, very urgent matter.

00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.072
Did it get resolved?

00:09:43.072 --> 00:09:46.305
Yes, it was something I could handle alone,

00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:49.105
so you don't need to worry about it.

00:09:54.872 --> 00:09:57.372
I have a meeting, so I'll get going.

00:09:58.838 --> 00:10:02.472
What? He even set a condition
just to go together.

00:10:02.472 --> 00:10:04.572
This is ridiculous.

00:10:30.405 --> 00:10:32.405
Is she hiding the fact
that they went together?

00:10:32.405 --> 00:10:34.205
Why bother?

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:40.638

Isn't dinner Korean food tonight?

00:10:47.905 --> 00:10:50.085
- Yeah.
- Seems right.

00:10:50.705 --> 00:10:52.438
- It's seaweed soup.
- Seaweed soup?

00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:53.605
It's good.

00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:13.572
Show me the pictures of our Yeol Mu.

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:15.872
Friends really are the best.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.038
[President Kang Du Jun]

00:11:19.038 --> 00:11:20.438
[President Kang Du Jun]

00:11:20.438 --> 00:11:21.438
Oh my, what do I do?

00:11:21.438 --> 00:11:23.172
- What?
- What?

00:11:23.172 --> 00:11:24.772
- What?
- It's nothing.

00:11:24.772 --> 00:11:26.672
- It's really nothing.
- I guess she doesn't like seaweed soup.

00:11:26.672 --> 00:11:28.905
- Huh?
- Seems she doesn't like seaweed soup.

00:11:33.138 --> 00:11:34.672
[President Kang Du Jun]
What, read and ignored?

00:11:34.672 --> 00:11:35.938
Did he read it and ignore me?

00:11:35.938 --> 00:11:37.838
- Ignored it?
- Huh?

00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:39.038
- But it's Korean food?
- Ignore?

00:11:39.038 --> 00:11:42.538
Ah... nothing.

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:47.972
[Jang Hui Won]
My phone's acting weird. The file won't open.

00:11:47.972 --> 00:11:50.505
Sometimes large files take a while to load.

00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:52.072
Wait a bit.

00:11:52.072 --> 00:11:53.805
Yeah?

00:11:55.738 --> 00:11:56.772
- Huh?
- Why?

00:11:56.772 --> 00:11:58.505
[Jang Hui Won]
It changed to deleted message.

00:11:58.505 --> 00:12:00.238
Maybe she sent it by accident.

00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:03.405
Looks like Ms. Hui Won sent it by mistake.

00:12:05.605 --> 00:12:07.738
Who is he texting?

00:12:07.738 --> 00:12:09.938
Was it sent by mistake?

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:12.105
Who was she sending it to?

00:12:12.938 --> 00:12:14.605
I really can't stand this kind of thing.

00:12:14.605 --> 00:12:16.638
Ah, what is it? I'm so curious.

00:12:16.638 --> 00:12:18.072
Should I just ask?

00:12:18.072 --> 00:12:20.172
Ah, whatever.

00:12:30.138 --> 00:12:31.605
Stop making those sounds.

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:34.538
Seriously, we're eating.

00:12:36.933 --> 00:12:38.661
Jeez.

00:12:47.638 --> 00:12:50.838
Should I just ask directly?

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:51.973
[Jang Hui Won]

00:13:00.305 --> 00:13:02.438
Uncle!

00:13:02.438 --> 00:13:04.605
Did something happen with Manager Jang?

00:13:04.605 --> 00:13:05.638
Nothing happened.

00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:08.105
Tell me, so I can decide
whether to help you or not.

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:09.538
You?

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:11.938
I've probably dated
more than you have, Uncle.

00:13:11.938 --> 00:13:15.005
Are you secretly dating
someone behind my back?

00:13:15.672 --> 00:13:19.272
Stop dodging and tell me what's going on!

00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:24.905
Well, could it be

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:28.272
Assistant Manager Cha Min Uk from Sales...

00:13:31.805 --> 00:13:32.805
Forget it.

00:13:32.805 --> 00:13:34.972
Assistant Manager Cha the honey water?

00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:35.972
Honey water?

00:13:35.972 --> 00:13:38.272
He's Manager Jang's friend.

00:13:38.272 --> 00:13:40.238
Don't tell me you're jealous because of him?

00:13:40.238 --> 00:13:42.272
You think I'd really be jealous over him?

00:13:42.272 --> 00:13:44.272
That's ridiculous.

00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:47.038
Uncle, are you jealous?

00:13:47.038 --> 00:13:48.538
Jealous? Don't be absurd.

00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:50.105
I'm Kang Du Jun.

00:13:50.105 --> 00:13:51.105
Would I really sink to jealousy?

00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:53.205
Yeah, right. No way.

00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:56.738
No matter what, you're
still the baby's father.

00:14:09.972 --> 00:14:12.072
The more I think about it,
the more absurd it is.

00:14:12.072 --> 00:14:14.572
How could he see that photo and not reply?

00:14:14.572 --> 00:14:16.238
Maybe he didn't see the photo.

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:18.338
[Mi Ran]
You said you deleted it right away.

00:14:19.505 --> 00:14:21.038
I saw him checking his phone!

00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:22.538
Huh?

00:14:22.538 --> 00:14:26.538
Do you realize you've been talking
nonstop about your president?

00:14:26.538 --> 00:14:27.672
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:14:27.672 --> 00:14:30.272
Why are you so upset?

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:32.272
You always push things like that.

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:34.272
No, you're feeling upset now.

00:14:34.272 --> 00:14:36.405
But do you know why that is?

00:14:36.405 --> 00:14:38.572
Because you had expectations.

00:14:38.572 --> 00:14:41.738
The higher your expectations,
the greater the disappointment.

00:14:41.738 --> 00:14:44.205
Oh, that's...

00:14:44.205 --> 00:14:49.672
I was curious, but he acted
clueless. So I was baffled.

00:14:49.672 --> 00:14:50.838
Oh, please.

00:14:50.838 --> 00:14:53.838
Anyway, I got my bonus. I'll treat.

00:14:53.838 --> 00:14:55.605
Let's go eat something good with Min Uk.

00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:57.305
With Min Uk?

00:14:58.205 --> 00:15:00.405
I haven't been feeling well lately.

00:15:00.405 --> 00:15:03.038
I'm fine. Just treat Min Uk
to something nice.

00:15:03.038 --> 00:15:04.705
Yeah? Alright.

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:06.438
Take good care of yourself.

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:09.005
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:13.105
Why do I feel like she's avoiding me?

00:15:24.372 --> 00:15:27.238
Whether you regret having the baby
or cry over a man,

00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:28.238
would you even listen if I stopped you?

00:15:28.238 --> 00:15:30.005
It's your life, so you handle it now.

00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:31.038
I'm staying out of it.

00:15:31.038 --> 00:15:32.772

Yes, Professor.

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.138
Today?

00:15:53.138 --> 00:15:55.405
Oh no, what should I do?

00:15:56.938 --> 00:15:59.772
I'm not feeling well.

00:15:59.772 --> 00:16:02.772
Yes, I should be fine by then.

00:16:03.738 --> 00:16:07.138
We can have a meal then.

00:16:07.138 --> 00:16:09.272
Yes, thank you.

00:16:21.638 --> 00:16:23.238
Any plans after work today?

00:16:23.238 --> 00:16:25.305
Attention everyone!

00:16:25.305 --> 00:16:29.005
You know we have early dismissal
today for Culture Day?

00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:30.172
Yes!

00:16:30.172 --> 00:16:34.772
So I'm thinking of treating
everyone to some pork belly!

00:16:36.805 --> 00:16:39.538
- Manager Nah?
- Oh, I'd love to join but...

00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:42.705
My wife said if I don't get
an early dismissal, she'll divorce me today.

00:16:43.338 --> 00:16:46.772
Manager Nah has three kids, so he's out!

00:16:50.638 --> 00:16:53.805
I have a date today.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.005
Date?

00:16:55.005 --> 00:16:56.805
I booked a one-day class today.

00:16:56.805 --> 00:16:58.238
Oh, that knitting thing you've been learning?

00:16:58.238 --> 00:17:00.338
Yes, today we're knitting baby hats.

00:17:00.338 --> 00:17:02.238
Manager, want me to knit hats for your kids?

00:17:02.238 --> 00:17:03.605
Nah, my kids have big heads.

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:04.705
Can't make one in a day anyway.

00:17:04.705 --> 00:17:06.205
- Must take after their dad.
- Then, me!

00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:07.372
- Just knit one for me.
- Assistant Manager.

00:17:07.372 --> 00:17:09.072
- I clearly said baby hats...
- So,

00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:11.405
everyone's busy, is that it?

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.972
- Yes.
- Well then...

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:17.305
- Me?
- It's not like

00:17:17.305 --> 00:17:20.372
I have too much time, or I'm lonely...

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:22.172
No!

00:17:22.172 --> 00:17:24.838
Manager Jang has plans with me today.

00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:33.572
I already have plans.

00:17:35.738 --> 00:17:38.538
Honey water?

00:17:38.538 --> 00:17:40.405
As if he's some kind of hangover remedy.

00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:49.505
Mr. honey water, what brings you here?

00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:51.238
Pardon?

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:54.405
No, Assistant Manager Cha Min Uk,
what brings you here?

00:17:54.405 --> 00:17:57.705
I'm not exactly free enough
to meet you one-on-one, you know.

00:17:57.705 --> 00:17:58.972
Who let you in?

00:17:58.972 --> 00:18:00.238
Without even telling me?

00:18:00.238 --> 00:18:02.338
It's me. Didn't you have him do something?

00:18:02.338 --> 00:18:04.338
He's just brought it
after finishing everything.

00:18:04.338 --> 00:18:05.605
- The task I assigned?
- Last time,

00:18:05.605 --> 00:18:08.405
you told me to redo the report, didn't you?

00:18:13.285 --> 00:18:14.605
[Purpose of Client Visit
and Summary of Key Activities]

00:18:14.605 --> 00:18:16.838
I had high expectations,
but it's quite disappointing.

00:18:16.838 --> 00:18:19.938
If you tell me exactly what's wrong,

00:18:19.938 --> 00:18:21.172
I'll fix it and bring it back.

00:18:21.172 --> 00:18:23.972
No, I don't think it'll change
even if you redo it. No need.

00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:25.572
Here, something warm.

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:27.305
- What is it?
- It's honey water.

00:18:27.305 --> 00:18:28.905
- Honey water?
- This honey water

00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:31.272
is mixed to a perfect golden ratio.

00:18:31.272 --> 00:18:33.072
Do you think I have time
for a leisurely tea break right now?

00:18:33.072 --> 00:18:36.305
I absolutely won't drink it. Honey water.

00:18:37.138 --> 00:18:38.738
I'm fine too.

00:18:38.738 --> 00:18:42.072
Well then, if there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

00:18:42.072 --> 00:18:44.938
I need to stop by the New Product
Development Team briefly.

00:18:44.938 --> 00:18:49.705
Aren't you visiting the New Product
Development Team way too often?

00:18:49.705 --> 00:18:52.672
Sales and New Product Development

00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:54.338
are inseparable, you know.

00:18:54.338 --> 00:18:56.038
I guess you didn't know.

00:18:56.738 --> 00:18:57.772
Oh, wait.

00:18:57.772 --> 00:19:01.772
I just remembered something
I need Assistant Manager Cha to do.

00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:04.272
Secretary Go, remember
what I mentioned earlier?

00:19:04.272 --> 00:19:05.938
Tell Assistant Manager Cha
exactly what I said.

00:19:05.938 --> 00:19:09.205
About what? I don't know anything about it.

00:19:10.372 --> 00:19:11.872
You know, that thing.

00:19:11.872 --> 00:19:12.872
That?

00:19:12.872 --> 00:19:14.638
That one, that one?

00:19:17.405 --> 00:19:20.038
Oh, that?

00:19:23.905 --> 00:19:26.672
Ugh, I'm so tired of this, really.

00:19:26.672 --> 00:19:29.105
Ugh, neither of them is a kid.

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:34.905
Emergency! Let's meet up.

00:19:53.138 --> 00:19:54.838
Something's off between them?

00:19:54.838 --> 00:19:58.272
Yes, there's definitely
some problem between them.

00:19:58.272 --> 00:20:00.172
It's kind of awkward.

00:20:00.172 --> 00:20:01.705
Come to think of it,

00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:04.038
Du Jun seemed in a bad mood yesterday too.

00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:05.872
He got annoyed over nothing.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:08.772
Am I serving a president
or raising a grumpy seven-year-old?

00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:12.105
Right? Manager Jang seemed
a bit more down than usual.

00:20:12.105 --> 00:20:13.672
Yeah.

00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.372
So what are we going to do?
Do you have a plan?

00:20:16.372 --> 00:20:17.505
I'll have to make one now.

00:20:17.505 --> 00:20:20.405
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:20:20.405 --> 00:20:22.905
Just in case, I made plans
with Manager after work.

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:24.138
Yeah?

00:20:24.138 --> 00:20:26.572
Something we can help with.

00:20:28.905 --> 00:20:31.805
I've matched quite a few couples in my time.

00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:33.772
Boom.

00:20:33.772 --> 00:20:35.672
Love's Cupid, shall I try it again?

00:20:35.672 --> 00:20:37.838
Oh, Cupid?

00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:39.972
That sounds fun.

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.938
Oh, how about this?

00:20:45.253 --> 00:20:47.038
Oh, that's perfect!

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.138
Let's just get those two together properly.

00:20:49.138 --> 00:20:50.505
Then let's meet there later, okay?

00:33:49.472 --> 00:33:51.172
Well...

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.905
Because you're an exceptional employee.

00:34:07.238 --> 00:34:08.938
Team Leader Bang.

00:34:23.838 --> 00:34:27.572
I came because I'm curious
about something, Jang Hui Won.

00:34:27.572 --> 00:34:29.172
Yes, go ahead.

00:34:29.172 --> 00:34:31.372
So that day at the hospital,

00:34:31.372 --> 00:34:33.472
- Cha...
- Cha?

00:34:35.238 --> 00:34:37.405
That day at the hospital, Cha...

00:34:37.405 --> 00:34:40.572
Cha... ah, what am I even saying?

00:34:40.572 --> 00:34:43.038
- Cha...
- Min Uk!

00:34:46.805 --> 00:34:48.538
You've been waiting long, right?

00:34:48.538 --> 00:34:49.672
No.

00:34:49.672 --> 00:34:52.638
Time flew by while I was thinking about you.

00:34:52.638 --> 00:34:56.038
Me too. Thinking of you,
the whole day just went by.

00:34:56.038 --> 00:34:58.538
Ah, come on, what are you saying?

00:34:58.538 --> 00:35:00.037
What are you two doing?

00:35:00.037 --> 00:35:04.538
Oh, I confessed to Hui Won.

00:35:04.538 --> 00:35:06.338
And we decided to date.

00:35:06.338 --> 00:35:07.972
- What?
- What are you doing before the President?

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.472
Why, why!

00:35:09.472 --> 00:35:11.172
So what?

00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:13.238
President, you will congratulate us, right?

00:35:13.238 --> 00:35:14.238
You will congratulate us, won't you?

00:35:14.238 --> 00:35:18.238
Man to man.

00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:23.205
When, where, and how?

00:35:23.205 --> 00:35:24.272
Why, why?

00:35:24.272 --> 00:35:25.638
We have a date,

00:35:25.638 --> 00:35:27.305
so I guess we should head off now.

00:35:27.305 --> 00:35:29.305
Well then.

00:35:29.305 --> 00:35:30.805
No, Jang Hui Won.

00:35:30.805 --> 00:35:32.772
Jang Hui Won, wait a moment!

00:35:32.772 --> 00:35:34.605
- Hui Won, wait!
- What should we do today?

00:35:34.605 --> 00:35:35.738
Wait!

00:35:35.738 --> 00:35:38.972
Stop right there!

00:35:44.453 --> 00:35:46.053
Jeez.

00:35:46.738 --> 00:35:48.472
What good is just thinking about it?

00:35:48.472 --> 00:35:51.072
You won't even be able to ask properly.

00:35:52.038 --> 00:35:53.317
[Si Hyeong]

00:35:55.505 --> 00:35:56.605
Yeah, Si Hyeong. What's up?

00:35:56.605 --> 00:36:00.205
Du Jun, you know the day
the chairman collapsed?

00:36:10.538 --> 00:36:12.638
What brings you here? Coming at lunchtime?

00:36:12.638 --> 00:36:13.705
I was just in the area.

00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:15.238
I came by to treat you
to something delicious.

00:36:15.238 --> 00:36:17.172
Oh, that's kinda touching.

00:36:17.172 --> 00:36:18.172
Ah, by the way,

00:36:18.172 --> 00:36:19.872
is grandfather doing okay?

00:36:19.872 --> 00:36:23.072
The best medical team
is caring for him in real time.

00:36:23.072 --> 00:36:24.172
You don't need to worry.

00:36:24.172 --> 00:36:28.138
Still, I should give him a call.

00:36:29.072 --> 00:36:30.738
How's work?

00:36:30.738 --> 00:36:31.805
Nothing special, right?

00:36:31.805 --> 00:36:34.372
- Yeah.
- You should be done

00:36:34.372 --> 00:36:36.805
with your internship by now.

00:36:38.072 --> 00:36:39.372
So that's the real point.

00:36:39.372 --> 00:36:43.172
Your father started directly
in management at your age.

00:36:43.172 --> 00:36:46.205
You said Dad
had management training even earlier.

00:36:46.205 --> 00:36:48.605
So it's already late for you.

00:36:49.338 --> 00:36:52.172
Why did your grandfather insist
on leaving Taehan Liquor,

00:36:52.172 --> 00:36:55.105
which isn't even a holding company,
to your uncle?

00:36:55.105 --> 00:36:56.838
Eventually,

00:36:58.405 --> 00:37:00.938
this place is the golden egg.

00:37:09.705 --> 00:37:11.672
- Father.
- Yes.

00:37:11.672 --> 00:37:12.672
Have you eaten?

00:37:12.672 --> 00:37:14.172
Yeah, I have.

00:37:14.172 --> 00:37:15.972
I brought some samgyetang.

00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:17.938
It's quite good when energy is low.

00:37:17.938 --> 00:37:21.838
Wow, your mother would love this.

00:37:28.205 --> 00:37:30.405
Oh, would you like some tea too?

00:37:30.405 --> 00:37:33.038
I heard my sister-in-law came that day?

00:37:33.038 --> 00:37:35.605
Yeah, she sometimes comes to have tea.

00:37:35.605 --> 00:37:38.605
You're always lenient with her.

00:37:38.605 --> 00:37:41.172
So, what did you talk about that day?

00:37:49.438 --> 00:37:51.338
I'm sorry.

00:37:51.338 --> 00:37:52.438
I'm sorry.

00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:54.238
It's okay.

00:37:59.138 --> 00:38:03.238
Are you still taking medicine these days?

00:38:03.238 --> 00:38:04.872
I stopped.

00:38:04.872 --> 00:38:06.757
For things that could be

00:38:06.757 --> 00:38:08.738
used against you in the board,

00:38:08.738 --> 00:38:11.705
you shouldn't let anyone see or catch them.

00:38:11.705 --> 00:38:15.138
You know it's easy to exploit
your psychiatric history as a weakness, yes?

00:38:15.138 --> 00:38:18.472
Why don't you just quietly
get treatment in the U.S. like last time?

00:38:18.472 --> 00:38:20.872
No, I won't run away anymore.

00:38:20.872 --> 00:38:23.772
There won't be anything for you
to worry about anymore.

00:38:25.005 --> 00:38:27.238
I'll get going.

00:38:35.805 --> 00:38:37.105
Has he already left?

00:38:37.105 --> 00:38:41.305
Oh, he dropped by to give me this.

00:38:41.305 --> 00:38:43.305
But still,

00:38:43.305 --> 00:38:47.172
I was gonna bring up
the blind date while he was here.

00:38:58.972 --> 00:39:00.261
Oh.

00:39:01.093 --> 00:39:02.917
Oh.

00:39:08.505 --> 00:39:11.005
So, what you are saying is...

00:39:11.005 --> 00:39:12.472
I mean,

00:39:12.472 --> 00:39:15.505
let's set up your daughter with my son.

00:39:15.505 --> 00:39:17.505
- What?
- Our Du Jun

00:39:17.505 --> 00:39:19.538
may only focus on work,

00:39:19.538 --> 00:39:21.405
but he's not lacking in anything.

00:39:21.405 --> 00:39:23.838
Of course. I know that.

00:39:23.838 --> 00:39:26.738
But why did you choose Mi Ran

00:39:26.738 --> 00:39:29.738
as a match for such a precious son?

00:39:29.738 --> 00:39:32.638
First, her gentle way of speaking.

00:39:32.638 --> 00:39:35.038
You've really raised her well.

00:39:35.038 --> 00:39:37.705
My Mi Ran?

00:39:37.705 --> 00:39:43.272
You've actually talked with Mi Ran, right?

00:39:43.272 --> 00:39:45.705
They say one detail speaks volumes.

00:39:45.705 --> 00:39:50.638
Even after just a few words,
I was completely charmed.

00:39:52.972 --> 00:39:55.072
You're here early?

00:39:55.872 --> 00:39:57.772
You're really teaming up
with me for the contest?

00:39:57.772 --> 00:40:00.105
There are plenty of
talented people, but why me?

00:40:00.105 --> 00:40:04.105
Manager Nah was just bragging
to his son via video call earlier.

00:40:05.038 --> 00:40:08.338
It's not anyone else.

00:40:08.338 --> 00:40:11.338
Our team's ace offered to work together.

00:40:11.338 --> 00:40:12.872
Oh, Manager Nah.

00:40:12.872 --> 00:40:14.572
You're competent,

00:40:14.572 --> 00:40:15.738
and you have great drive.

00:40:15.738 --> 00:40:18.638
While I prefer niche challenges,

00:40:18.638 --> 00:40:22.172
you always consider
public appeal and marketability.

00:40:22.172 --> 00:40:24.738
We're going win-win together.

00:40:24.738 --> 00:40:26.238
Come on, fighting!

00:40:26.238 --> 00:40:28.072
We can do it!

00:40:28.072 --> 00:40:31.105
So, I've lined up someone
I think you will really like.

00:40:31.105 --> 00:40:34.905
A fresh perspective and vision
that our team doesn't have!

00:40:34.905 --> 00:40:37.038
He should be here any minute now.

00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:40.705
You're here!

00:40:56.638 --> 00:40:58.105
Assistant Manager Cha is joining too?

00:40:58.105 --> 00:40:59.838
We didn't invite him at first,

00:40:59.838 --> 00:41:01.872
but anyway, that's how it turned out.

00:41:01.872 --> 00:41:04.638
He never leaves Manager Jang's side.

00:41:04.638 --> 00:41:07.172
We're going to Gapyeong soon for research.

00:41:07.172 --> 00:41:09.338
It's a craft brewery Manager Jang knows well.

00:41:09.338 --> 00:41:11.072
Gapyeong?

00:41:12.605 --> 00:41:15.872
Hui Won knows good places. Smells great.

00:41:15.872 --> 00:41:18.705
Welcome.

00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:19.738
Cha Min Uk!

00:41:19.738 --> 00:41:21.205
Oh? Mi Ran.

00:41:21.205 --> 00:41:22.338
What? You came alone?

00:41:22.338 --> 00:41:24.305
Yeah, I was just getting takeout.

00:41:24.305 --> 00:41:25.637
Then let's eat together.

00:41:25.637 --> 00:41:28.872
I had a company dinner today,

00:41:28.872 --> 00:41:32.997
but Hui Won left early feeling sick.

00:41:32.997 --> 00:41:34.789
Oh.

00:41:35.805 --> 00:41:37.272
Hey, at least you answer my messages.

00:41:37.272 --> 00:41:38.305
It's not like I'm gonna get you or something.

00:41:38.305 --> 00:41:40.005
I did, just now.

00:41:40.005 --> 00:41:41.905
Just now?

00:41:41.905 --> 00:41:43.738
That's early.

00:41:44.672 --> 00:41:46.772
Ugh, I lost my appetite.

00:41:46.772 --> 00:41:48.638
I'll just get takeout too.

00:41:48.638 --> 00:41:50.172
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

00:41:50.172 --> 00:41:51.372
One more for takeout, please.

00:41:51.372 --> 00:41:54.005
- Okay.
- You're buying.

00:41:55.005 --> 00:41:56.738
What?

00:41:59.005 --> 00:42:00.605
Buy it for me too.

00:42:00.605 --> 00:42:02.338
You owe me a lot.

00:42:02.338 --> 00:42:05.305
You're always so slow to reply,
it's driving me nuts.

00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:07.938
Just because I confessed once,
you treat me like a stranger.

00:42:07.938 --> 00:42:10.105
That's all debt. How will you repay it?

00:42:10.105 --> 00:42:11.805
You're buying.

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:25.272
Annoying, seriously annoying.

00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:31.938
- You're home.
- Ah, you scared me.

00:42:31.938 --> 00:42:33.038
Dad!

00:42:33.038 --> 00:42:35.905
I told you not to barge in when I'm not here.

00:42:35.905 --> 00:42:39.305
Do you really have to see your daughter
with a guy like that to finally wake up?

00:42:39.305 --> 00:42:40.305
Okay.

00:42:40.305 --> 00:42:41.838
That's not the point.

00:42:41.838 --> 00:42:44.072
Are you seeing anyone these days?

00:42:46.038 --> 00:42:47.205
Dad.

00:42:47.205 --> 00:42:51.272
Don't try to benefit from your daughter,
just remarry yourself.

00:42:51.272 --> 00:42:52.638
Just go on this one blind date,

00:42:52.638 --> 00:42:55.272
I promise I won't touch
any of your inheritance.

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:57.305
And I'll reactivate your credit card.

00:42:57.305 --> 00:42:59.972
Quit working at that unprofitable hotel too.

00:42:59.972 --> 00:43:02.138
Really? What's this about?

00:43:02.138 --> 00:43:03.505
Is the family decent?

00:43:03.505 --> 00:43:06.205
Oh, it's beyond decent.

00:43:06.205 --> 00:43:09.938
First, make sure to keep it
a secret that her date is

00:43:09.938 --> 00:43:11.705
the second son of Taehan Group.

00:43:11.705 --> 00:43:13.405
Knowing him,

00:43:13.405 --> 00:43:16.572
he might back out if he feels pressured.

00:43:16.572 --> 00:43:18.272
Oh, yes.

00:43:18.905 --> 00:43:21.572
Just meet him once, okay?

00:43:25.509 --> 00:43:28.038
- No, I won't.
- Why?

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:31.005
What's the point of another blind date?

00:43:32.938 --> 00:43:35.238
I'm seriously...

00:43:35.238 --> 00:43:36.405
Fine, I'll do it.

00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.538
You mean it?

00:43:37.538 --> 00:43:40.438
Just don't go back on your word
about the inheritance.

00:43:40.438 --> 00:43:42.305
Of course.

00:43:45.272 --> 00:43:47.805
We're going to Gapyeong soon for research.

00:43:47.805 --> 00:43:50.038
It's a craft brewery Manager Jang knows well.

00:43:50.038 --> 00:43:52.838
But how did they end up
in a team for the contest?

00:43:52.838 --> 00:43:56.138
And isn't Gapyeong basically a date spot?

00:43:58.772 --> 00:44:01.672
A date I've never even had.

00:44:06.305 --> 00:44:08.105
- Hello?
- Si Hyeong, are you busy?

00:44:08.105 --> 00:44:09.372
Yeah, really busy.

00:44:09.372 --> 00:44:11.105
I uploaded docs for your approval tomorrow.

00:44:11.105 --> 00:44:13.205
What's my schedule next Monday?

00:44:13.205 --> 00:44:15.438
You called this late just for that?

00:44:15.438 --> 00:44:17.838
It's really important to me, hurry up.

00:44:17.838 --> 00:44:19.972
Ugh, seriously... Wait!

00:44:19.972 --> 00:44:21.938
Well... this...

00:44:21.938 --> 00:44:23.305
Monday.

00:44:23.305 --> 00:44:26.438
Nothing major. Department meetings
in the morning, and...

00:44:26.438 --> 00:44:28.605
Then clear my schedule
if there's nothing urgent.

00:44:28.605 --> 00:44:30.238
Suddenly? Why? Something wrong?

00:44:30.238 --> 00:44:33.005
- I'm hanging up.
- Hello? Wait!

00:44:33.005 --> 00:44:34.705
Hello...

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:37.638
Jeez.

00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:46.072
Oh, this feels more
like a picnic than research.

00:44:46.072 --> 00:44:48.405
Ah, indeed.

00:44:48.405 --> 00:44:51.272
Snacks and water are in the car,

00:44:51.272 --> 00:44:53.205
so just get in comfortably.

00:44:53.205 --> 00:44:58.205
Sales Team really prepares differently.

00:44:58.205 --> 00:44:59.938
Where's Se Hyeon?

00:44:59.938 --> 00:45:03.505
She said she'll print the interview materials
and come out soon.

00:45:04.453 --> 00:45:06.533
Oh.

00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:08.672
I'll go to the bathroom one last time.

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:10.572
Sure.

00:45:14.172 --> 00:45:15.638
Hey, Hui Won.

00:45:15.638 --> 00:45:18.572
- Huh?
- Am I making you uncomfortable?

00:45:22.138 --> 00:45:24.472
I was a bit worried

00:45:24.472 --> 00:45:26.341
that maybe

00:45:26.341 --> 00:45:27.738
my confession that day

00:45:27.738 --> 00:45:29.029
has become a burden to you.

00:45:29.029 --> 00:45:33.205
No, not at all.

00:45:34.305 --> 00:45:36.272
You can take your time
to think about the answer.

00:45:36.272 --> 00:45:38.338
But during the contest,

00:45:38.338 --> 00:45:41.405
just treat me normally like before.

00:45:42.638 --> 00:45:44.338
Okay.

00:46:02.725 --> 00:46:03.772
Ouch.

00:46:03.772 --> 00:46:06.638
The straight route is great, but you're
turning too sharply at the corners.

00:46:06.638 --> 00:46:09.172
I told you about my back.

00:46:20.505 --> 00:46:24.572
- President!
- Even better seeing you all here.

00:46:28.272 --> 00:46:29.472
What brings you here?

00:46:29.472 --> 00:46:31.705
I had some business nearby,
killed two birds with one stone.

00:46:31.705 --> 00:46:35.105
All the way to Gapyeong?

00:46:35.105 --> 00:46:39.205
The owner probably expects
only approved staff to visit today.

00:46:39.205 --> 00:46:41.472
I think the owner would be happier

00:46:41.472 --> 00:46:44.172
seeing me than you, Assistant Manager Cha.

00:46:46.572 --> 00:46:48.705
Why are you acting like this?

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:52.238
I'll explain properly to the owner.

00:46:52.238 --> 00:46:53.472
Oh, you're here?

00:46:53.472 --> 00:46:54.538
Oh, sir.

00:46:54.538 --> 00:46:56.205
This is the brewery owner.

00:46:56.205 --> 00:46:59.638
Thanks for coming all this way.

00:46:59.638 --> 00:47:00.705
Not at all.

00:47:00.705 --> 00:47:03.905
As I mentioned, please take
good care of our staff today.

00:47:03.905 --> 00:47:06.305
Let's talk in private when this is over.

00:47:06.305 --> 00:47:07.472
Yes, let's do that.

00:47:07.472 --> 00:47:08.905
Shall we go then?

00:47:08.905 --> 00:47:10.638
Yes.

00:47:16.038 --> 00:47:17.138
Well,

00:47:17.138 --> 00:47:18.305
shall we join them?

00:47:18.305 --> 00:47:19.505
Yeah.

00:47:19.505 --> 00:47:22.038
Let's go.

00:47:24.138 --> 00:47:26.738
On the way here,

00:47:26.738 --> 00:47:29.438
you saw the Texas-style
smoked barbecue place.

00:47:29.438 --> 00:47:32.505
And here, we have our craft beer...

00:47:32.505 --> 00:47:35.105
President, what brings you here?

00:47:35.105 --> 00:47:36.872
I came to see you.

00:47:36.872 --> 00:47:38.438
- What?
- Heard they have

00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:40.997
the best beer in town.

00:47:40.997 --> 00:47:42.338
Oh.

00:47:42.338 --> 00:47:45.272
So that's how it is.

00:47:48.405 --> 00:47:52.338
If you need any particular beer
or have any questions, just let me know.

00:47:52.338 --> 00:47:55.238
Our craft beer is real draft beer,

00:47:55.238 --> 00:47:57.172
with live yeast.

00:47:57.172 --> 00:47:59.838
I'll set it up right away.

00:47:59.838 --> 00:48:03.038
If you could pay more attention
to my staff than me.

00:48:03.038 --> 00:48:05.205
They'll call if they need anything.

00:48:06.038 --> 00:48:07.738
Shall we go?

00:48:09.638 --> 00:48:11.572
I heard the President
proposed the collaboration,

00:48:11.572 --> 00:48:13.672
and somehow we seem a bit sidelined.

00:48:13.672 --> 00:48:14.672
I know, right?

00:48:14.672 --> 00:48:17.505
I wish the President had come another day.

00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:19.372
Oh, don't be like that here.

00:48:19.372 --> 00:48:20.838
Let's go try some beer.

00:48:20.838 --> 00:48:21.972
I heard it's really good. Hurry up.

00:48:21.972 --> 00:48:23.605
Alright, let's go.

00:48:23.605 --> 00:48:25.938
Let's see how fresh it is.

00:48:30.805 --> 00:48:34.438
Unlike mass-produced beer from conglomerates,

00:48:34.438 --> 00:48:36.838
our craft beer's hallmark is its live yeast.

00:48:36.838 --> 00:48:40.172
This mash tun mixes malt and water,

00:48:40.172 --> 00:48:45.138
saccharifying them
at 60 to 80 degrees Celsius.

00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:21.061
[Barley]

00:49:23.172 --> 00:49:24.938
You gonna try non-alcoholic?

00:49:24.938 --> 00:49:26.672
Huh?

00:49:28.038 --> 00:49:30.338
Not just for pregnant women,
but for non-drinkers too.

00:49:30.338 --> 00:49:34.072
It'd be great if they could
enjoy beer happily.

00:49:34.072 --> 00:49:35.405
That's a good idea. I'm all for it.

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.738
Let's all discuss it after research.

00:49:37.738 --> 00:49:39.938
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:49:39.938 --> 00:49:41.705
Thanks.

00:49:41.705 --> 00:49:44.305
How's your research going?

00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:51.301
Now here it is...

00:49:57.972 --> 00:50:00.138
Grill it properly, please.

00:50:03.938 --> 00:50:06.372
I confessed to Hui Won.

00:50:06.372 --> 00:50:08.772
Why are you telling me this now?

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:10.605
Because I want to do it fairly.

00:50:10.605 --> 00:50:13.672
Unlike someone who created
a fake schedule just to follow her.

00:50:13.672 --> 00:50:17.305
Even knowing Hui Won's situation,
you still said that?

00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:19.772
Yes, I'm fully aware.

00:50:19.772 --> 00:50:22.205
And confident I can handle it.

00:50:22.205 --> 00:50:26.872
If you do know, you should understand
this isn't just her problem.

00:50:26.872 --> 00:50:31.238
To me, it just looks like
you're clinging to the past.

00:50:32.105 --> 00:50:33.138
I don't care.

00:50:33.138 --> 00:50:35.005
As long as Hui Won's okay with it.

00:50:35.005 --> 00:50:37.338
And let's be honest,

00:50:37.338 --> 00:50:39.538
I think the one caught between

00:50:39.538 --> 00:50:41.938
is you, not me.

00:50:48.072 --> 00:50:49.838
- Hui Won.
- Huh?

00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:52.172
- Give it to me.
- Thanks.

00:50:52.172 --> 00:50:54.738
Since you like bell peppers,
I prepared a lot of them.

00:50:54.738 --> 00:50:56.438
Really?

00:50:57.672 --> 00:50:59.672
- Did you wash all of this?
- Yeah.

00:51:08.338 --> 00:51:12.005
- These too?
- Yeah, washed them with the peppers.

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:17.405
Look, ta-da!

00:51:17.405 --> 00:51:19.372
Wow, amazing.

00:51:22.438 --> 00:51:25.005
President, we prepared a small event.

00:51:25.005 --> 00:51:26.838
- Pretty.
- Me?

00:51:26.838 --> 00:51:28.538
Thank you.

00:51:29.672 --> 00:51:32.272
Hui Won, here.

00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:35.238
Oh.

00:51:35.238 --> 00:51:37.405
I could peel it myself.

00:51:37.405 --> 00:51:40.605
You never eat shrimp
because peeling them is a hassle.

00:51:40.605 --> 00:51:41.805
I'll do it.

00:51:41.805 --> 00:51:44.438
Wow, what does peeling shrimp mean?

00:51:44.438 --> 00:51:45.738
It's love!

00:51:45.738 --> 00:51:47.905
Manager Jang, you should
date a man like this!

00:51:47.905 --> 00:51:50.138
Oh, please!

00:51:50.138 --> 00:51:53.472
I peeled enough for everyone, try some.

00:51:53.472 --> 00:51:54.538
Please eat, here you go.

00:51:54.538 --> 00:51:56.238
Thank you.

00:51:57.172 --> 00:51:58.905
President.

00:52:00.438 --> 00:52:02.938
How was the beer? How was it?

00:52:02.938 --> 00:52:04.372
It was really good, amazing.

00:52:04.372 --> 00:52:06.605
Was it good?

00:52:06.605 --> 00:52:10.672
It's bitter yet sweet.

00:52:13.538 --> 00:52:15.805
Did I go too far?

00:52:17.472 --> 00:52:19.472
Manager, have this.

00:52:26.938 --> 00:52:28.638
President.

00:52:32.005 --> 00:52:34.705
What are you doing here?

00:52:34.705 --> 00:52:36.872
The night air's great,

00:52:36.872 --> 00:52:40.305
and the night sky is so pretty.

00:52:41.438 --> 00:52:45.338
You barely ate. Let's go, everyone's waiting.

00:52:45.338 --> 00:52:47.138
What about you, Hui Won?

00:52:48.072 --> 00:52:51.638
Not anyone else. Were you waiting for me?

00:52:51.638 --> 00:52:53.372
Pardon?

00:52:55.905 --> 00:52:58.905
Actually, I went to the OB-GYN that day.

00:52:58.905 --> 00:53:01.872
I saw you with Mr. Cha Min Uk.

00:53:02.605 --> 00:53:06.972
I always thought I was the one you needed.

00:53:06.972 --> 00:53:11.538
But today, I suddenly realized maybe I'm not.

00:53:11.538 --> 00:53:14.738
- President.
- I told you this before.

00:53:14.738 --> 00:53:16.172
I'll do as you wish.

00:53:16.172 --> 00:53:20.305
Whoever your heart belongs to,
it's none of my business.

00:53:20.305 --> 00:53:22.972
But I do expect us both
to take responsibility for our actions.

00:53:22.972 --> 00:53:26.338
Whoever you have feelings for, I don't care.

00:53:26.338 --> 00:53:29.272
I'll keep moving forward regardless.

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:32.338
Whether it's one night or 15 years,
I don't care about that.

00:53:32.338 --> 00:53:34.105
You do what you want.

00:53:34.105 --> 00:53:37.438
I'll protect you two in my own way.

00:53:38.305 --> 00:53:41.738
I'll go ahead. Be careful on your way.

00:54:22.572 --> 00:54:25.438
[President Kang Du Jun]

00:54:28.038 --> 00:54:30.638
You do what you want.

00:54:30.638 --> 00:54:34.072
I'll protect you two in my own way.

00:54:43.405 --> 00:54:45.472
What I said earlier...

00:54:47.272 --> 00:54:49.705
How's your research going?

00:54:50.373 --> 00:54:52.038
Since you like bell peppers...

00:54:52.038 --> 00:54:54.172
I think the one caught between

00:54:54.172 --> 00:54:56.472
is you, not me.

00:54:58.533 --> 00:54:59.653
[Jang Hui Won]

00:55:10.838 --> 00:55:13.505
The draft beer there was insane!

00:55:13.505 --> 00:55:15.038
It's not that the beer yeast is alive,

00:55:15.038 --> 00:55:17.205
[Seriously]
it was seriously alive.

00:55:17.205 --> 00:55:18.838
I was drinking like crazy
and almost got wasted!

00:55:18.838 --> 00:55:20.638
He really was drinking nonstop.

00:55:20.638 --> 00:55:21.805
Right? I drank a lot, didn't I?

00:55:21.805 --> 00:55:24.638
You didn't go for research but for fun, huh?

00:55:24.638 --> 00:55:26.438
- Assistant Manager Choi.
- I heard from Se Hyeon

00:55:26.438 --> 00:55:27.738
that the President came too, huh?

00:55:27.738 --> 00:55:29.905
Yeah, he got out of a car wearing a suit,

00:55:29.905 --> 00:55:31.038
and I thought he was a model.

00:55:31.038 --> 00:55:32.872
People who've modeled are different.

00:55:32.872 --> 00:55:34.538
But it was supposed to be just staff,

00:55:34.538 --> 00:55:37.872
so it must've been a bit awkward
seeing the President, huh?

00:55:37.872 --> 00:55:39.072
I thought it would be awkward for me too.

00:55:39.072 --> 00:55:41.638
But thanks to him, we did
the research comfortably,

00:55:43.938 --> 00:55:45.372
and totally spoiled ourselves.

He seemed really uncomfortable though.

Plus the President really liked me!

I have extraordinary sense, right?

00:55:50.705 --> 00:55:53.172
Your perception is uniquely special.

Right? Isn't that true, Se Hyeon?

00:55:55.672 --> 00:55:57.905
Absolutely. Completely unique.

Se Hyeon's completely deadpan about this.

True, we should ask Manager Jang
who was actually there.

Huh? Where'd Manager Jang go?

00:56:08.705 --> 00:56:09.905
She was here seconds ago.

00:56:09.905 --> 00:56:11.838
Oh, she left with a file earlier.
Guess she has something to report.

00:56:11.838 --> 00:56:13.938
As expected, after visiting
the brewery yesterday,

Manager Jang is full of inspiration again.

Well, that won't do.

Probably a celebrity?

Could be.
