WEBVTT

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.679
Finally became a shining star.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:30.239
But…

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.600
Are you still blaming me?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.560
Do you still remember me?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.400
I've gotten used to this kind of life already.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.280
But some people's presence…

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.000
is just like candy.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.319
You think you've long forgotten how it tastes,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
only to realize…

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:15.120
it's already ingrained in your bones.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.680
Take a deep breath, follow my rhythm.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
When…

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.120
will I finally find you?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.700
"Candy"

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
(Episode 1: No Crying After Candy)

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.719
It's reported that your studio is suspected
of issuing fake invoices.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.159
Lin Can,

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.496
the amount of tax evasion exceeds seven figures.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.159
Is this how you purchased
that limited edition luxury car?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.599
During the tax scandal,

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:34.735
you still showed up publicly.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.080
Tell us,
are you taunting the public?

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.840
And the rumors about you and your agent Si Han...

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.240
the lesbian gossip is everywhere.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.240
Is it true or not?

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.800
Regarding these questions,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.520
the studio will appoint

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.936
a dedicated legal team to handle them.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.400
We cannot disclose specific details.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.599
If you care about Lin
Can's work, how about...

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.159
What about snatching the female lead role
from actress Jiang Wan?

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.159
How do you explain that?

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:51.159
Yeah! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.000
Answer that!

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.560
Answer us!

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.000
You were seen on the new drama set

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.376
being intimate with a married director,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.520
with repeated physical contact.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.319
So…

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.120
are all your leading roles

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.720
obtained through such improper behavior?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.919
I never thought Lin Can was so rotten.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.759
I've wasted all these years supporting her.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:05.759
Everyone, friends from the media,

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.080
regarding these online rumors,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.479
we've prepared statements from our lawyers.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.936
We won't respond to personal questions.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.240
Top star Lin Can flees in guilt!

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.879
Where is she?

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.479
Over there!

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.960
After her!

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.319
Hurry!

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:24.568
(Si Han: When you've gotten
somewhere safe, send your location.

00:03:24.592 --> 00:03:25.407
The company strongly warns you
against responding to the media.)

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
Xiao He.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.039
Come here!

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.439
Nuannuan.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.079
Where are you?

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.240
Sorry, sorry.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.959
Had enough filming?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.720
Filming secretly is a violation of privacy...

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.480
it's illegal.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.360
Want me to call the police?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.600
I...

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.360
What a thorough disguise.

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.279
Let me see

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:53.519
what you've filmed.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.120
I didn't...

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360
I didn't film anything.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.079
I didn't film a thing.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.759
I was just buying groceries and heading home.

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.399
Dressed like that…

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.639
for groceries?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.199
I was just hiding from my landlord.

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:30.720
Oh, right.

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.199
What did you say earlier?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560
You're a celebrity?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.240
You don't know me?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600
My bad.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:40.959
I misunderstood.

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.160
How about…

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360
I give you an autograph?

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.680
No, thanks.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.920
A photo?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160
A photo then?

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.879
No need.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.199
I really don't know you.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720
I'll head back now.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.160
Fine.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680
Don't know me, huh?

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.399
Now you know me?

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.079
I still don't know you.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.000
I'm still going home.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360
Xiao He.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.839
It's so good to see you.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680
But…

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.800
We're not in the same world anymore.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.879
She went into this alley.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.439
After her!

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:34.480
Go that way.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.519
Quick, quick!

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.199
Don't be scared.

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.439
I'll take you away.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.120
Don't be scared.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.639
I'll take you away.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680
Hurry!

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720
We're here.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.639
Go that way.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:26.639
Okay.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.040
So-sorry...

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.519
Did I grip too tight?

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.519
Didn't you say you don't know me?

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.680
Why help me out then?

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:00.439
Give me your phone.

00:08:25.325 --> 00:08:26.325
When did you move back?

00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:28.738
(Three years earlier)

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:30.839
Who are you?

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.840
What are you doing loitering outside my door?

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:35.816
Where's the previous resident here?

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.440
Moved out long ago.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.440
It's my place now.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.639
My aunt sold my house.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.000
I barely managed to rent it back.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:47.199
This was originally your parents' home.

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:48.960
They lived here,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.240
yet dared to sell it?

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.039
Are you a rabbit?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.440
All vegetables.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.799
So skinny.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.080
Don't you eat anything decent?

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:04.399
It's just that…

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:06.360
Wen Nuannuan, open up!

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.240
I know you're home.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.559
Oh no.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.200
The landlord's here for rent.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.559
Open up!

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.559
I'll handle it.

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:12.559
Hurry, open up!

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.120
No need.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.759
You can hide today, but not forever.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.039
I know...

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:16.879
I'll handle it.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:17.600
You just graduated, no job.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.879
Why not just follow me?

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.159
Rent's free.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.600
I'll take you out to eat every day.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:23.799
Who are you?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.240
I'm her creditor.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:26.559
You're a creditor too?

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:27.639
Wen Nuannuan,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.799
how come you owe everyone?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.720
If you don't pay the rent today,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.279
pack your things and get out.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.000
I know...

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.440
you just graduated, no job.

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:35.759
Why not just follow me?

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:36.679
Rent's free.

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:38.039
I'll take you out to eat every day.

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:39.039
You're recording me?

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:40.159
About the rent...

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.159
someone will contact you today to settle it.

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.080
If you harass her again,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.240
this recording

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.679
goes to my lawyer.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.960
Hey, miss...

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.320
let's talk this out nicely.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.399
You're amazing.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
Thank you.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360
But…

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:02.080
when did you become my creditor?

00:10:04.106 --> 00:10:04.625
Huh?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.519
Did you forget everything from before?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.600
Please give me your bank number.

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.559
Once I find a job and save enough,

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:16.840
I'll pay you back the rent.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.200
Wen Nuannuan,

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.440
can you really repay
what you owe me?

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960
Forget it.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.159
Consider it hush money.

00:10:26.617 --> 00:10:27.639
What happened today…

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.279
don't tell anyone.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:33.799
Got it.

00:10:36.733 --> 00:10:37.733
Don't worry.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.279
I won't tell anyone
what happened today.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.600
And in the future, I won't...

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:47.719
I'll send you the location.

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.559
Okay.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.840
See you soon.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:52.919
What did you say?

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:55.679
I said…

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:57.720
I won't bother you in the future either.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200
Bye.

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:07.679
You…

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.919
All grown up and you're
still crying like this?

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200
Isn't it embarrassing?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Alright.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.360
Have some candy.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.480
No more crying.

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:18.200
Xiao He,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.080
let's go!

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:20.159
Coming!

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:23.879
Hurry up.

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:02.720
What's got you so happy?

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.280
Do you still remember
that person I told you about before?

00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:11.039
Your…

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:13.080
never-started, already-over first love?

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:18.799
Don't tell me you…

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.000
Life, huh.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320
Notify HR.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.639
I need a new assistant.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200
Okay.

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:48.399
Wen Nuannuan,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.279
starting today,

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:52.519
your easy days are over.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320
Xiao He,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.200
it was so good to see you.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.200
But we probably won't meet again.

00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:10.541
[*searching up Lin Can*]

00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:16.919
So pretty.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.879
They say she has a big shot backing her.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.135
Otherwise, she'd be finished.

00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:23.039
Can Can's been quietly doing charity all along.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.600
Can't the gossip get any fresher?

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.655
If you don't know the truth,

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.679
don't talk nonsense.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.080
That limited edition motorcycle of hers

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.640
could last a regular person a lifetime.

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:29.960
You worker ants

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.655
shouldn't bother pitying celebrities making millions.

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:33.440
Lin Can and her agent Si Han…

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.559
I could ship that.

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:37.120
They look so good together.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080
But…

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:41.919
it's none of my business.

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:55.679
Star Entertainment.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.399
Isn't that Xiao He's company?

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:01.360
No.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.840
I can't go.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.279
But next month's rent…

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:22.080
I wonder if I'll get hired this time.

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:23.919
But dear God,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.320
please don't let me run into Lin Can.

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.259
[Auntie]

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.120
Hello, Auntie.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.519
Nuannuan, I have some good news.

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.720
Your cousin is getting married.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320
Congratulations to him.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.120
The girl's from the city.

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:55.159
The bride price is 300,000.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.519
As the older sister,

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.816
you should contribute 88,000.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840
Only fair, right?

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:00.720
Auntie,

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:02.279
it's not that I don't want to help,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.200
but I really don't have that kind of money.

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:06.759
Besides, our cousin is so outstanding...

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:08.559
any girl would be lucky to have him.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.120
Why would he need a bride price?

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:11.279
Don't give me that.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.879
Have a conscience.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.480
Since you were little,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.679
how much have we spent on you?

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120
Auntie,

00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:19.559
I really don't have time right now.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.960
Let's talk another day.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.600
I have to go to an interview.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.759
If I don't do well in this interview,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.320
not only can't I give you money,

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:28.480
I might have to rely on you.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.679
Hello?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Auntie?

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.080
Auntie?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.879
Did you see the recent hot searches?

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.879
I heard Lin Can's about to be canceled.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.000
But even in this state,

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.240
I heard she still snatched Jiang Wan's lead role.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.480
Exactly.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.480
It's trending everywhere.

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:08.640
The tag “Lin Can Get Out of Entertainment”

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.720
has over a billion views.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.680
And that gossip about her and her agent Si Han...

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680
is it true or not?

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.599
Don't know.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.480
But honestly, they do look good together.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.559
You all know so much gossip.

00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:19.799
Is it even real?

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:21.400
Who knows?

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.559
But that's what's online.

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:24.559
The way you talk,

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:26.319
I thought you saw it yourselves.

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.799
Wha— what's it to you?

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:30.200
We can say whatever we want.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200
None of your business.

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:33.240
It's not my business.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.759
But I just think…

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.359
you don't need to worry so much.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.319
After all, Lin Can isn't blind.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160
She…

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.599
would never pick any of you as assistants.

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:44.519
Right, little girl?

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:51.400
Lin Can.

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:52.999
She's even more beautiful in person.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:55.160
Probably spent a fortune on that face.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.319
Can't even take care of yourself.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.040
How will you take care of me?

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:15.799
Just like a little puppy.

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:17.599
Lin Can!

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Stop right there!

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:26.960
Lin Can!

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.720
Why did you steal my lead role?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.440
You've been my supporting actress for years.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640
Still not used to it?

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:35.640
You're just jealous!

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.359
The director said

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.520
the female lead needs someone like me...

00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:41.119
with a perfect waist-to-hip ratio.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:44.559
Too bad.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.440
Great body, no brains.

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:47.799
You...

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:48.799
Jiang Wan.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Si Han.

00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:55.519
Take the next interviewee to the meeting room.

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.160
Today's interviews end here.

00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:58.960
Other applicants

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400
may leave.

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.079
Miss Jiang,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.200
if you have any issues with the casting,

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.200
take it up with Mr. Shen.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.720
As for now…

00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:10.079
please mind where you are.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920
Let's go.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640
Lin Can,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.240
don't get too cocky.

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:19.079
I hear the tax bureau

00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:20.079
will be visiting soon.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.480
Better memorize your
supporting actress lines.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.920
Please enjoy the anger-relief exercise.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Are you crazy?

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:35.559
Teacher Jiang Wan,

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:37.319
you instructed me before:

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:38.680
next time you get angry,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.200
play this anger-relief exercise.

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:44.519
Don't be troubled, don't be troubled.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.960
Trouble will make you die early.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480
Lin Can!

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.400
I'll kill you!

00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:55.599
Come in.

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:02.759
Hello, interviewers.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.720
My name is Wen Nuannuan.

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:04.919
I'm here for the interview.

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.079
Have a seat.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.039
This is my resume.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.599
So your career plan is to be…

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.000
an instant noodle blogger,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.200
or…

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:28.519
a moving company worker?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.440
No, no, no.

00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:31.759
I'm applying to be a celebrity assistant.

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:35.519
Any salary expectations?

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:37.559
Um…

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:39.359
Enough for rent is fine.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.119
Please take another look.

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:47.519
Look at this...

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.480
this is my “Box Moving King” award

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.039
from the moving company.

00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:52.240
And also…

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.839
my special guide for solo hunger situations...

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:55.879
Instant Noodle Strategies.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.359
Air-fryer crispy noodles,

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.680
crayfish mixed noodles,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.160
spicy sour noodles,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.400
cold tossed noodles,

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:03.039
curry seafood noodles…

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:03.559
Sign here.

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:04.759
Stamp here.

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:06.640
Okay.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400
Alright.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.160
Welcome.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480
You're hired.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.000
It's…

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.160
that simple?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.680
You…

00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:24.079
Look...

00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:26.079
I still have lots of skills to show.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.640
Not needed.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.920
Starting today,

00:21:28.119 --> 00:21:29.559
you are Teacher Lin Can's assistant.

00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:31.519
Lin Can?

00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:37.079
I really can't do this.

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:37.480
Come on.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.039
I'm not cut out for this.

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:38.759
Let me show you around.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.240
I really can't, miss.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.200
Miss…

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200
I...

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:44.000
Miss, I really can't.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.039
This is your supervisor's office.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.720
This is the boss's office.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.920
Over here

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:50.599
is the company pantry.

00:21:50.839 --> 00:21:52.480
Now let me tell you...

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:54.039
Can… can you find someone else?

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:54.920
I really can't be Lin Can's assistant.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.920
Trying to run?

00:21:56.079 --> 00:21:57.079
Let me tell you,

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:58.160
the contract is signed.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160
No turning back.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.960
I didn't know that was a contract.

00:22:01.079 --> 00:22:02.119
No probation period.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880
Direct full-time hire.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:05.079
Full-time?

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:06.119
Salary's good too.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720
This much.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.119
Five figures?

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:11.319
First things first...

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.599
you must address Lin
Can as “Teacher Lin Can.”

00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:16.480
Next, listen carefully.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:17.759
You need to remember these rules.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400
First,

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.160
Teacher Lin Can's assistant

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:23.759
must be available 24/7.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:25.920
Second,

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:29.000
she treats her motorcycle better than her own mother.

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:31.000
The last assistant

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:32.839
got the maintenance date wrong

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.319
and was fired on the spot.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200
And also…

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:40.759
never, ever ask if she has someone she likes.

00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:42.240
The assistant before the last one

00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:44.160
asked about her relationship status

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:45.599
and later…

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:47.200
Wh-what happened to her?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.400
I heard

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:49.599
after leaving,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.240
she was mentally traumatized.

00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:54.599
Needed six months of therapy.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.799
She's probably recovered by now.

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:01.160
Wen Nuannuan,

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.319
good luck.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.319
And the rumors about you and your agent Si Han...

00:23:31.319 --> 00:23:32.720
the lesbian gossip is everywhere.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.599
Is it true or not?

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.160
Lin Can!

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.879
Why did you steal my lead role?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.160
Nuannuan,

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:27.480
all settled with onboarding?

00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:31.039
I've signed away my body.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440
Good.

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:35.640
Your first day starts with work.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.880
Sorry about that.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.440
But Lin Can is missing right now.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.759
I have an important meeting soon.

00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:44.079
It's urgent.

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:46.000
I need you to help me immediately

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.440
to find Lin Can as soon as possible.

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:49.519
Okay.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.480
I'll text you her location.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
Contact me if anything.

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:03.599
Good luck,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720
Wen Nuannuan.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Teacher Lin Can.

00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:17.839
Teacher Lin Can.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.400
Teacher Lin Can.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.680
Teacher Lin Can.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160
I'm coming in.

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:55.559
Teacher Lin Can.

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:42.119
Must be home by 3 a.m.

00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:45.759
Watch your mouth in front of the media.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.799
No posting sad essays after drinking.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.880
Going faster than eighty...

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.400
no alcohol for a week.

00:27:20.519 --> 00:27:21.519
Teacher Lin Can.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.880
Are you in there?

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480
I'm coming in.

00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:28.839
Xiao He.

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:30.599
Teacher Lin Can.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.960
Teacher Lin Can.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:41.839
Xiao He.

00:27:42.319 --> 00:27:43.319
What's wrong?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.480
Oh no.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.880
Is she… dead?

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:49.559
No.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.960
I need to call 911.

00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:05.599
So-sorry, Teacher Lin Can.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920
I didn't mean it.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200
I thought you were…

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:17.079
After disappearing for so long,

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.960
you're finally back.

00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:27.400
If I died,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440
would you be sad?

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160
Yes.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.039
I don't want to lose my job on day one.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
So…

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:41.456
you don't want anything to happen to me.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.480
Of course.

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:46.039
I mean…

00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:47.119
I don't want to be

00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:48.359
the primary suspect.

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:50.960
So you still care about me, right?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.000
What's with Lin Can today?

00:28:57.612 --> 00:28:59.039
Um… Teacher Lin Can,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.599
It was Si Han who sent me.

00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:03.160
I'm your new assistant.

00:29:03.186 --> 00:29:04.186
Wen Nuannuan.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.440
Have you figured out how you're
going to repay what you owe me?

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.039
What do I do?

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:13.160
Did she plan how to torture me?

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.400
Don't go.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160
Don't leave me.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800
(Easter egg)

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.640
Let's go, hurry.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.720
Hurry, it's about to rain.
