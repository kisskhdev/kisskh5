00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.013
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:42.229
What?

00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:44.189
Why is it empty?

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:47.234
Those damn bastards!

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:48.986
How did they hide so fast?

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:50.988
Hey, calm down.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.741
Why are we searching here?
They cleared out a long time ago!

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:55.826
The investment scammers

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:57.619
only rent this space

00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:59.955
for investment seminars and events.

00:01:00.038 --> 00:01:01.039
What?

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.506
Hey, Seong-dae invested 2.9 billion won.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.841
It's three billion in total.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.719
He'll catch on soon enough.
Better wrap it up.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:15.554
I'm already on it.

00:01:15.637 --> 00:01:16.847
I'm Seok Jeong-ho, alright?

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:18.891
You're kidding me.

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:21.351
I put so much effort into this case!

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:23.604
Why would you ruin it like this?

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.064
Can't believe you raided this office
without a clue!

00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:27.649
Damn it.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.651
I was tipped off, okay?

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:32.654
What a joke.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:43.790
Hello?

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.293
There are cryptocurrency scammers
in Gangnam.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:47.878
- What?
- Check the files I sent you

00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:49.922
for further details.

THE MANAGEMENT DISAPPEARED IN 2020,
WITH 500 MILLION DOLLARS OF DAMAGE

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.564
Why did you raid this office?

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.484
They're too smart.
They must've caught on...

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:15.364
Hold on. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:21.495
Yes, Mr. Lee.

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:23.956
Did you invest in Miracle Asia?

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:25.707
No!

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:43.433
What?

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:44.726
This can't be right.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:46.520
Where did they all go?

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:48.981
Oh, no.

00:02:49.564 --> 00:02:50.983
CEO'S OFFICE

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:55.904
These frauds!

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:00.534
My money!

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:06.915
My money!

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:09.876
Mr. Lee

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:11.753
are you alright?

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.422
It wasn't much money, right?

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:14.673
How much did you invest?

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.677
You said you'd tell me!

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.345
And that you'd wait two months!

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.097
When did I say that?

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:24.349
And I wasn't behind the raid.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.993
Yes, Mr. Kang.

00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:44.911
I got a call from
the Future Talents Foundation.

00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:48.206
Oh, yes.

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:50.917
Five years of making donations sounds
pretty good.

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:52.461
Send them 300 million won.

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:53.545
Yes, sir.

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:04.306
- The street angel?
- Yes, the angel.

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.558
- I'm Park Cheol-woo.
- I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.894
Nice to meet you. I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.316
I'll bring you the best food
to go with those drinks.

00:04:15.108 --> 00:04:16.401
Han-young!

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:18.028
Three billion won!

00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:19.112
Three billion...

00:04:20.864 --> 00:04:23.450
You're paying me for the stage set
and my acting, right?

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:25.118
- Of course.
- Really?

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.828
You can't lie. You're a judge.

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:27.913
I wouldn't do that.

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:29.498
I'll give you all three billion won

00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:31.583
for setting the stage and for your acting.

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:33.168
And when the time is right

00:04:33.668 --> 00:04:35.712
donate it with a happy heart.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:36.797
Hey!

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.216
Nothing's meaner
than taking back a present.

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:40.967
And nothing is better than sharing.

00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:42.052
No!

00:04:42.135 --> 00:04:43.178
You're the best.

00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:44.805
No, I'm the worst!

00:04:45.263 --> 00:04:47.349
You always let Na-yeong win, but never me.

00:04:47.432 --> 00:04:49.810
You can stop now.
I get it. You two are best friends.

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:51.895
Won't Sin-jin pass out in stress

00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:53.647
after realizing he's lost three billion?

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.649
It'll be over
before we even break his neck.

00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:58.360
No, I doubt
that he'll be all that affected.

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:03.115
He knows he can easily earn it back
through blackmail or bribes.

00:05:03.657 --> 00:05:04.658
What?

00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:06.493
So, all that work was meaningless?

00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:07.577
Why meaningless?

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:09.538
It united us as a team.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.874
- One team!
- We now know our common enemies

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.961
and how excellent we are
at acting and thinking on our feet.

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.840
Everyone will be so shocked to hear
that the former President is

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.550
on Sin-jin's side.

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:23.802
- Alright, take your glasses.
- Thanks.

00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:26.179
- What was that? One team?
- Yeah.

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:27.639
Alright, Jin-a.

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:28.723
For one team!

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:30.100
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:31.643
One team!

00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:33.937
We're one! Yes!

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:38.650
Try this. It's a delicacy.

00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:42.070
Hey, imagine what would've happened
had we not moved offices.

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:44.489
It was impossible
to get Seong-dae to leave.

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:45.991
Gosh, we were so close.

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:48.743
Hearing about that office pisses me off.

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:50.745
How could you all keep it a secret?

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.205
Well, I went over to help.

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.623
What if I didn't recognize you?

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:55.041
You recognized me right away.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.334
All those mean words

00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:58.128
about my driving and life!

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:00.380
Those words really came from your heart.

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:03.300
Let's just say I was creative on the spot.
It was all acting.

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:05.177
Ha, I doubt it.

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:07.471
Come on, stop picking on me.

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:10.599
So, what actually happened?

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:17.189
I tipped the prosecution
about Miracle Asia.

00:06:18.523 --> 00:06:20.150
What? The prosecution?

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:22.402
We need the prosecution to raid the office

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:25.405
for the case to be dismissed
without Seong-dae realizing who got him.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.491
Hey

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:32.537
how am I supposed to know
the prosecution is coming?

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:34.706
On that note

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:37.667
let's set up another office.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.464
Man, I knew you were smart!

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:47.385
MIRACLE ASIA HEADQUARTERS ADDRESS

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:49.804
They moved offices already?

00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:53.642
Classic scammer move.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.101
Sure.

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:56.937
Headquarters or not

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.064
as long as they make my money grow.

00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:02.025
You knew it, didn't you?

00:07:02.108 --> 00:07:03.109
No!

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:06.279
It's my first time hearing about it.

00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:08.698
Wow, your acting is on point!

00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:14.663
What is this?
It's not a restaurant nor a food stand.

00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:17.123
What is this?

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:18.750
Hello!

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:20.460
- Hello!
- Hey.

00:07:21.044 --> 00:07:22.128
- Here.
- Hello.

00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:23.213
- Thank you.
- Sit here.

00:07:23.296 --> 00:07:24.589
- Thank you.
- She's...

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.883
How are you?

00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:30.095
Hello, I'm Song Na-yeon.

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.598
Hello, I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.017
Hi, I'm Song Na-yeon.

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:37.477
What's with that voice?

00:07:38.436 --> 00:07:39.729
Have a seat.

00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:40.939
Here.

00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:42.941
I cooked this squid stir-fry.

00:07:43.024 --> 00:07:44.651
- Wow!
- Have a glass.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.404
Thank you.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.157
You can beg me all you want

00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:34.659
and I'd still never eat there.

00:08:38.663 --> 00:08:41.041
But why do I want to cry?

00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:42.375
This is so annoying!

00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:09.319
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:09:10.153 --> 00:09:11.237
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:09:13.615 --> 00:09:14.949
What the hell is this?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.744
You said you'd sort it out.
You told me to trust you!

00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:22.749
Did I ever say I couldn't sort it out?

00:09:25.752 --> 00:09:27.128
So, what's your plan now?

00:09:27.462 --> 00:09:29.631
Forget becoming the Chief Justice.

00:09:29.714 --> 00:09:32.008
My son is about to make me lose
my Justice title!

00:09:33.843 --> 00:09:36.054
Your son's trial will be over soon

00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:38.556
and you'll become the Chief Justice.

00:09:40.517 --> 00:09:41.518
Are you

00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:43.687
really sure about this?

00:09:45.438 --> 00:09:47.691
The trial was unexpected

00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:50.068
but that won't change anything.

00:09:53.113 --> 00:09:54.364
You're sure about this?

00:09:55.865 --> 00:09:56.866
But

00:09:59.077 --> 00:10:00.620
now that it'll take more effort

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:04.749
with your son's unexpected case

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.379
you'll need to give me what I want.

00:10:19.597 --> 00:10:21.099
Justice Hwang's son's life is

00:10:21.182 --> 00:10:23.101
right in your hands.

00:10:23.685 --> 00:10:26.396
It's like you won the lottery.

00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:32.152
Justice Hwang's son's life is in my hands

00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:34.237
but nobody's approached me yet.

00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:36.239
As if

00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:38.366
someone is stopping them.

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:46.249
You cast the bait yourself

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:49.377
so hunt him yourself, too.

00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:52.380
Tae-seong isn't a bait.
He's being held hostage.

00:11:00.054 --> 00:11:02.140
I'm not conducting a trial.

00:11:02.474 --> 00:11:03.725
It's a hostage situation.

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:06.644
The record of your illegal funds

00:11:06.728 --> 00:11:08.563
when you worked
for the National Election Commission.

00:11:09.814 --> 00:11:11.357
Bring that to me.

00:11:19.574 --> 00:11:21.326
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:30.043
Do you really not know?

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:31.461
No, I don't.

00:11:35.882 --> 00:11:38.134
So, you're choosing to be
a heartless father.

00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:42.138
By the way

00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:46.142
your son will receive
the maximum sentence possible.

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:56.861
You don't think I can stop a junior judge
with a single call

00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:59.155
with my huge networks?

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:01.366
Sorry.

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:04.077
That newbie judge only listens to me.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.957
Haven't you made enough calls already?

00:12:12.627 --> 00:12:13.628
You must know

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:17.465
you have zero power over your son's trial

00:12:18.258 --> 00:12:19.759
pretty well by now.

00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:28.518
Anyway, I got your message.

00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:34.399
Regardless of the trial

00:12:35.775 --> 00:12:37.485
I'll make you the Chief Justice.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.280
The file exposes

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:43.116
not only multiple assemblymen

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:46.578
but also the illegal funds
for the former and current Presidents.

00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:50.665
You sure you can handle that?

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.297
I wouldn't have bitten off

00:12:58.131 --> 00:12:59.632
what I couldn't chew.

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:15.690
Justice Hwang.

00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:41.299
The court hereby orders

00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:43.134
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:13:43.384 --> 00:13:46.512
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

00:13:47.847 --> 00:13:49.390
Hwang Nam-yong.

00:13:56.105 --> 00:13:58.483
I don't care what you give Sin-jin.

00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:02.070
You'll never become the Chief Justice.

00:14:03.488 --> 00:14:05.281
I'll do everything it takes to stop you

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.450
even if you were to sell your soul.

00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:14.624
Why haven't you sent the money

00:14:14.707 --> 00:14:16.000
to the Future Talents Foundation?

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:21.381
I think we should re-negotiate
on the donation period.

00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:23.841
No, a five-year donation period
isn't a bad deal.

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:25.802
Right.

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:30.598
Is something wrong?

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.145
- Mr. Kang.
- Tell me.

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:41.234
I'm sorry.

00:14:42.026 --> 00:14:43.987
I've been scammed.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.281
What?

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:52.704
I invested some money
into an Asian cryptocurrency scam

00:14:53.287 --> 00:14:56.249
and the prosecution ruined my plan
by suddenly raiding them.

00:14:56.791 --> 00:14:58.209
I had no idea.

00:14:58.793 --> 00:15:00.837
You invested your money,
knowing it was a scam?

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:02.797
Yes. But...

00:15:03.423 --> 00:15:05.508
Prosecutor Park promised a heads-up

00:15:05.591 --> 00:15:06.592
before raiding them

00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:08.636
so I thought it'd be safe.

00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:11.389
But someone unexpected came along...

00:15:11.472 --> 00:15:12.473
That's enough.

00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:14.684
How much did you lose?

00:15:20.982 --> 00:15:23.067
All three billion won.

00:15:25.486 --> 00:15:27.030
You've really lost your mind.

00:15:27.488 --> 00:15:28.823
I can find them.

00:15:29.407 --> 00:15:31.325
Prosecutor Park has been investigating

00:15:31.409 --> 00:15:32.618
so I know he'll find them.

00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:38.708
So?

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:41.169
What if they do get arrested?

00:15:47.425 --> 00:15:49.010
What will you tell the prosecution?

00:15:58.978 --> 00:16:01.522
How will you explain
where you got the three billion won?

00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:09.906
That I gave it to you?

00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:31.302
I'll do everything to get the money back.

00:16:31.385 --> 00:16:32.595
No!

00:16:43.106 --> 00:16:44.357
Don't bother doing anything.

00:16:56.786 --> 00:16:58.788
Stay low and invisible

00:17:00.123 --> 00:17:01.791
until I call you.

00:17:03.543 --> 00:17:04.836
Just stay alive.

00:17:20.434 --> 00:17:21.561
I'm ready.

00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:25.439
HWANG NAM-YONG

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.234
I'll send the judge
on your son's case tomorrow.

00:17:34.031 --> 00:17:36.659
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:18:15.615 --> 00:18:16.782
You called me?

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:21.662
Meet up with Nam-yong.

00:18:21.746 --> 00:18:22.747
He has something for you.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.873
Yes, sir.

00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:27.043
And here.

00:18:30.671 --> 00:18:31.672
What's this?

00:19:15.424 --> 00:19:17.510
So, you're the judge on the case.

00:19:17.593 --> 00:19:19.387
I've seen you at the Central Court.

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:22.640
Yes, I've only briefly introduced myself.

00:19:22.723 --> 00:19:23.891
Is that right?

00:19:24.517 --> 00:19:26.852
I'm sure you know Tae-seong is my son.

00:19:27.728 --> 00:19:29.397
How do you plan on closing the case?

00:19:30.523 --> 00:19:31.732
What do you mean, sir?

00:19:32.566 --> 00:19:34.485
I guess you haven't heard yet.

00:19:34.986 --> 00:19:36.654
I'll tell you now, then.

00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:39.532
Announce Tae-seong as not guilty.

00:19:40.032 --> 00:19:42.159
Let's say he was misled

00:19:42.243 --> 00:19:44.537
to think his teaching assistantship
and internship

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:45.997
counted as work experience.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.501
I'll be forever grateful
once you close the case well.

00:19:51.043 --> 00:19:52.378
And

00:19:55.131 --> 00:19:57.508
make sure to pass this on to Sin-jin.

00:20:01.762 --> 00:20:05.349
If it's about the final verdict,
I've already heard about your history.

00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:08.227
I hear you wrote the verdict yourself
last time.

00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:09.395
If that's what you want

00:20:09.854 --> 00:20:11.981
I'll happily go to that length for you.

00:20:12.064 --> 00:20:14.317
Could you please write one this time, too?

00:20:14.984 --> 00:20:15.985
Sure.

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:17.987
I just need a few days to write it.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.614
A person who injures the credit of another
by circulating false facts

00:20:20.698 --> 00:20:22.366
or through fraudulent means

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.909
shall be punished by imprisonment with
labor for less than five years

00:20:23.993 --> 00:20:25.995
or by a fine not exceeding 15 million won.

00:20:27.163 --> 00:20:29.206
What do you think you're doing?

00:20:30.124 --> 00:20:32.251
Just wanted to help you write the verdict.

00:20:32.335 --> 00:20:36.297
Tae-seong lied about his work experience
to apply for the job at JB

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.631
which is fraudulent

00:20:37.715 --> 00:20:39.550
and an obstruction of business

00:20:39.633 --> 00:20:41.218
for disrupting JB's hiring process.

00:20:42.428 --> 00:20:47.224
A son of a Justice should be
an inspiring example to society, not this.

00:20:49.518 --> 00:20:51.937
I'd say a year and a half in prison
sounds about right.

00:20:52.021 --> 00:20:55.232
What the hell are you going on about?

00:20:55.566 --> 00:20:56.942
You even used your authority

00:20:57.026 --> 00:20:59.737
to make JB forge Tae-seong's scores
so he could be hired.

00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:01.572
Since the public despises

00:21:01.655 --> 00:21:04.492
anyone using their powerful dads
for their own success

00:21:04.575 --> 00:21:05.951
he'll have to serve

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:08.245
a year and a half without exceptions.

00:21:08.788 --> 00:21:12.333
You think you can continue being a judge
after pulling this?

00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:17.046
You're the one who should end
your career in court.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.881
What? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.010
How dare you blackmail a Justice?

00:21:30.351 --> 00:21:31.936
How dare you?

00:21:47.493 --> 00:21:49.078
Tae-seong will serve

00:21:49.161 --> 00:21:50.913
exactly a year and a half in jail.

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:52.581
What?

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.889
HWANG NAM-YONG'S TRANSACTION RECORDS
FOR ALL BRIBES RECEIVED

00:22:09.473 --> 00:22:12.810
This was over a decade ago.

00:22:14.395 --> 00:22:16.147
How do you have this?

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.737
INVESTIGATION RECORD, CONFIDENTIAL
TARGET: HWANG NAM-YONG

00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:25.531
CONFIRMATION OF TRANSACTION

00:22:25.614 --> 00:22:26.991
WITNESS: HAN TAE-HWA
POSITION: SECRETARY AT S GROUP

00:22:27.074 --> 00:22:28.451
TESTIFYING IN THE INVESTIGATION ROOM,
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:22:28.534 --> 00:22:30.202
HWANG NAM-YONG'S TRANSACTION RECORDS
FOR ALL BRIBES RECEIVED

00:22:30.286 --> 00:22:31.871
RECIPIENT: HWANG NAM-YONG

00:22:31.954 --> 00:22:33.372
TESTIMONY

00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:34.790
I WAS BORN ON OCTOBER 22, 1964,
AND I WORK FOR S CONSTRUCTION

00:22:34.874 --> 00:22:36.000
YOUR HONOR, I WAS HIT IN THE HEAD
BY ONE OF THE PROTESTING RESIDENTS

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:37.251
MY BOSS IS VERY STRONG. HE PROTECTED ME

00:22:37.668 --> 00:22:40.379
INVESTIGATION RECORD, CONFIDENTIAL

00:22:40.463 --> 00:22:43.507
You took bribes
from Mr. Jang Tae-sik of S Construction

00:22:44.842 --> 00:22:47.136
and ruled in favor of a con man
who staged his injury.

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:51.557
What a verdict needs is
justice and common sense.

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:53.142
But you framed

00:22:53.225 --> 00:22:55.811
Plaintiff Lee Bong-seok as the perpetrator

00:22:55.936 --> 00:22:58.230
and sentenced him
to a year and a half in jail.

00:22:59.815 --> 00:23:01.275
Your verdict

00:23:02.568 --> 00:23:04.236
robbed a family

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.530
of its father

00:23:08.532 --> 00:23:09.700
and husband.

00:23:14.788 --> 00:23:16.081
Who are you?

00:23:17.541 --> 00:23:18.584
Don't tell me...

00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:19.960
That's right.

00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:24.423
The son who had his father robbed
for a year and a half

00:23:26.217 --> 00:23:27.885
all because of you.

00:23:38.437 --> 00:23:39.438
So...

00:23:41.357 --> 00:23:43.567
you want an apology from me now?

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.655
What's the point in getting an apology?

00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:50.157
When you won't even be sincere.

00:23:50.241 --> 00:23:51.408
That's right.

00:23:51.492 --> 00:23:52.743
But you're the same.

00:23:53.244 --> 00:23:55.287
All that talk about justice

00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:57.790
yet what you want on my son's verdict is

00:23:58.249 --> 00:23:59.833
revenge, not justice.

00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:03.629
It doesn't matter if I get fired
or my son ends up in jail.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.382
What difference does that make for you?

00:24:08.092 --> 00:24:09.802
I don't know if you know it yet

00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:11.762
but I'm the next Chief Justice.

00:24:12.054 --> 00:24:13.180
So

00:24:14.014 --> 00:24:15.724
let past stay in the past

00:24:16.392 --> 00:24:18.352
and move on to the future with me.

00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:21.272
I'll compensate you for the past
well enough.

00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:25.568
I'm more curious about the present.

00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:30.406
I'm not sure
if what I want is revenge or justice.

00:24:30.489 --> 00:24:31.949
But in this moment

00:24:33.117 --> 00:24:34.994
I just can't stand the fact

00:24:35.077 --> 00:24:36.370
that someone like you

00:24:36.453 --> 00:24:39.164
has power and authority in court.

00:24:46.797 --> 00:24:48.632
Think about how far I can get you

00:24:49.008 --> 00:24:51.802
once I become the Chief Justice.

00:24:52.303 --> 00:24:54.221
Seize the chance

00:24:55.264 --> 00:24:56.265
when you can.

00:24:59.476 --> 00:25:00.894
I'm the one giving you a chance.

00:25:02.855 --> 00:25:05.649
Start by retiring as a judge.
It doesn't suit you.

00:25:06.984 --> 00:25:09.820
That's the only way
your son will return home.

00:25:20.706 --> 00:25:22.708
You have no idea
how badly I wanted to kill you.

00:25:47.608 --> 00:25:49.902
A writer once asked himself

00:25:52.112 --> 00:25:54.573
"Can the past help the present?"

00:25:58.202 --> 00:25:59.828
And here's what I want to ask myself.

00:26:00.954 --> 00:26:02.748
Can myself from my past life

00:26:02.831 --> 00:26:05.250
help me in the present?

00:26:07.961 --> 00:26:09.963
Am I still making the right choices

00:26:10.047 --> 00:26:11.965
for the better future?

00:26:15.344 --> 00:26:18.472
COURT

00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:21.558
Did you assign Judge Lee

00:26:21.642 --> 00:26:23.936
for my son's case on purpose?

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:27.481
As unfortunate as it is for you

00:26:28.107 --> 00:26:30.275
I guess karma is a real thing.

00:26:31.652 --> 00:26:32.903
What about the documents?

00:26:32.986 --> 00:26:35.906
Did you write them?

00:26:37.866 --> 00:26:39.076
I was

00:26:39.159 --> 00:26:41.203
your assistant judge then.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.372
You took bribes from defendants

00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:45.499
and colluded with them all the time.

00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:47.418
So, you go behind my back like this?

00:26:47.918 --> 00:26:50.212
There's not even anything in it for you.

00:26:50.754 --> 00:26:52.589
Because truth can also be powerful

00:26:52.673 --> 00:26:54.091
though that's rarely the case.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.889
You struck me for no reason.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.476
Do you realize
what your little punch has caused?

00:27:04.977 --> 00:27:07.521
That rascal told me to end my career!

00:27:07.604 --> 00:27:08.605
Otherwise, he insisted

00:27:08.689 --> 00:27:11.275
he'd sentence my son to jail
for a year and a half!

00:27:13.569 --> 00:27:14.570
That's interesting.

00:27:16.113 --> 00:27:17.990
Regardless of what Judge Lee told you

00:27:18.073 --> 00:27:19.783
you'll become the Chief Justice.

00:27:20.409 --> 00:27:22.411
And your son will also be home soon.

00:27:22.494 --> 00:27:23.495
What?

00:27:25.539 --> 00:27:26.915
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:28.125
I'm not joking.

00:27:29.042 --> 00:27:31.044
Think about all the wrongs you've done.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.839
This is just a small price to pay.

00:27:38.177 --> 00:27:39.386
So

00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:42.723
is this really the end of it?

00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:45.601
But Judge Lee is still the judge
on the case.

00:27:45.684 --> 00:27:47.770
Words have power.

00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:50.689
Whose words do you think have more power

00:27:51.607 --> 00:27:53.484
Judge Lee's or mine?

00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:11.001
You'd better own up

00:28:12.252 --> 00:28:14.213
to what you just said.

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:36.860
I apologize.

00:28:38.445 --> 00:28:40.531
What? For what?

00:28:42.407 --> 00:28:43.992
For Seong-dae.

00:28:44.743 --> 00:28:46.245
I knew he was into investing

00:28:46.328 --> 00:28:48.705
but I had no idea
he'd do something so ridiculous.

00:28:49.206 --> 00:28:50.999
I should've watched him more closely.

00:28:52.918 --> 00:28:54.711
How's that your fault?

00:28:55.838 --> 00:28:58.173
It's my fault for leaving money
with such an idiot.

00:29:00.968 --> 00:29:02.010
No.

00:29:02.344 --> 00:29:04.346
I'll work even harder

00:29:04.721 --> 00:29:06.306
so you don't run into more problems.

00:29:07.307 --> 00:29:08.308
Okay.

00:29:09.351 --> 00:29:11.562
Let's just move on.
Don't make it a bigger issue.

00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:14.064
We're making the Chief Justice here.

00:29:15.274 --> 00:29:17.651
Three billion won isn't worth
jeopardizing that.

00:29:19.862 --> 00:29:20.863
Cheers.

00:29:39.506 --> 00:29:42.509
The only ones who knew
Seong-dae had three billion won were

00:29:43.302 --> 00:29:44.469
you, me

00:29:45.345 --> 00:29:46.805
and Han-young.

00:29:47.764 --> 00:29:49.516
Sorry? What do you mean?

00:29:51.852 --> 00:29:53.186
We have to see

00:29:54.771 --> 00:29:56.356
what Han-young is really like.

00:30:09.494 --> 00:30:10.495
So, did you bring it?

00:30:19.922 --> 00:30:20.923
Did you check the file?

00:30:21.298 --> 00:30:22.299
No, sir.

00:30:25.761 --> 00:30:28.680
You must be dying to know
what Nam-yong is handing over to me.

00:30:30.223 --> 00:30:32.976
I figured you'd tell me
if it was something I needed to know.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.942
There are some impressive devices
these days.

00:30:45.072 --> 00:30:46.740
If you accessed this file

00:30:47.407 --> 00:30:48.867
I'll be able to see it.

00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:55.332
ALLOW DEVICE TO CONNECT

00:30:55.415 --> 00:30:58.251
RECORD OF ILLEGAL FUNDS

00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:03.048
ILLEGAL FUNDS FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.888
ILLEGAL FUNDS
FOR FORMER PRESIDENT PARK GWANG-TO

00:31:13.767 --> 00:31:15.519
VIEW RECORD OF DEVICE USE

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.785
FILES ACCESSED: 0 TIMES
FILES COPIED: 0 TIMES

00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:35.497
You're awfully obedient for a young man.

00:31:37.791 --> 00:31:40.210
If I were you,
I would've opened it out of curiosity.

00:31:43.296 --> 00:31:44.297
Let me pour you one.

00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:04.735
Yes, Ms. Song.

00:32:04.818 --> 00:32:06.611
I talked to an expert

00:32:06.695 --> 00:32:08.697
and you'll be really screwed
if you open it.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.283
It tracks all the times
the files are accessed and copied.

00:32:11.366 --> 00:32:13.076
You'd better not do anything with it.

00:32:22.502 --> 00:32:24.171
There's a first for everything.

00:32:26.548 --> 00:32:28.175
That's where your initial resolve lies.

00:32:30.302 --> 00:32:31.303
Here.

00:32:34.222 --> 00:32:36.725
I'm walking on thin ice

00:32:36.808 --> 00:32:38.101
to gain Sin-jin's trust.

00:32:40.479 --> 00:32:42.731
One slip, and it's game over.

00:32:44.649 --> 00:32:47.736
But so many forget
about their first resolves.

00:32:49.237 --> 00:32:50.322
But that's

00:32:51.198 --> 00:32:52.365
none of my business.

00:32:52.991 --> 00:32:53.992
You know why?

00:32:54.576 --> 00:32:55.869
Because you have

00:32:56.828 --> 00:32:59.039
endless people wanting to be on your side.

00:33:02.167 --> 00:33:03.168
Exactly.

00:33:04.961 --> 00:33:06.296
So, don't forget yours.

00:33:42.332 --> 00:33:43.708
Hey, welcome back.

00:33:43.792 --> 00:33:45.168
Thanks. Where's Mother?

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.337
She's asleep. She said she was tired.

00:33:55.762 --> 00:33:57.514
- Father.
- Yeah?

00:33:58.515 --> 00:34:00.725
Why don't I join you for a drink?
It's been a while.

00:34:00.809 --> 00:34:01.810
Sure.

00:34:27.002 --> 00:34:30.297
Oh, I was just going to have one glass.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.426
Wow.

00:34:57.449 --> 00:34:58.450
Here.

00:35:12.214 --> 00:35:13.215
Father.

00:35:13.632 --> 00:35:14.633
Yeah?

00:35:18.637 --> 00:35:19.721
I was

00:35:20.889 --> 00:35:22.307
there.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.521
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:35:29.022 --> 00:35:30.065
When you were protesting

00:35:30.607 --> 00:35:32.275
against the redevelopment.

00:35:32.734 --> 00:35:34.152
Why are you still stuck on that?

00:35:34.236 --> 00:35:35.737
You should forget about it.

00:35:44.412 --> 00:35:46.456
- When you passed out...
- Forget about it all.

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:51.211
Whatever it is, just forget about it.

00:35:56.132 --> 00:35:57.300
Are you okay?

00:35:57.384 --> 00:35:59.135
Don't come this way! Stop!

00:35:59.678 --> 00:36:01.263
Don't hurt us!

00:36:03.431 --> 00:36:04.432
Father?

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:07.894
No!

00:36:12.023 --> 00:36:13.024
Father!

00:36:35.755 --> 00:36:38.675
Even the stones on the ground have
their own stories.

00:36:39.467 --> 00:36:41.261
And even the newest newborns have

00:36:41.344 --> 00:36:44.097
as many stories as the days they've lived.

00:36:44.556 --> 00:36:45.557
So

00:36:45.974 --> 00:36:48.351
in a world of endless stories intertwined
with each other

00:36:48.435 --> 00:36:50.687
who doesn't feel wronged or blamed?

00:36:51.646 --> 00:36:53.898
If you stay stuck on feeling wronged

00:36:54.399 --> 00:36:57.485
how can your heart embrace

00:37:00.196 --> 00:37:02.240
the more important emotions
that it should feel?

00:37:05.577 --> 00:37:08.621
People don't say they're fine

00:37:08.705 --> 00:37:11.124
because they're really fine.

00:37:12.334 --> 00:37:13.668
So

00:37:14.544 --> 00:37:16.379
whatever is going on inside of you

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.425
just keep telling yourself it's fine

00:37:22.177 --> 00:37:23.928
and it'll all be fine one day.

00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:46.868
I like my eggs

00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:49.788
sunny-side-up.

00:37:51.414 --> 00:37:53.416
Don't break the yolk.

00:37:58.755 --> 00:37:59.839
Thanks.

00:38:29.285 --> 00:38:30.453
It's fine.

00:38:31.955 --> 00:38:33.706
It's fine.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.999
I'm sorry.

00:38:42.674 --> 00:38:44.175
I'm sorry.

00:38:44.259 --> 00:38:47.220
How much time do I have?

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.099
I just want to live like this

00:38:51.182 --> 00:38:53.643
until the end.

00:39:13.371 --> 00:39:14.414
Oh, gosh.

00:39:16.833 --> 00:39:18.793
Stop drinking before bed.

00:39:26.384 --> 00:39:28.094
You remember that girl?

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:32.015
The one we met
shortly after I was released from jail.

00:39:33.391 --> 00:39:34.684
Of course.

00:39:35.101 --> 00:39:36.686
How can I forget about her?

00:39:45.111 --> 00:39:46.112
Hello?

00:39:47.155 --> 00:39:48.448
Do you need help?

00:39:48.531 --> 00:39:49.949
Did your mom tell you to come?

00:39:52.494 --> 00:39:54.662
Oh, I...

00:39:55.914 --> 00:39:57.290
Well...

00:40:06.674 --> 00:40:07.884
Here you go.

00:40:13.515 --> 00:40:14.766
What's this?

00:40:15.934 --> 00:40:17.143
I'm sorry.

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:19.395
- Hey!
- Miss!

00:40:20.813 --> 00:40:22.899
Oh, well...

00:40:23.399 --> 00:40:25.527
My dad isn't a bad man.

00:40:26.277 --> 00:40:29.155
Please don't resent him so much.

00:40:32.992 --> 00:40:34.452
Hey...

00:40:44.003 --> 00:40:45.088
Hello

00:40:45.171 --> 00:40:46.923
my name is Kim Jin-a.

00:40:47.507 --> 00:40:48.967
I'm the daughter of Kim Seok-tae

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.261
the man whom you supposedly beat up

00:40:51.344 --> 00:40:52.971
and sued you.

00:40:53.805 --> 00:40:57.016
I know you didn't do anything wrong.

00:40:57.433 --> 00:40:59.185
Of course, I also know

00:40:59.269 --> 00:41:01.145
you didn't hurt my dad.

00:41:01.729 --> 00:41:04.774
My dad isn't a bad man

00:41:04.857 --> 00:41:07.569
but he did something bad
so he could raise me.

00:41:07.986 --> 00:41:09.028
I'd love to tell my dad

00:41:09.112 --> 00:41:11.948
to stop working in such an evil job

00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:14.284
but I've been pretending
not to know about his job

00:41:14.784 --> 00:41:17.912
because I don't want to break his heart.

00:41:19.539 --> 00:41:21.332
My Jin-a.

00:41:23.293 --> 00:41:25.169
You're a real grown-up,
like everyone else.

00:41:28.506 --> 00:41:29.549
Of course.

00:41:30.675 --> 00:41:32.385
I even work late nights

00:41:32.802 --> 00:41:34.137
and have staff dinners.

00:41:38.933 --> 00:41:40.560
You've never had those, have you?

00:41:40.852 --> 00:41:43.354
Are you asking if I'm jealous?

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.941
Are you?

00:41:50.528 --> 00:41:51.654
Of course.

00:41:52.447 --> 00:41:53.990
I'm so, so jealous.

00:41:58.703 --> 00:41:59.704
Here.

00:41:59.912 --> 00:42:02.790
Apparently, this brings you luck.

00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:05.501
Broke people like us

00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:07.629
have nothing but luck to count on.

00:42:08.254 --> 00:42:10.131
So, every time I saw a four-leaf clover

00:42:10.298 --> 00:42:11.883
I made sure to pluck it.

00:42:12.592 --> 00:42:13.843
But now that I see it

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:18.306
having you as my daughter was
my biggest luck.

00:42:19.098 --> 00:42:20.391
You're my Ace of Clubs.

00:42:23.853 --> 00:42:26.022
The four-leaf clover in this letter is

00:42:26.105 --> 00:42:28.232
what my dad and I love most.

00:42:28.858 --> 00:42:30.693
Dad said we had to wish for luck

00:42:30.777 --> 00:42:32.487
because we had nothing else to count on.

00:42:32.945 --> 00:42:34.989
That's why he loves these clovers so much.

00:42:35.073 --> 00:42:38.117
A four-leaf clover may be the only thing

00:42:38.201 --> 00:42:39.952
I can give you now

00:42:40.036 --> 00:42:41.788
but once I grow older

00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:43.790
I'll compensate you
for my dad's wrongdoing.

00:42:44.207 --> 00:42:45.917
I'm so sorry.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.252
Sincerely, Kim Seok-tae's daughter,
Kim Jin-a.

00:42:51.547 --> 00:42:52.674
Her name was

00:42:54.384 --> 00:42:56.552
Jin-a, right? Kim Jin-a?

00:42:56.844 --> 00:42:57.887
Yeah.

00:42:58.346 --> 00:43:00.098
She asked us to forgive her dad.

00:43:00.973 --> 00:43:03.142
She wrote that he was doing bad things
to raise her

00:43:04.018 --> 00:43:06.854
but he wasn't a bad man.

00:43:08.648 --> 00:43:11.067
How does that make any sense, though?

00:43:14.821 --> 00:43:15.905
You know

00:43:17.448 --> 00:43:19.826
we should've at least fed her a meal
before she left.

00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:24.205
I hope she's doing fine.

00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:26.249
I sure do, too.

00:43:45.393 --> 00:43:47.061
Are you Mr. Kim Seok-tae's guardian?

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.573
I urgently called you earlier

00:43:58.656 --> 00:44:00.616
because he was having breathing issues

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.702
but I should've waited a bit first.

00:44:02.785 --> 00:44:04.370
Sorry for calling you so late.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:23.973
Interesting.

00:44:25.016 --> 00:44:27.310
I swear I've seen him somewhere.

00:44:30.188 --> 00:44:32.356
Call her right now.

00:44:34.108 --> 00:44:35.109
Yes, sir.

00:44:37.695 --> 00:44:38.738
Ms. Kim.

00:44:38.988 --> 00:44:41.240
Ms. Kim!

00:44:41.616 --> 00:44:42.617
Ms. Kim!

00:44:42.992 --> 00:44:43.993
Ms. Kim!

00:44:44.452 --> 00:44:46.329
You can't do this!

00:44:49.207 --> 00:44:50.875
I won't say anything

00:44:50.958 --> 00:44:53.586
about you guys having moved him
to a different room

00:44:53.669 --> 00:44:55.046
without my permission.

00:44:57.131 --> 00:44:58.883
- Sorry?
- Tell me

00:44:58.966 --> 00:45:00.051
how much the VIP suite costs.

00:45:00.676 --> 00:45:01.761
Oh, sure.

00:45:18.653 --> 00:45:19.862
Damn, that's fresh.

00:45:20.363 --> 00:45:21.614
Why don't you move your dad

00:45:22.406 --> 00:45:24.075
back to the VIP suite?

00:45:24.158 --> 00:45:27.119
I'll take care
of your father's hospital bills

00:45:27.203 --> 00:45:30.122
and all the money you need

00:45:30.206 --> 00:45:31.833
to maintain your status.

00:45:32.708 --> 00:45:35.086
Are you using money to win love

00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:36.587
because the letter didn't work?

00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:40.007
What you're doing is

00:45:40.383 --> 00:45:41.676
disrespecting your father.

00:45:42.093 --> 00:45:44.846
Byeon, what did the doctor say?

00:45:47.139 --> 00:45:48.140
It's Chronic...

00:45:48.558 --> 00:45:51.060
It's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.

00:45:51.143 --> 00:45:53.813
Yeah. What causes that?

00:45:53.896 --> 00:45:55.857
Repetitive concussion

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.900
and head injuries.

00:45:58.651 --> 00:45:59.944
I see.

00:46:02.363 --> 00:46:05.992
That's interesting for a man
with a successful prosecutor daughter.

00:46:06.075 --> 00:46:09.745
What kind of a life did he possibly live
that led up to that?

00:46:11.539 --> 00:46:14.750
He might as well have joined a gang

00:46:14.834 --> 00:46:16.419
if he wanted to get his head smashed.

00:46:16.502 --> 00:46:18.921
Maybe he was one of them,
just at the very bottom?

00:46:19.881 --> 00:46:20.965
Watch it.

00:46:21.424 --> 00:46:23.676
Oh, sorry.

00:46:31.517 --> 00:46:33.060
PATIENT: KIM SEOK-TAE

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:35.771
Dad!

00:46:40.067 --> 00:46:41.402
My gosh.

00:46:42.862 --> 00:46:43.988
Are you okay?

00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:45.072
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:46:48.534 --> 00:46:49.660
What do we do?

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.789
Oh, gosh. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:47:06.594 --> 00:47:08.179
Good work.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.068
You know

00:47:23.945 --> 00:47:26.614
this is at least 100 times healthier

00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:29.241
than the raw liver last time.

00:47:35.247 --> 00:47:36.332
You become mine

00:47:37.833 --> 00:47:39.043
if you drink this, okay?

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.965
I'm just kidding.

00:47:44.048 --> 00:47:45.091
Drink it

00:47:45.174 --> 00:47:47.343
and all of this is yours.

00:47:49.095 --> 00:47:50.429
You hold quite a grudge.

00:47:50.763 --> 00:47:52.139
Of course.

00:47:52.223 --> 00:47:54.934
There's nothing I hate
more than people who pretend to be chill.

00:47:56.686 --> 00:47:57.728
So, what now?

00:47:58.104 --> 00:47:59.605
Are you trying to befriend me now?

00:47:59.689 --> 00:48:00.731
Well

00:48:00.815 --> 00:48:03.943
I'd love to have such a pretty prosecutor
be my friend, of course.

00:48:23.587 --> 00:48:26.549
You know, I love oysters

00:48:28.467 --> 00:48:31.804
but the ones from you are too fishy.

00:48:41.814 --> 00:48:44.275
I appreciate you keeping me entertained

00:48:46.527 --> 00:48:49.739
but be a little patient.
Stop pestering me.

00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:51.824
I'll come soon enough.

00:48:57.997 --> 00:48:59.081
Okay.

00:49:00.499 --> 00:49:02.168
But don't take too long.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.378
I hate being bored

00:49:05.046 --> 00:49:06.505
as much as you do.

ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE
TAKES HIS OWN LIFE AT HIS OFFICE

00:49:27.485 --> 00:49:28.694
INVESTIGATION ON CHU YONG-JIN
TO BE INTERRUPTED

00:49:29.987 --> 00:49:31.864
I've confirmed everything about Haenal

00:49:31.947 --> 00:49:34.158
S Group's case, and the other case.

00:49:34.658 --> 00:49:36.494
My guess was right about them all.

00:49:36.577 --> 00:49:39.038
But there's no conclusive evidence yet.

00:49:39.121 --> 00:49:40.539
The same goes with this.

00:49:43.876 --> 00:49:45.795
Sin-jin...

00:49:46.712 --> 00:49:48.005
Why do you think

00:49:48.089 --> 00:49:51.425
Han-young left this with you?

00:50:03.145 --> 00:50:05.648
We'll know once he tells us.

00:50:08.734 --> 00:50:10.402
Is all of this true?

00:50:10.486 --> 00:50:12.571
Yes, based on everything I know.

00:50:13.322 --> 00:50:15.991
I'm sure he's done more evil things
that I don't know about.

00:50:16.784 --> 00:50:19.078
Since when did you know about Sin-jin?

00:50:19.161 --> 00:50:20.287
When I found

00:50:20.371 --> 00:50:23.082
the draft dodger list
at my parents' junkyard.

00:50:23.165 --> 00:50:24.166
Once I realized

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.043
Sin-jin was the one going after that list

00:50:26.127 --> 00:50:27.378
I kept digging into him.

00:50:27.753 --> 00:50:29.755
I knew it
when you busted that serial killer

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:31.590
in Chungcheongnam-do.

00:50:32.258 --> 00:50:34.969
Why are you acting like a prosecutor?
You're a judge!

00:50:35.052 --> 00:50:38.097
And you should've come to me first
when you got this.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.059
I needed to gain Sin-jin's trust first.

00:50:42.143 --> 00:50:43.310
And get a new car from him?

00:50:43.394 --> 00:50:45.980
I told you I paid for that
with a 60-month installment plan!

00:50:46.063 --> 00:50:47.648
- But it was so sudden.
- So?

00:50:47.898 --> 00:50:49.233
Life happens, okay?

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.735
I'm already...

00:50:52.486 --> 00:50:53.779
Yes, sir.

00:50:56.365 --> 00:50:57.366
In fact

00:50:57.908 --> 00:51:00.244
we're also conducting
an internal investigation on him.

00:51:00.327 --> 00:51:03.914
- Sorry?
- Sin-jin has a bad reputation.

00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:07.710
But nobody dares to check
if the rumors are true.

00:51:08.085 --> 00:51:09.628
It's as if messing with Sin-jin is

00:51:09.712 --> 00:51:11.672
doing the unfathomable.

00:51:13.799 --> 00:51:14.967
Tell me

00:51:15.467 --> 00:51:18.846
the real reason I need to become
the Chief Justice.

00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:19.972
Sorry?

00:51:21.182 --> 00:51:22.474
It's you again?

00:51:22.558 --> 00:51:24.393
Is this about Sin-jin?

00:51:25.477 --> 00:51:26.478
Yes, sir.

00:51:27.313 --> 00:51:29.315
I need the Chief Justice to have my back

00:51:29.398 --> 00:51:31.609
in order for me to take on Sin-jin.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.153
I see.

00:51:35.237 --> 00:51:36.447
Are you crazy?

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:37.990
- How dare you...
- But

00:51:38.782 --> 00:51:40.618
Sin-jin isn't the final boss here.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.497
We had an idea
when we began the internal investigation.

00:51:47.833 --> 00:51:49.001
Do you know

00:51:50.628 --> 00:51:51.921
who has his back?

00:52:16.153 --> 00:52:19.156
This looks like a bag full of money.

00:52:20.658 --> 00:52:22.952
Do you know who runs Suojae?

00:52:23.035 --> 00:52:24.036
Sorry?

00:52:25.162 --> 00:52:26.163
I'm not sure.

00:52:27.873 --> 00:52:30.000
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

00:52:47.726 --> 00:52:48.978
This is Baek Yi-seok.

00:52:49.061 --> 00:52:50.854
Hello, Mr. Baek.

00:52:51.772 --> 00:52:54.191
Are you confident about nominating me

00:52:54.275 --> 00:52:55.401
as the next Chief Justice?

00:52:55.484 --> 00:52:57.111
Have you made up your mind?

00:52:59.446 --> 00:53:00.823
Yes, please go ahead with it.

00:53:06.412 --> 00:53:07.413
Sure.

00:53:08.956 --> 00:53:12.293
I'll gladly watch
this audacious rookie's back.

00:53:15.296 --> 00:53:16.380
Thank you, sir!

00:54:14.813 --> 00:54:16.899
- Prosecutor Park?
- Yeah.

00:54:17.566 --> 00:54:19.860
You overheard Prosecutor Kim on the phone
in the hallway

00:54:19.943 --> 00:54:22.237
and ran into Prosecutor Park
at the golf driving range?

00:54:22.821 --> 00:54:23.822
That may not be

00:54:24.615 --> 00:54:26.033
a coincidence.

00:54:27.993 --> 00:54:28.994

00:54:31.121 --> 00:54:32.122
Look into it.

Yes, sir.

What do I tell Mr. Kang, though?

00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:42.466
He told you to do nothing but stay alive.

00:54:46.011 --> 00:54:48.931
Don't get on his nerves.
He doesn't have time for that.

00:54:50.057 --> 00:54:51.141
Yes, sir.

00:54:51.433 --> 00:54:54.353
Why do you keep coming to me?
You love risking your life, anyway.

00:54:56.188 --> 00:54:59.233
The universe may decide when I live or die

00:55:00.192 --> 00:55:02.277
but the Presidential election is soon.

00:55:02.694 --> 00:55:05.697
Who becomes the next leader is
up to the people.

00:55:05.781 --> 00:55:07.241
Exactly.

00:55:08.242 --> 00:55:09.243
Here.

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:12.121
Who's going to win?

00:55:13.247 --> 00:55:15.624
It's one or the other, anyway.

00:55:15.707 --> 00:55:16.708
Why so confused?

00:55:16.792 --> 00:55:19.086
The public opinion polls keep changing.

00:55:19.169 --> 00:55:20.921
I can't predict anything.

00:55:22.714 --> 00:55:23.841
Gosh, old man.

00:55:23.924 --> 00:55:27.970
You talk like a gentleman,
but order me around like a maid.

00:55:29.513 --> 00:55:30.556
Here.

00:55:45.863 --> 00:55:46.989
This one.

00:55:47.448 --> 00:55:49.241
He'll take the jewel and rise.

00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:55.622
KIM YUN-CHEOL
OF THE DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY

00:55:56.248 --> 00:55:58.625
Kim Yun-cheol from the ruling party?

00:55:58.709 --> 00:56:00.961
Having no change of government sounds

00:56:01.503 --> 00:56:03.005
like the best scenario possible.

00:56:35.162 --> 00:56:36.663
Damn it, he's awake.

00:57:03.732 --> 00:57:04.983
I got it done.

00:57:05.901 --> 00:57:06.902
Good work.

00:57:16.912 --> 00:57:22.793
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:57:27.339 --> 00:57:30.259
This contains all records of illegal funds
for the new assemblymen

00:57:30.342 --> 00:57:33.887
and the former and the current Presidents
from the last election.

00:57:34.304 --> 00:57:36.473
Including Mr. Park Gwang-to,
the former President.

00:57:42.396 --> 00:57:43.397
Are you surprised?

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:47.651
Yes, sir.

00:57:49.236 --> 00:57:50.737
Illegal funds

00:57:50.821 --> 00:57:53.073
for the former and current Presidents...

00:57:55.659 --> 00:57:56.994
What a kid.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.122
You thought Presidents would do better?

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:05.043
Nam-yong took these files
while in the National Election Commission.

00:58:06.587 --> 00:58:09.548
I could only get my hands on them
because you kept his son captive.

00:58:12.134 --> 00:58:13.343
I knew it.

00:58:15.637 --> 00:58:16.805
So, Tae-seong

00:58:17.347 --> 00:58:18.640
was not a bait

00:58:19.516 --> 00:58:21.059
but was being held captive.

00:58:22.644 --> 00:58:24.688
Are you disappointed
I didn't tell you sooner?

00:58:31.862 --> 00:58:32.904
No, sir.

00:58:33.447 --> 00:58:35.741
I'll get to end Nam-yong's career

00:58:36.199 --> 00:58:38.952
and you've become more powerful
with those files

00:58:39.036 --> 00:58:40.287
so I'm glad.

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.541
That's right.

00:58:45.709 --> 00:58:48.253
How it ends always matters
more than the way there.

00:58:55.761 --> 00:58:58.013
I want to share this power with you.

00:58:59.598 --> 00:59:00.599
What do you say?

00:59:01.725 --> 00:59:05.604
It's a chance
to join the real power circle.

00:59:10.984 --> 00:59:12.110
He means the Suojae.

00:59:16.365 --> 00:59:18.283
Everyone, please rise.

00:59:29.461 --> 00:59:31.254
Announce Tae-seong as not guilty.

00:59:32.964 --> 00:59:35.384
You want to join the real power circle

00:59:35.467 --> 00:59:37.135
the shadow government that runs Korea?

00:59:37.219 --> 00:59:39.012
This is just a small entry fee for that.

00:59:46.103 --> 00:59:47.771
Everyone, please be seated.

00:59:53.527 --> 00:59:54.695
DEFENDANT

00:59:54.778 --> 00:59:57.364
JUDGE

00:59:57.447 --> 00:59:58.448
Where's the Defendant?

00:59:59.825 --> 01:00:02.577
Sorry, Your Honor.
I can't reach him right now

01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:04.162
but he should be here any minute.

01:00:13.046 --> 01:00:15.006
JUDGE

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:21.847
It's been ten minutes now.

01:00:22.639 --> 01:00:23.974
Do we need to wait any longer?

01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:25.976
Sorry about that.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.921
Tae-seong is holding a press conference.

01:00:55.005 --> 01:00:56.381
- Right now?
- You sure?

01:01:01.511 --> 01:01:02.929
In the past life

01:01:03.013 --> 01:01:05.849
Tae-seong took his own life
with a letter claiming his innocence

01:01:05.932 --> 01:01:08.310
which made the public turn
from cold to empathetic.

01:01:08.393 --> 01:01:09.895
And Nam-yong, who'd lost his son

01:01:09.978 --> 01:01:11.396
became the Chief Justice.

01:01:25.869 --> 01:01:26.870
I knew

01:01:27.746 --> 01:01:29.956
I was faking my work experience

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.210
yet still included
my teaching assistantship and internship

01:01:34.628 --> 01:01:37.339
as work experience
on my application to JB Daehan.

01:01:38.131 --> 01:01:41.301
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR HWANG TAE-SEONG
AND HIS UNFAIR HIRING ALLEGATIONS

01:01:42.177 --> 01:01:43.178
I apologize.

01:01:47.098 --> 01:01:49.184
I'm Gong Hyeon-do of Yujeong Daily.

01:01:49.267 --> 01:01:50.519
When did you submit

01:01:50.602 --> 01:01:52.854
your application to JB Daehan?

01:01:53.522 --> 01:01:56.650
I was tipped off
that you applied after the deadline.

01:01:58.527 --> 01:01:59.694
I submitted it to the HR

01:02:00.737 --> 01:02:02.322
after getting hired.

01:02:05.242 --> 01:02:06.952
Tae-seong!

01:02:28.515 --> 01:02:29.516
Tae-seong!

01:02:29.683 --> 01:02:30.684
Tae-seong!

01:02:42.696 --> 01:02:43.947
Darn it.

01:02:45.073 --> 01:02:46.074
Yeah.

01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:48.535
I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

01:03:00.255 --> 01:03:02.215
Sin-jin will try to kill Tae-seong.

01:03:02.299 --> 01:03:03.466
Guard him, no matter what.

01:03:04.134 --> 01:03:05.135
Who am I?

01:03:05.677 --> 01:03:07.304
I'm Seok Jeong-ho, alright?

01:03:08.597 --> 01:03:10.974
Gosh, why is it raining out of nowhere?

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:12.267
What's with the weather?

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:13.852
I told you to bring an umbrella.

01:03:14.019 --> 01:03:15.395
Hello.

01:03:17.856 --> 01:03:18.940
Your father is

01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:20.859
Justice Hwang Nam-yong, correct?

01:03:22.068 --> 01:03:23.069
Yes.

01:03:23.778 --> 01:03:26.364
Have I been kidnapped?

01:03:26.448 --> 01:03:27.616
Are you stupid?

01:03:28.283 --> 01:03:30.035
I saved your life!

01:03:32.287 --> 01:03:33.330
But

01:03:33.788 --> 01:03:35.957
people will keep coming,
trying to kill you.

01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:38.627
And we can't save you on time every time.

01:03:39.127 --> 01:03:40.837
Who's trying to kill me?

01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:42.505
What did I ever do wrong?

01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:45.342
You had your father get you a job
at JB Daehan.

01:03:45.425 --> 01:03:47.010
I don't deserve death for that!

01:03:47.093 --> 01:03:48.219
No

01:03:48.303 --> 01:03:50.931
that deserves death and more to those
who want your father

01:03:51.014 --> 01:03:52.390
to become the Chief Justice.

01:03:53.099 --> 01:03:56.019
They need you to die
for people to become empathetic

01:03:56.102 --> 01:03:58.313
so your father can finally become
the Chief Justice.

01:04:00.398 --> 01:04:02.233
That's ridiculous.

01:04:02.317 --> 01:04:04.152
- Is it? Really?
- Hey.

01:04:04.235 --> 01:04:05.278
You're saying

01:04:06.613 --> 01:04:08.156
it's not ridiculous

01:04:08.657 --> 01:04:10.992
that you got hired
with the lowest test score?

01:04:11.076 --> 01:04:12.202
Stop.

01:04:13.995 --> 01:04:15.038
Man!

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:19.209
Do you want to live?

01:04:20.585 --> 01:04:21.753
Yes.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.548
Strike first, then.

01:04:26.675 --> 01:04:28.718
I'm Song Na-yeon of Daejin Daily.

01:04:28.802 --> 01:04:29.970
Did Justice Hwang

01:04:30.053 --> 01:04:32.973
also help you get a job at JB Daehan?

01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:37.060
Yes, my father said

01:04:38.019 --> 01:04:41.022
the written exam and the interview were
just for formality

01:04:42.273 --> 01:04:44.484
and that I'd get the job, no matter what.

01:05:07.841 --> 01:05:12.303
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

01:05:12.387 --> 01:05:15.390
The Judiciary is in a huge shock
once again.

01:05:15.473 --> 01:05:17.475
Justice Hwang, under the allegations

01:05:17.559 --> 01:05:20.145
of colluding with unfair hiring practices
and taking bribes

01:05:20.228 --> 01:05:21.938
submitted his letter of resignation.

01:05:22.397 --> 01:05:23.523
The prosecution explained

01:05:23.606 --> 01:05:26.109
Justice Hwang allegedly took bribes
from a construction company

01:05:26.192 --> 01:05:27.444
and used his networks

01:05:27.527 --> 01:05:29.654
to get his son a job he didn't qualify for

01:05:29.738 --> 01:05:32.824
and that they planned on summoning him
for questioning soon.

01:05:33.158 --> 01:05:36.036
Justice Hwang submitted
his letter of resignation this morning

01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:39.289
and left the court without a word.

01:05:42.667 --> 01:05:44.419
The prosecution is aware

01:05:44.544 --> 01:05:46.046
of Justice Hwang receiving bribes

01:05:46.129 --> 01:05:49.632
and his involvement
in unfair hiring practices.

01:05:49.716 --> 01:05:52.552
They will announce
a date for his questioning soon.

01:05:52.635 --> 01:05:54.471
Chief Justice Jeon Heung-woo is

01:05:54.554 --> 01:05:56.806
also taking responsibility by resigning

01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:00.351
for the damaged reputation
of the Judiciary.

01:06:00.643 --> 01:06:02.896
The Office of the President has made

01:06:02.979 --> 01:06:04.898
an official nomination of Baek Yi-seok

01:06:04.981 --> 01:06:06.566
as the next Chief Justice.

01:06:06.649 --> 01:06:08.985
Power changes are happening rapidly
within the Judiciary

01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:11.571
and the employees within the court
are wondering

01:06:11.654 --> 01:06:14.240
if this will signal a reformation

01:06:14.324 --> 01:06:15.992
of the whole system.

01:06:18.203 --> 01:06:21.498
I'll invite you to the room
with the best views once you retire.

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:23.917
Here.

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:43.978
Your son will have to pay
for what he's done.

01:06:45.063 --> 01:06:46.064
But I'll let you get away

01:06:46.147 --> 01:06:48.608
with non-custodial investigation
and probation.

01:06:51.736 --> 01:06:53.321
But of course

01:06:54.989 --> 01:06:57.325
you'd better not let Suojae hear
about our deal.

01:07:21.724 --> 01:07:23.143
What a pathetic man.

01:07:24.352 --> 01:07:26.604
He got bitten in the ass by his own son.

01:07:31.734 --> 01:07:33.361
Here we are.

01:07:45.456 --> 01:07:46.958
Don't trust anyone here.

01:07:47.876 --> 01:07:50.086
And don't speak
unless you're asked a question.

01:07:50.628 --> 01:07:52.964
Don't be surprised
by anything you see or hear.

01:07:55.758 --> 01:07:56.801
You'll look stupid.

01:07:57.844 --> 01:07:58.887
Yes, sir.

01:08:07.604 --> 01:08:09.189
Is today

01:08:09.856 --> 01:08:12.317
the day we fill our treasure chest?

01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:14.611
Yes, sir.

01:08:15.361 --> 01:08:16.487
Mr. Han

01:08:18.323 --> 01:08:21.492
you know why I'm still going so strong
to this day?

01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:23.328
I don't know, sir.

01:08:23.703 --> 01:08:25.371
Because the world is the same.

01:08:26.623 --> 01:08:30.043
It never changes, does it?

01:08:43.806 --> 01:08:44.807
Introduce yourself.

01:08:47.018 --> 01:08:49.187
I'm Judge Lee Han-young
at the Seoul Central Court.

01:08:50.813 --> 01:08:53.650
I'm here
to serve the nation and our people.

01:09:08.456 --> 01:09:09.499
Take a seat.

01:09:41.239 --> 01:09:42.824
This is a special activity fund
from the National Intelligence Service.

01:09:58.006 --> 01:09:59.632
This is from the prosecution.

01:10:12.312 --> 01:10:14.063
This is
from the Ministry of National Defense.

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:26.284
This is from the National Police Agency.

01:10:38.588 --> 01:10:39.714
Alright, then.

01:10:40.673 --> 01:10:42.050
Let's serve our nation.

01:11:08.868 --> 01:11:10.244
These crazy bastards!

01:11:13.414 --> 01:11:17.418
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:42.985
The elimination has begun.

01:11:43.069 --> 01:11:44.195
They have a record
of everywhere we've been

01:11:44.278 --> 01:11:45.613
and our call history!

01:11:45.696 --> 01:11:47.323
Sin-jin is going to catch on soon.

01:11:47.407 --> 01:11:49.409
I'll get rid of Gwang-to,
who relies on mere shamans

01:11:49.492 --> 01:11:51.119
and become the leader of Suojae.

01:11:51.202 --> 01:11:52.662
So, who is that?

01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:53.955
Judge Lee Han-young.

01:11:54.038 --> 01:11:55.706
And Sin-jin is behind it?

01:11:55.915 --> 01:11:58.626
The prosecution will indict him
while in custody

01:11:58.709 --> 01:12:01.712
and Judge Lee, whom we met at the Suojae,
will be on the case.

01:12:02.046 --> 01:12:03.881
Hey, Byeon. Let's save a life.

01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:05.258
Sin-jin and Gwang-to.

01:12:05.341 --> 01:12:06.634
I must stop both of them

01:12:06.717 --> 01:12:09.137
or the country's justice will be gone
for good.

01:12:13.349 --> 01:12:15.351
