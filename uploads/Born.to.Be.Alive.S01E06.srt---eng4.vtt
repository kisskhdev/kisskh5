[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.130
[Episode 6]

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.920
Forget it.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840
Get in the car with us.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.350
Okay.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.979
Thanks, Chief.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.490
As for my colleagues...

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.789
Don't worry.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.979
We'll take them away.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.700
Okay.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.810
You guys, come over this side.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.640
Come here.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.200
Come on, get in the car.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.430
Let's go.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.530
Put it the stuff and come with us.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.910
-Are we going to the Mazhi County?
-Let’s go.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.240
I want to make a trip
to the Telecom Bureau,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.660
and call my chief editor.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.310
Who told you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.770
we're going to the county?

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.480
Then where are we going?

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.370
I'll show you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.470
the real Bolamula.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.060
One, two, push.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.960
One, two, push.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.060
One, two, push.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.900
One, two, push.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.120
Han.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.160
Go get the quilt

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.650
and put it under the wheel.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.020
He Qingyuan.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.170
The car is too heavy.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.770
Take the bucket down.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.190
Okay.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.970
Bai Ju.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.190
Follow me.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.630
Okay.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.450
You two go. Get in the car.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.870
You guys get up.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.450
Come and help.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.640
Come.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.470
Come.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.990
Slowly.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.150
Come.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.670
Done.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.760
The people in front, let go.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.380
Okay, it's done.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.040
Let go more.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.750
Okay.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.900
Can you reach it?

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.500
One, two, three.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.180
One.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.480
One, two, three.

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.190
Well done.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.370
Do you encounter situations like these

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.000
every time you come here?

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.870
Do you mean getting bogged down,

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.800
or

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.480
running into some clueless bumpkin
from the provincial capital?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.630
I...

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.470
It's common to get bogged down.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.710
Trucks are easier to get stuck

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.590
than jeeps.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.460
Patrolling the mountains

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.920
is basically about
combatting two types of illegal activity.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.710
One is poaching,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.640
and the other is `

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.020
The main target of poaching
is Tibetan antelopes.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.030
In Bolamula,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.790
there used to be

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.650
over 200,000 Tibetan antelopes.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.310
Now,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.130
there are only less than 30,000.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.430
Illegal mining

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.290
is gold prospectors
illegally mining placer gold.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.870
Actually, Tibetan antelope

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.400
is more valuable than gold.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.620
In India,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.810
they make shawls

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.440
from Tibetan antelope wool,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.520
called Ring Shawls

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.350
What is a Ring Shawl?

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.070
The texture of this shawl

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.870
is very light.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.010
It can go through

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.860
a ring.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.660
Then is it also illegal

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.140
to harvest brine shrimps?

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.510
They have no fishing license.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.840
Of course it's illegal.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.510
When we eventually develop

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.120
the Economic Development Zone,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.450
we'll define an area

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.740
and fix quotas for them,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.440
like mineral resources,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.970
so it can be mined and developed

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.100
in a reasonable way.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.870
When you go back

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:48.450
and see

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.060
our research report
on the development zone,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.060
you will be clear.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.500
Okay.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.409
Thank you.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.710
It's here!

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.550
It's them!

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.100
Don't move!

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.000
Don’t move!

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.550
We are the Mountain Patrol.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.890
Stop!

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.300
Stop!

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.310
Stop!

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.010
Don't move!

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.500
Hands on your head.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.390
Come here! Stop!

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.050
Don't move! Hands on your head!

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.450
Squat down!

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.710
Stop right there!

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.580
Stay in the car. Don't come over.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.040
Don't move.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.700
Don't move.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.140
Don't move.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.070
I'll shoot if you move.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.730
Don't move!

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.630
Stop!

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.450
Don't move.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.400
Come down. Put yout hands up.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.830
Hands up!

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.770
Get up.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.130
Come down here.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.070
Get up.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.300
Get up.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.960
Squat properly.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.890
Squat properly.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.120
Hurry up.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.630
Get up.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.960
Come here.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.390
Squat down.
Squat!

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.950
Do you have a gun?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.010
No.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.540
I transport pelt.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.980
I didn't bring a gun.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.820
Come here!

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.900
Get down!

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.340
Captain.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.630
There are so many people.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.890
It's troublesome to transport them out.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.660
Let's fine them first.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.040
Okay.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.040
Who is the leader?

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.190
I'm asking you.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.190
Who is the leader?

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.560
Stand up.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
What's your name?

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.420
My name is Liu San.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.740
We are

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.740
the Mountain Patrols

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.930
from Mazhi County's
economic development company.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.400
We are fining you

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.310
for suspected of illegal transportation

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.570
of wildlife products.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.020
How many pelt for these?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.080
150.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.530
How much?

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.550
150.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.420
Turn around and have a look.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.330
This is 150.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.250
200?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.130
The fine is 1,200 yuan.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:06.390
Pay up.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.930
Sure, I'll pay.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.710
Didn't I ask you

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.710
to wait in the car?

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.740
I think

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.660
it's safer

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.090
being together with you.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.280
Why did they

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.710
bury the sheep skin here?

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.560
After the poachers hunt the sheep,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.390
they will bury the leather skin

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.720
at the rendezvous spot.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.030
The buyer will hire someone

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.360
to dig out the sheep skin

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.350
and then transport it overseas.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.260
In this way,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.799
they avoid the police

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.289
and our inspection

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.220
along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.470
Where are you going?

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.570
Where are you going?

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.240
I need to go to the bathroom.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.840
Together.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.960
I'm sorry.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.120
I'm sorry.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.840
Stop!

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.850
Stop the car!

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.390
Stop! Don't move!

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.430
What is that car for?

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.040
To pick us up.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.400
Stop him!

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.960
Stop!

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.460
Bastard!

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:55.680
Stop!

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.500
Don't move!

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.260
Don't move!

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.580
Stop running!

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.240
Stop!

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.080
Stop! Stop running!

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.920
Put down your gun.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.910
Don't move!

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.250
Don't move.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:40.940
Don't move.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.480
Don't move!

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.480
Bring me the gun.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.750
Get up!

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.890
Get him to stand up!

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.090
Why didn't you shoot?

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.920
Do you want to die here?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.150
I saw his eyes.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.130
What about it?

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.990
Didn't you see his gun?

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:29.860
He looks

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.490
around the same age as Bai Ji.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.290
At home...

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:34.930
Maybe

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.290
this is not someone's home.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.550
This is Bolamula.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.630
People with guns

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.690
are all fugitives.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.380
He points a gun at you.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.130
You pity him

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200
and give him a chance,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.860
Then there's only one result.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.240
There's no chance to start over.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.340
Do you understand?

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.650
If you were the one who fell just now,

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:03.890
all the members

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.420
and those who care about you

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.950
will never forgive themselves.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.140
131.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.840
132.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.190
133.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.290
134.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.350
135.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.860
136.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.470
137.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:36.910
Do you smoke?

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:38.390
138.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.480
139.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.820
140.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.240
Hurry up.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.000
142.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.940
143.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.580
144.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.870
145.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.090
146.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.790
14...

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.550
-147.
-Why did you poach antelopes?

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.290
For money.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.620
148.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.730
How much is an antelope?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.730
I don't poach antelopes.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.190
I specialise in skinning.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.770
How much is skinning an antelope?

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.430
Seven yuan.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.790
156.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.540
More.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.190
Let me help you.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.980
No, no, no.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.600
It's okay.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.460
Let me help you.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.050
Sure.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.390
Shao.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.750
Take a rest.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.000
Have some noodles.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.550
Okay.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:54.910
Thank you.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.270
More soup, please.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.370
Sangba.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.980
Nothing is better than

00:13:59.010 --> 00:13:59.860
the soup of instant noodles.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.920
Yes, that’s right.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.250
Captain.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:03.850
Thank you.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.480
Sangba.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.420
How much food do we have left?

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.350
We have enough supplies this time.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.720
We still have five packs
of instant noodles

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.520
and a beef leg,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:12.880
We barely ate

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.940
the bag of flat bread too.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:14.910
We need to

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.390
It's enough food for us
for more than ten days.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:17.740
Wait.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.430
Cook all the instant noodles.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.500
And go ahead

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.220
and give them some flat bread.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.120
Tonight,

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.840
we'll all rest early.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.290
We'll head out

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.190
as soon as it gets light tomorrow.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.600
Go.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.530
Wait.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.210
Come on.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:38.940
Don't move.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.300
Both of you, don’t move.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.100
Han, Zhacuo, don't move.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.640
Wait.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.010
Wait. Don't move.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:44.620
Wait.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:45.970
Don't move.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.600
Don’t move.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.560
Captain.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.280
Come with me.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.050
What's wrong?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.640
We can't go back.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.310
The mineral exploration mission

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.440
has barely started.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.050
Look.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.390
We haven't even been to

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.240
the Wild Ox Valley and Gangcha Peak.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:09.950
I know.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.080
But you can't be bringing

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.290
two trucks of people

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.260
and

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.790
a journalist from the provincial city.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.600
on a weeks-long journey

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.130
to explore the mine, right?

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.650
How about this?

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.220
Let Bai Ju and Zhacuo

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.270
lead them out first.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.120
We continue our journey.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.950
No.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.220
It's too dangerous.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.440
But the county

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.380
urged us many times.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.640
This is a special case.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.200
I'll explain to them.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:33.840
We always

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.790
have special situations.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.370
The county

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.830
won't hear us out anymore.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.030
The one-month deadline

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.290
is coming really soon.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.100
Don't worry.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.940
I know what to do.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.860
Captain, can we eat now?

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.390
Go ahead.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.600
Here, boil it.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:11.690
Here.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.840
Is it raw?.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:18.960
Eat it.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.750
It's hygienic.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.610
It tastes good.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.620
It's fresh.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.270
Try it.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.320
Eat.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:23.680
Eat.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.000
Try it.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.870
Just eat it straight?

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.440
Yes.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.110
Eat.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.120
Is it not good?

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.470
I don’t think so.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.030
Captain.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.430
Those people...

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.500
No one was watching them just now.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.099
They didn't run away either.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.290
They don't have food.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.020
Without a car,

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.500
they can't get out of this place.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.829
They can only follow us.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.490
Han treats them quite well.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.530
He used to poach antelopes.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.730
They were in cahoots.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.730
Really?

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.420
Han

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.800
indeed used to poach

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.830
with the bandits.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.830
Then he was caught by the Mountain Patrol

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.630
and stayed in prison for a while.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.720
After being discharged,
he had nothing to do.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.520
So, Captain kept him in the team.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.550
You are really generous

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.070
to be willing to keep him.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.400
Isn't it good to stay?

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.550
One less goat hunter,

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.610
and one more goat protector.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.930
How good is that.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.490
Captain, there are still some left.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.530
Han! Han!

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.080
Have you hunted a goat before?

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.970
Who said that?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.130
Have you ever poach one before?

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.400
Did you say that?

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.770
Did you?

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.440
No.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.600
No.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.460
It must be you.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.110
Do you want a beating?

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.850
Captain,

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.420
If poachers beat someone up,

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.980
are you going to do anything about it?

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.140
Talk to the police.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.340
Police officer, are you going
to do anything?

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.130
Childish.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.360
Han. Han.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.300
Tell me.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.270
Just tell me.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:47.750
Tell me.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.010
Initially,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.420
I was herding animals for others.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.550
Then the grassland became dessert.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.040
The goats couldn't live.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.300
And I had nothing to do.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.380
Later, I heard that

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.340
you can earn money
at the Uninhabited Zone.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.170
So I came in.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.360
Can you

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.380
do it at that time?

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.980
I can't do it at first.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.590
But when you see it more often,
you'll get used to it.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.510
Once,

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.290
the boss killed someone

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.060
who wanted to run away.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.620
And I git scared.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.350
No one governs the Uninhabited Zone.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.580
As time goes by,

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.070
you'll think you're allowed
to do anything.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.430
Since

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.540
Bolamula is so dangerous,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.900
and the number of Tibetan antelopes

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.830
is so little,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.030
why don't you breed the Tibetan antelopes

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.270
in captivity

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.460
through a breeding base

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.300
just like for pandas.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.300
Isn't that great?

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.940
Why are you laughing?

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.880
The high-altitude area

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.980
is their true home.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.560
The weather here is cold

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.100
and there is less oxygen.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.140
Alpine plants

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.270
is their food.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.730
They can't get used to living

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.090
at where humans live.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:05.350
They are

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.020
the messengers of King Gosal,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.550
and the elfs on the plateau.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.480
Yes.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.470
He,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.160
did you bring the Dramyin?

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.850
Yes.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:24.520
He is the singer

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.330
among us.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.900
Really?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.220
He.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.370
please perform

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:31.700
"Dear Young Friend"

for

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.480
our journalist, could you?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:33.980
Okay.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.220
Okay.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.200
Okay.

Captain scolded you today

for your own good.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.510
You could hear it

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.460
from so far away?

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.110
I didn't.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.010
Then why did you say that?

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.900
From what I know about him,

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.800
he's right.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.770
If he didn't shoot in time,

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.180
perhaps someone

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:21.890
in the team

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.120
will get injured because of my mistake.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:29.910
I think

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.430
I've become a trouble.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:36.450
Alright.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.020
Just don't make the same mistake

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.820
the next time.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.700
Next time?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.200
Do I still get a next time?

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.710
Hey,

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.360
stop turning around.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.290
It gets more chilly when you do that.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:54.640
The little warmth left in the blankets

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.840
all left as you turn.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:57.160
Stop tossing and turning.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.490
What warmth were there?

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.610
The muddy quilt makes me even colder.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.870
I rather not sleep with it.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.040
Give it to me then.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.980
Fine, sleep with it.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.120
It's better than not.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.570
Yes.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.890
I won't give it to her.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.770
Are you not cold?

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:21.680
No, no.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.220
I...

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.280
I took this out.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.840
Otherwise, it bothers me.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.960
What's wrong?

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.200
Do you know

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200
what bone this is?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.100
I know.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.160
It's a goat's.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:39.660
Goat's?

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.360
It's Tibetan antelope's bone.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.800
Well...

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.130
I'm sorry, County Mayor Lin.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.170
It's okay.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.650
It's cold and I should've changed it
anyway.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.440
I'm really sorry.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.220
I only came to report to you now.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.830
It's nothing.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.350
You safely

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.000
returning from the Bolamula.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.140
That's the most important thing.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:35.800
Have a seat.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:36.450
Okay.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.710
How was it?

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.610
You must be scared.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.210
You must have suffered a lot.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.050
It really was scary.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.970
I... I didn't suffer much.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.630
I just suffered from the dirt.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:47.810
But

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.680
I got a lot of first-hand materials.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.480
It's worth it.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.880
But I should've

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.440
come back after I'm done organising them.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.440
Please excuse me.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:55.960
I just like

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.140
young people like you

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.410
who focus on work

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.100
and don't care about trifles.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.740
Sit.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.440
Here.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:05.290
Have a seat.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.090
This

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.510
is the photo

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.050
from the investment inspection tour

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.060
and the first draft of the report.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.270
My secretary

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:17.960
took the photo.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.890
So that's what it is.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.550
But the writing...

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.740
Help me proofread

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.370
and refine it.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.960
Edit it for me.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.720
Okay, don't worry, County Mayor Lin.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.320
I will

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.750
write this article well.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.480
And...

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.960
County Mayor Lin.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.020
Although this time

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.720
my visit to the Bolamula

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.890
was accidental,

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.040
I gained a lot.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.850
The Uninhabited Zone

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:36.460
not only

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.290
has undeveloped mineral resources,

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:39.250
it also has

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.130
undeveloped news resources.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.180
I think the Mazhi County

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.570
should promote this aspect,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:43.480
place more importance

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.700
on this deserted place,

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.700
so that more people

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.240
can understand us.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.770
That's indeed a good thing.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.310
Tell me your ideas.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:50.550
County Mayor Lin.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.680
Here's what I think.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.160
Because the poaching and
illegal mining situation

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.480
in the Uninhabited Zone

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.570
are very rampant.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.610
I think

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.030
we can make a special report on it.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.270
It can improve

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.220
people's environmental awareness

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.240
to protect wild animals

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240
and mineral resources.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:02.830
How about this? We...

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:03.380
Shao.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.790
Have a seat.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.440
The county attaches great importance

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.900
to the development
of the Uninhabited Zone.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.480
The County Public Security Bureau

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.590
and Deputy County Mayor Duo's

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.250
Mountain Patrol

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:17.800
are actively attacking

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.490
poaching and illegal mining.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.140
But

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.050
the priority of our county

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.620
is to develop the economy.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.760
if the economy doesn't develop,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.560
all of this is just an empty talk.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.850
You wrote an article on economy

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.920
on the provincial newspaper.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.920
I read it well.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.740
You are so young

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.180
but your understanding of

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:36.720
the importance of economic development

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.740
and the relationship between stakeholder

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.010
are better than mine.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.010
No, no.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.400
Sir, you flatter me.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:42.790
I...

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.250
Okay, I understand.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.770
County Mayor Lin,

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:50.920
I'm just a journalist.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.120
The things that I know

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.330
and am interested in

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:53.900
might be

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.460
very limited,

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:56.960
unlike you

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.510
who consider the full picture.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.010
How about this?

00:26:59.010 --> 00:26:59.440
I...

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:00.550
I will...

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.050
I'll go back

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:01.920
and revise

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.980
the article,

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.520
Strive to fire the first shot

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.530
in promoting Mazhi County.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.880
Then I’ll leave it to you.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.680
Greet Chief Editor Huang for me.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.180
Okay.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.700
Let me see you off.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.030
Okay.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.500
The station is right across the road

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.590
where those people are waiting.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.260
It's right across the road.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.010
No need. No need.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.140
I can walk by myself.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.060
I won't bother you.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.320
I didn't ask you

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.350
to stay for a meal.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.440
I'm really sorry for you.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.420
No, no.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.760
Can I get a cup of hot water?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.510
On the way here,

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.790
I didn't get to have anything warm.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.440
That's easy.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.890
Here.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.260
Give it to me.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:35.960
Okay.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.290
Does the bus stop here?

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.460
Okay, thank you.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.000
Someone came.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.180
What about it?

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.910
I think he's taking a photo.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.740
Another journalist?

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.250
Let me see.

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:36.810
This man...

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.330
Why does he

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.790
look familiar?

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.160
Is it another reporter?

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:44.840
It's the same reporter.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.040
Am I seeing a ghost?

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.400
Didn't he leave?

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.650
It's not a ghost.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.510
It's him.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.380
He's

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.220
waving at you.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.240
Not me.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.460
He's waving at you.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.580
I’ll tell Captain

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.040
that reporter spy is here.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.200
Zhacuo.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.400
Zhacuo.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.460
Bye.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.350
Hello.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.570
I'm finally here.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.400
The car I took

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400
broke down again.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.900
Chief reporter.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.920
Did you

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.200
leave something here?

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.320
No, no.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:49.410
Why did you

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.380
come here again?

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.900
I'm here

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.810
to join you.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.590
I want some water.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.150
Editor-in-Chief,

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:03.650
Bolamula

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.410
is full of treasures.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.460
There are more materials than gold.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.520
I'm now

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.500
a robber now.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.590
These days of experience

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.050
is enough to write a novel.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.510
No.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.950
Don't you believe me?

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.590
I'll write it in the report.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:20.540
No, I'm not bragging.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.480
There are really a lot of things

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.720
to shoot and write.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.640
Stop talking nonsense.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.850
these useless things.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:26.850
I asked you to write a feature report

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.830
on the investment promotion conference.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:28.530
The county said

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.930
you didn't show up at all.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.410
How do I explain to them?

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.010
Do you think

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.210
you're going on a paid work trip?

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.490
No, Chief Editor.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.450
I'm doing this for your sake.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.200
Think about it.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:37.850
Our evening newspaper

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.220
is short of an explosive news.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.750
Which one do you think is more eye-catching,

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.030
an in investment promotion conference

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:42.980
in a poor county,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.610
or a poaching incident

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.010
in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.210
This news

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.770
has social importance,

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.700
can create buzz,

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.230
and is interesting.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.880
Who would have thought

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.550
in such a difficult environment,

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.720
there's such a group of people

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.190
locking in such a life-and-death struggle

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.610
with the poachers.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:58.960
It's such a thrilling news.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.430
Once it's announced,

00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.970
our sales

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.130
will go up in a flash.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.670
This way,

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.250
the issue with our bonus is solved,

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.680
and your mission is completed.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.260
Right?

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.570
Five days.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.510
Five, no, no.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.530
Five days is definitely not enough.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:10.090
Because for one trip to the mountains,

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.630
He's writing about us.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.330
I need at least 20 day.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.970
Then will I be on the newspaper?

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:14.840
How about a month.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.100
Listen to his boasts.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.460
He is another spy

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.340
County Mayor Lin sent

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.500
to supervise us.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.510
Who are you talking about?

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.850
Zhacuo, what do you think?

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.280
Yes.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.710
He's talking about you.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.390
If he really stays,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.810
will he write about me?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.480
Probably.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:42.790
A misguided youth.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.480
Come on.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.180
What for?

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.450
Count him down.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.170
Ask him to pay the phone bill.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.250
Yes.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.190
Hurry up.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.060
One month.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.600
Yes, just one month.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.560
If

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.480
I exceed...

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.780
If I exceed the deadline by a day...

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.160
Then it's just one day.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.540
You can't argue with me,

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.120
can you?

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.570
Are we allowing the Reporter Shao

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:24.390
to stay?

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.840
He's a reporter

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.250
and interested in us.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:29.570
Isn't this

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.750
promotion for free?

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.470
If we can make more people

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.690
know us

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.900
through his articles,

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.400
it'll be quite helpful.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.340
You can't even

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:42.120
pay for such a person to come.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.520
It's good to let him stay.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.410
Okay.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.130
But he's a reporter
from the provincial capital.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.780
He has no experience

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.640
working in the highland wilderness.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.200
If he follows us to the mountains,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:53.850
whether he can adapt to

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:54.660
the high-altitude environment

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.400
is a problem.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:56.700
More importantly,

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.110
all poachers in the Uninhabited Zone

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.250
own guns.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.830
Bullets are blind.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.400
We don't have bulletproof vests either.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:03.860
Then...

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.440
Why are you laughing?

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.310
You can't let him

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.440
go into the mountain with a face basin.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.380
What if

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.350
something happens to him,

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.830
how can we take the responsibility?

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.320
How about this?

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.770
We don't know when is the next time

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.170
we head to the mountains.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.400
Let him stay in the team

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.220
for a few days

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.750
to get used the environment.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.030
If he can't stand it,

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:29.310
we'll ask him to leave.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.500
In the future,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.410
when he comes with us to the mountains,

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.870
if we encounter captures,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.070
make it a rule

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.860
for him to not to get off the truck.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.940
When we're safe,

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.130
he can get off the truck to interview.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.090
That's good.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.110
I agree.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.140
It's settled then.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.890
Show him

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.660
my notes.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.160
It might help him

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.050
with his writing.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.680
Okay.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.540
I...

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.430
You agreed too?

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.250
That's it.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.460
I wanted to say

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.400
that his stay

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.900
means there's another mouth to eat.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.219
We should make him pay for his meals.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:11.770
Okay.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800
Don't worry.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.030
Okay.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.120
I'm hanging up. Bye.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.190
My boss has agreed.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.230
I can stay.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.010
What about Captain Duojie?

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:23.810
He agreed too.

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:24.920
Good. Good.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.530
Good.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:26.550
That's great!

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.570
This is Captain’s work notes.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.719
You can refer to it.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.630
Okay, thank you.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.510
Then

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.270
where should I sleep?

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.000
Pay up first.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.929
Food and accommodation fee.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.980
W-Why do I need to pay

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.940
staying here?

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.480
Our dorm and canteen

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.120
are free.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.400
Only you need to pay.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:49.610
I have no money.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.100
We heard it just now.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:51.940
Your leader said

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.310
you're on a paid business trip.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.440
You must have money.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.360
Give it to me.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:56.820
It was all taken away

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.980
while catching brine shrimp, wasn't it?

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.570
I'm really completely broke

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.010
without a single penny now.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.590
Really.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.780
Reporter Shao.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.550
Can you speak English?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.090
Yes.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.910
I passed level four in English.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:09.100
That's great.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:10.500
Can you tutor me?

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.150
Well,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.990
tutoring can cover the accommodation fee,
right?

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.030
Are you dreaming?

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.030
In the future,

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.120
do labour work to repay your debt.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:23.660
Fine.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.880
As long as you let me stay,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.940
whatever you want.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.750
I...

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.740
There are only a few beds.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.920
Suit yourself.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:32.940
Okay, I'll take this one.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:33.670
This is good.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.680
Right?

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.510
Change another one.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.670
This...

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.380
Nice hat.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.040
Why isn't anyone wearing it?

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.890
That's Dongzhiba's bed.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.130
He sacrificed.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.400
Bai Shao.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.760
It's the end of the month.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.750
We have a debt

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:03.980
that doesn't match.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.870
I might have to work overtime today.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.300
It doesn't matter.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.300
I'll wait for you.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.860
Let's watch movies tonight.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.320
They're playing After Separation tonight.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.290
But my brother and my mom

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.730
have been arguing recently.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.550
My mom asked me

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:21.310
to go home

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.660
as soon as I finish work.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.920
Well,

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.930
are we not watching

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.790
After Separation anymore?

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.180
We are

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.880
Who said we aren't?

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.410
I'll wait for you.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:44.740
Ma'am,

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.070
the research report you made us write

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:47.030
on gynaecological illnesses

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.030
among women in pastoral areas

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.590
is out.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.690
We combined

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.440
the medical records
from the past three years

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.360
and organized

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.590
three dedicated field study.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.760
We sampled 320 women

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.570
between 18 to 45

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:57.520
for this report.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.670
The only issue is the number of samples
is too small.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:01.940
The pastoral area is too big.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:02.910
Sometimes,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.170
we can only visit

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.790
two or three pastors ina day.

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:07.490
Trichomoniasis,

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.170
bacterial infections,

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.070
and chlamydia.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.210
The situation is more serious
than expected.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:15.120
Yes.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.870
We don't usually think so.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.490
But once we collected the statistics,

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.570
the disease rate

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.170
is unexpectedly high.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:21.860
One of

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.280
the important reasons is

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.000
it's too far for the herdsmen

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.360
to buy toilet paper at the county.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.090
And toilet paper is expensive.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.130
Director Zhang

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.800
never praised me.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.260
The seniors.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.490
have gone to the city one after another.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.270
I'm the only one left.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.290
I'm afraid I can't do it well.

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:43.820
I'm under a lot of pressure.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.380
What pressure?

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.930
You've done very well.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.010
Look at me.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.480
I'm not as good as you.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.070
Bai Ji.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.140
You're no match for me.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:00.530
Yes.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.240
I'm no match for you.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.240
I've made mistakes,

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.030
was fined,

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:12.050
and detained.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.510
It's good enough

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.570
to not go to prison.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.550
I mean,

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:21.450
you don't have to compete with me.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.320
There's no end in comparison.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.480
You don't have a job.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.540
Just find one.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:27.860
You must have

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.540
something you're the best at.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.270
When I went on a patrol,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.050
the herdsmen told me

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.130
even every grass on the prairie

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.210
knows

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.560
where they should grow.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:48.940
Well,

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.640
When I find my location,

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.360
I'll tell you first, okay?

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.480
No.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.150
You have to

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.640
tell Director Zhang first

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.220
and tell me second.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:12.700
Okay.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.710
Eat up.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.370
Come on.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:20.830
Young man, have some tea.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.530
Here.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.000
Have some tea. Thank you.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.630
Here, Bai.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:29.810
Have some tea.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.330
Okay.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.520
Here, go have some tea.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.150
Okay.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.550
Come on.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:37.370
Have some tea.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:40.110
Thank you, Aunty.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.130
You’re welcome.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.590
Here, you must be tired.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:43.750
Here, tea.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.630
Have some.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.980
Thank you, Aunty.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.240
You guys must be tired.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:49.740
Have a good rest.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.860
This is a cow's leg

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.820
for you.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.590
Okay.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:55.300
Thank you.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.360
Thank you, Aunty.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.590
50 jin of tsampa.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.690
50 jin?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.040
Didn't we agree

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:02.710
on 40 jin?

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:03.530
You have one more person

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.940
in your team.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.500
He can eat.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:07.860
This afternoon,

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.750
he ate a lot

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.480
of my tsampa.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.600
No, Aunty.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.340
Didn’t we agree

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.600
not to talk about this?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.210
It's okay.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:15.710
Eat more tsampa.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.280
It's good for your health.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.290
Right?

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.700
I didn't eat that much.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.140
Here, have some more.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.030
Thank you.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.960
You're welcome.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.320
Here.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:24.090
Thank you.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:24.480
Finish it

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.480
and get back to work.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:25.860
Come.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.060
Especially you.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.230
Get back to work.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.300
Do you want to stay for dinner?

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.430
There's dinner?

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.130
Go.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.000
Get back to work.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.400
OK.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.590
They've worked hard.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:38.380
No, no.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:42.730
They...

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.440
Here.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.940
Here.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.420
You...

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.360
This is...

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:55.670
You've eaten too much.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.420
Stop eating.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.440
If I don't eat, my brain doesn't work.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.390
And what I eat

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.490
is my own portion.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.190
Let me remind you.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.070
There's a fixed amount of tsampa

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.730
each person gets every month.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.300
If you had finished eating,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.550
you can only have noodles soup.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.280
Every month?

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.070
Yes.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.110
Isn't it every week?

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.400
Five jin of tsampa a week.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.430
Do you think
you're the county committee secretary?

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.810
We are

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.400
looking for...

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.360
We are

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.250
looking for...

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.320
5 jin a month.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:37.930
No, no.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.070
1,000.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.400
1,500, 2,000.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.090
2,000.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:46.860
5,000.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.510
5 times 5 is 25? No.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.510
What's wrong?

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.010
The whole team gets 50 jin a month.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:53.470
No, no.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:54.190
Stop talking.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.050
I'm not talking about the tsampa.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.410
I'm talking about...

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.690
No way.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.430
This is bad.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.040
No! No!

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.080
Captain Duojie.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.440
Captain Duojie.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.820
What’s wrong with him?

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:08.920
Are you full?
