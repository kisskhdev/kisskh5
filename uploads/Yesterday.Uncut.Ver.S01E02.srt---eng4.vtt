00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.880
We now turn to a breaking story
shaking the business world.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.640
Vivatpattana Group
is facing allegations of a data leak

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.000
as well as a severe liquidity crisis.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.600
Although no official statement
has been made

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.160
by Mr. Watt Vivatpattana, the CEO,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.280
who has yet to be contacted,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.153
the allegations alone have caused

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:11.480
significant economic
and social repercussions.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.193
The public is now watching
how this crisis will unfold

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.960
and whether it will be handled

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.433
with transparency and urgency,

00:01:20.473 --> 00:01:22.760
demanding not only explanations

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.840
but concrete action plans.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.580
Cheers.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.760
The number of clients with high net worth
at Thada Chartered Bank

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.920
has grown by 30 percent
within just one year.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.000
Congratulations, Mr. Khun.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.640
At just 30 years old, you've already
risen to the position of chairman.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.120
What a rising leader
of the new generation.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.600
Not really.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.640
I'm nowhere near my grandfather
or my father yet,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.760
and I still have a lot more to learn.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.940
Always so humble.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.440
By the way, when would you be available?

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.440
I have a new project
I'd like to present to you.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.040
Wait,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.520
isn't that Mr. Vier Vivatpattana,
Mr. Watt's son?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.233
I haven't seen him in ages.

00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:26.720
What brought him here today?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.240
I wonder about that, too.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.560
How have you been, Vier?
Haven't seen you in ages.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.800
Mr. Khun.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.720
- You haven't changed at all.
- Mr. Khun...

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.173
I'll talk to you later.

00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:37.240
Please excuse me.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.640
Well...

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.800
Mr. Khun...

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.360
Vier...

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.720
Long time no see.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:10.440
♫What is left are shadows of ourselves
standing in its place♫

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.400
♫And the scars of our pain♫

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.040
♫That will never fade away♫

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.240
♫What is left is the gaping wound of the past♫

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.600
♫Imprisoned by the love
neither of us could never grasp♫

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.840
♫If we could turn back time,♫

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.760
♫I wonder if we'd hold each other again♫

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.520
How did you get that scar?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.560
Is that from when you were kidnapped?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.320
Yeah.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.800
Why?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.600
You don't like me anymore?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.320
Whatever happened to you,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.680
I still like you.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.120
I still remember that night we shared.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.880
So, where have you been?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.960
You didn't even reach out.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.240
You know,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.200
someone's been missing you.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.760
I went on vacation.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.760
But I...

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.320
still kept up with things here.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.240
That's how I found out...

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.000
Thada Chartered has a new chairman now.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.560
So you were keeping tabs on me?

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.000
Of course I was.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.560
After all, we were...

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.640
friends.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.160
I missed you.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520
Why did you stop?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.160
We can do it here.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.600
I don't mind.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.040
You must have taken...

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.520
quite a lot of bribes, haven't you?

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.440
What do you mean?

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.400
Look at this.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.600
Keep scrolling.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.640
There's a lot more.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.600
What the hell are you trying to do?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.480
It's just that...

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.840
VPG Group is looking for some funding
at the moment.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.400
Your company's losses

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.680
are because your father
stepped into the hotel business himself.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.120
It has nothing to do with me.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.320
I just...

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.200
miss the friendship we once had.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.480
I'd like us to work together again.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.440
Take some time to think it over.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.320
It's been so long.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.400
Kelvin?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.240
Let go of me.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.800
You're so shocked, aren't you?

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.840
Let go of me.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.000
Have you been drinking?

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.760
Why does it matter?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.720
What did you do with Khun?

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.480
Why?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You're okay seeing everyone else,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.120
but not me?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.720
Why should it matter to you?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.080
Let go of me.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.760
Let go.

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:38.708
Did you sleep with Khun?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.880
Did you?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.120
Answer me!

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.420
Why?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.680
Even if I did,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.440
what's wrong with it?

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.840
How could you do that

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.240
when you're the only one I have?!

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.400
How?!

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.440
Let go of me.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.520
I won't.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.400
You can't sleep with anyone else.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.560
You have to be with me!

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480
Got it?!

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.808
Why?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.720
If you come any closer,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.400
don't blame me.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.133
I'm serious.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.400
Hey!

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.720
I know I messed up,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.960
but are you really not gonna forgive me?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.520
You've gone out of your mind.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.360
You still haven't answered me.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.920
If you don't,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.760
I won't let you go.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.920
Fine, fine. I'll tell you.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.620
But... can we take care
of your wound first?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160
Are you worried about me?

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.920
That room...

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.840
There should be a first-aid kit in it.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.560
Come with me.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.800
Hey!

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.080
Vier!

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.560
Vier!

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.080
Let me out!

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.320
Vier!

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.520
You won't get away from me!

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.440
Damn it!

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.440
Vier...

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.240
You won't get away from me.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440
You're awake?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Did you sleep well?

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.000
You wore this pajama set last year.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.360
You even bought one for me.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.840
Remember?

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.600
How did you know where I was?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.720
Long time no see.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.720
This has gone too far.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.320
What the hell do you want?

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.040
I love you.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.240
Chiang Mai, please.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.640
Yes, sir.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680
He's checking in.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.600
I've been...

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.740
watching you ever since the taxi ride.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:33.920
Vier...

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.920
Can we be the same again?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.360
No.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.560
If I had chosen
not to contact him that day,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.440
my life might not have
turned out this way.

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:51.840
Meet me tonight at 8 P.M.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.640
I'll send you my location.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.320
Jeez.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.520
Mind if I vent a little?

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.200
This freaking traffic
is driving me nuts.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.120
Earlier at the airport,
someone took my luggage by accident.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.120
Good thing I noticed right away,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.640
or I'd never have gotten it back.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.880
By the way,

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.160
this is the luggage you asked me to get.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.833
Tell me.

00:16:35.873 --> 00:16:38.240
Are you planning to stay here
instead of going home?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.600
Lit...

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.600
What?

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.600
My parents don't even nag this much.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.000
Look,

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.280
I already booked
another room like this one.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.960
I even booked you a spa session.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.880
Wherever you feel sore,

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.920
go get a massage, buddy.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.800
But...

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.240
I thought you said
you weren't investing anymore.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.880
Why are you not going home?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.120
And now you're making me come here, too.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.640
I said I wouldn't invest in King Group,

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.280
not that I'm done investing altogether.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.200
And what other option
could be better than King Group?

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.940
Kelvin.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.160
But isn't he part of King Group?

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.080
He's just an insignificant heir

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.880
and a pitiful little boy.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.640
Pitiful?

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.073
You can't do this
just because you feel sorry for him.

00:17:36.113 --> 00:17:37.480
This is business.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.600
I think he's the real deal.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.880
His taste and appearance
are both impressive.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.720
I've never been wrong about people.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.760
He's patient,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.200
brilliant, and hardworking,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.800
yet he keeps it all hidden.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.760
Keeps it hidden?

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.840
Well...

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.040
not only does he hide
his sharp intelligence,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.880
he also hides his ambition
and determination.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.360
I'm telling you, he's extraordinary.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.700
I mean,

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.600
that's an even higher risk.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.240
Come on, man.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.760
At least our company
has never refused to invest

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.960
in small but profitable businesses.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.740
Besides,

00:18:30.144 --> 00:18:34.960
I want to invest
in my own hotel business.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.080
So you're bringing someone else in?

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:44.800
What about me?

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.240
That's why, man.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.240
That's why I called you here.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.400
I want you to help me look into it.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.031
I'm sure our judgment

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.160
is good enough.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.760
Fine.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880
So...

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.160
what's next?

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.680
What are you gonna do first?

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.580
What do you want to know?

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.920
How?

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.540
And when?

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.580
Let's see...

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.640
how long he can keep it hidden.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.080
You're Kelvin, right?

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.280
Yes.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.040
Welcome to the party.

00:20:24.888 --> 00:20:26.920
Hey, Vier. It's your friend.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.640
Kelvin?

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.040
Hi, Kelvin.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.280
Vier has told me a lot about you.

00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:46.937
You're the second heir
of King Group, right?

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.320
Uh...

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200
Not exactly.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.720
Oh...

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.440
Kelvin's really great at designing

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.120
and running hotels.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.200
Wanna talk to them?

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.800
You don't.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.640
Let's just drink. Come on.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.040
Alright, cheers.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.880
Come on.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.320
Cheers.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.800
Take it easy.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.640
If you don't start now, when will you?

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.360
This is such a great place.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.240
Do you want more?

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440
Are you not enjoying yourself?

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.320
I thought it'd be just us.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.080
Okay, fine.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.480
Here. Cheers.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:07.880
Let's hurry.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.374
But I never said

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.080
it would be just us.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.160
I'm sorry.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.540
I got the wrong idea.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.720
When I got your message,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.640
I was really happy.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.880
I thought you had already
gone back to Phuket.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.480
Well then,

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.500
if you feel uncomfortable,

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.480
it'll be just us next time, alright?

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.920
Thank you.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.680
You're thanking me again?

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.240
I didn't mean it that way.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.560
Neither did I.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.440
I just wanted to know

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.120
if you play sports.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.917
I do.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.040
What kind of sports
are you talking about?

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.440
Any kind, really.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.080
Let's do it tomorrow, then.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320
If you don't know how to fence,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.040
I can show you.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.200
So you can fence.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.720
I'm not going easy on you, then.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.120
In fencing,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.800
it's not about winning every match.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.600
It's about learning
to get back up every time.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.320
Fencing with you...

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.560
is actually pretty fun.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.280
Then next time,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.320
try playing sports my way.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.359
Where the hell is it?

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.080
Calm down.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.360
You'll scare the fish away.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.800
Why are you so serious?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.680
It doesn't matter.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.360
Guess the fish doesn't like the bait.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.840
You have no idea.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.360
Patience...

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.040
is the best bait for big fish.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.640
Turns out you're into fishing.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.040
I don't see the fun in it.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.822
It's painfully boring.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.200
Guess you like doing things like that.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.080
The kind you took me to try.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520
Where are you going?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.000
Hey...

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640
Didn't you enjoy it too?

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.560
Wait!

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120
I got it!

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.360
Whoa.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.640
I got it!

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.760
It's so big.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.880
You're great at this.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.040
Am I?

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.240
Not bad.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.240
Am I good at this?

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.800
You're pretty good.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.920
You're making me fall harder.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.040
What's wrong?

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.480
I don't like this.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.680
What do you mean by this?

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.640
You said what happened between us

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.360
was just a one-night stand.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.360
And now you're acting weird.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.680
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680
Please...

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.360
Don't play with my feelings, okay?

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.680
Well,

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.360
that's why
I want to get to know you more.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.480
I like you.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.600
Let's follow each other on Insta.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.920
I'm not on Insta.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.160
What?

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.680
What era are you living in?

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.840
I don't have an account.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.760
Never had one.
I don't even know how it works.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.960
Give me your phone.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.920
I'll sign you up.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.280
I don't want to brag,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.600
but I have over
a hundred thousand followers.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.860
What username do you want?

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.100
Kelvin.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.880
All done.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.960
You travel quite a lot, huh?

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.480
You talk to so many people.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.080
I know you checked my story!

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.520
How does he know?

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.920
You secretly took a pic of me.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.160
I won't do that again.
We'll just take a pic together.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.520
Why is your profile picture a dog?

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.960
I'll tell you next time.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.280
I'll tell you my secret.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:57.920
What secret?

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.440
[What secret?]

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.280
I'll tell you the next time we meet.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.360
"I'll tell you the next time we meet."

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.280
So,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.440
what's on your mind?

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:49.880
Can you tell me?

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.320
I want to start my own business,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.200
fight for justice for my mom,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.520
and claim everything

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.000
that's meant to be mine.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.920
My parents fought over the company.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.960
My father claimed that my grandfather

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.320
had given him all the management rights.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.600
He broke up with my mom

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.520
and asked for a divorce.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.480
She just cried

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.760
and told me we lost everything.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.880
I remember that...

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.800
my mom drove me out of the house

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.440
in the pouring rain

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.480
even though she wasn't confident driving.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.240
That was the last time...

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.240
I saw her.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.040
The locket you saw...

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.760
is the only thing

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.000
she left behind.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.560
It's my keepsake of her.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.920
And the dog in the picture...

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.920
was our pet.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.760
He was hit by a car
and died the very same day she did.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.240
After my mom passed away,

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.320
my father brought Ken and Mother
into the house.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.600
I was sent to an orphanage.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.720
When I turned 18,

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.760
my father finally came to get me.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.240
Why did he have to wait until then?

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.440
Mother passed away.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.400
But I only found out later

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.440
that my father already had Ken and Mother
before he met my mom.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.000
The reason he chose to marry my mom

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.600
was for the future.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.680
As for everything else,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.480
I don't want to remember.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.080
To my father,

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.520
Ken is the only son.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.520
His only son.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.840
I'm nothing but a dog.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.680
I swore to myself

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.360
that I would succeed

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.320
and prove to everyone

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.840
that my mom's son

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.400
is no less than anyone else.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.120
I've saved up some money.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.440
It may not be a lot,

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.520
but it's enough to buy a plot of land.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.920
I plan to build my own resort there.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.680
And one day,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.560
I'll take King Group down.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.080
Vier,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.520
do you want to do this with me?

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.320
I promise you...

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.760
if I ever get everything back,

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.940
half of it will be yours.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.900
I appreciate the trust you're giving me.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.160
But I'm a businessman.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.000
Your family background

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.200
does matter,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.000
but you still have to
prove yourself to me.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.289
I know.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.000
I've already made a business plan.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.240
Take a look first,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.400
then let me know what you think.

00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:44.711
Sure.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.680
[Beachfront Hotel Development Project]

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.720
What do you think?

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600
Not bad.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.480
It's quite interesting.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.160
It's a long-term investment plan

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.120
meant to increase
the brand's business value.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:14.940
But...

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.600
No one's doing this in Thailand yet.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.680
Right.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.120
Some conservative investors
probably won't like it.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.040
Long-term projects often run at a loss.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.680
Even if I agree with it,

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.480
the board would probably...

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.320
not approve it.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.880
I'm damn relieved, man.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.760
I really thought you'd lost it

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.400
after sticking around with that Kelvin
every single day.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.840
Good thing
you still know what you're doing.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.240
Listen to me.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.880
Just walk away.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.240
It'll be best for both you

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.840
and him.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.120
Trust me.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.140
Thank you.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.440
Hey.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.640
Have a seat.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.640
Have you eaten yet?

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.360
Want something to drink?
I'll get it for you.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.840
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.480
I'm good.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.180
I've...

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.520
gone over your business plan in detail,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.920
but...

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.080
my company

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.520
really can't invest in it.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.720
It's not that it's bad.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.840
It's actually very good.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.980
So...

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.040
what's the reason?

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.960
Your concept is really innovative,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.680
but it's also extremely risky.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.640
Very few

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.160
would dare to take that risk.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.360
And...

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.600
our company policy

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.320
doesn't allow investing
in things we can't visualize

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.320
or that exist only as numbers.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.560
I'm sorry.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.760
No, it's... It's okay.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.800
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.400
Then, please excuse me.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.480
Hold on, Kelvin.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.080
Kelvin...

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.960
I saw you were on a trip.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.120
Where did you go?

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.160
Why do you wanna know?

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.120
Come on.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.600
I just wanna know where you went.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.560
- Where did you go?
- Can't tell you.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.800
So, did you close the deal last time?

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.140
Yep, all taken care of.

00:39:33.755 --> 00:39:36.280
Are you sure?
That was my connection, you know.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.898
- Whoa, you wanna do this?
- Yeah.

00:39:39.311 --> 00:39:40.080
So?

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.800
So, what happened
to that naive Kelvin guy?

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.480
Don't even bring up that bastard.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.200
He asked Vier to join his business.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.040
The moment Vier said no, he was gone.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.480
Aw...

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.880
Clearly, it was all for his own benefit.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.880
- I bet.
- Yeah.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.680
He's not like that.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.200
Is someone else joining us?

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.600
Just forget it.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.640
Kelvin?

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.080
Can I have a moment of your time?

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.560
Where have you been
these past three months?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.175
I thought you were mad,

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.920
so you avoided me.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.200
I was busy trying to find a reason.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.320
A reason that would help you trust me.

00:41:26.688 --> 00:41:27.911
Come on.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.480
Where is this place?

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.320
Remember when you asked me
about the plan?

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.440
I spent the past three months

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.200
building this place on my own land.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.160
I've designed everything.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.600
The exterior, the interior, everything.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:58.880
Look.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.800
Over there is the lobby.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.320
That's the check-in area
and the hotel's signature space.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.240
For the interior,
I combined modern design with wood

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.440
so everyone who stays here
feels comfortable

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.280
and truly connected to nature.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.600
What do you think?

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.640
I think it's great.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.320
But I think...

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.520
you should consider
a pet-friendly zone as well.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.080
A lot of people have pets these days,

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.160
and they really love them.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.940
You think so?

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.720
Sure.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.920
Wanna take a look inside?

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.320
I'll show you around.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.160
That side is right on the beach.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.320
Vier,

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.880
how do you feel about my idea?

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.200
Your idea is good,

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.760
but that doesn't mean

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.320
the board will change their mind.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.200
Anyway,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.360
I'll take the risk this time

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.520
and help you find investors.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.980
Really?

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.680
Are you gonna take this risk with me?

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.000
Yeah.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.920
I could just go skinny-dipping right now.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:48.560
Thanks.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.480
You're the very first person

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.640
who truly believes in me.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.880
You're exaggerating.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.800
You're acting like a kid.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.920
Let's take a selfie.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.920
Our very first photo as partners.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.280
But there's only one.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.380
I'll take another.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.100
So we can both keep one.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.800
We apologize,

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.840
but your loan
cannot be approved at the moment.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.720
Thank you.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.720
We're really sorry,

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:10.680
but we don't have a policy in place
to approve this loan at the moment.

00:45:20.777 --> 00:45:21.577
Okay.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.680
Hello.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.840
Your dream is impressive,

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.200
but I'm afraid
it exceeds our financial capacity.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.920
Mr. Ken,

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.560
all funds have declined
to invest in Mr. Kelvin's business.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.540
Great.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.120
Keep an eye on them

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.880
and the funds, too.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.280
Don't let them...

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.600
get a single cent.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.560
We've also learned that

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.400
Mr. Vier is now interested
in joining Mr. Kelvin's business

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.480
and plans to help him
raise funds as well.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.640
Vier?

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.520
Since when did they get close?

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:45.920
You can go now.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.965
I can't believe you lost VPG Group

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.440
all because of your recklessness.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:07.540
I'm sorry.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.200
I just wanted to
help our company move faster.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.680
Which only proves
you're too weak to play this game.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.680
Business isn't just about
making big money.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.400
It's about keeping your name clean.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.200
Dirty money can be laundered,

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.760
but a tainted reputation

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.240
can never be clean again.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.520
This mistake

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.280
cost us hundreds of millions

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.880
and proved one thing to everyone.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.800
It proved that my son...

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.280
played dirty, but wasn't smart enough!

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.640
In the business world,

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.640
only the clever ones survive.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.160
This world is mud.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.040
Those who survive

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.640
are the ones who know

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.080
how to move through it
without falling.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.280
Yes, Dad.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.600
You bastards.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.840
You already lost
the moment you challenged me,

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:38.960
you pieces of trash.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.760
I'll wipe you out myself.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.600
Kelvin...

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.720
You're the very first person

00:49:13.285 --> 00:49:14.845
who truly believes in me.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.320
Vier...

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.240
Vier!

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.160
Vier, are you up?

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.420
Wake up.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.880
Vier...

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.760
Vier.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.360
Are you up now?

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.160
Hey.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:27.920
What's up?

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.160
You've just been sleeping
since you got back.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.160
Get up and take a break.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.040
Go take a shower now.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.160
Okay.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.000
See you.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.360
Eat up, honey.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.360
This one's on me.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.160
You sick or what?

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.803
Have you taken your meds yet?

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.360
Well,

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.520
I want to ask you something.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.160
- How are you, Vier?
- I...

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:15.920
Long time no see.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.080
When did you come back?

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.640
Ohm?

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.680
I'm here to pick up my khao soi.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:21.920
Alright.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.480
I just got back.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:28.160
You look kinda tired.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.560
Yeah, kinda.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.520
Two bags of khao soi.
That'll be 100 baht, please

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.880
Take care of yourself, alright?

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.160
Don't worry too much.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.360
I'm leaving now.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:44.760
- See you.
- Okay.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.480
Alright.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.400
Goodbye.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880
Where were we?

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.520
What were you saying?

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.680
Well,

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.600
I wanted to ask you something.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.720
I'm thinking about
starting a business in Bangkok.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.920
Do you happen to have
any connections or suggestions?

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.800
No?

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.680
Not like that.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.760
I just realized

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.160
you've grown up now.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.120
Ready to spread your wings, huh?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.320
I'm being serious.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.800
I want some advice.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.160
That's nice.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.720
I remember when you first got here,

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.320
you couldn't do anything.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.840
And now you want to
start a business in Bangkok.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.280
What about you?

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.280
How have you been?

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.080
What do you mean?

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:43.560
I'm fine.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:45.780
I don't know.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.600
I can't explain it,

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.640
but I get the sense that

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.480
something's definitely wrong.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.160
You didn't even come see me
when you got back.

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:57.280
You just shut yourself away

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.240
and wouldn't even eat.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680
I'm just tired.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.200
What's making you this tired?

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.020
What happened?

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.000
Can you tell me?

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.080
I'm worried about you.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.520
Thanks.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.760
Come on, don't treat me like a stranger.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.560
Look, without you,

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.200
I wouldn't have...

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:36.520
made it this far.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:38.740
That's not true.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.260
It is.

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.680
Sai oua here.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.960
Fresh, hot sai oua here.
[Nana's Delicious Sai Oua]

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.080
Do you want some sai oua?

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.020
Wanna try some?

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:53.640
Where are you going?

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.920
What are you going to do?

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.200
Hey,

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.440
if you wanna sell around here,

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.920
did you get my permission?

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.480
What permission?

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:19.060
Hey...

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.760
Why?

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.160
This is a public space.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.880
Why would she need your permission?

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.800
Yes, Mr. Ongart.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.520
Can you send ten guys over?

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.880
I've run into
some small-time thugs here.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.040
Okay.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.000
Yes, sir.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.040
I've already shared my location.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.600
Just wait until they come.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.120
Who's Ongart?

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.800
There's no Mr. Ongart here.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.640
There's only Mr. Somsak.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.320
We've been tricked!

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.600
- Run now.
- Go!

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:01.800
Shit.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:03.600
Hey!

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.760
You picked a fight with those thugs

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.200
when you had nothing.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.960
You taught me how to do business

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.200
and helped me start my restaurant.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.520
Someone as special as you

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.280
should've gone much further.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.920
Don't tell me...

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.080
Are you a CEO in disguise?

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.560
Jeez.

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.360
Hey,

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.860
you must've watched
too many short dramas.

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.320
If you don't want to tell me,
that's fine.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.920
But if you ever need my help,

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.060
you can let me know, sir.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.120
Yeah, thanks.

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.280
Is it tasty?

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.960
It is. Give it a try.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.000
I'll take care of the customer first.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.760
What would you like, sir?

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800
Khao soi, please.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.640
One moment, sir.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.400
He looks like
the person on the missing poster.

[Missing:
Vier Vivatpattana, 25]

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.240
Missing?

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.040
And the reward...

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.200
Five hundred thousand baht!

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.920
What the hell is going on?

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.840
I can't stay here anymore.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:36.240
Wait...

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.440
Can you tell me what happened?

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.160
Many of you must have seen
the missing person notice I put up.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.120
Vier,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.880
I want to tell you that...

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.400
I love you.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.000
Aw, he loves him so much.

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.812
- Exactly. I'm jealous.
- Yeah.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.600
Vier, I'm begging you.

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.920
What happened?

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.800
Yes?

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.440
Vier, we're in trouble.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.440
Khun is terminating
all of our contracts.

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.680
What should we do?

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.560
King Group is buying land around here.

They're now planning
to demolish Nana's restaurant.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:50.760
Wait...

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.800
Oh!

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.200
Nature is calling.

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.640
Oh!

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.800
Watch my luggage.

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.720
I'll be right back.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.880
- Uh...
- I'm going to the restroom.

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.080
I'll wait outside.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.040
Okay.

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:07.280
Finally...

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.240
I've found you.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.480
Where is he?

Come on, pick up.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.480
Why aren't you picking up?

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.000
Ms. Lalin,

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.720
I've got the list of applicants
for Loyde Group's bodyguard positions.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.000
I can't believe it.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.480
You always said business was family,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.760
but today you chose business over family.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.200
A strong alliance gives you power,

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.520
and power

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.920
is what keeps everything intact.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.600
What about my happiness?

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.720
Have you ever thought about that?

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.920
Happiness is unnecessary.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.240
But if you want it,

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.600
money can provide it.

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.520
It buys stability.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.400
Money always works.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.520
So in your eyes,

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.000
I'm nothing more than a pawn, aren't I?

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680
Ms. Lalin,

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.120
has anyone caught your eye?

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.240
Do I have any other options?

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.760
There's another applicant,

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.920
but I don't think he's suitable.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.520
Still, if you'd like to take a look,
you can, miss.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.080
Come in.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.160
You may begin.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.840
Why hide the fact that you're a woman

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.040
when you're this skilled?

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.360
So no one would hold back
just because I'm a woman.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.880
What's your name?

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.280
It's Nana.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.960
Be here tomorrow at 8 A.M.
to start work.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.860
Don't be late.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.560
Ohm,

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.720
are you still awake?

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:01.189
Can I talk to you for a bit?

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.800
Well,

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.040
Vier's been missing since yesterday,

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:07.600
and I still haven't heard from him.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.480
What should I do?

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.760
Should I go to the police?

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.800
Really?

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.680
Do you know his family?

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.040
His father
is a very well-known businessman.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.960
Be careful
with whatever decision you make.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.240
Maybe you should try
contacting his family first.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.000
He once told me

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.640
he was kidnapped a long time ago.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.360
Could it be happening again?

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.320
Calm down. Don't do anything rash.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.640
He has a family.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.840
You shouldn't get involved.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.880
Vier,

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.160
breakfast is ready.

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.320
Come have some.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.360
Vier...

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.680
Have a seat.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.960
Fuck it.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.880
♫Countless memories♫

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.440
♫That cut you deep♫

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.600
♫I know there's no way♫

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.240
♫To make things right again,♫

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.000
♫'Cause I once believed
I couldn't love at all♫

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.840
♫Never saw your worth until the fall♫

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.120
♫If I knew how to love you right,♫

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.120
♫I wouldn't live in regret tonight♫

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.960
♫I hope the stars would hear my plea,♫

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
♫I don't want this pain inside of me♫

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.840
♫I need you♫

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.760
♫Only you♫

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.240
♫There's one thing you should know♫

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.250
♫I'm sorry I once broke your heart♫

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:21.000
♫I'm sorry for making you cry♫

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.960
♫I'm sorry I was so unkind
while calling you mine,♫

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.680
♫Keeping you close, just by my side♫

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.520
♫I'm sorry I once broke your heart♫

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.260
♫I'm sorry for making you cry♫

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.220
♫I'm sorry I was so unkind
while calling you mine,♫

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.320
♫Keeping you close, just by my side♫

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:48.080
♫I'm sorry I once was so heartless and cold♫

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:52.440
♫The truth is I love you with all of my soul♫

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.780
♫Just one more chance, let me prove it to you♫

01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:00.820
♫Let me show you how much I love you♫

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.880
♫How much I love you♫

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.300
♫Just one more chance, let me prove it to you♫

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.070
♫Let me show you how much I love you♫
