00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.610
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.650
I see it. Have you told Shin Jae?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.530
(Hyun Jin)

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.230
Ra Young! Yoon Ra Young!

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.170
Hey, Ra Young, open the door!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.680
Hey, what happened?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.720
I'm okay. I'm okay now.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.520
Let me see where you're hurt.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.320
What kind of jerk did this?

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.090
Did you see their face?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.900
Did you call the police?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.030
- Not yet. - Let's get you to a hospital first.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.830
Can you walk?

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.340
(Episode 3)

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.310
Still, don't you think you should stay in the hospital today?

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.210
Are you sure it wasn't that stalker who used to follow you around?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.750
It wasn't the stalker.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.690
It wasn't a robbery. Then what was it?

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.820
A fan of Kang Eun Seok?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.590
It could've been an online hater. The backlash has been worse lately.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.060
It's Do Jun.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.200
Yes. What have you got?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.070
I'm sorry.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.010
You're telling me nothing was caught on any CCTVs or dashcams?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.480
It seems they used the emergency exit to get out the back,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.950
and it seems the whole route was planned out beforehand.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.080
Who would go to such lengths and why?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.790
(Husband)

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.960
I was worried. The house is a wreck, and you were gone.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.370
- You went out like that? - Sorry.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.500
I was completely out of it.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.380
Is Ra Young okay?

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.640
Yes.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.780
Her injuries aren't serious, but she seems really shaken up.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.950
Was it that stalker again? Or just some other psycho?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.920
We're not exactly sure yet.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.120
Do you really have to keep doing this work?

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.400
I don't mean being a lawyer. I mean LnJ.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.670
There are other cases besides crimes against women. You have options.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.439
I see about five bodies a month.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.240
Over 70 percent of them are women.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.310
In a world like this, how could I not worry about you?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.640
In a world like this, how could I not do this work?

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.650
Hyun Jin, I hate that...

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.379
you're constantly attacked by strangers.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.380
And I hate that you'll be targeted for revenge.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.420
You used to admire me fighting back and never let anyone get to me.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.490
Why is something you used to admire now something you want me to stop?

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.600
Are you worried about me, or just for yourself for having to?

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.370
I ran into Ra Young at the hospital earlier.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.739
She said you stepped back from representing Jo Yoo Jeong.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.940
That's true, right?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.370
I was, until a little while ago.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.510
But not anymore.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.680
You're taking Jo Yoo Jeong's case?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.280
You know who the lead detective is, don't you?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.490
I'll be gathering evidence to put Jo Yoo Jeong away,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.820
and you're helping her get away? While we sleep in the same bed?

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.030
Maybe she didn't do it.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.830
What?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.500
The person who killed Jun Hyeok...

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.970
It might not have been Yoo Jeong.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.510
How can you even say that? We have her confession and evidence.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.650
The real killer could've framed her, you know.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.950
Do you have anything to back that up?

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.460
Why? You can't bring yourself to believe it?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.290
What Lee Jun Hyeok did to Jo Yoo Jeong?

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.230
It's not that...

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.810
Honey!

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.820
I'm just going to crash here.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.260
You don't have to trouble yourself. I'm fine, really.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.690
Who said this was for you?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.700
I'm the one who can't sleep.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.140
This is nice.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.540
This brings back memories.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.010
Back at Hyun Jin's place in college.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.220
Remember how the three of us slept on one mattress in that tiny place?

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.850
How did the three of us even fit in there?

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.420
Tell me about it. You were a wild sleeper back then.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.430
- I still am. Want to find out? - In a space this big? I'll pass.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.300
You should cut back on your shows.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.100
And lay low from the press for a while.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.610
Shin Jae.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.410
Yes.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.280
I can't stop.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.550
I don't care who stabbed me today. A stalker, a hater, whoever.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.160
If I stop,

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.690
I might as well be dead, Shin Jae.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.300
Fine. Keep going.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.710
I'll handle the consequences.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.130
I said I'm just here to meet someone!

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.130
I'm sorry, but we have a dress code. We can't let you in.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.700
Who said anything about eating here?

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.600
Darn, let go of me!

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.370
What, you're just gonna ignore me?

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.810
Min Seo!

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.940
See? What did I tell you? I said my daughter was in here.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.979
Why haven't you answered my calls?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.480
I was worried, so I came to find you.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.920
I'm so sorry. I am so, so sorry.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.520
How much do you make here? You're not cut out for this place.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.800
Are you crazy? What are you doing here?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.070
Is that any way to talk to your mother?

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.930
Maybe you should've picked up and read my texts then.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.370
Those jerks have started hitting me in the face now.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.340
I guess that means I'm of no value now.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.580
They'll probably sell me off for parts or worse.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.010
- What's that got to do with me? - Give me your phone.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.120
- Darn it, where did you hide it? - What do you think you're doing?

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.120
Fine. Let's make it a win-win.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.890
I have a way to get us some money.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.690
I thought they were cheap lawyers,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.329
but I looked them up, and it turns out...

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.660
Haeil's daughter is a lawyer there.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.570
- So what? - Connect.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.170
If we leak some info on that, I think we can score a huge payday.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.540
Just throw them a few scraps of what you know.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.710
Come on, sweetie.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.350
Don't be like that. You're disappointing me.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.880
Enough already. I'm still paying off...

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.080
the debt you racked up in my name.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.390
How else will you exploit me? How much more can you sell me out?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.219
You wench. You think you paid it all off yourself?

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.720
I chipped in five grand, you know.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.630
Don't come looking for me ever again.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.770
Forget Connect and all that nonsense.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.540
Stay there, and you'll end up dead, you wench.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.920
This is all stuff we already know.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.290
What did Dong Je say?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.660
He dug through forums, social media, and databases,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.660
and said no prostitution link has come up on that app.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.130
Yes?

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.600
Ms. Hwang, your husband is here to see you.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.230
Seon Kyu's here?

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.540
We had a little fight yesterday. I wonder if that's why he's here.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.609
Still in the honeymoon phase?

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.840
You couldn't even wait for her to get off work.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.050
I heard you got hurt. Are you okay?

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.250
It was nothing. Coffee? Tea?

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.580
Coffee, please.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.730
What brings you all the way out here?

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.630
About yesterday...

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.570
I shouldn't have said it like that.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.570
I'm sorry.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.410
I was a little on edge too.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.940
I'm sorry.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.210
Look.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.120
I still have that dream.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.020
The one where you leave me for Lee Jun Hyeok.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.490
Even though you're right here with me.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.730
I'm so pathetic, Hyun Jin.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.530
I shouldn't feel this way about someone who died so tragically,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.070
but I guess that's just how much I love you.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.300
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.910
For making you feel so insecure.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.880
I'm so sorry.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.320
- Should I have left you two alone? - We're done.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.920
We'll finish the rest at home.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.490
A little more information than I needed.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.430
Thanks.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.860
I just need to pack up. Do you want to wait?

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.900
Shall we hit the gym before we head home? It's been a while.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.440
No. I have to hurry back. I actually just stopped by for work.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.270
Work?

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.740
I'm here to collect DNA samples. From both you and Ra Young.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.280
What are you talking about? Our DNA? Why?

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.580
We found some unidentified DNA at Lee Jun Hyeok's place.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.219
It was on a woman's accessory, but it's not Jo Yoo Jeong's.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.520
We can't even identify the person.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.930
What does that have to do with our DNA?

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.360
We need to compare them to rule out those close to her.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.030
Since you were all in contact with Jo Yoo Jeong very recently,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.830
there could have been some transfer.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.300
So, who's first?

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.470
(DNA Collection Room)

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.380
- Detective Gu. - Yes, Chief.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.080
Are you here to drop off evidence for analysis?

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.150
Yes. It's from the victim's house. We're trying to rule out associates.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.920
That must be the case Attorney Yoon is working on.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.390
- You know Attorney Yoon? - We go back. I'll let you work.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.660
Yes, ma'am.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.030
My hair could have been left at Jun Hyeok's place, right?

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.130
It could've gotten on Yoo Jeong,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.670
but my earring...

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.370
getting on her and ending up stuck in his bed?

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.640
Hey, does that sound plausible to you at all?

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.310
No.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.980
Should I beg? Cry? Just throw myself at his feet?

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.619
Hwang Hyun Jin, what have you done?

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.020
That's not the problem right now.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.730
If the police find out that earring is yours,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.660
you'll be brought in for questioning.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.870
From their point of view, your actions are suspicious enough,

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.300
and then if, by some chance, the police...

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.810
run your DNA against the cold case database...

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.610
No way.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.340
But what if they do?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.450
If...

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.250
that comes to light...

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.020
The police can't get...

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.360
their hands on your DNA.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.890
He went to collect your DNA?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.330
All right. I'm on my way.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.730
No, wait.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.140
There might be...

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.670
another way.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.070
(Hong Yeon Hui, Chief Forensic Medical Examiner)

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.650
Yes?

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.060
Thank you for agreeing to join our Task Force.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.420
I should be thanking you.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.290
It's been ages since I've handled corporate law,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.490
but you insisted on bringing me on board.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.730
Please have a seat.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.810
Why me? That's what I came here to find out.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.140
Shall I venture a guess?

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.010
It's no secret my mother wants me to succeed her,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.120
and you know if you rope me in, she'll go all in on this project.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.590
I simply needed you, Attorney Kang Shin Jae.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.260
The one who created deal structures no one else could even imagine...

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.130
And pulled off a last-minute upset in the K-Finance acquisition.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.100
Named by a prominent legal journal as one of Asia's attorneys to watch.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.670
The ace corporate advisor, Kang Shin Jae.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.110
That's the person I chose as my partner.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.510
That's a shame. My specialty is sex crimes now.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.850
So if you're ever a victim, be sure to call me.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.320
I'll be a much better partner to you then.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.320
How are your ex-husbands doing?

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.160
I doubt they're doing very well.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.430
Thanks to the alimony my mother wrung out of them.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.040
You'd best be careful too, Mr. Baek. Stay off my mother's radar.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.080
(New Free Support Program)

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.850
There.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.480
Are you satisfied now?

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.590
I told you, I always get what I want.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.330
And just so you know, don't bother making room for me at Haeil.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.930
The view from my office is much better, anyway.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.490
I told you you'd change your mind.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.360
After just one autopsy, the smell clings to all of my hair.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.400
Cigarette smoke is nauseating, but this covers it up pretty well.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800
Want to try some?

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.740
Let me get straight to the point.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.879
You're more interesting...

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.180
than I gave you credit for, Yoon Ra Young.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.420
That's the most audacious request I've ever heard.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.790
It's not a request. It's a deal. Either take the deal, or forget it.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.660
But you have to decide right here, right now.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.400
If you refuse, I have to move on to my next option.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.300
All right.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.140
You do understand exactly what I'm asking, don't you?

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.470
I'm not drunk.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.340
If I swap the DNA samples for you,

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.840
you'll take on my divorce case. Right?

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.510
You're a lawyer, though.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.680
Doesn't this request... No, this deal.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.420
Doesn't it weigh on your conscience?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.550
I'm not exactly planning on going to heaven.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.320
What about you?

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.060
My life is already a living hell.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.060
Child custody, division of assets...

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.700
I'll get you everything you want, Hong Yeon Hui.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.400
But do you even know who my husband is?

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.940
He's a sitting prosecutor.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.410
I don't care who he is.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.140
All right, then.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.910
Then let's say we have a deal.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.680
I'll choose the celebratory drinks.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.560
Wasn't the crime scene reenactment scheduled for next week?

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.860
How should I know? We just do as we're told.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.730
Hey, he's here! He's here!

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.300
- Just a moment... - He's here.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.470
Come on, guys.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.570
Is it true you murdered the victim because he sexually assaulted you?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.140
Was it really sexual assault this time?

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.070
Weren't you trying to intentionally approach the victim again?

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.680
How did you know the victim?

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.239
Why go to the victim's house?

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.450
Don't you feel any remorse toward the victim's family? Say something!

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.550
- Let's see your face! - Hey, why hide your face? Come on!

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.420
There's no need to be nervous.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.690
Just reenact what you told us. Exactly what happened that day.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.270
Do you remember what you said in your statement?

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.770
Want me to recite it for you?

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.740
So you don't get confused about your own statement.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.410
It's all a lie, isn't it?

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.710
I told you to stay away.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.880
It was Connect, wasn't it?

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.590
How you met Kang Eun Seok, and how you killed Reporter Lee...

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.290
It was all through Connect In, the sex trade app.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.590
(Suspect)

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.400
Seon Kyu.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.070
I need to speak with you for a moment.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.600
Sure.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.070
(Suspect)

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.910
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.350
Connect In? What's that? I've never heard of it.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.350
This is Reporter Lee's phone, the one you said you threw away.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.690
And on it, I found...

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.290
who really killed Reporter Lee.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.630
So what? This doesn't mean I didn't kill him.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.540
The phone...

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.940
- The detectives kept asking, so... - This is as far as I go.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.270
This is all I can do for you.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.280
If you take one more step, there's no turning back.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.620
We're all set. Let's begin.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.860
The choice is yours.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.220
Are you going to turn back with me?

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:25.530
Or walk off that cliff alone?

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.300
You went into the living room.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.640
Okay, you got the knife from the kitchen.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440
And then what?

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.950
What did you say you did next?

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.190
Yoo Jeong, run! Get out of here!

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.500
And then?

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.030
Then what?

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.240
I can't do this.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.210
It wasn't me.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.740
I didn't do it.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.610
What do you mean? Are you saying you didn't kill him?

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.920
They made me do it.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.320
- I didn't kill him. - Who's "they"?

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.390
- I really didn't do it! - Hey!

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.630
Are you messing with us right now?

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.660
You think this is some kind of a joke?

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.330
- Let's get this right. Hurry up. - Are you getting all of this?

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.100
Excuse me?

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.300
Despite the right to recant anytime during the investigation,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.240
the police are coercing a suspect who is doing just that.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.810
Are you getting all of that on camera?

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.790
Did you murder Reporter Lee here on that day?

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.490
It wasn't me.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.170
I didn't kill him.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.500
So...

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.840
is there any need to continue?

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.140
Darn it.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.950
All right, everyone out.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.780
Come on, let's move!

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.590
Let's go. Come with me.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.990
Is this a strategy, or do you really believe her?

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.760
We'll see, won't we?

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.060
You know how solid the physical evidence is.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.500
Everything is so conclusive.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.700
Don't you find that a little strange?

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.130
Do you have any evidence besides her testimony...

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.000
You of all people should understand why I can't say more.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.910
- I knew it was too good to be true. - Sir.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.480
What?

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.920
The unknown DNA from Lee's place. Did you run it against his contacts?

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.320
What, you're hoping it's a match for the real killer?

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.430
What's gotten into you? You're not a rookie, are you?

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.000
Suspects always flip their stories. It's common before the prosecution.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.300
Gosh.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.870
Hello, Detective Gu Seon Kyu, Mujin Police.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.810
The sample I submitted yesterday. Can I get a rush on the analysis?

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.150
Connect In is a secret app for sex trafficking.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:41.820
Reporter Lee was writing and expose on it. That day...

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.970
That's enough for now.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.370
You've been through enough today.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.040
Attorney Yoon.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.410
Those people are very dangerous. They won't just let this go.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.910
Nothing's going to happen to you.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.110
I won't let them.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.390
We have a long road ahead of us. So we need to keep our strength up.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.660
What do you want? Korean, Chinese, Western?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.830
- Korean. - Korean it is. What about dessert?

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.100
Ice cream.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.600
I'll get us the biggest and most expensive kind.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:33.970
So you have that to look forward to.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.550
The suspect, Ms. Jo, who surrendered for the murder of Reporter Lee...

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.790
has reportedly denied all charges...

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.620
during a crime scene reenactment conducted by police this morning.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.029
While the police focus their inquiry...

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.260
on why Ms. Jo recanted her testimony,

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.730
they also plan to conduct further investigation.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:08.240
They will also analyse the evidence and the confession's credibility...

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.640
to ensure the investigation proceeds without...

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.580
Excuse me. We need your cooperation.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.140
Please lower your mask.

(Kim Mi Jeong, Cleaner at Hankuk University Hospital)

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.390
- Thank you for your cooperation. - For goodness' sake.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.160
Am I free to go now?

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.200
Yes, Attorney Yoon.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.210
Everything's clear so far.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:43.740
Thanks, Do Jun.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.380
I need you for a few more days until she's moved to detention.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.510
You sent Do Jun to the hospital?

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:51.979
I had to take precautions.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.620
These are Reporter Lee's murderers we're talking about.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.790
Good call. What's the word from the police?

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.220
They seem to think she's just backing out of her confession.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.430
We need evidence to turn the tables. Evidence against Connect.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.330
If only we could use that photo from Jun Hyeok's phone as evidence.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.370
Even so, that doesn't prove Connect was behind Lee's murder.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.970
Now Yoo Jeong has changed her mind, we'll soon learn about Connect.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.340
If we can find out what that app is and shove it in their faces,

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.780
the police will have no choice but to act.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.850
Yes?

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.760
Attorney Hwang, you have a visitor.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.060
I don't have any meetings scheduled. Who is it?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.990
She said you'd know her. Her name is Lee Seon Hwa.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.740
Ms. Lee Seon Hwa.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.040
This place is really nice.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.780
Do you really help people like me here?

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.180
If you need our help, we do.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.580
I don't know.. I think you ladies need my help more than I need yours.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.690
I know a girl who works for Connect.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.760
How much will you give me if I put you in touch with her?

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.130
What's your price?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.730
- Three. - Three grand?

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.200
Are you kidding me?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800
Thirty grand.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.370
But why are you here alone?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.310
Is your contact on board with cooperating with us?

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.510
The 30 grand is just for her phone number.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.340
Persuading her is your job.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.410
What? Thirty grand for just a phone number?

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.120
- That's ridiculous. - Take it or leave it.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:37.950
I'll pay it. Thirty grand.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.100
Write down your account number. I'll wire it right now.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.660
Now here's someone who gets it.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.170
No way! How can you trust her?

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.300
Here.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.840

Gosh, I've never met a cool girl like her before.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.600
Pleasure doing business with you all.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.870
Just so we're clear,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.340
that 30 grand I just gave you isn't for the phone number.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.540
It's to buy your silence.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.910
You leaked your source's number to us.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.750
What's to stop you from selling them our information for more money?

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.250
What kind of person do you take me for?

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.720
I don't care what kind of person you are.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.660
What's important is that this money is our insurance policy.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.860
So if you ever feel tempted to side with Connect, remember this.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.260
I have a complete record of the money you took from me.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.030
From what I've seen, they go crazy if anyone leaks their secrets.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.140
Welcome aboard. You're in the same boat as us now.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.040
- The number's unavailable... - She's not picking up?

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.310
Let's just leave a message for now.

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.910

Yoo Jeong, are you asleep?

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.340
Wake up. I have good news.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.710
We might have someone who's willing to testify for us.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.380
They might even have info about Connect that you don't.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:26.860
And look. A big tub of fancy ice cream.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.430
We won't leave a bite. We're going to finish it all, just us two.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.070
Yoo Jeong?

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.170
Come on, wake up.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.340
Yoo Jeong, let's wake up.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.520

Yoo Jeong, please wake up.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.480
Oh, Yoo Jeong...

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.640
Are you the next of kin?

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.480
Yoo Jeong, please wake up...

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.150
Those jerks did this.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.060
This is definitely Connect's work. She recanted, so they silenced her.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.630
Are you positive no outsiders had access to her?

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.630
I don't know. I'm not sure.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.270
Did you check the CCTV footage?

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:52.970
It looks like...

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.310
the drugs in the treatment room were tampered with.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.280
The culprit?

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.710
Jo Yoo Jeong herself.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.950
- Are you saying it was suicide? - What? That's ridiculous.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.920
She had a procedure this afternoon. We'll need the autopsy,

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:18.830
but the missing medication matches what was found by her bed.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.900
Motive?

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:24.000
She had no reason to kill herself all of a sudden.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.330
You would think.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.270
The pressure of what happened today must've been immense.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.440
Whether her story was true or not,

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.340
that's a lot for anyone to handle.

All of you, please just go.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.420
Go. Please, just go. I said get out!

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.420
Yoo Jeong never wanted to report it in the first place.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.990
She said she didn't want the lawyers involved anymore.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.900
Her lawyers and I... We're the ones who killed her.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.070
We're the ones who killed her.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.770
We killed her...

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.310
We killed her...

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.530
Tomorrow will be mostly clear nationwide.

Reporting from the hospital where suspect Ms. Jo was being treated.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:55.060
Ms. Jo reportedly evaded the watch of police and staff this afternoon.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.660
And it's been confirmed that she obtained a controlled substance.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.100
During a crime scene reenactment this morning,

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.270
Ms. Jo had completely denied the charges against her.

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.240
It appears she couldn't handle the resulting psychological pressure...

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.570
and resorted to this drastic measure.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.910

It was his junior reporter's.

So there's no evidence, not a hair, to back up Jo Yoo Jeong's story.

She's just a kid, but she told such a big lie.

I kept wondering about that.

A girl who hated trials and lawyers, and was acting out...

If she was turning herself in, she would've gone to the police.

The truth is,

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:40.840
I think she was relying on you, on all of you lawyers.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:46.850
She was just a kid who couldn't rely on adults.

Since you were always on my side, I have one last favour to ask.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:47.640
Please protect my sister.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.750
It wasn't suicide. She was driven to it.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.860
Those jerks changed their target to Yoo Jeong's sister.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:02.560
To make sure Yoo Jeong would break.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:07.230
We even had someone watching her since the reenactment.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.670
So how on earth did they get to her?

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.970
We underestimated them.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.280
I told her nothing bad would happen.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.910
That I wouldn't let it.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.350
On the day of the crime scene reenactment,

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.520
she was terrified of what Connect might do...

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.220
and that's what I told Yoo Jeong.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.860
Ra Young.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.130
I'm the one who failed Yoo Jeong.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.070
Your sister's a real beauty.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.640
Right.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.950
You need to protect your sister. What if she ends up like you?

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.120
Your sister's life is in your hands.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.090
Don't you get it?

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.770
I was wrong. Please, just spare me this once.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.040
(Park Je Yeol)

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.840
That's up to you, isn't it?

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:07.220
Do you not understand...

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.990
what I'm saying?

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.690
What are you guys doing here at this hour?

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.500
I had a feeling you'd be here.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.470
See? What did I tell you? It was obvious.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.570
There has to be something we missed about Connect.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.399
Whether she meant to or not,

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.870
Yoo Jeong must've let something slip.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.810
I can't let her go down like this.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.720
I...

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.690
wanted to be the kind of person that we so desperately needed.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.570
To people like us back then, I'd say,

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.040
"It's not your fault. You don't believe me?"

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.310
"Then we'll fight for you. We'll win."

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:38.870
"No matter what,"

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:41.680
we'll be on your side."

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.650
"And that you too..."

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.520
"deserve to be happy."

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.490
That's what I wanted to tell them.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.060
But why is it that back then, and even now,

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.730
it feels like nothing's changed at all?

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.000
I can't forgive them!

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.870
I'm going to make those jerks pay.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.110
No, I can't let them get away with this.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.180
Connect? What a joke.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:22.020
Just you watch.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.420
I'll follow those scumbags to the depths of the fiery pit.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:33.260
Okay, let's be rational about this.

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.500
We don't have a client for this case anymore.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:39.030
On top of that, we have no intel on Connect.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.840
The one thing we do know is that these guys are extremely dangerous.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.639
So, no one could blame us if we were to walk away right now.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.710
Realistically speaking.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.750
So, what's it going to be?

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:56.750
Do we keep going?

00:46:58.590 --> 00:46:59.590
Or do we stop?

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.980
All right. Then I guess we'll see this through.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.680
You said we don't have any intel,

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.150
but if we can't get to them,

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.250
we just make them come to us.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.690
What are you planning?

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:39.090
If they want to kill me, I say bring it on.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.130
I'm not going down alone.

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.490
When did you get home?

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.360
Just a little while ago.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:09.690
You should've woken me up.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.930
What's all this?

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.430
(Sunchang Meju Eel)

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:21.100
You've just seemed so worn out lately.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.610
It's about Jo Yoo Jeong, isn't it?

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.280
I just can't seem to shake it.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.480
I figured as much.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.590
I brought you something fortifying before you left.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.250
But you just got off your shift.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.590
You must be tired too.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.830
I just had to grill it. It was no trouble at all.

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:47.730
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.550
Hey, I've been thinking.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.760
Maybe we should go back to the clinic?

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.260
Let's try to have a baby again.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:25.830
IVF, whatever it takes,

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:28.970
let's give it another try.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:33.110
Thank you.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.450
- And I'm sorry. - For what?

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.430

(Incoming Call)

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:19.070
Han Min Seo's still not picking up?

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.010
No. She's not picking up for you either.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.450
I can't even try convincing her if I can't get a hold of her.

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.850
Try calling Lee Seon Hwa. Ask her for an address or something.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:31.120
Yes, got it.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:34.490
What time is Ra Young on?

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:36.990
At seven, in a bit.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:39.190
But I don't think we can watch it together.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:40.560
I have a doctor's appointment.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.470
All right. I'm on my way now. Okay.

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:48.400
- I'm taking off. - Okay, good luck.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.840
This is Detective Gu Seon Kyu with Violent Crimes Unit Two.

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:55.340
Detective Gu Seon Kyu?

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.610
This is Park Je Yeol from the Mujin Prosecutor's Office.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.980
We've met before, haven't we?

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.879
- Yes. - About the Jo Yoo Jeong case.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.350
There's something missing from your report.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.460
The identity of the initial caller who reported the case to 911.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.860
Okay, I'll look into it and get back to you.

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:11.490
Please do.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.940
- That was Prosecutor Park, right? - Yes.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.470
Actually, I already got the file from 911.

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:27.110
Turns out it was from a payphone. And there's no CCTV nearby.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.780
We could've just closed this case, but he's making us run in circles.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.750
I think someone's hurt. I heard a scream.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.990
It's a house in front of the park on Seongil-gu, Jungam-ro.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:45.160
- Why bother identifying them? - Play it again.

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.760
What?

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:52.470
I think someone's hurt. I heard a scream.

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:55.200
It's a house in front of the park on Seongil-gu, Jungam-ro.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.089
The person you called is unavailable.

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.490
Leave a message after the tone.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.960
(Honey, are you okay? If you can't make it, let me know.)

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.760
Ms. Hwang Hyun Jin?

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:24.230
Yes.

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:26.470
Your husband isn't here yet?

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.370
I'm so sorry, but I'll have to reschedule.

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.880
A public interest firm specialising in representing sex crime victims.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.040
Joining us is Attorney Yoon Ra Young of LnJ.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.350
- Welcome. - Hello. I'm Yoon Ra Young of LnJ.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.590
I heard the three of you at the firm went to college together.

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:48.560
I'm curious how you all decided to start a firm helping victims.

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:52.430
Would you mind doing a quick search for "sex crime law firm"?

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:56.030
This is a first for me, using my phone on a live broadcast.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:00.270
But since she asked, I hope our viewers will understand.

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.340
(Juvenile crime acquittal, Yes, you can.)

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.680
- What do you see? - It's mostly ads and promotions.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:10.380
That's right. Most promise favourable results..

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.650
For the perpetrators.

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:16.320
They boast about how many times they've gotten charges dropped...

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.890
and how much they've gotten sentences reduced.

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.590
So when victims go online for help,

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.190
the first thing they see are ads like that.

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:28.230
That's why we saw a desperate need for a firm that helps only victims.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.470
We wanted victims to know we'd fight for them, not the perpetrators.

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:34.500
We knew we had to get that message out there.

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:38.240
So that's why you created LnJ, a firm dedicated to victims.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.680
Yes. We wanted victims to know that no matter what happened,

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:44.310
they are absolutely not alone.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:49.320
Because what victims truly want is to have someone on their side,

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.990
to listen to their story, and to fight alongside them.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.290
That's why we named our firm LnJ,

00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.530
which stands for "Listen and Join."

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.560
To listen to victims and join their cause.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.640
This is Attorney Hwang Hyun Jin from LnJ.

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:11.870
Lee Seon Hwa gave me your contact information.

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:13.370
I want to help you.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.520
Now, we have to talk about your most recent case.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:24.320
The case was closed when the suspect suddenly died,

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.990
but many questions still remain.

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.960
In this case, during the crime scene reenactment,

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.660
the suspect recanted her confession, saying she didn't kill the victim.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:34.760
The investigators saw it as her simply changing her story,

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.970
but I believe that's the most crucial part of this case.

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.070
What specifically makes you think so?

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:44.040
Because the voice the suspect tried to raise until the very end...

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.940
was ultimately never truly heard.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:51.850
I believe this is still happening to others as we speak.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:55.180
Even at this very moment, there are people who are too scared...

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:58.050
and are suffering all on their own.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.790
That's why, through this broadcast,

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.320
I have a message for every single one of them.

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:07.700
We are waiting to hear your stories.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:10.270
So we can fight alongside you.

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.440
There's only one thing we need.

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:16.140
And what would that be?

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:17.910
Connect.

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.780
Connect? As in a connection?

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.310
Yes. We're weak when we're alone,

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.850
but we find strength when we connect with one another.

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:30.550
Our goal going forward is clear.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:33.020
It's to connect, to form a connection.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:39.690
If we can't get to them, we just make them come to us.

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.669
Hey, Do Jun. From this moment on,

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:48.170
don't let Ra Young out of your sight.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.240
Connect. A connection.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:54.040
It sounds like you're referring to solidarity among victims,

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:57.380
What kind of victims are you referring to, specifically?

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:01.280
Like victims of sexual assault, harassment, domestic abuse, and...

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.220
those exploited by large-scale sex trafficking rings.

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.460
(Han Min Seo)

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.260
- Hello? - This is Han Min Seo.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.200
I'm so glad you finally called.

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:18.870
Can we meet and talk in person?

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:32.050
I heard from Han Min Seo. She said she's coming by tomorrow.

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.410
We have only one goal. To connect.

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.430
- Are you all right? - Our real fight begins now.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:22.060
If you're watching this right now,

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:23.770
please reach out to us.

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:27.840
We will take your hand.

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.750
(Honour)

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:34.000
This is a warning. A warning that they know about it.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.140
You know what gives me this kind of feeling?

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:39.810
That green hoodie?

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:42.280
This all started when we got close to Connect.

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.780
You wouldn't happen to know anything about the seal, would you?

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.450
Who could've sent us this card?

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:51.320
Han Min Seo is our only way into Connect.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:52.790
Should we try tracing the server first?

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.760
- I'm in. - I saw one of the VIPs.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.860
A Connect user.
