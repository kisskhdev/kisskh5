00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.950
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.900
[Episode 7]

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.530
The plan was to get Xie Yong'er
to spill the truth when drunk,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.100
but I ended up
revealing everything myself.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.300
I thought I held the script,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.430
but Prince Duan
was the one truly above all.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.430
I even revealed my only way to survive.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.240
I...

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.310
must be doomed now.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.560
My Lady,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.370
it's time to wash and dress.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.530
My Lady, you've been drinking?

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.440
Be quiet.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.270
My head hurts.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.310
Let me sleep a bit longer.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.120
That won't do.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.520
You are to pay your respects
to the Empress Dowager today.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.360
Why do I have to see her again?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.640
Nothing good ever comes from meeting her.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.590
Can't I just pretend to be sick?

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.120
His Majesty just promoted
Concubine Xie to Consort this morning.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
If you don't attend,
you'll face even more criticism.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.400
The Emperor's heart
is truly unpredictable.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.120
Greetings, Your Majesty

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.080
Greetings,
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.400
May Your Majesty
be blessed with good fortune.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.310
May Your Majesty the
Empress Dowager enjoy peace and health.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.040
You may rise.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.230
Everyone, please be seated.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.890
Thank you, Your Majesty

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.110
and Empress Dowager.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.079
A hangover is truly miserable.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.970
Consort Xie.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.170
Come to my side.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.230
Your Majesty.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.950
So beautiful.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.120
Emperor,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.310
the Flower Festival Banquet
is approaching.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.510
What are your plans?

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.240
Your Majesty,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.000
with the Flower Festival Banquet
drawing near and flowers in full bloom,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.190
our Great Xia now

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.240
enjoys peace and prosperity.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.680
Therefore, I believe

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.190
all of us consorts

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.870
should each contribute our strengths

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.870
and do our part
to sing the praises of the nation.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.470
Am I right?

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.550
That's right.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.390
I personally picked 100 kinds of flowers

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.720
and made them into Hundred Flower Cakes.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.320
They taste

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.560
excellent.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.690
I've been preparing since last year.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.750
I'm embroidering an 8-foot-long piece
called Blossoms and Wealth.

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.600
By the time
of the Flower Festival Banquet,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.730
it will be finished.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.300
After years of study,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.510
I finally cultivated a new flower species.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.710
Putting so much thought into one thing?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.430
Yet they seem to enjoy it.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.980
Come to think of it,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.720
being just a simple 2D character

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.190
seems quite happy at least.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.480
But the more I know,

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.160
the more worries I have.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.970
You've all put in great effort.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.100
I am very pleased.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.130
Emperor,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.190
what do you think?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.830
Which do you prefer?

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.159
Last night,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.550
the dances
Consort Xie performed in my chamber

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.520
were quite impressive.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.909
I danced?

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.990
I don't remember that at all!

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.420
At the banquet,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.800
let's have Consort Xie perform a dance.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.870
Your Majesty...

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.670
It's settled.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.900
Your Highness,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.370
are you feeling unwell?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.850
I've caught a slight cold recently

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.480
and feel a bit off.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.920
On such a fine day,

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.240
I'd better excuse myself

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.870
so as not to spoil Your Majesty's and
the Empress Dowager's enjoyment.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.800
What a pitiful look.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.750
How scheming.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.600
Stop pretending, Sister.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.680
Pretending to be sick for sympathy?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I hope His Majesty

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.160
doesn't fall for this
"white lotus"'s trick.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.000
Well, Consort Yu's heal—

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.570
Get lost.

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.159
What a shame.

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:40.830
She was trying to act pitiful,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.490
but turned out truly pitiful.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.040
His Majesty is sick of her now.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.040
Serves her right.

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.710
My dear,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.960
come to my chamber again tonight,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.330
alright?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.240
Isn't that Noble Consort Yu
who just lost favor?

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.160
Stop looking.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.240
Xiahou Dan's performance
of favoring the new over the old

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.510
is quite convincing.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.240
According to the original story,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.480
by now, I, the demonic consort,
should have been

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.360
completely suppressed by Xie Yong'er,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.560
never able to turn things around again.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.170
Turn things around?

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.020
Whether it's me, Xie Yong'er,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.100
or even Xiahou Dan—

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.690
we might all just be 2D characters
in Prince Duan's eyes.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.700
My Lady.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.980
[Let's have a chat
in the flower house at midnight]

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.810
What's meant to come has come.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.990
Wanyin.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.700
I'm here.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.000
Come to me.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.510
This man

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:44.720
is so good at this.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.860
I was careless.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.760
I should have brought Mr. Bei
or secret guards for safety.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.960
But he probably won't

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.420
take my life at this stage.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.910
I'll struggle a bit first

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.150
to see

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.300
what level he's really at.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.650
Your Highness, what did you

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.630
ask me here for?

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.310
Earlier today,

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.050
I visited Minister Yu.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.270
He misses you

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.100
and wants to know
how you're doing in the palace.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.200
So I thought

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.320
I'd ask on his behalf.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.800
That's very thoughtful of you,
Your Highness.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.060
However...

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.750
life in the palace...

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840
is just like this.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.240
Wanyin, do you have something
on your mind?

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.530
Concubine Xie

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.610
attended His Majesty last night.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.190
This morning,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.150
she was promoted to Consort.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.540
Your Highness,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.310
what do you think of Consort Xie?

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.560
She is His Majesty's woman.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.420
I dare not comment.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.280
What about me?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.080
Your Highness,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.650
what do you think of me?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.920
Like viewing a flower through the mist,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.250
I can't see you clearly.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.600
Your Highness,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.330
why do you feel this way?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.630
Wanyin,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.960
we've known each other
for quite some time.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.290
Perhaps some things...

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.900
should be spoken plainly now.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.730
For example?

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.130
For example...

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.670
who...

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.120
are you exactly?

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.140
I...

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.080
Or...

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.080
who is His Majesty?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.480
And who is Xie Yong'er?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.060
The worst guess has come true.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.890
He saw through Xie Yong'er,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.120
perhaps because this lovesick fool

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.250
let something slip.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.990
That he can see through me too

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.860
might be because I slipped up somewhere.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.980
But he even saw through Xiahou Dan,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.030
that master actor.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.160
That's impossible.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.530
Which means

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.480
he can only be

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.680
standing on a higher level.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.420
Wanyin, there's no need to be so nervous.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.780
I have never meant you any harm.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.680
And since you can foresee some things,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.670
you should know that choosing me

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.320
is the wiser choice.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.000
Since you already know everything,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.260
what do you need me for?

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.670
I didn't come to you
to have you do anything.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.910
I came because I've fallen for you.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.400
We're not even the same species.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.080
Not even from the same dimension.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.480
How could you fall for me?

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.420
Well...

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.610
That doesn't seem to matter, does it?

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.080
So

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.620
you like me as a character?

We're at a critical moment of survival.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.460
The people are exhausted,

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.080
resources are running dry,

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.930
the soldiers are growing old,

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.430
and the people's hearts are drifting away.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.030
To make peace with a life

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.560
of frustrated aspirations;

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.280
steeds and spears were never

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.240
my desire.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.830
Sir, excellent poem!

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.170
I have one too.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.410
Please take a look.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.680
A true gentleman seizes the moment,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.240
and a wise man understands his fate.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.070
Though old,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.400
one's resolve need not fade;

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.160
though poor, one's ambition

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.400
should not fall.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.240
Loyal and righteous men
have all but perished,

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.720
[Discourses on Salt and Iron]

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.980
while troubles within and without
rise one after another.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.880
Fellow scholars,

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.310
[Du Shan]

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.270
you have studied diligently for decades,

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.440
upholding righteousness
with quiet forbearance amid chaos.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.070
-Don't rush.
-Thank you.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.270
You possess extraordinary integrity.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.430
The rise and fall of the realm

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.640
concerns every man.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.880
When the land is adrift,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.310
rather than replacing the ruler,

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.590
it's better to destroy the old rules
and rebuild.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.070
I wish to befriend all you heroes

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.270
and shape the nation,

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.240
saving the collapsing tide

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.410
and supporting the falling edifice.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.240
Let's set the heart for Heaven and Earth,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.770
secure life for the people,

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.110
carry on the lost teachings of the sages,

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.840
and bring lasting peace
for generations to come.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.800
Let's gather
at East Lake at the end of the month

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.680
to discuss our grand plan.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.410
This journey may be dangerous.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.560
I ask that you

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.370
travel with caution

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.530
to ensure your safety.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.790
As a CEO, he really deserves your title.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:41.680
His literary talent

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.490
puts me, a corporate drone,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.550
to shame. I can't compare at all.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:58.830
Cen.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.220
Let me borrow this.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.640
We came to answer your invitation

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.920
because we were moved
by the words in your letter

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.680
and wished to meet a kindred spirit.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.310
Yet today,

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.390
all you've arranged
is drinking and sightseeing.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.740
This hardly feels like

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.520
the long-awaited meeting
your letter promised.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.480
You have all traveled far,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.940
and endured the discomfort
of being veiled.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:30.880
I

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.840
truly feel uneasy about it.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.550
As my letter said,

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.890
I have long admired your talents.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.240
The brilliant essays you have written,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.030
I often read aloud to myself
and ponder in my heart.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:42.550
When I close the book...

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.350
Let's skip

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.740
the pleasantries.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.400
Establishing offices
and building the nation

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.880
is meant to provide the people
with the means to live;

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.550
levying taxes and collecting revenue

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.030
is to support the state.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.000
All taxation

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.240
must

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.840
consider people's strength

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.840
and the land's suitability.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.650
This is Li's essay?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.180
Li Yunxi from Zhuozhou

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.380
is erudite and ambitious,

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.640
of noble character,

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.960
upright and unyielding,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.160
frank and outspoken.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.000
If he heads the Ministry of Revenue,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.170
his meticulous nature

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.520
will surely deter all corruption.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.770
I must drink to that.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.350
You've certainly

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.480
done your homework.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.050
Du Shan from Bingzhou,

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.620
with his piece "Red Kite,"

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.610
moved the world.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.680
If he heads the Ministry of Rites,

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.280
he will bring honor
and integrity to Great Xia.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.960
I don't deserve such praise.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.320
The key to river management

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.340
is first to understand its principles,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.920
then adapt to circumstances,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.590
and weigh with human compassion.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.120
Er Lan's "River Transport"

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.510
is insightful yet accessible,

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.440
every word a gem.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.430
If he heads the Ministry of Works,

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.350
the population growth of Great Xia

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:05.550
will be within reach.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.100
Yang is clever and flexible,

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.550
skilled in mathematics.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.830
Now that times have changed,

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.100
today, the Ministry of Personnel

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.570
needs someone like you

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.590
to choose talent

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.160
without prejudice.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.570
I'll drink to that.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:22.200
Wang Zhao

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.880
is honest and straightforward,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.740
a pleasure

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.260
to meet.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.680
In the future, he may well serve
in the State Ceremonial Bureau,

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.280
mediating between nations.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.720
You

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.660
promised everyone such grand prospects.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.240
So,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.080
what role am I to take on?

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.960
Food is the first necessity of the people.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.920
Cen, if you serve
as an agricultural official,

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.780
it will be a great blessing to all.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.590
The northwest now

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.920
suffers from severe drought,

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.310
while the southwest is plagued by floods.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.920
Recently,

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.340
I came across a book
from the Western Regions

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.400
that records a crop

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.770
resistant to lodging

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.200
and tolerant of both drought and flooding.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.330
If there is a chance,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.890
I would like to discuss it with you

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:01.950
through the night.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.910
Your Highness,

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.210
our men just sent word.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.640
The Emperor has secretly left the palace
and gone to the West Mountain.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.700
The West Mountain?

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.820
Why did he suddenly
go to the West Mountain?

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.720
His villa is there.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.290
Perhaps he went to enjoy the hot springs.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:29.880
Stop joking.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.070
Lately, the Emperor
has been leaving the palace frequently.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.870
A few days ago,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.720
he rode his carriage
around the city 3 times

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.350
and returned
without doing anything at all.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.950
Don't you find that strange?

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.960
How many people did the Emperor bring?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.240
He traveled with a light escort,

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.270
keeping a very low profile.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.020
It seems

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.390
he doesn't want anyone to know.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.590
If that's the case,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.210
why don't we take
this excellent opportunity

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.890
and just...

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.220
You...

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.750
I can have the troops
I've stationed in the suburbs

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.010
disguised as bandits.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.590
We can certainly accomplish
this great deed

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.990
without anyone knowing.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.170
No, Your Highness!

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.270
-Yes, we can't do that, Your Highness!
-There must be something wrong.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.510
We have planned for years

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.270
and attempted assassination
more than once,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.270
yet the Emperor has evaded them all.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.550
I don't believe

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:28.680
he's truly as incompetent

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.170
as he appears.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.810
I don't believe it either.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.770
-Acting in such haste
-You...

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.440
-risks too much.
-Exactly!

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.400
Why are you so indecisive?

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.990
Opportunities like this don't come twice!

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.560
Well...

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:41.960
You...

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:42.430
You...

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.010
Sir,

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.010
how confident are you
about this bandit plan?

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.900
Your Highness!

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.440
We've rehearsed for a long time.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.900
I dare not say it's foolproof,

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.270
but

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.130
our chances of success are very high.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:00.820
You promised us
all kinds of official positions

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.000
in the Ministries of Revenue, Justice,
and Personnel haphazardly,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.790
as if you could actually

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:05.790
control that incompetent emperor.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.210
Indeed.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.530
To serve a wise ruler

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.810
with one's life;

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.240
to die as a martyr for the country's sake.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.830
Now

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.340
the court's capable men are gone.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.430
I almost wish

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.510
I could strike the ground with my head

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:20.640
to wake that tyrant.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.650
What do you expect from that tyrant?

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.410
But I heard people say

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.680
that Prince Duan is skilled
in both civil and military affairs

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.880
and could be considered a worthy ruler.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.460
Prince Duan only seeks power.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.440
He has done nothing
for the country or its people.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.240
He cannot be considered worthy.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.640
As the ruler of a nation,

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.590
he plunged his people into suffering.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.830
When all is said and done,

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.890
the emperor has failed his subjects.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.310
Beautiful women are disasters.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.750
I suppose the tyrant

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.510
must have been bewitched
by that demonic consort Yu Wanyin,

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.510
-growing ever more muddled and unruly.
-Why me again?

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.480
That's right.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.790
As the poem says, "Nights with
the beautiful woman are too short;

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.350
from now on, the emperor no longer
attends court in the morning."

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.510
Was he a wise ruler

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.360
before that demonic consort appeared?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.440
Just say he's incompetent.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.110
Why blame a woman?

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.510
Are you defending that demonic consort?

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.110
What else?

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.550
Do you really believe
that a woman from the harem

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.960
can disrupt state affairs?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.200
It's just an excuse.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.550
How is it an excuse?

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.440
Everyone says that...

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.040
Says what?

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.590
That she has a snake-like face
that can peel pears?

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.070
You keep calling her
"demonic consort" with such conviction.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.100
Li, have you actually seen her

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.640
perform any witchcraft?

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.070
Er...

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:30.650
Alright, alright.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.790
-Well said, sis.
-Mr. Li, you care about

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.590
-the country and the people.
-You should say more.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.320
I admire you.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.810
Er Lan makes a fair point.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:38.690
But gentlemen,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.920
aren't we getting off topic?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.400
Who should govern this country
and how it should be governed—

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.590
that is what we

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.120
should be concerned about.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.950
Am I right?

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.280
That's right.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.480
As stated in the letter to all of you,

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.310
we must destroy before we can rebuild.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.710
How to break the deadlock

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.810
is the key.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440
In my opinion,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.920
the crux still lies with the people.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.670
Since ancient times,

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.550
the capable should be in charge
and the mediocre beneath them.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.840
Yet now it is the mediocre
who are in charge

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.400
and the capable who are beneath them.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.680
Without breaking the privileges
of the nobility,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.340
none of this can move forward.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.350
As the saying goes,

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.550
"Are kings and nobles

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.000
born that way?"

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:17.800
Exactly!

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.110
War

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.030
does not necessarily destroy a nation,

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:21.550
nor do

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.000
famine and disaster.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.160
But there is one thing

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.530
that can end a nation's fortune
and make the people lose faith:

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.260
when the path

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.770
for the poor and talented
to rise is blocked.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.600
You really dare to say that?

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.960
Why wouldn't I?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.550
All of us here are commoners.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.160
How much can we truly save Great Xia?

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.000
Look up.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:46.030
There is no clear sky,

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.960
only mire and filth.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.830
"Big rats, big rats,

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.350
stop eating our grain."

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.970
For the sake of the people,

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.070
there's nothing we can't do!

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.960
Well said!

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.550
With your ambition and vision,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.350
there is hope for Great Xia!

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:05.880
Indeed.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.480
But ambition alone,

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.000
without the chance to serve in office,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.110
makes saving our nation mere empty talk.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.880
You are indeed like your words.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.720
This drinking session

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.120
has been most enjoyable!

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.920
But you still haven't told us...

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.030
who

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.750
you really are.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.800
It's coming!

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.230
The climax of this scene
is finally coming!

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:35.990
My humble surname...

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.440
is Xiahou.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.840
With such eloquence,

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.250
could you be Prince...

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.680
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, Du.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.130
My given name is...

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.150
Dan.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.990
As for this lady,

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.330
she is the very demonic consort

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.530
you were just speaking of,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.790
Yu Wanyin.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.760
Nice to meet you, gentlemen.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.700
I am Wang Zhao.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.620
Greetings, Your Majesty!

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.300
-I'm Du Shan.
-I'm Yang Duojie.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.440
-I'm Er Lan.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.690
If you want to kneel, then kneel.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.090
Why pull me down with you?

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.350
You expect me to kneel
to this incompetent emperor?

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.350
Over my dead body.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.480
Everyone,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.730
please rise.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.860
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.090
All you know is that

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.240
I am a tyrant, ruling harshly

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.010
and preying on the people.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.060
What you do not know

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.920
is that over the past ten-plus years,

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.900
my power

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.880
has long been hollowed out.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.040
Now, half of the court

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.680
is controlled

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.530
by the Empress Dowager,

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.310
and the other half

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.430
manipulated by Prince Duan.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.880
They make high-stakes gambles
with the lives

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.010
of Great Xia's people again and again.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.490
Though my heart bleeds,

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.790
I can only pretend to be a tyrant

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:28.920
to preserve my own life.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.150
Today's meeting

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.730
is my attempt

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.830
to lay bare my true heart before you,

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.500
in the hope that you

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.030
might understand my unspoken difficulties.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.480
Your Majesty,
if you truly have such intentions,

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.750
why not reform the imperial exam
and recruit talent openly?

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.680
Why did you ask us
to meet you in secrecy like thieves?

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.970
This way of recruiting men

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.110
seems

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.560
beneath your royal dignity.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.060
Too many eyes are watching me.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.720
Even the slightest change
to the imperial exam

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.800
would face opposition from all sides.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.070
If not for my secret guards
searching everywhere,

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.330
your brilliant essays

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.370
would never have reached my desk.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.360
I can only contact you in secret

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.250
so I can place you

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.100
in suitable positions

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.969
to realize your grand ambitions.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.620
Therefore,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.960
you should know that

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.370
what I promised you just now

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.320
was not

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.000
empty talk or hollow bait.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.600
Of course,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.710
I know

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.659
that my one-sided words alone

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.170
cannot, in a single day,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.340
turn your loyal hearts

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.630
toward me.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:48.760
But I must try.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.639
In the future,

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.630
when you enter the court,

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.060
you will surely be targeted

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.230
by the Empress Dowager's
and Prince Duan's factions—

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.840
courted,

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.170
exploited,

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.090
or attacked.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.890
When that day comes,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.760
I only hope you will not forget
the passionate words you spoke

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.880
and the lofty aspirations you laid bare

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.130
on this boat today.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.360
I hope you will stand tall

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.160
and be the backbone of Great Xia.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.590
These are just words

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.590
devised to recruit these scholars.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.320
So why do I feel like crying

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.070
after hearing it?
