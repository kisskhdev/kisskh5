00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.520
Was the door locked when you arrived?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.280
It was.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.240
There are no signs of forced entry through the windows either.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
How many copper keys are there for the shop?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.120
And who holds them?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.720
Aside from these coffins, my coffin shop...

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.240
...doesn't have anything valuable.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.880
So I gave a copper key to the pallbearer.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.280
It was just to make it convenient for the client to pick up the coffin.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.000
The deceased in this coffin...

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.240
Do you recognize her?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.480
I do, I do.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360
This is the wife of the pallbearer Wu Tu'an.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.680
Her name is Xiao Lian.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.880
We know Wu Tu'an very well.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920
So he has a copper key in his hand.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.040
The blood spatter pattern...

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240
suggests that while she was still alive,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.720
she was nailed to death inside the coffin.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.600
This must be the crime scene.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.720
Guiyi.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.720
Investigate closely.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.280
Yes.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.640
I'll be right back.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.880
Come and take a look!

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.800
Take a look!

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.040
My Lord!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.280
Xiao Lian's death has nothing to do with me!

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.800
It has nothing to do with me, My Lord!

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.720
If it has nothing to do with you, why did you run?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.960
Why were you acting so sneaky?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.000
Evil spirit.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.800
There's an evil spirit, My Lord!

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.400
I was afraid of being tainted by the evil spirit.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.240
Evil spirit?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.480
Yes.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.520
That day, Wu Tu'an and I...

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.200
Oh.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.560
That is Xiao Lian's husband.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.960
We were carrying a coffin for the client together.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.920
But somehow...

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.080
...something strange happened.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.160
Coffin in the middle...

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.080
Hey!

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.480
People on two sides...

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.400
Hah!

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.800
We lift the coffin...

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.480
Hey!

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.640
Steady as Mount Tai...

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.520
Hah!

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.000
The filial son keeps vigil...

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.200
Hey!

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.240
Departed soul, walk slowly...

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.000
Hah!

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.240
Brother Tu'an.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.440
Why aren't you answering the work chant?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.040
The one in the coffin isn't a dead person.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.080
I saw it.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.320
Inside is a paper effigy.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.120
Pfft, pfft, pfft!

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.120
You can't say such ominous words while moving the coffin!

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.000
It's a paper effigy.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.440
Inside the coffin is a paper effigy.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.560
It's ominous.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.920
Shh!

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.400
Client, everything is fine.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.240
Watch your step.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.600
After we finished the work for the Sun family,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.400
and received our reward,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.120
we drank some wine to relax,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.840
and forgot about the matter.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.440
But who could have known...

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.320
...that very night...

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.760
Xiao Lian...

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.840
Darling.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.600
Darling.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.080
Darling, what's wrong with you?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.880
Darling, it's me, Xiao Lian. Darling.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.840
What's wrong with you?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.200
Why don't I find you a job in Chang'an City

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.000
as a storyteller some other day?

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.560
With a mouth like yours,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.160
it's a pity you're a pallbearer.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.760
My Lord.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.000
I dare not speak a word of falsehood.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.520
Although I didn't see it with my own eyes,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.840
among us pallbearers,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.160
the word has long since spread.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.760
He must have been possessed by an evil spirit.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.160
My Lord, you may not know,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.560
but what happened afterwards...

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.040
...was even weirder.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.320
Darling

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.320
Why have you returned so late tonight?

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.040
Darling

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.480
What is that burning in the courtyard?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.440
Xiao Lian

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440
Get me something to eat.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.680
Sit down first, Darling.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.760
I saved some food for you.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.480
I'll go get it.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.600
Xiao Lian

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.360
Xiao Lian

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.160
Darling

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.440
What is the meaning of this?

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.000
Darling

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.000
Why have you returned so late tonight?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.240
I saved some food for you.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.360
Hurry, sit down and eat.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.080
Ah

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.640
Darling
