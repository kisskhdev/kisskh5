00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.300
Suddenly proposing to her like that, who wouldn’t be in shock?

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.260
You should’ve come and asked your life coach first.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.300
What should I tell her then?

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.620
You have to explain to her about our plan first. Tell her why you want to marry her.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.420
Tell her you have to marry her because you want to help her.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.260
But I don’t even have the courage to tell her about what happened yesterday.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:58.340
If she finds out that I’m using myself as bait, she’ll definitely say no.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.940
And do you think she’d say yes to this?

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.460
She probably thinks you’ve gone nuts by now.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.380
So…What should I do then?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.660
Should I go and explain everything to her now?

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.900
Not yet. Give her some time.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.700
What you should do now is to come up with a good reason to make her agree to marry you.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.260
It’s not too late, isn’t it? Wouldn’t she think I’m not right in the head by now?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.020
Lom. Lom.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.180
- Suit yourself then.
- Lom, wait. Lom!

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.860
Hey! Lom!

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.500
[Rose: A prince must be with a princess.]

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.600
[Rose: Will the prince marry this princess from the land of rose?]

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.360
[Din: What kind of a princess proposes to a prince first?]

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.200
[Rose: Din!]

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.460
[Din: Yes, I’ll marry you.]

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.460
[Din: Rose, will you marry me?]

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.300
[Din: Please marry me, Rose.]

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.940
[Lom: She probably thinks you’ve gone nuts by now.]

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.960
[Din: Please marry me, Rose.]

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.200
- I'll use these to make you some salad.
- Sounds good.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.330
Din.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.940
Are you leaving, Miss?

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.500
Why don’t you stay for breakfast with Miss Rose first?

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.800
Maybe not. I have a lot to take care of today.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.540
You’re not avoiding her, aren’t you?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.960
Avoiding? Who is she avoiding?

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.060
Don’t listen to her nonsense, Aunt Chan.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.460
Morning, Rose!

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.100
Well, I’m…I’m going then.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.930
- Miss Lom.
- Yes?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.260
What is going on?

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.620
Oh, I’m so hungry now. Let’s go eat. I want to eat some vegetables.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.020
I’ll make you salad then. But you have to tell me everything.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:49.380
Moddang!

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.580
What are you doing, Miss?

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:51.980
Get in here first.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.580
What happened, Miss?

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.330
What is it?

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.860
What’s wrong, Miss?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.130
Moddang, I don’t know what to do now.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.530
What happened?

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.930
Yesterday, Din…

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.900
Miss Din what? Did she and Mr. Wasu fight again?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.180
No, not him.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.660
Din just…

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.580
Yes?

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.760
She…

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.700
Yes?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.930
She…

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:15.860
Yes?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.700
She proposed to me!

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.700
See? You already look so stunned just by hearing it.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.820
She proposed. Miss Din proposed to you!

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.260
Miss Din proposed to you!

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.700
She seems quiet on the outside, but she’s actually down bad for you much more than I thought.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.140
It’s been only a few days after you came back and she’s already proposed to you!

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.560
Stop talking rubbish.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.780
What rubbish, Miss? It’s all true.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.460
Remember that day when you first came back? She was right there to protect you.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.500
Or the other day after that incident on our farm, she also asked you to move in with her.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.130
And now she even proposed to you too!

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.940
If it were me, I’d definitely say ‘Yes!’ without even thinking.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.140
How can I marry her? We’re not lovers.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.060
Aw, look at those people in the past, Miss. You’ll grow to love her soon after marriage.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.260
But I’m not like those in the past.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.800
I’m a gen-Z girl.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.580
Geez, who cares about that? Miss Din is such a sweet person.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.260
Whoever has the chance to be close to her will definitely fall for her.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.800
Whatever. I’m not going to do it.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.140
Why not, Miss?

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.940
Miss Din is considered top-tier around here. Rawr!

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.660
No! I’ve decided.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.540
I’m going to be clear and tell her I won’t marry her.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.730
That’s such a waste, Miss. Please think it over a little.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.760
Moddang. No.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.020
Geez, why is it so hard to ship them together?

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.980
Miss Rose! Please think about it again!

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.660
Aunt Chan.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.900
Yes?

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.160
Have you seen Din?

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.420
She should be in the office by now.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.740
And Miss Lom has gone to the city centre. They’ll probably be back in the evening.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.580
Is the office far from here?

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.500
Not at all. It’s that way, just less than 10-minute walk.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.500
Thank you.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.700
Oh, are you going to go there now, Miss?

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.260
The sun is quite strong outside. I’ll tell Miss Din to come here instead.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.200
It’s all right. I can walk there.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.760
Miss Rose, I’ll go with you too.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.360
It’s quite hot. Let’s stay under the umbrella.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.800
Not hot at all. You’re just being nosy, aren’t you?

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:45.800
Of course not. Miss Din told me I shouldn’t let you go anywhere alone.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.980
You’ve only been here a few days and she’s already bought you off?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.980
Oh, she doesn’t have to do that.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.020
Just by seeing her face, I’m willing to go through heaven and hell for her.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.060
Moddang! She’s not someone you can joke around like that.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.940
Behave yourself.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.900
Oh, are you jealous?

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.100
Wait for me, Miss!

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.860
Please don’t be upset.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.160
Is she really in the office?

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.530
I can’t see her anywhere.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.530
But Aunt Chan said she’s here.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.160
Load them on the truck with the rest of the fertilizers too.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.900
Oh, hello, Miss Rose.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.700
Hello.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.580
What are you doing here, Miss?

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.500
Er…I’m Kla, head of the workers here.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.500
You know who I am?

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.140
Yes, Miss. Miss Din told me to take care of you if you ever come to visit here.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:02.460
She said it’s very easy to know it’s you since you’re very beautiful. So, I’d be able to know right away.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.700
Maybe it’s easier if she introduces me to everyone here.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.560
I thought so too, Miss.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.160
So, where is she now?

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.730
She has gone to the city centre with Kaew.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.620
When she’s back, I’ll tell her that you came looking for her, Miss.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.100
Please excuse me then, I must get back to work.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.930
Yes, thank you.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.060
You’re welcome.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.060
- Is it fresh?
- Yes.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.960
Who’s Kaew?

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.900
She’s Miss Din’s assistant, and also Mr. Kla’s daughter.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.360
I see. An assistant.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:50.260
Yes. But they are very close. They’ve been friends since they were still in school.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.020
After she graduated, Miss Din asked her to help with the work here.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.140
She helps Miss Din taking care of this farm.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.260
If you see Miss Din anywhere, you’ll also see Miss Kaew there.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.940
They seem close indeed.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.460
But don’t worry, Miss. Although they might be really close,

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.740
they’re just friends and nothing more.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.260
Why are you so quiet? Is it because you’re jealous?

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:29.020
Why would I be jealous? I’m just curious. If Din and Miss Kaew are that close,

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:33.180
why didn’t she propose to her then? Why proposed to me?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.460
Jealous for sure!

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.460
Miss Rose, wait for me too!

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.540
Hi, Rose. Aunt Chan said you went looking for Din.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.060
Why are you back alone? Is Din still working?

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.360
She’s gone out with Miss Kaew since noon.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.400
I mean, she’s gone out for work since early morning.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.160
Perhaps…is there something bothering your mind?

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.160
Yes?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.360
Is it about Din’s marriage proposal?

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.200
You know about it too?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.300
Yes. How should I say it? Well, it was actually my idea.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.160
What do you mean?

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.220
It means I told her to do that.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:37.380
I told her that marrying you would be the best way to keep you safe from Mr. Wasupol’s harm.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.700
Safe? How?

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.340
If you agree to marry Din, everyone would think that…

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.820
Din now owns everything instead of you. That’d make you safer.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:56.300
At least, this means Mr. Wasupol will no longer have any excuse to make you marry his son.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:03.330
So, Din proposed to me because it was a plan that you suggested?

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:10.020
Hmm…yes.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.330
She isn’t quite good at communicating. That might’ve made you misunderstand her.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.300
I also find it strange for her to suddenly propose to me like that.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:28.760
Now that you know the truth, will you agree to marry her?

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.500
I really appreciate your concern, Lom.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.760
But for me, marriage must come after love.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.930
But if we have to wait for you to fall in love, it might already be too late.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.160
Also, it’s just a fake marriage.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.460
But I don’t want Din to sacrifice that much and put herself in danger for me.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.660
I’ve already caused her much enough problems.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.860
But Din chose to do it herself.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.060
Thank you, Lom. I’ll think about it.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.460
Aren’t you sleepy, Miss?

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.580
I can barely keep my eyes open now.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.780
Just go to bed then. You don’t have to wait with me.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.000
But Miss Din said…

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:56.020
Moddang, just go to sleep. I can wait for her alone.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:03.780
Well, then…please don’t stay up so late, Miss.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.660
I wish you would wake up soon, Dad.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.400
I’m so confused right now.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.530
The light in the house is still on. Miss Rose is probably waiting for you.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.540
Rose? I don’t think so.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.100
Excuse me for prying, but are you two having a problem?

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.960
When we were with the client today, I noticed you were quite distracted.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.360
It’s nothing.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.860
I’m sorry I didn’t help you drive today.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.360
Kaew, I never think of you as an assistant. You’re my friend.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.860
So, how’s your wrist? Is it better?

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.699
Much better now. Not that hurt anymore, Miss.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:21.100
I’ll try to get back to normal soon so that I can drive for you.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.500
What about your forehead?

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:29.460
It’s getting less swollen now.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.300
Yeah, the red mark has gone.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.400
Din!

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:35.940
Rose.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.380
This is Kaew, my assistant.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.330
Hello, Miss Rose.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.860
Hello, Miss Kaew.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.340
Don’t you think you’re overworking Miss Kaew?

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.460
It’s almost midnight but she still can’t get off work.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.820
Oh, not at all. I’m used to it. You have to be quite flexible when working with her.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.660
You seem to know her so well, Miss Kaew.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.980
So, how come you’re still up?

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.860
I’m waiting for you.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.330
Me? Why?

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.660
To continue where we left off.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.900
I won’t be able to sleep if we don’t clear it up.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.530
I’d better head home then, so that you and her can talk.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:36.780
That’s all right, Miss Kaew. Since you’re her assistant and very close to her, you’re welcome to stay.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.130
It’s about your marriage proposal.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.560
Well, actually…I can explain about that, Rose.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:02.860
You don’t have to. Just listen to me. I already have an answer.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.820
I will marry you. We’ll get married as soon as possible.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.180
Lom. Lom!

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.020
Lom, Lom, Lom, Lom!

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.060
Lom! Wake up! Wake up, Lom!

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.500
- Wake up!
- What?

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.660
Rose just agreed to marry me!

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.760
What?

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.420
Rose agreed to marry me!

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.060
Really?

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.420
Yes! What should I do next?

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.860
Where should I have the wedding? At a hotel or maybe

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.700
Stop!

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.340
It’s midnight. Calm down.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.660
Calm down.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.600
I was a little too happy.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.700
As if you were going to marry for real, huh?

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.460
Isn’t it just a fake marriage?

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.900
But even so, we have to make it as best as we can to show Rose that we are respectful.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.780
Roger that, Miss groom-to-be.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.540
I’m going back to sleep then. I’ll congratulate you tomorrow.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.400
Hey, wait! Lom, wait!

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.620
Lom! Wake up!

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.580
Who am I going to talk to then?

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.060
Wake up!

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.940
- Lom!
- Geez, so noisy!

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.620
Hey, wake up. I can’t sleep, Lom.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.260
What the heck have I done?

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.140
It’s not true!

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.980
How could I face her tomorrow?

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.900
Rose, you’re up early.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.360
Yes, you too.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.780
- About last night…
- About last night…

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.260
You go first.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:37.200
About last night, were you serious?

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.400
Yes, I’m serious.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.800
Then, there’s a lot we have to talk about.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.330
Talk about what?

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.620
Hey, don’t be so serious. We’re not married for real anyway.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.100
Of course, I have to be serious. Although it’s a fake marriage, we have to make everyone believe we’re married for real.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.700
Otherwise, our plan would mean nothing.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.300
What do I have to do then?

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.900
First, we must keep it a secret.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.820
Don’t let anyone know it’s a fake marriage.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.460
Not even Moddang?

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.700
Yes.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.200
What about Miss Kaew?

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.340
I won’t tell her too.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:53.620
She’ll only know that we’re having conflicts with Nubanun farm. But she’ll never know about our fake marriage.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:55.730
Okay.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.420
Right now, we can’t trust anyone.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.820
I believe there’s a mole on our farm who keeps informing Wasu about us.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.700
I promise I won’t tell anyone.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:13.060
Right now, apart from you and me, there are also Nam, Lom, and Fai whom I’ll tell them about this secret.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.900
Everyone in my family will also welcome you as one of the Watinwanich.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.180
So that you can rest assured you’re not facing this problem alone.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.400
Everyone will help protect you.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.260
Thank you.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.730
Is there anything else?

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.380
Second, no matter where you go or whatever you do,

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.140
you should always let me know.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.620
And I’ll also do the same to you.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.460
Yes.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.180
I’ll do my best to arrange our wedding and make it look as real as possible.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.100
Also…

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.960
Also what?

00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:02.300
Also, we have to sign a certificate of marriage to make it legal.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.540
So that Wasu and his dad will believe us.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.300
But you don’t have to worry.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:15.740
I’ll write a contract stating that I’ll never touch any of your assets or properties.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.740
Or if you want, you can divorce me anytime.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:32.000
That’s fine. I understand we have to make it look real, both by law and in practice.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:40.340
In practice? Do you really know what that means?

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.130
Of course, I do.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:00.100
Finally, if you ever meet someone you love and want to cancel this marriage,

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.620
you can always let me know.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.420
Yes.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.020
If one day, you have someone you love and want to cancel this marriage,

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.940
you can always let me know too.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.500
Deal.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:31.020
[Din: One day, I’ll become strong and protect you, Rose.]

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.300
[Din: I promise.]

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.930
[Rose: You promise!]

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.060
Is she really going to marry you as soon as possible?

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.980
Yes. And since you’re the one who came up with this plan,

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.500
you have to be responsible by helping me arrange the wedding.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Nope! I’m a cop not a wedding planner.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.260
- No way. No.
- Hey,wait. Hold it right there.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.730
Listen, you’re the most experienced one among our siblings.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.220
You’re a pro in this, with the most experience and the most flings.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.860
You must know what people who are going to marry want, or what they have to do.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.100
It’s true that I have a lot of flings. But so far, I haven’t met anyone I want to marry yet.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.060
Why do you have to rub it in?

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:33.940
Oh, what to do then?

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.800
Why don’t you just ask Nam?

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.940
She owns a hotel. She surely has arranged hundreds of weddings there. That one is the real pro.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:45.660
That’s right!

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.260
Nam: I already know.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.960
Lom called and told me everything yesterday.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.160
Nam: Don’t worry, Din.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.100
I’ll arrange the best wedding for you.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.980
As for the venue, let me go there and take a look first.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.300
But it’s quite urgent. Are you sure you can do it?

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:21.780
Nam: Easy peasy. I even used to arrange a wedding where the groom ran away in the middle of the ceremony.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.140
Then, please tell Fai for me. I can’t get a hold of her at all.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.130
Not sure if she’s stuck in the mine or on a deserted island somewhere.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.300
Okay.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.740
Fai: What did you say?

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.100
What? Din is getting married?!

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.020
With who? And when? Why? Can we trust that person?

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.800
When did they fall in love? Why have I never heard about it?

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.460
Nam will come here to take care of the venue.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.620
Mhm. But right now, you have to take care of yourself first.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.600
Huh?

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:38.860
Although it’s just a fake marriage, I genuinely want this wedding…

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.260
to be a good memory, and leave a great impression in your heart.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:57.260
Hello, Miss Din.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.330
This way, please.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.940
Excuse me?

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:15.900
Yes?

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.600
How is it, Miss?

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.660
It fits you perfectly.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.780
If you like this style, you can also choose the colour and the fabric pattern.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.220
Does it really suit me?

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.620
Yes.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:44.300
If you’re not sure, how about we ask Miss Din too?

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.860
What do you think?

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.620
Din.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.900
Din!

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.130
Yes?

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.300
I asked what you think about this dress.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:17.200
It’s beautiful.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.930
I think I’m going to put my hair up like this.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.620
And put on a slight makeup, so that it won’t look too flashy.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.760
You already look so pretty without makeup.

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:38.580
You don’t have to compliment me. It’s just a fake marriage anyway.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:49.300
Even though it’s not real, you’re the most beautiful bride in my eyes.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.340
I’m sorry.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.100
It was my fault, I tripped.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.300
I’d…better go change then.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.930
Can we stay like this for a while?

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.820
I know why you brought me here, but…

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.180
I know.

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:37.500
But even if it’s just a fake marriage,

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.660
I honestly want the best for you.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.580
[Door knocking]

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.460
Hello.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.730
Please feel free and choose any ring that you like.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:12.860
Thank you.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.600
Maybe this one.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.660
It’s quite simple. I can wear it every day.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.000
Can we try that one, please?

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:41.960
Yes.

Right now, the police–especially that Wayo girl–are keeping an eye on us.

Nam already told me everything. I’m not going to let my sister risking her life like that.

[Din]: All right then, let me officially introduce you guys to each other again.

Someone seems to have lost her mind earlier.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.200

This is Rose.

Hello.

Hi.

Hi…there.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.330
We’ll help arrange the wedding for you.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.700
Thank you so much.

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.100
Lom told me that you’re a pro in wedding arrangement.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.900
Oh, not at all.

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:23.420
She’s exaggerating.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:29.180
So, do you want to have the wedding here or at Chomchan farm?

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.560
What do you say?

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.100
I think it’d be safer to do it here.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:40.400
And how many guests would you like to invite?

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.860
I want to keep it small and private.

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:50.060
Maybe with a small corner for the VIP guests like those senior officials from the province.

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:54.060
In case if Mr. Wasupol and his men show up, they mightn’t dare to stir up any trouble.

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:56.580
That’s a good idea.

00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.260
Those senior officials can also be the witnesses for our wedding.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.420
As for your safety, let me take care of that.

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.700
And about photography for a prewedding, Fai will help take care of it.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.220
Who said I’d do it?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.860
Fine. But that’s because Nam’s asked me to.

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:27.060
Okay then, I’m going to take a look around a bit.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.220
I’ll see what I can do with the place.

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.980
Then, I’ll tell the organizer to work on it.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.360
Go ahead then.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.900
Fai, come and help me take some pictures. I have to send them to my staff.

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.100
Okay.

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:47.620
Please feel free to use as many flowers as you want from my farm.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.760
I’ll tell my workers to bring them here for you.

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.740
Thank you.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.700
Hey, can you stop making a sullen face?

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:04.940
What? I haven’t said anything yet. You’re all imagining it.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:11.560
Fai, no matter what, I’m going to marry Rose. Please try to understand me a bit.

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.900
I know, I know. Can’t you see I’m trying to cooperate?

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.930
Where are you going?

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.800
To get my camera.

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:28.780
Din, did I do anything to upset Fai?

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.130
She’s always like that to strangers.

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:35.700
But once you get to know her more, she’s actually quite friendly.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:47.460
Sis, let’s do the prewedding photoshoot tomorrow.

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:50.100
But it might look a little dry in the background.

00:59:56.330 --> 01:00:00.780
Then, should we do it at your farm instead? It’ll probably look prettier.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.800
Yeah, that’d be better. Can we use your farm, Rose?
