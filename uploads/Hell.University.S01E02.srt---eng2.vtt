00:02:16.993 --> 00:02:19.787
Guys, I think we’re almost there.

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:20.828
Guys, wait!

00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:23.886
Are you sure this is the right way?

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.555
Hell University.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.663
You all need to register.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.629
Remember...

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:36.125
This university changes at 7:00 p.m..

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:37.460
Be careful.

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:39.667
Hello, newbies.

00:02:39.894 --> 00:02:42.230
I am Madam Violet.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.476
Headmistress of Hell University.

00:02:45.976 --> 00:02:49.897
7 pm to 5 am is what we call Freedom Night

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.108
Also known as Bloody Night

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:53.984
Everything is free.

00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.904
You are free to do whatever you want.

00:02:56.946 --> 00:02:59.031
Killing is allowed.

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:00.866
So I suggest that you stay in your rooms...

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.035
Lock up your doors,

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.121
and don't go out.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:08.541
What did we get ourselves into?

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:11.627
What if something bad happens to us?

00:03:12.795 --> 00:03:14.588
Jerome, it’s Mia!

00:06:33.948 --> 00:06:36.742
Why aren't they fazed by death?

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:40.127
What the hell is wrong
with this university?!

00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:43.252
They did it again.

00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:44.986
Who did this?

00:06:45.847 --> 00:06:47.181
Black Blood Gang.

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:50.184
That nail in his tongue is their symbol.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.478
Another war will happen soon...

00:06:53.437 --> 00:06:54.897
And I know this war will be bloodier

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.603
now that they've killed Raze
Silvenia's one and only brother.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:01.279
Raze Silvenia?

00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:04.574
The leader of the Devil God Warrior.

00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:21.405
Good morning, class. I hope I'm not late.

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:25.094
Yes, you are, Mr. Dimatalo.

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:28.681
You know Supremo hates people who are late.

00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:34.687
Who’s this girl?

00:07:35.612 --> 00:07:37.103
And what’s with her attitude?

00:07:37.648 --> 00:07:40.026
And who is this “Supremo”
she’s talking about?

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:45.406
You're right, Ms. Nicky. So-sorry...

00:07:46.324 --> 00:07:47.491
Ahh class...

00:07:47.595 --> 00:07:49.775
We'll begin our lecture in a while.

00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:52.705
Ahh... please bring out your algebra books.

00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:09.138
Algrebra is about finding the unknown.

00:08:10.381 --> 00:08:11.470
In this class...

00:08:12.517 --> 00:08:17.188
I will teach you how to find X...

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:21.359
and Y.

00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:40.544
Do you know everything?

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:46.467
What is this girl taking about?

00:08:47.677 --> 00:08:50.054
Why won’t she leave me alone?

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:55.393
If m equals three and x is equals five

00:08:57.311 --> 00:09:02.066
and b is equals six. We will find the y...

00:09:05.486 --> 00:09:10.658
I said... do you know everything?

00:09:12.576 --> 00:09:13.452
No, I don't.

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:16.872
But I'll figure it out on my own.

00:09:18.082 --> 00:09:19.959
I don't need anything from you.

00:09:26.841 --> 00:09:29.844
Your curiousity will kill you, Zein.

00:09:31.846 --> 00:09:33.097
Suit yourself...

00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:39.528
If you really want to know the
truth, you must find it yourself.

00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:45.568
Or you can have it the easy way...

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.499
break the only rule.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.788
Can you just leave me alone?

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:00.583
If I'm curious about something...

00:10:01.176 --> 00:10:03.329
I'll figure it out on my own.

00:10:10.384 --> 00:10:12.678
Do you hear how pathetic you sound?

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.235
Well anyway...

00:10:17.183 --> 00:10:20.102
If you don't want to die early...

00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:24.774
I would just obey the
rules and shut my mouth.

00:10:32.615 --> 00:10:34.116
Who are you?

00:10:37.953 --> 00:10:39.455
Let's just say...

00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:43.834
I'm one of the big dogs here.

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:46.221
And no one...

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:48.923
talks back to me

00:10:51.258 --> 00:10:52.676
like what you’ve been doing.

00:10:57.908 --> 00:10:59.269
But I got to say...

00:11:00.101 --> 00:11:02.269
I kind of admire your...

00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:07.024
tenacity, Ms. Zein Shion.

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:09.944
You have my attention.

00:11:11.028 --> 00:11:12.238
I wonder...

00:11:13.447 --> 00:11:16.617
what reckless thing you'll do next.

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.914
This girl is really testing me.

00:11:23.124 --> 00:11:26.085
But there’s things I want to
find out about this university too.

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:29.480
Fine.

00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:31.340
Just do it, Zein.

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:38.431
I want to know what the
deal is with this university?

00:11:44.532 --> 00:11:45.566
Miss Shion!

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.733
Are you ready to listen
and be part of this class!?

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:53.028
Yes, Sir. Sorry.

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:21.785
Shit! Did you see that?
There's so much blood!

00:12:22.224 --> 00:12:23.277
Jerome, please!

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:26.478
Shut up! You're making it worse!

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.731
So annoying!

00:12:28.731 --> 00:12:29.899
I'm sorry!

00:12:30.608 --> 00:12:32.610
How about the guy with red hair?

00:12:33.027 --> 00:12:34.403
Did you see him too?

00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:37.114
Are you sure about what you saw, Mia?

00:12:37.406 --> 00:12:39.783
Cause we really didn't notice anyone.

00:12:42.578 --> 00:12:47.333
Isn't it because of the dead body we saw?

00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:49.835
That's why you keep seeing
things that aren't there?

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.907
No!

00:12:51.323 --> 00:12:52.929
I'm sure. I saw him.

00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:55.716
Then he just disappeared.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.100
Huh?

00:12:57.635 --> 00:12:58.969
Don't worry about it, Mia!

00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:00.733
If his hair is red...

00:13:00.804 --> 00:13:02.598
we can easily spot him.

00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:05.421
Because...

00:13:05.976 --> 00:13:07.102
his hair is red!

00:13:07.228 --> 00:13:08.120
Huh?

00:13:08.145 --> 00:13:09.772
You're saying stupid shit again!

00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:13.077
Guys!

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:14.584
Zein's not here!

00:13:14.735 --> 00:13:15.835
What!?

00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:16.698
What do you mean Zein's not here?

00:13:16.723 --> 00:13:17.952
Where could she be?

00:13:17.977 --> 00:13:19.691
She told us we would meet here!

00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:23.492
[beeping]

00:14:14.545 --> 00:14:15.796
Are you ready to die?

00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:20.623
You've got some nerve, huh?

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.053
You think you can outdo me?

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:25.848
I've killed many people.

00:14:28.105 --> 00:14:29.981
Do you want to be added in the list?

00:14:30.728 --> 00:14:31.834
Am I right?

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.045
Who are you?

00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:38.277
You want to know my name?

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.988
I'm Nicky Colt.

00:14:41.697 --> 00:14:45.075
Listen well next time, bitch!

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.486
Where could Zein be?

00:15:04.511 --> 00:15:05.818
She should be here by now.

00:15:06.013 --> 00:15:06.920
Hey!

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:08.932
Worried much?

00:15:09.683 --> 00:15:14.529
You know how Matt gets if it's about Zein.

00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:17.024
He likes her?

00:15:17.733 --> 00:15:21.403
Matt, you're overexaggerating! Calm down.

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:23.822
Chill! Don't overthink it.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:25.324
I'm not overthinking!

00:15:25.699 --> 00:15:28.535
I'm worried about her! I don't want
anything bad happening to her...

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.013
I need to find her!

00:15:31.038 --> 00:15:33.332
You can't skip class, Matt!

00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:35.809
You know it's against the rules!

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.512
And everyone's eyes are on us.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.171
You might get hurt.

00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:43.984
You're being too much!

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.465
You're so overprotective!

00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:51.379
This lover boy can't help it.

00:15:52.476 --> 00:15:55.479
He’ll go against all odds for Zein!

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.149
What if you had to go
through Bloody Night for her?

00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:01.582
Will you still save her?

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.949
Of course!

00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:05.337
But not just for her...

00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:07.452
I'll do it for all of us.

00:16:08.909 --> 00:16:10.918
We're all in this together, right?

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.930
Chill.

00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:14.039
I'm just making you laugh.

00:16:14.744 --> 00:16:15.848
She'll be here.

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:17.223
Don't worry too much.

00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:19.426
Speaking of Bloody Night...

00:16:20.295 --> 00:16:21.621
So, what's the plan?

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:24.488
Are we going to coop up in the dorms again?

00:16:24.809 --> 00:16:26.728
Of course! Isn't that obvious?

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:27.845
We’re safer there.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.446
But...

00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:32.599
But aren’t you curious what it's like to
be on the ground during Bloody Night?

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.722
What if...

00:16:34.834 --> 00:16:36.043
Let's go out for a bit tonight?

00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:40.732
I want to see everything up close.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.110
Are you serious, Dave?

00:16:43.735 --> 00:16:44.957
Do you have a death wish?

00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:46.707
Of course not!

00:16:47.322 --> 00:16:49.741
Maybe the red-haired guy
you're so curious about is there!

00:16:50.492 --> 00:16:51.637
The one you keep looking for?

00:16:52.484 --> 00:16:53.535
Oh no!

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.222
Someone's being jealous!

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.480
Really?

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.125
But you know guys?

00:16:59.376 --> 00:17:00.590
Dave has a point.

00:17:01.128 --> 00:17:04.423
Until when are we hiding every 7:00 p.m.?

00:17:05.215 --> 00:17:07.676
I admit... I'm curious too!

00:17:08.434 --> 00:17:10.471
But our safety is our priority!

00:17:11.054 --> 00:17:12.114
Right!

00:17:12.139 --> 00:17:13.807
And we're newbies here.

00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:16.477
Their eyes are set on us.

00:17:16.977 --> 00:17:19.354
We can't trust anybody here, remember?

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.322
So that's it?

00:17:22.066 --> 00:17:23.832
We'll always hide?

00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:25.402
Exactly, it's better!

00:17:26.695 --> 00:17:28.864
Unless you want to face
those killers head on?

00:17:30.407 --> 00:17:31.992
We need to stay together, okay?

00:17:33.327 --> 00:17:35.785
We can't leave without
Zein on Bloody Night.

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:37.289
It's too dangerous!

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.473
Don't you have class?

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:12.238
Full name, please.

00:18:15.869 --> 00:18:16.941
Zein.

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:18.664
Zein Shion.

00:18:25.308 --> 00:18:26.331
Boo!

00:18:29.716 --> 00:18:30.723
Nice.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.445
What's your problem?

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.098
Don't you still have class to attend to?

00:18:37.114 --> 00:18:38.457
Why are you here?

00:18:39.601 --> 00:18:40.754
Why do you care?

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:51.446
This is your first warning, Ms. Shion.

00:18:52.072 --> 00:18:54.032
Once, I see you out here
again during class hours...

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:56.122
I'll make sure to break your arm off.

00:19:04.585 --> 00:19:05.752
Who are you!?

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.723
Ace Craige.

00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:10.635
The Supreme Student Government
President of Hell University.

00:19:12.342 --> 00:19:14.636
Supreme Student Government President?

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:17.764
Nice meeting you, Ms. Shion.

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.689
Who is he?

00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:29.151
Is he the one they're afraid of?

00:19:30.277 --> 00:19:31.528
Supremo?

00:19:51.598 --> 00:19:53.892
Physics helps us understand

00:19:54.273 --> 00:19:56.733
how the body responds to external forces.

00:19:58.098 --> 00:19:59.433
Like for example,

00:20:00.007 --> 00:20:02.468
when someone gets
bruises from a tight grip...

00:20:03.107 --> 00:20:05.401
that's force and pressure in action.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:10.308
Concentrated force
damages tiny blood vessels

00:20:10.953 --> 00:20:12.621
and the longer it is applied

00:20:12.954 --> 00:20:14.790
the more severe the injury.

00:20:16.499 --> 00:20:17.832
- Ms. Kath?
- Yes?

00:20:17.857 --> 00:20:19.609
So the stronger the punch?

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.095
The harder the fall?

00:20:23.038 --> 00:20:24.498
Jerome!

00:20:26.273 --> 00:20:28.942
If that's what you understood
from my discussion, Jerome

00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:30.326
I won't correct you.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.926
But don't come crying to
me when you fail my subject.

00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:42.775
Nice of you to join us, Ms. Shion.

00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:44.246
Sorry.

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:49.164
Zein!

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.415
What's this?

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.584
What happened to you?

00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:55.587
Why is your arm bruised?

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.134
What happened?

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:03.470
That looks different...

00:21:05.722 --> 00:21:06.932
Zein, who did this?

00:21:07.563 --> 00:21:08.629
Tell me.

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.647
May I see that, Ms. Shion?

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.243
That's the first warning.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:31.707
Use this.

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:34.334
But remember this,

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:38.463
warning number two means
a more severe punishment.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.510
What are you talking about, Ms. Kath?

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.012
Who did that to you?

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:47.973
Supremo.

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.629
Don't make any more offenses.

00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:55.090
Next time, you won't be as lucky.

00:22:09.597 --> 00:22:10.770
Supremo?

00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:12.514
Who's that?

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:13.790
Ace Craige.

00:22:17.043 --> 00:22:18.920
Okay, back to our lesson!

00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:24.092
Where have you been?

00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:25.218
I was worried sick.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:28.071
Don't worry...

00:22:28.096 --> 00:22:29.389
this is nothing.

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:34.352
You know how this place
is filled with bastards.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:37.762
But I'm okay.

00:22:38.241 --> 00:22:39.284
Don't worry.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.129
You're sure?

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:45.155
Next time, don't go anywhere without me.

00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:47.160
Okay?

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:55.457
Your curiousity will kill you, Zein.

00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:58.348
Suit yourself...

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:04.800
If you really want to know the
truth, you must find it yourself.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.764
Or you can have it the easy way...

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:15.977
break the only rule.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:36.289
This school has too many secrets.

00:23:36.738 --> 00:23:38.156
One wrong move

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.252
could put us in danger.

00:23:41.128 --> 00:23:42.921
But if I don't do anything,

00:23:43.296 --> 00:23:44.881
how will we ever get out?

00:23:56.476 --> 00:23:57.480
Matt?

00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:58.453
Zein.

00:23:58.478 --> 00:23:59.271
See you later.

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.262
Who are they?

00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:01.690
What do they need from you?

00:24:01.866 --> 00:24:03.201
They're just looking for trouble.

00:24:03.934 --> 00:24:04.902
Don't mind them.

00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:06.314
Are they bothering you?

00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:08.213
No, they're not.

00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:09.340
Don't worry about me.

00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:12.826
Don't stray away from the group.

00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:14.870
Are you serious, Zein?

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.831
Shouldn't I be the one telling you that?

00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:21.121
Let's go.

00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:45.734
Last night, we confirmed ten deaths.

00:24:46.276 --> 00:24:47.527
There were a few minor casualties.

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.418
All were contained,

00:24:49.672 --> 00:24:53.592
except for the public display
orchestrated by the Black Blood Gang.

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:55.452
It's actually fifteen deaths.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.892
The worst one was Rouge Silvenia.

00:24:59.372 --> 00:25:00.682
Fifteen?

00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:02.375
That's wasn't in my report!

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.252
You should double
check your report, Fritzy.

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:06.421
Anyways, continue.

00:25:06.743 --> 00:25:10.831
They’re growing more rebellious, Supremo.

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:13.111
If this continues,

00:25:13.136 --> 00:25:15.071
given the Bloody Night's history...

00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:19.142
it's only a matter of time before
Devil God Warrior decides to retaliate.

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.312
We can't afford a war
between the two gangs.

00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:24.184
Especially now.

00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:25.723
I agree, Supremo.

00:25:26.175 --> 00:25:28.385
These newbies can be a nuisance.

00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:30.111
You all remember what happened

00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:33.073
the last time a newbie
entered Hell University, right?

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:35.246
Wait!

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:37.269
The newbies aren't in my report either.

00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:39.037
How are you aware of them?

00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:43.582
As the Vice President of the
Supreme Student Government,

00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:45.635
second-in-command to Supremo,

00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:50.674
it's natural that I know all the
newbies entering Hell University.

00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.677
You should've been
aware of the newbies too...

00:25:53.677 --> 00:25:54.965
Fritzy.

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.535
Why weren't you informed?

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:00.824
You know...

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:03.311
there seems to be a lot of...

00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:06.982
inconsistencies with your reports lately.

00:26:08.316 --> 00:26:10.485
Don't make me regret
appointing you as my secretary.

00:26:13.947 --> 00:26:15.066
So...

00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:16.908
how are the newbies adjusting?

00:26:17.617 --> 00:26:19.327
So far, they're okay.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.777
They're quiet.

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:23.581
They keep to themselves.

00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:27.419
And they're not actively
participating during the Bloody Night.

00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:30.105
Quiet?

00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:32.270
Keep to themselves?

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:34.840
Nothing?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.738
Actually...

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.098
there's one.

00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:41.016
There’s this girl…

00:26:41.725 --> 00:26:45.145
I heard from some students
that she's stubborn and rebellious.

00:26:46.813 --> 00:26:47.840
Rebellious?

00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:50.277
How exactly?

00:26:51.057 --> 00:26:52.504
According to the report...

00:26:53.174 --> 00:26:56.504
she wandered off during
her first night in the campus.

00:26:57.073 --> 00:26:58.575
She and her friend almost got injured.

00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:01.119
Some students even witnessed that

00:27:01.144 --> 00:27:03.521
Zein talks and fights back
to anyone who tries her.

00:27:03.837 --> 00:27:05.797
At least, that's their initial vibe.

00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:08.509
She was even late for one of her classes.

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:12.380
She seems to not care about the rules.

00:27:13.001 --> 00:27:15.044
Even the looming danger
of the Bloody Night...

00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:16.760
she seems not to care.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.803
I'm sure you'll easily spot her.

00:27:19.929 --> 00:27:20.996
Interesting.

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:25.185
Supremo... maybe she just wants attention?

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.730
There's always someone
like that every year.

00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:31.871
Maybe...

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:33.434
Maybe not.

00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:35.809
Keep an eye on her.

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:37.530
I want to know everything.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.174
Why?

00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:40.909
Just do it!

00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:43.871
Copy, Supremo!

00:27:45.671 --> 00:27:46.691
Let's see

00:27:47.775 --> 00:27:49.526
how long until she breaks.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.743
6:20 pm

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.023
There's still enough time to go
back to the dorm before Bloody Night.

00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:33.988
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:35.723
Where do you think you're going?

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:37.423
Hey! Are you stupid?

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:41.845
You know how dangerous it is in a few
minutes and you're prioritizing peeing?

00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:42.695
Zein, be for real!

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.573
Do you have a death wish, Zein?

00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:47.934
I can just kill you right now!
Do you really want to die?

00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:49.144
You're all exaggerating!

00:28:49.433 --> 00:28:50.684
I just need to go to the bathroom!

00:28:50.854 --> 00:28:52.105
I really need to pee!

00:28:52.209 --> 00:28:52.876
I'll be fast!

00:28:52.939 --> 00:28:53.895
Please!

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.567
Zein, I'll go with you.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:56.526
Are you serious?

00:28:56.752 --> 00:28:59.839
You two are being stupid! Suit yourselves!

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:01.824
Let them be, Van.

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:03.283
They can take care of themselves.

00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:06.327
And they still have time before 7:00 p.m..

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:07.605
Ugh!

00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:09.332
Right?

00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:10.395
Right.

00:29:10.832 --> 00:29:12.834
Just be aware of the
time and be careful, okay?

00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.191
Ms. Shion?

00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:19.382
I see one warning isn't enough for you?

00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:21.634
I just need to go to
the bathroom, Ms. Kath.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:23.344
Is that against the rules?

00:29:23.803 --> 00:29:24.777
Of course not.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.887
Go ahead.

00:29:26.973 --> 00:29:29.392
Just do it fast and keep
your curiosity to yourselves.

00:29:31.443 --> 00:29:36.031
It’s starting to get dangerous out
there, and I’m sure you’re aware of that.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.809
Come on.

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:43.656
We'll go ahead.

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:46.743
Stop worrying, Van.

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:48.620
I'm so annoyed.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.134
You’re so stubborn.

00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:06.221
I can go to the bathroom on my own.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:07.996
Look around...

00:30:09.265 --> 00:30:10.637
there's no one here.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.199
Safe.

00:30:14.896 --> 00:30:17.440
You know there's no
area here that's safe, right?

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:23.305
It's better that the
two of us stay together.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.991
I always want to be sure
that I can protect you.

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.178
Just wait for me here, okay?

00:30:47.428 --> 00:30:49.222
Be careful, okay? Hurry up!

00:30:49.973 --> 00:30:51.532
I'm serious, be careful.

00:30:51.557 --> 00:30:52.652
I will.

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:04.028
What's the deal with this
school? And with Ace?

00:31:04.934 --> 00:31:08.116
What has he done to make
everyone so afraid of him?

00:31:09.325 --> 00:31:11.703
Who are the people that built this school?

00:31:12.912 --> 00:31:15.039
Who are the members of the Black Blood Gang

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.582
and Devil God Warrior?

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:22.588
Your curiousity will kill you, Zein.

00:31:23.089 --> 00:31:24.924
If you really want to know the truth...

00:31:25.915 --> 00:31:27.833
you must find it yourself.

00:31:28.428 --> 00:31:31.597
Or you can have it the easy way...

00:31:32.348 --> 00:31:35.351
break the only rule.

00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:41.190
What's the rule Nicky keeps talking about?

00:31:42.248 --> 00:31:45.543
I'm only aware of Hell
University's one and only rule.

00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:48.531
I need to know.

00:31:49.206 --> 00:31:50.214
But how?

00:31:51.421 --> 00:31:54.633
Do I have to go out during
Bloody Night to find out?

00:31:57.204 --> 00:31:59.373
But we’re surrounded by demons.

00:32:01.127 --> 00:32:03.671
What will happen to me if I do that?

00:32:14.735 --> 00:32:15.725
Shit!

00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:29.670
Matt?

00:32:31.908 --> 00:32:33.159
Matt?

00:32:37.663 --> 00:32:38.834
Matt?

00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:41.998
Matt?

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.976
Zein, it's 7:00 p.m..

00:32:59.568 --> 00:33:01.195
They're out here for blood.

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:05.066
We need to leave before they surround us.

00:33:05.525 --> 00:33:05.942
Matt-

00:33:05.942 --> 00:33:07.026
We need to escape.

00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:09.237
We need to find Mia and the others.

00:33:10.286 --> 00:33:13.778
We need to hide if we
still want to live, Zein!

00:33:20.748 --> 00:33:21.933
Let's go?

00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:23.126
Be careful.

00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:25.128
Be quiet.

00:33:31.067 --> 00:33:31.984
Hey!

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:32.718
Shit!

00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:36.848
Go after them!

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.642
Move faster! They're coming, Matt!

00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:47.817
Matt! They're coming!

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:48.609
Please!

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.539
Matt, faster!

00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:55.116
Faster, hurry up!

00:33:55.141 --> 00:33:56.905
They're coming, Matt!

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:58.327
Are you done?

00:33:58.327 --> 00:33:59.530
Please!

00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:07.895
Zein, whatever happens
don't let go of my hand, okay?

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.089
Are we going to survive this, Matt?

00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:11.466
Just trust me!

00:35:37.848 --> 00:35:38.944
Let's go!

00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:47.812
Come, let's go!

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:00.700
Faster!

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.842
Where are they?

00:36:01.867 --> 00:36:03.119
They're not here!

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.263
Come on!

00:36:04.288 --> 00:36:06.772
Aren't we going to look for Matt and Zein?

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:08.457
Van, we don't have time!

00:36:08.457 --> 00:36:09.500
We need to hurry!

00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:12.044
What if they need our help?

00:36:12.044 --> 00:36:13.921
We can't stay here!

00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:15.397
It's too dangerous!

00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:19.635
Black Blood Gang.

00:36:20.303 --> 00:36:24.140
One of the two most feared
gangs here in Hell University.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.269
There's more I want to know about them,

00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:31.897
And their rival gang Devil God Warrior.

00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:36.485
But it's hard to ask
around in this university.

00:36:37.153 --> 00:36:39.071
You cannot trust anybody.

00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:42.867
I can only trust Matt and the others.

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.100
Matt,

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.496
this is our chance to search for answers.

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:50.077
Are you being serious right now?

00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:52.835
We almost died.

00:36:56.172 --> 00:36:58.716
We'll die eventually
if we continue being blinded by the truth.

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:02.178
We need to find the truth about this place

00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:03.679
to find a way out.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.123
Zein...

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:10.603
You'll get hurt if you do that.

00:37:13.272 --> 00:37:16.025
Do you want to end up like
Rouge Silvenia? Or worse?

00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:17.873
Huh?

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:22.873
Please, Zein.

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:26.035
Le'ts go back to the dorm, please!

00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:28.108
Please, Zein.

00:37:28.996 --> 00:37:30.247
Please listen to me.

00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:35.753
Matt, please.

00:37:36.773 --> 00:37:37.850
Please, listen

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.913
I can’t do it

00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:44.470
This is our chance
to find out the truth!

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:46.288
Please, Matt.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.809
Zein, we need to go back to the dorm!

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:53.521
It'll be more dangerous
as the night falls.

00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:54.897
Please!

00:38:04.532 --> 00:38:05.655
No, Matt.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.661
We need to know the truth.

00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:12.881
You know, Zein.

00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:16.335
I'm ready to tell you all that I know...

00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:19.885
but please don't do this,
I'm begging you.

00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:22.299
Please, Zein.

00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:24.552
What you did earlier,
don’t do it again,

00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:25.952
Please.

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:28.553
Wait...

00:38:28.723 --> 00:38:31.559
Does Matt know something
about this university?

00:38:33.018 --> 00:38:33.561
How?

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:34.311
Zein...

00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:36.647
Zein, I think they're gone.

00:38:38.664 --> 00:38:39.678
Let's go?

00:38:42.801 --> 00:38:43.795
Okay.

00:39:25.942 --> 00:39:27.170
Matt...

00:39:30.335 --> 00:39:31.419
Be careful.

00:39:33.702 --> 00:39:34.745
Zein, it hurts!

00:39:38.373 --> 00:39:39.374
What happened?

00:39:39.499 --> 00:39:40.647
Matt?

00:39:42.544 --> 00:39:43.803
What happened to you?

00:39:43.837 --> 00:39:45.255
- Zein, my leg hurts!
- Can you still walk?

00:39:48.951 --> 00:39:50.328
Zein, I can't walk.

00:39:50.403 --> 00:39:51.821
My foot is getting numb.

00:39:53.388 --> 00:39:54.014
No...

00:39:54.139 --> 00:39:55.807
Zein, save yourself.

00:39:55.807 --> 00:39:56.350
What?

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:57.437
Just leave me here.

00:39:59.404 --> 00:40:01.072
No, Matt. I won't do that.

00:40:01.104 --> 00:40:02.481
I'm not leaving you.

00:40:02.481 --> 00:40:03.491
This is my fault.

00:40:07.986 --> 00:40:08.991
Zein, please.

00:40:11.823 --> 00:40:13.158
What happened, Matt?

00:40:14.618 --> 00:40:15.616
It hurts...

00:40:40.117 --> 00:40:41.243
Matt, please.

00:40:41.268 --> 00:40:42.894
Be okay, please.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.959
Please be okay.

00:40:51.863 --> 00:40:52.983
I'm so cold...

00:41:11.466 --> 00:41:13.131
What are you doing here?

00:41:17.339 --> 00:41:18.507
Leave us alone!

00:41:21.852 --> 00:41:23.103
Leave us alone!

00:41:24.123 --> 00:41:26.439
We didn't do anything wrong to you.

00:41:33.363 --> 00:41:34.397
Zein...

00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:37.884
What are you doing here?!

00:41:37.909 --> 00:41:39.327
Leave us alone!

00:41:40.495 --> 00:41:42.539
We didn't do anything wrong!

00:41:47.711 --> 00:41:49.702
Leave us alone!

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.084
One...

00:41:58.636 --> 00:41:59.804
Two...

00:42:06.646 --> 00:42:08.106
Three!

00:42:10.983 --> 00:42:11.880
One!

00:42:13.504 --> 00:42:14.506
Two!

00:42:15.522 --> 00:42:16.545
Three!

00:43:40.757 --> 00:43:42.509
- Where have you been?
- Hurry!

00:43:42.534 --> 00:43:43.243
Hurry!

00:43:43.243 --> 00:43:43.785
Didn't you check the time!?

00:43:43.785 --> 00:43:44.577
Come on!

00:43:44.577 --> 00:43:44.953
Wait!

00:43:44.953 --> 00:43:46.496
Close it!

00:43:50.083 --> 00:43:50.583
Hurry up!

00:43:50.583 --> 00:43:51.751
Lift the table! Help me!

00:43:51.751 --> 00:43:52.825
Guys, come on!

00:43:55.296 --> 00:43:56.380
One, two, three!

00:43:57.585 --> 00:43:58.715
Lift it!

00:43:59.134 --> 00:44:00.153
What are you doing?

00:44:00.536 --> 00:44:01.325
Okay!

00:44:05.682 --> 00:44:06.266
Hurry!

00:44:06.266 --> 00:44:07.017
Get the tables!

00:44:07.017 --> 00:44:07.817
Hurry!

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:11.563
Get out of the way!

00:44:11.563 --> 00:44:12.580
Hurry!

00:44:12.605 --> 00:44:13.411
Hurry, come on!

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.254
Hurry

00:44:14.566 --> 00:44:15.609
Let's get the sofa!

00:44:15.634 --> 00:44:16.340
Hurry!

00:44:16.875 --> 00:44:17.832
Hurry up, Dave!

00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:23.992
What's happening?

00:44:25.028 --> 00:44:26.094
Dave... Hurry!

00:44:26.119 --> 00:44:26.619
Hurry, Dave!

00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:27.203
Get that too!

00:44:27.203 --> 00:44:28.020
Faster! We can use that too!

00:44:28.045 --> 00:44:29.039
- Wait!
- Get that one, hurry!

00:44:29.039 --> 00:44:29.789
Jerome!

00:44:29.831 --> 00:44:30.832
- Jerome!
- Hurry!

00:44:30.832 --> 00:44:31.750
You're too loud!

00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:34.004
Can't you calm down a bit?

00:44:34.794 --> 00:44:35.962
If we fully cover this,

00:44:36.272 --> 00:44:37.690
we can't see what's going on out there!

00:44:38.368 --> 00:44:40.161
Matt and Zein are still out there!

00:44:40.633 --> 00:44:41.817
Do you want them to die?

00:44:44.728 --> 00:44:45.903
You’re right,
I forgot about them.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.224
You're so smart, Dave.

00:44:50.268 --> 00:44:52.729
But where the hell are they?

00:44:53.605 --> 00:44:55.148
They should be here by now!

00:44:55.482 --> 00:44:57.275
- What if they came across
- Where is Zein and Matt?

00:44:57.275 --> 00:44:58.109
The Black Blood Gang?

00:44:58.134 --> 00:44:59.122
Mia!

00:44:59.569 --> 00:45:01.231
Don't say such things!

00:45:01.256 --> 00:45:02.591
What if they're dead!?

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:04.098
That's not going to happen!

00:45:05.283 --> 00:45:06.134
Mia!

00:45:06.159 --> 00:45:07.702
How do you really feel?

00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:08.895
Huh?

00:45:09.663 --> 00:45:11.895
Earlier, you were worried about them.

00:45:12.399 --> 00:45:13.895
And now you're saying they could be dead?

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:15.152
I don't know, okay?

00:45:15.184 --> 00:45:16.356
I don't know!

00:45:17.102 --> 00:45:18.812
My head is spiraling, Jerome!

00:45:18.837 --> 00:45:20.130
I'm so scared!

00:45:21.257 --> 00:45:22.258
I don't know if you've noticed but,

00:45:22.258 --> 00:45:24.677
people are killing each other outside!

00:45:25.989 --> 00:45:26.930
So sorry...

00:45:27.347 --> 00:45:29.099
I just want all
of us to survive this night!

00:45:29.432 --> 00:45:30.517
All of us!

00:45:31.434 --> 00:45:32.602
- Jerome!
- Is that bad?

00:45:33.345 --> 00:45:35.472
We're all scared right now, okay?

00:45:36.022 --> 00:45:37.440
All of us are worried!

00:45:38.066 --> 00:45:39.442
But please...

00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:41.043
Show some empathy.

00:45:41.068 --> 00:45:42.051
Can you do that?

00:45:47.742 --> 00:45:48.637
Sorry...

00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:52.455
I just want us to survive.

00:45:53.665 --> 00:45:54.916
That's all I want.

00:45:59.754 --> 00:46:00.730
I'm sorry.

00:46:00.755 --> 00:46:01.798
I'm sorry, Mia.

00:46:07.679 --> 00:46:08.571
Okay.

00:46:08.596 --> 00:46:09.931
You're both right!

00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:12.559
We just all want to survive...

00:46:13.601 --> 00:46:16.604
panicking won’t help any of us.

00:46:19.729 --> 00:46:21.314
Let's just trust that they'll come back.

00:46:22.003 --> 00:46:23.570
Everything will be okay.

00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:27.031
Zein and Matt are strong.

00:46:30.034 --> 00:46:33.079
The two of them can survive this.

00:46:33.264 --> 00:46:34.765
I believe in them.

00:46:37.622 --> 00:46:38.628
They'll return.

00:46:39.221 --> 00:46:40.307
They will return.

00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:42.621
Okay? They'll return.

00:46:49.554 --> 00:46:50.638
They're here!

00:46:54.434 --> 00:46:55.059
Wait...

00:46:56.186 --> 00:46:58.563
Who's the red masked guy?

00:46:59.772 --> 00:47:01.858
Matt's unconscious.

00:47:02.246 --> 00:47:03.256
What happened to Matt?

00:47:34.891 --> 00:47:35.881
Matt!

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:39.522
Matt!

00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:40.623
Matt!

00:47:40.647 --> 00:47:41.397
Wake him up!

00:47:41.397 --> 00:47:42.334
Matt!

00:47:54.452 --> 00:47:55.828
- Matt...
- Please...

00:47:55.828 --> 00:47:56.976
What happened to the two you?

00:47:58.889 --> 00:48:01.354
The Black Blood Gang saw us.

00:48:03.878 --> 00:48:07.465
They stabbed Matt with a nail.

00:48:09.217 --> 00:48:10.242
A nail?

00:48:10.635 --> 00:48:12.512
But his wound is just small...

00:48:13.155 --> 00:48:14.749
Why does he look like
he’s already dying?

00:48:15.556 --> 00:48:16.499
Matt...

00:48:16.724 --> 00:48:17.648
Matt!

00:48:19.269 --> 00:48:20.812
I thought so too...

00:48:21.562 --> 00:48:23.439
- The wound is so small.
- I don't understand.

00:48:24.816 --> 00:48:29.988
But he couldn't walk and fainted.

00:48:32.323 --> 00:48:34.575
Then he saved us...

00:48:38.511 --> 00:48:39.971
Let the wound bleed.

00:48:40.673 --> 00:48:43.759
Clean it with warm water until
the poison is removed.

00:48:45.795 --> 00:48:46.851
That's all?

00:48:47.213 --> 00:48:48.339
No medicine?

00:48:51.687 --> 00:48:52.484
Mia...

00:48:52.977 --> 00:48:54.353
Put the ointment on his wound.

00:48:56.654 --> 00:48:58.364
When it's clean... bandage it.

00:48:59.851 --> 00:49:01.686
If your friend is strong...

00:49:02.845 --> 00:49:04.263
he will survive.

00:49:06.441 --> 00:49:07.150
Matt...

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.276
You can survive this!

00:49:08.276 --> 00:49:09.360
Matt is strong!

00:49:19.245 --> 00:49:21.497
Matt, we're here.

00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:24.250
We're safe.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.711
Don't give up.

00:49:28.087 --> 00:49:29.297
Don't worry.

00:49:32.967 --> 00:49:34.093
Where did he go?

00:49:39.747 --> 00:49:40.414
Where is he?

00:49:40.439 --> 00:49:41.649
What is he? A ninja?

00:50:17.345 --> 00:50:19.305
It might be Raze Silvenia.

00:50:19.847 --> 00:50:20.898
The leader...

00:50:21.307 --> 00:50:22.392
of Devil God Warrior.

00:50:22.693 --> 00:50:24.362
But why did he save us?

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.438
We entered this place
without knowing anything...

00:50:27.537 --> 00:50:29.747
we don't know their history,

00:50:29.969 --> 00:50:31.406
who runs the school...

00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:32.807
We need information.

00:50:33.027 --> 00:50:34.487
I'll ask you, Zein...

00:50:34.904 --> 00:50:37.782
Are you ready to trade your life

00:50:37.807 --> 00:50:39.684
with the information I'm about to give you?

00:50:41.058 --> 00:50:42.727
I am so happy to announce,

00:50:43.254 --> 00:50:45.631
on behalf of the Hell U administration,

00:50:45.886 --> 00:50:48.430
that we will be having another...

00:50:50.628 --> 00:50:52.242
Acquaintance Party!

00:50:55.383 --> 00:50:59.512
This is the right time to celebrate

00:51:01.039 --> 00:51:02.207
Especially now,

00:51:02.992 --> 00:51:05.369
after all the deaths these past few weeks.

00:51:06.936 --> 00:51:07.742
Besides,

00:51:07.767 --> 00:51:09.060
the late headmaster...

00:51:10.273 --> 00:51:11.649
recently died.
