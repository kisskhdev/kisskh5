00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.280
Syrus, the Western Merchant

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.160
Who recognizes him?

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.760
My Lord

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.800
I do

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.360
This man has a brandy nose

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.560
He has a great capacity for liquor

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.000
I once drank with him all night

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.640
When was the last time you saw him?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.160
Probably

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.600
Seven or eight days ago

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.960
I was returning from the Western Regions

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.640
and rested at the Ten Thousand Nations Inn

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.440
When I sobered up the next day, he was gone

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.520
He must have gone to Chang'an early in the morning

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.440
That was exactly seven days ago

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.360
Adudan the Arab. Who recognizes him?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.400
I do

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.680
Me

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.880
Lao Yao

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.720
Mm

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.320
This forest is sinister

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.240
I fear it is far beyond our imagination

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.360
I realized that

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.280
According to the map

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.080
we should have reached Wanling Township long ago

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.560
but now we can't seem to find our way out of this forest

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.800
Lao Yao

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.160
Lao Yao

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.720
Lao Yao

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.960
Lao Yao

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.800
Lao Yao

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.720
Lao Yao, can you hear me?

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.080
Shentu

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.000
Here

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.600
The road is this way

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.800
Shentu

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.640
What's wrong, Shentu?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.040
Cover your mouth and nose

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.680
There is a Bewildering Fog in the forest

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.640
It seems we are already trapped in the forest

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.240
It's her

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.480
That wrongful case

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.760
Shentu Boqi

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.960
As a Magistrate

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.040
yet you misjudged a wrongful case

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.720
You deserve to die!

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.000
You deserve to die!

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.840
You deserve to die

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.880
You deserve to die

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.280
You wronged an innocent person

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.800
Go die right now

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.640
Go die right now

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.080
Die!

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.240
Die!

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.800
Shentu Boqi

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.160
You are unworthy of being a Magistrate

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.800
Die!

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.080
Shentu

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.960
Die!

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.680
Shentu, wake up

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.320
Die

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.680
Shentu

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.880
Die

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.640
Die

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.400
Die

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.640
Die

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.680
No

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.240
I cannot fall here

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.200
Bad news!

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.440
Something terrible has happened!

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.400
Village Head! Village Head! Someone else has died!

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.560
What?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.720
Shentu, you're awake.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.400
Where is this?

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.640
If I hadn't stopped you last night...

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.520
...you would have stabbed yourself to death.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.840
This is Brother Sun Jia.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.200
He's the one who saved us last night.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.240
Oh, thank you.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.320
You are too kind, sir.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.880
I wouldn't call it saving.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.720
I was just returning from buying lamp oil...

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.400
...when I happened upon you two lost in the forest.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.240
Lao Yao.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.880
Yeah?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.680
Wanling Township is haunted.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.200
I feel the truth...

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.600
...lies right in this forest.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.280
You two...

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.800
...came here for the spirits?

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.720
Exactly.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.000
You are outsiders.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.920
You may not know...

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.320
...but you must not go into that forest again.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.120
Since you are awake...

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.000
...and it's safer while it's light out...

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.640
...let me lead you out.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.000
Wanling Township is no place to stay.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.560
That forest...

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.800
...what is strange about it?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.440
It is the Vengeful spirit of the mountains.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.480
Nonsense.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.960
There are no such things as ghosts or spirits in this world.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.360
It is easy to enter Wanling Township...

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.000
...but to leave...

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.080
...the only way is through the old forest.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.360
Nowadays, only...

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.160
...those who regularly buy lamp oil dare to walk it.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.080
If no one guides you...

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.160
...you will never leave Wanling Township.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.480
Good advice cannot save a damned soul.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.960
Since you two do not believe me...

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.480
...suit yourselves.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.120
Another death!

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.800
Someone else has died!

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.880
Let's go take a look.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.040
Let's go.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:31.720
Village Head.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.320
This Red bridal dress...

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.120
I'm not blind.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.800
Where is her father?

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.400
We are looking for him now.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.280
We haven't found him yet.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.960
What are you standing there for?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.040
Go find him immediately!

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.720
Get more people to help!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.240
Yes!

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.400
Go!

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.640
The oil lamp... it's out.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.560
Bury her.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.320
While it is still light...

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.600
...bury her in the forest quickly.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.040
Bury her far away.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.760
Do not invite the ghost into the village...

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.680
...to harm the people.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:25.680
Wait.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.680
Since a murder has occurred...

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.720
...why bury the body hastily without investigating the cause?

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.200
Who are you two?

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.360
Acting Vice Minister of the Dali Temple...

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.360
...Yao Yuan.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.920
You guys go that way.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.520
Go.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.280
Check up there.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.160
You guys search over there.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.280
You guys search over there.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.200
Go.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.040
Brother Jia Liang...

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.000
...we can't stay in Wanling Township anymore.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.360
Why don't we leave?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.600
Burning oil every day...

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.040
...we'll burn through our money and die anyway.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.760
Leave?

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.200
Why did we come to Wanling Township in the first place?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.680
Where can we go now?

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:11.840
Hurry up!

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.640
Go find him!

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:16.920
Found him!

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.320
Old Man Yu's body is here!

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:19.800
Go, go, go!
