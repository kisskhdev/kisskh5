WEBVTT

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.000
Who are you? Why are you following me?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.360
This dagger...

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.840
...is undoubtedly the murder weapon.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.320
Last night,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.360
Dong Qiu's movements were also strangely suspicious.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.280
He even went to the unmarked grave in the eastern suburbs.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.160
I've come to see you.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.560
How have you been?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.120
A blank tombstone.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.800
Could it be that inside that grave...

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.040
...lies Miaoling?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.040
I understand now.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.560
Let's go, let's go.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.720
Come with me.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.280
Right now.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.360
What are you acting so crazy for?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.920
Oh.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.960
Lady Xiaomu, you come too.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.800
Call more people.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.920
Bring iron hoes, ropes, and sticks.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.720
Now!

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.680
Bring plenty of men.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.320
Follow me.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.240
Don't be in such a rush.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.720
Wait, take off these clothes first.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.000
You'll understand once we get there.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.720
Shentu, slow down a bit.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.080
Lao Yao.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.440
There is something wrong with this grave.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.360
Be careful.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.280
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.920
Lao Yao.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.080
This pit isn't right.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.560
What's wrong with it?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.560
It's shallow.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.800
An ordinary grave is at least eight chi or one zhang deep.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.880
But this grave...

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.640
...is a mere five chi deep.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.680
Therefore...

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.320
...there is another pit beneath this one.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.120
Just as I thought.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.040
This soil...

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.680
...shows signs of having been turned over.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.040
Here, give me a hand.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.800
Guiyi.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.800
Yes.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.640
Start digging.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.040
Dig!

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.680
Is Dong Qiu being watched?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.520
He is being watched.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.520
Good.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.400
My Lord, we found something.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.720
A vertical coffin.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.480
Pressed Vertical Burial.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480
What is a Pressed Vertical Burial?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.040
An ancient, accursed sorcery.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.360
Using a horizontal coffin to suppress it...

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.880
...cursing the person in the vertical coffin...

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.280
...to never be reincarnated for all eternity.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.600
Hoist the coffin immediately.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.520
Open the coffin.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.760
It's Zhao Di.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.280
It is indeed that dagger, no mistake.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.880
Arrest Dong Qiu.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.240
Search.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.800
My Lord.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.520
What is the meaning of this?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.560
Are you not clear on what you have done?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.400
Your humble servant does not know.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.560
At nightfall...

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.680
...where did you go?

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.440
Your humble servant was in the house the whole time.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.040
Because I must help the Sun family carry the coffin tomorrow...

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.480
...and it will likely be a tiring day...

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.720
...so I was resting in my room.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.720
Is this dagger yours?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040
It does not belong to your humble servant.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.160
So you're saying I falsely accused you?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.680
Your humble servant dares not.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.920
But this truly does not belong to your humble servant.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.360
If you don't admit to killing Zhao Di...

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.800
...then you are admitting to killing Miaoling.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.120
My Lord, what do you mean by this?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.640
Your humble servant does not understand.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.680
Still pretending?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.560
Miaoling died from the Fatal Fragrance inside this incense.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.120
If you still do not understand...

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.560
...then we will dig up the unmarked grave in the eastern suburbs...

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.640
...and examine Miaoling's remains.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.280
I still couldn't hide it from you.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.040
It was me.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.840
I killed that jerk Zhao Di.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.800
Tell me.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.400
Why exactly?

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.240
Why?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.360
Because of Miaoling.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.240
I lied to you that day.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.760
I didn't see any Life-Burning Ritual at the Sun family.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.080
Because...

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.040
At that time, I saw Miaoling calling for help.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.680
Help me.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.040
Help me.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.320
I blame myself for being cowardly and stupid.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.320
I only realized after leaving the Sun family

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.960
that Miaoling was mouthing "Help me."

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.000
I have carried countless coffins

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.280
and seen countless dead bodies.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.600
On the day of the funeral, I only needed one look

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.040
to see that Miaoling did not die of illness.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.720
I thought it over and over.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.680
The problem might be with that scent.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.760
So I tried every way

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.200
to steal some incense from the Sun family.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.080
I'm a rough man.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.360
I don't recognize these things at all.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.480
I found many people to identify it.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.760
Later I discovered

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.320
that this incense was mixed with Fatal Fragrance.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.200
What is your relationship with Miaoling?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.440
She was a well-bred lady.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.920
I'm a poor lad living day to day.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.840
What relationship could we have?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.880
It's just that Miaoling's appearance

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.160
gave me something to look forward to every day.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.280
It's really fun.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.640
Cool and fun.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.360
Oh my.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.600
Be careful.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.800
Don't you think it's dirty?

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.400
What's dirty about this?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.520
The mud on your body will wash right off.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.680
My name is Miaoling.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.240
What is your name?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.240
My name is...

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.400
Miss.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.360
Miss.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.640
Oh no.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.560
The steward is coming.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.720
I have to go quickly.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.800
Miss.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.160
We are good friends now.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.760
I'll come play with you again next time.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.440
Time to go back, the Master is looking for you.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:46.760
My name is...

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.480
I know I don't have such a good fate.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.000
I didn't dare to have delusions.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.000
But that jerk Zhao Di, with his glib tongue,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.360
flattered his way into marrying into the Sun family.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.920
If he had treated Miaoling wholeheartedly, it would have been fine.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.280
But he killed Miaoling for the Sun family fortune.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.720
He deserves to die.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.120
Dying once is too easy for him.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.400
So I pressed him under the coffin.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.400
So he can never be reincarnated.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.400
So you stole the bones when Miaoling was buried,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.960
and buried them elsewhere,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.640
to give her peace in the afterlife.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.480
What a devoted fool.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.320
Just like you.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.320
My Lord.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.520
Guiyi.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.280
The deaths of Wu Tuan, Xiaolian, and Zhuzi.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.440
Dong Qiu has confessed to them all.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.680
Miaoling's body has also been exhumed

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.720
and returned to the Sun family.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.920
Sun Changxing is preparing to rebury her.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.640
Mm.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.360
Understood.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.560
Where are you going in such a hurry, My Lord?

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:32.760
To find Shentu.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.280
Shentu.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.240
Strange things have happened in Wanling Township.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.160
Are you going?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.480
If you're not going, I'll go ahead by myself.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.480
Three, two, one.
