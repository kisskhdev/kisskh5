00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.699
Xiao Man.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.860
You're awake.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.140
Are you feeling any better?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.820
Drink your medicine.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.660
I already have.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.220
Your Majesty,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.220
it's time for court.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.660
You shouldn't go.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.660
I'll go by myself.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.179
Xiao Man,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.860
I had the Imperial Kitchen
prepare porridge.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.540
I'll have them bring it over.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.900
No need.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.460
Your Majesty should attend court.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.300
Let me summon
the Imperial Physician.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.980
Your Majesty should attend court.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.220
Go and rest.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.460
Don't just stand there.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.460
Are you feeling better?

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.540
Much better.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.900
I want to show you something.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.099
This painting has troubled me for days.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.700
I wanted you to see it today.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.980
This is General
Xiao Congrong of Great Qian.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.740
Do you resemble him?

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.179
I do.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.539
Why so alike?

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.660
She...

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.100
She's a relative of yours?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.140
Chu Ying,
there's sweat on your brow.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.459
Are you nervous?

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.740
Very much so.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.659
I'm waiting for your answer

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.780
to see if it'll ease my nerves.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.220
She is not a relative.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.420
She is my mother.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.620
No wonder you bear the likeness.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.460
So you're her child.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.460
Your parents...

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.060
were killed by my father.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.860
Do you know?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.939
I do.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.499
Then as the daughter of the Zhen clan,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.979
and I as the son of the late emperor,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.579
what stance should we take?

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.180
You're asking too suddenly.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.859
I'm not prepared for this question.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.059
Let me think about

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.340
how to tell you my thoughts

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.219
without hurting you.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.499
There's no need for that.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.779
I'm afraid the answer will be

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.459
too harsh for you.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.419
I'm confronting you

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.619
because I'm ready
to face your truest feelings.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.619
This has to be resolved. It has to be said.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.219
Can all the years between us

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.699
not compare

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.940
to our heartfelt truth?

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.380
Fine.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.860
Come closer.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.539
None

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.179
of

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.939
your

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.060
business.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.619
I gave you my life,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.179
and that's all I get?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.299
- What year were you born?
- Chengshun, Year Thirteen.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.579
And what year did my parents die?

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.659
Chengshun, Year Twelve.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.419
Back then,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.179
did Your Majesty
reach out from the womb,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.899
grab the late emperor's wrist,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.979
and behead my parents?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.539
Don't be silly.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.700
I wasn't even born yet.
It's none of my business!

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.900
No, that's not right.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.699
Xiao Man, you should say more.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.019
You're so calm it frightens me.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.980
I spent ten years

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.379
thinking about how to face this,

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.579
how to face you.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.900
Of course I'm calm.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.219
Don't you want to kill

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.860
your enemy's child?

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.459
I could do it right now.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.859
When you walked in,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.459
didn't you

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.620
come prepared
for the chance you might be killed?

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.500
And then what?

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.899
Would it wash away the charge of treason

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.780
from my parents' names?

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.859
If I seek vengeance on an outsider,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.220
would it clear
the injustice against the Zhen clan?

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.060
For ten years,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.020
this question has
tormented me every day.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.420
I lived in despair.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.140
I grew up alone until I was nine,

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.940
before I met you.

00:07:57.087 --> 00:07:58.807
And then I was suddenly told...

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.620
Countless nights,

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.859
I wished

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.940
I'd died with my parents back then,

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.980
so I wouldn't have to
face such a cruel dilemma.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.430
Can anyone tell me

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.700
what I ever did wrong?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.740
Besides,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.259
I know how you lived as a child.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.859
I know how you grew up.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.980
I know the sorrow you carry inside.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.020
You and I are the same.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.940
We're both victims.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.860
I, too, am someone's child.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.579
I won't let my parents
die under false charges,

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.300
nor have future generations
speak of the Zhen clan

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.780
as traitors who colluded with the enemy.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.060
And the only person capable

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.060
of clearing their names

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.580
is you, Chu Ying.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.260
Aren't you afraid

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.340
I'll disappoint you?

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.980
I'm not.

00:09:09.212 --> 00:09:10.379
You are the only person

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.220
who can help me with this.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.899
With this imperial token,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.580
you can act freely within the palace.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.660
I'm glad

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.900
you're here with me.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.019
Listen closely.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.179
To me, the name "Xiao Man"

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.459
is the most
beautiful name in this world.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.860
You gave me warmth
when I was most helpless.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.699
You represent

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.059
a friendship I've carried
day and night for ten years.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.180
Xiao Man...

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.300
I've never changed.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.500
As long as you haven't changed,

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.036

Listen to me.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.699
No matter three years,
five years, or however many years,

on the bond between us.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.020
Your little emperor is telling you

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.260
you won that wager.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.940
We both did.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.340
And what did you win?

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.860
Before I walked through that door,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.620
I hoped that you wouldn't hurt me.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.580
I wagered my life on it.

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:30.515

You're no longer angry with me?

As long as our hearts remain as one,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.459

Stand down.

It's a misunderstanding.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.380
It truly is.

you could've

Or had Duanmu Zhi charge in.
