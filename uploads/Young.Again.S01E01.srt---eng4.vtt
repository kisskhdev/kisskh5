00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.840
Honey

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.000
Taste this.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.579
Braised fried egg.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:10.680
Honey.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.199
Do you want...

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.479
me to make you a few side dishes?

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.000
Honey.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.840
The fried egg won't be good cold.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.759
You gotta eat it while it's hot.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.680
I know.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.180
Honey, look at you.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.479
Still unhappy?

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.599
I've explained it all clearly to you.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.520
She's just an ordinary female classmate.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.280
You're so annoying.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.319
It's not about you.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.000
I'm wondering how to tell Dad about that.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.919
You mean the company asking Dad to retire?

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.919
Right. You can't hide something like this.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.520
If you ask me, just tell him.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.340
With this kind of thing, if you hit him with a sudden blow,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.259
you might give him a heart attack.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.340
Bad news like this,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.259
you have to tell him bit by bit.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.580
Retirement.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.620
How can you tell him that bit by bit?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.699
Dad,

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.020
the company officially notifies you to step down a little bit?

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.879
Keep your voice down.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:59.620
Morning.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.659
Dad.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.659
What is "a little bit"?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.900
Um, you're up so early?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.120
Can't help it.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.979
Busy.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.780
A whole pile of company matters are waiting for me to handle.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.659
Go on.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.699
What matter is "a little bit"?

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.300
Well Dad, I'm going to say it.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.919
Please don't have a heart attack.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.879
I wanted to say...

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.580
What is it that involves a heart attack?

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.879
He wanted to say...

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.379
he has a complaint about you.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.319
He's saying you...

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.319
don't pay enough attention to your health.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.340
Although work is busy,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.319
you can't ignore your own health.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.919
Right?

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:35.419
Yes.

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.020
Look at you.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.319
At this age, after all.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.099
Right.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.020
At this age, after all,

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.759
you should retire when you reach the age...

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:43.620
a little bit.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.939
I still don't understand your "a little bit".

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.780
It's just that I...

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.539
I have a complaint about you too.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.379
You have a complaint about me too?

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.340
I...

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.020
Yes.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.580
You really don't pay enough attention to your health.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.860
Fine.

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.860
I accept your complaints.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:02.780
Do you have anything else to say?

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.659
Me?

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.340
I...

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:06.780
Dad.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.819
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.960
You...

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.659
You...

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.779
You still don't pay enough attention to your health.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.060
How can you go on like this?

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.100
Do you two have anything new to say?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.980
I have a whole pile of things arranged for this morning.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.160
I'm very busy.

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:28.540
Leaving now.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:29.860
Bye-bye.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.740
Leaving.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.300
Shall I get you a fried dough stick?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.839
No need.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:33.980
Just an egg.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.620
Take care on the way.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.019
What's wrong?

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:42.100
Why do you keep pulling me?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.779
You didn't let me say a word.

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.100
Look at Dad's state.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.379
We can tell him tonight when we get back.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.500
Let him be happy for one more day.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.899
What's on the schedule today?

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.459
Let me take a look.

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:58.420
Here it is.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.500
Look here.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.899
This morning you are going to

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:02.819
the retirement community at Yangliu Xincheng.

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.079
It's located on Beiqing Road in Changping District.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.980
I'm going to a retirement community?

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.699
Take a look.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.779
You are representing the company leadership

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.420
to visit the seniors in the retirement community

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.319
who for our company

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.620
have made outstanding contributions.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.459
They include

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:21.060
Mr. Jia,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.220
Mr. Zheng, and Mr. Fu.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.660
They are all over eighty years old.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.699
You know them all.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.379
I do know them.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.819
But do they still know me?

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:40.319
Mr. Li,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.220
slow down.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.220
This is our company's

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.920
newly developed real estate project,

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:48.079
the subsidiary retirement community,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.680
Yangliu Xincheng.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.160
Xiao Zhang, don't pant so hard when you speak.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.399
I've been lacking exercise lately.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.399
I can't compare to you.

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:58.759
You young people are less fit than me.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:00.240
Mr. Ma!

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.259
Mr. Ma!

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.939
Mr. Ma!

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.740
Hello.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.439
I really didn't expect this.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:07.160
You came in person.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.240
And so early, too.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.459
You're right to be surprised.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.939
I am not Mr. Ma.

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.600
Mr. Ma entrusted me

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.399
to represent the company to inspect Yangliu Xincheng

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.860
and visit the old comrades here.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.639
This is our company's Executive Vice President,

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.319
Mr. Li Jianguo.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.360
Apologies.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.120
How awkward.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:29.560
Um...

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.480
We always

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.199
heard that Mr. Ma was coming.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:32.600
You didn't expect

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600
that I came today.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.399
Mr. Li, please.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:37.019
This way, please.

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.699
Mr. Li, please.

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:43.160
Come.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.220
Hello, Mr. Ma!

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:46.660
Come, come, come.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.420
Wait, wait, wait.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.699
Everyone,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.079
let me introduce you.

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:50.939
This is

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.160
Li Jianguo,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.720
Mr. Li.

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:54.959
He is representing Mr. Ma

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.839
and our company leadership

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.720
to inspect the work at our Yangliu Xincheng.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.240
Come on, everyone, give a warm welcome. Applause!

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.120
Welcome, Mr. Li.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.800
Mr. Li.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.639
Mr. Li.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.500
President Li

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.800
There's one more place.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.139
The Evergreen Waterside Pavilion.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:19.779
It's our...

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:20.660
Do you still want to see it?

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:22.939
Do I have plans this afternoon?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.980
Do I?

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.680
Let me check.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.860
Yes.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.860
See? There are plans.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.100
Just take a look, President Li.

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:30.980
The seniors formed a Sunset Glow Art Troupe.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.180
Hearing you were coming, President Li,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.500
they prepared a performance just for you.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.459
Yes, indeed.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.660
Is it for me?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.420
It's for President Ma, isn't it?

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:40.579
President Li, you...

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.860
Fine.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.500
Let's watch.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.860
Come, President Li, this way please.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.819
This way, please.

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:52.819
I wish to be a desolate forest

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:56.420
On the banks of the river

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:59.139
Against the gusts of wind

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.139
Fighting bravely

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.220
As long as my love

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:10.779
As long as my love

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.319
Is a little bird

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.720
I can't see clearly.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.519
As long as my love

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:22.959
Is a little bird

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.660
In my dense woods

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.699
Building a nest

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:30.420
And singing

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.580
I wish

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.659
To be a ruin

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.899
On a steep rock

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:40.019
This silent destruction

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.220
Cannot bring me despair

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.539
As long as my love

00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:47.139
Is the green ivy

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:49.820
Along my desolate brow

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:52.659
Intimately climbing

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.179
And rising

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.379
Bravo!

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.179
President Li

00:08:59.179 --> 00:08:59.899
It's you again

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:01.740
Learn from President Ma

00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:03.620
Learn from President Ma

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:05.340
Learn from President Ma

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.919
I am not President Ma

00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:08.279
My surname is Li

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.799
My name is Li Jianguo

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:11.740
At this company,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.100
I handle some leadership duties

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.960
Ms. Liu, what about you?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.200
Sorry

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.620
I... My name is Liu Minzhi

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:18.700
Before I retired,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.179
I was an actress at the Children's Art Theatre

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:22.100
Ms. Liu is incredible

00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:23.259
An artist

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.379
A big star

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.419
She played lead roles her whole life

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:27.379
You see,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.740
she hasn't been retired for long

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.220
She's in her late sixties

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.019
You can't tell, can you?

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:31.980
She's very pretty, right?

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:33.720
I can't tell

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:35.159
I really can't tell

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.240
It seems you know Ms. Liu very well

00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:39.480
Of course

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.799
The two of us,

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.840
we're roommates

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.259
Right

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.279
My surname is Cai

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.399
My name is Cai Xiaoying

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.820
I'm an old-timer here

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.679
Just ask me if there's anything you don't know

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:50.519
There's nothing I don't know about

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:50.840
Um...

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.399
Alright

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.200
Auntie Cai

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.759
I think...

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:56.440
why don't we let Ms. Liu

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.820
show President Li around?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.779
Whatever the old leader

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:00.879
needs to know,

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.159
let Ms. Liu

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.740
give President Li a private introduction

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840
That's a good idea

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:08.679
You don't have plans for the afternoon, right?

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:11.600
No plans, right?

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.080
Let me check

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.220
No

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:15.200
Good, no plans

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.120
Alright then

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.919
Then let Ms. Liu

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:18.759
accompany Ma...

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:19.700
His surname is Li

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.519
accompany President Li for a walk

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:22.679
To get to know the situation

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.519
If she leaves anything out,

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:25.519
I'll add to it

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:27.399
Hurry up

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.179
Get a move on

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:29.220
Come on

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.000
Just now, I heard Xiao Cai mention...

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.720
that Ms. Liu is a famous performing artist.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.200
May I ask what works you've been in?

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.720
I'm hardly famous.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.399
I...

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.240
Don't listen to her nonsense.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.879
Don't listen to her bragging on my behalf.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:45.519
I am...

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.519
Yes, it's true I've acted my whole life.

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.259
However,

00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:49.759
I mostly performed in stage plays.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:50.440
Children's theater.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.840
You definitely haven't seen them.

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:53.519
So you haven't participated in any...

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.039
film or television productions?

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:56.879
Who says she hasn't?

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:59.200
Our Ms. Liu starred in that...

00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.600
called...

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.639
what was that movie called again?

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:01.500
That's enough, Xiao Cai.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.200
Called... called what?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.000
Xiao Cai.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.919
That was from so long ago.

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.399
*Flowers in Bloom*, right?

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.320
Yes!

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.720
I was wondering why you looked...

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:11.279
so familiar.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.639
Like I've seen you somewhere before.

00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:13.919
You're the one...

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.700
Look there...

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.019
The east wind sweeps ten thousand miles, vast and majestic.

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:24.080
The east wind sweeps ten thousand miles, vast and majestic.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.799
Majestic...

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:25.600
Yes.

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.679
Mr. Li.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:27.440
Wait, you...

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.039
You really remember that?

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:29.960
Of course I remember.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.559
I remember it vividly.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.440
In the heart of the red youth,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.860
grow red wings.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.960
I was that red youth!

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.759
No, Mr. Li...

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:47.440
your memory is truly amazing.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.159
At that time, I wasn't even...

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.000
ten years old yet.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.639
And you can still recognize me now?

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:54.080
And remember that film?

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.320
Of course I remember.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.960
I remember it so clearly.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.879
Let me tell you,

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:02.519
I'm a loyal fan of yours.

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:06.039
I wrote you so many fan letters.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.799
Unfortunately,

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:09.000
I never received a single reply.

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:09.879
Really?

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.799
I am truly so sorry.

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:13.399
It's just that...

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.519
back then, the film studio...

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:15.320
took all those letters...

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.940
and forwarded them to our school.

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:17.639
My goodness.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.480
Sack after sack of them.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.279
The thing is, I couldn't possibly reply to them all.

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:23.200
Look at that.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.759
What a coincidence.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.299
So...

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.159
how did Ms. Liu...

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:31.000
end up in our retirement community?

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.480
Didn't your family have any objections?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:35.460
Ma...

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.120
Mr. Li.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.519
You wouldn't know about this.

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:39.080
Our Ms. Liu...

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.200
has never been married.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.519
Where would she get a family?

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:42.159
Right?

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:43.399
So, our Ms. Liu...

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:44.519
is still a...

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:48.440
pure and chaste bachelorette,

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:50.360
a proper maiden.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.860
Enough, Xiao Cai. Stop it.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.279
By the way,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.279
say...

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.639
Mr. CEO here.

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:58.120
You've researched our Ms. Liu inside out.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.600
What's the situation on your end?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.480
Me?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.960
Comrades, come out quickly!

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:08.840
The company's old leader,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.519
Ma...

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840
President Li...

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.360
Your surname is Li, right?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.879
Don't change it again.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.960
has come to visit everyone in person!

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:17.679
Hurry up!

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:20.519
Make tea, serve cigarettes, get the seeds!

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.519
Cut the watermelon!

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:24.559
Is this where Teacher Liu usually lives?

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:25.240
Yes.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:26.720
The environment is quite nice.

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:27.480
Yes.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.879
The key is living with people your own age.

00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:31.360
There are no barriers to communication.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.159
It's joyful.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.480
Does Teacher Liu also like playing Go?

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.720
No, not me.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.399
It's Old Liang from the backyard.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.399
He's teaching his roommate, Rudolf,

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.720
how to play Go.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.639
Rudolf?

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.799
A foreigner?

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:46.320
Yes, this is an international retirement community.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.039
It's not strange to have foreigners here.

00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:50.139
I thought you were just saying that.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.879
There really is a foreigner?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.200
I am the foreigner.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:58.399
My name is Rudolf Kraut.

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:00.240
You can call me Rudy.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.120
Stewed Tofu?

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.720
Or Rudy?

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.639
No.

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:04.679
Not tofu.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.120
It's Dolf.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.519
Rudolf.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.340
And not stewed tofu.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.139
Rudy.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.200
Rudy.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.500
Is the nickname for the tofu.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.580
What tofu?

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.559
You've got me...

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.960
all confused.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.840
I got him all confused.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.559
Leader, don't listen to him.

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:23.779
He's just a foreigner.

00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:25.240
He used to be at the Second Ministry of Machine Building.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.240
He was an expert.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.279
After he retired,

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:30.000
he didn't want to go back to Germany.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.960
He insisted on spending his retirement here.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.919
That's wonderful.

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:34.919
He's been in China for over 30 years!

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:37.159
But he still can't speak Chinese well.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.059
Who said China isn't good?

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.740
Our China is no worse than your Germany!

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.820
Why is it our Germany?

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:47.500
May I ask, old gentleman,

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.940
what is your surname?

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.100
Watch your language!

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.259
Do I look that old?

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:51.820
No, it's not that...

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.139
No.

00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:54.139
I've had white hair since I was young.

00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:55.259
I have hot blood.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.240
He asked for your honorable name.

00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:58.919
Liang Shengtian.

00:14:58.919 --> 00:14:59.600
Mr. Liang.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.879
Male, 64 years old.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.240
Born in Jiangnan,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.320
raised in the North.

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.840
The reason I reside here

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.120
is mainly because of

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:10.799
Bai Jingjing.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.919
You know her, right?

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:15.360
Bai Jingjing, right?

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:16.720
I don't know.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.080
You don't know?

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.000
What's with you?

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:22.440
You don't know Bai Jingjing?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.159
Who doesn't know her?

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.000
Who isn't her fan?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.120
I don't know her.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.360
I'm just a fan of our Ms. Liu.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.000
No.

00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:32.360
Bai Jingjing is...

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.759
debuted in a girl group.

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.200
A viral star.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.679
A superstar with millions of fans.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:37.360
Me?

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.840
I'm just a washed-up actress.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.759
I can't compare with her.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.600
That's not it.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.840
The female star named Bai, right?

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.919
Remember now?

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.320
Still no.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.000
Then this female star named Bai...

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.159
what is her relationship with Mr. Liang?

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:55.919
Of course there's a relationship.

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:58.080
Let me put it this way.

00:15:58.159 --> 00:16:00.360
Bai Jingjing is my...

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.120
Honey.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.440
Is "honey" appropriate?

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.440
How old is she and how old am I?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.320
Then she's a mistress.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.279
For sure.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.019
That's even more inappropriate.

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:10.759
Bai Jingjing...

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.679
So many bosses, tycoons...

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:15.000
businessmen, and young hunks can't even catch her.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.240
Be my mistress?

00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:17.860
Otherwise...

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.039
Stop guessing blindly.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.419
I'll tell you.

00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:23.419
Bai Jingjing...

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.100
is my daughter.

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:26.419
Daughter?

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:27.980
That's not right.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.899
Then why is her surname Bai and not Liang?

00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:33.519
She takes the surname...

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:34.320
Her mom's...

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.980
No...

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.659
She takes her mother's surname.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.980
That's still not right.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.860
She should take her dad's surname.

00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:42.460
Your surname.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.019
Why...

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:47.659
must she take her dad's surname?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.059
Who is this grandma?

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:52.580
What you just said...

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.659
I heard it all.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.259
You sure are hale and hearty.

00:16:57.259 --> 00:16:58.700
Sharp ears and eyes.

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:00.980
Or can't you hear?

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:02.460
That's right.

00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:04.259
People...

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.940
must live and learn.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.200
Don't you agree?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:09.519
Right.

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:10.400
Young man.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.920
Young...

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.660
Who?

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.279
Is she talking about me?

00:17:13.279 --> 00:17:13.960
Yes.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.400
This is the company leader.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.960
Ma...

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.099
President Li.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:20.079
I'm Li Jianguo.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.839
I know.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.559
Little Li.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.480
What are you yelling for?

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.920
I'm a hundred years old.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.880
Can't I call you...

00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:32.599
"Young man"?

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:34.240
You can.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.480
You are a hundred.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.200
Don't listen to her nonsense.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.720
She just turned 96.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.319
Who's talking nonsense?

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:42.559
I heard that.

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:48.579
You...

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.339
You...

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:52.579
You are...

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.160
My name is Li Jianguo.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.539
Sent by the company.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.799
Who is this uncle?

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.079
Who's your uncle?

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:04.519
I'm your own dad!

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.680
Son!

00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:09.680
Son!

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:10.839
Son, I'm right here!

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:14.119
Give me back...

00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:15.259
My son!

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.240
Give me back my son!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.799
Goodbye.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.079
Bye now.

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:24.019
Goodbye.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.519
Ms. Liu.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.759
Well...

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:29.319
It's like this...

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:30.599
Um...

00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:33.200
In the future, regarding the community...

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:34.319
If there are any issues...

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.880
Any situations, any difficulties...

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:39.079
Big matters or small details...

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:40.039
No matter how trivial...

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.279
You can report them directly to me.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.599
If I have...

00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:45.680
If I have any issues...

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.880
I should contact you directly?

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.599
Why wouldn't you?

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.259
We're already friends now.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:50.720
Aren't we?

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.559
Besides, I am your...

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.240
Loyal fan.

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:56.960
If I have something to discuss...

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.359
How do I reach you?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.519
Right.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.460
Up until now, we haven't...

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.940
Exchanged contact information.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.039
Let's see...

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.119
Should I scan you...

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:05.019
Or will you scan me?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240
WeChat... this is...

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.519
Not very appropriate, is it?

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.880
What's inappropriate about it?

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:12.480
I was your fan back in the day.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:13.779
I wrote you so many letters.

00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:14.900
You never replied to any.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.720
Now, as a company executive...

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.880
Sending you a message...

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.519
Could you really ignore it?

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:22.039
Look at you...

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:23.599
No matter how high your rank...

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:24.980
I'm not your subordinate.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.759
Right?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.640
True.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.240
Alright.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.279
Let's scan then.

00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:29.960
But I...

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.599
I'm not very good with this thing...

00:19:31.599 --> 00:19:32.400
Let me try... I don't know how.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.039
Let me do it.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.279
President Li.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.319
Thank you for your hard work, President Li.

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:38.960
You've been gone for so long.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:41.240
The grandpas and grandmas...

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.880
Didn't stop you to complain about me, did they?

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.559
No.

00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:46.759
The seniors are all very lovely.

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:48.559
Happy as brothers and sisters.

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.519
Like big children.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.799
To be honest...

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.440
When I retire one day...

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.279
I'd also like to spend my golden years here.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:55.680
And become one of them.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.519
You're welcome to.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.599
President Li.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.440
I'll ask Mr. Zhao to bring the car around.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.119
Good.

00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:03.400
President Li, I'll let you get back to work.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.519
I'm going to take off my makeup.

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:04.920
Okay.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.839
Goodbye.

00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:21.519
Who says?

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:22.440
You say.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.279
You say.

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:23.920
You say.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.519
You say.

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:25.519
Fine, I'll say.

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:28.200
Actually, you say.

00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:29.319
Why?

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:31.119
Dad spoils his daughter the most.

00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:33.039
Bad news coming from a daughter's mouth

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:34.599
is easier for Dad to accept.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.599
Forgot to turn off the kitchen stove again.

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:42.400
Honestly.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.240
Come back.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.759
What?

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.039
The phone.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.839
Who's sending you WeChats?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.200
This...

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:52.759
Who is it?

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.440
Honey, I've told you a hundred times.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.920
That's just a normal female classmate.

00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:01.680
Female bestie.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.799
What?

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.480
You even have a female bestie?

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.559
You're allowed a male bestie,

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:06.960
but I can't have a female bestie?

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.400
Wu Yuntang.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.980
You...

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.279
Look, The east wind sweeps ten thousand miles, vast and majestic.

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:16.460
The east wind sweeps ten thousand miles, vast and majestic.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.559
Dad, you're in a good mood.

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.680
Joy refreshes the spirit.

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:21.759
Go to the kitchen

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:23.599
and get that bottle of Maotai Old Fu gave me.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.279
What's the happy occasion?

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.480
Nothing much really.

00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:30.720
Why are you standing there not moving?

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.039
Why are you standing there not moving?

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:31.680
Go.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.200
Dad.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.359
If you have nothing to say,

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:34.920
I have something to say.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.599
You...

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:37.099
Didn't you tell me to say it?

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:37.420
I...

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.279
Dad.

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:40.039
The company asked me to formally notify you

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:42.140
to process your retirement procedures.
