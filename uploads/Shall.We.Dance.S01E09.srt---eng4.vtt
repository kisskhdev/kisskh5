=Episode 9=

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.980
I know you're Great Qian's
finest martial champion,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.940
but I want to see you
dancing like a woman.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.820
The more alluring your dance,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.380
the greater my delight.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.500
What's the matter?

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.940
You won't do it?

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.932
(Fuling Palace)

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.499
See how well he dances.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.620
That's all?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.019
Only today have I learned

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.060
that you love me to such an extent.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.219
What...

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.939
What is going on here?

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.699
Who is she?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.820
Her?

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.179
She's my unruly, headstrong

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.540
sworn sister.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.659
Out of all the discreet

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.540
meeting plans we devised,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.019
you had to choose the one
where you storm my estate

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.780
disguised as a bandit.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.500
I don't know what to do with you.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.019
It saves me the trouble
of sneaking around.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.340
Besides,

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.500
I kind of missed that feeling

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.379
when I kidnapped you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.460
back at the border.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.260
Get to the point.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.020
Some time ago, you said the treasury
was mysteriously running dry.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.379
I've tracked down

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.579
where the missing money actually went.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.580
Guess who diverted the funds?

00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:34.060
Prince Consort.

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:35.900
Well now,

00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:37.940
how did you know?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.059
Then do you know

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.379
who your dear husband
passed that money on to?

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.780
Stop playing games

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.100
and tell me.

00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:50.149
Jia Yi.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.380
Jia Yi?

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.939
Report,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.779
my lady,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.220
Sun Gong has returned.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.260
Quick,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.180
kidnap me.

00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:04.217
I want to see where his heart lies.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.260
My dear,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.419
I just wanted to see

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.580
if you really loved me.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.779
Don't be angry.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.900
Why would I be angry?

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.819
As long as you're happy,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.140
how could I ever be upset with you?

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.379
The deep bond you
share with your best friend

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.980
is a good thing.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.740
Only...

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.939
Please do not speak

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.020
of my performance today to anyone.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.100
You barely passed the test.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.539
And your form was utterly graceless.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.379
How are you supposed
to amuse Her Highness?

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.299
Now, I shall properly instruct you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.260
on what constitutes a real dance.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.820
Look at you.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.500
You've lost weight.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.820
You too.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.659
You've grown older,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.339
even sprouting a beard.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.579
Back then, you were
fresh-faced and smooth,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.100
young enough to drip with youth.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.620
Are you saying I'm old now?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.979
Unpleasant to look at?

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.579
No longer to your liking?

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.680
Nonsense.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.760
(Fuling Palace)
I don't care.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.380
I'm not getting up
unless you comfort me.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.860
There, there.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.300
Give me a hug.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.460
Alright.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.419
I've missed you so much.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.300
Me too.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.220
Hug me tighter.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.580
Oh, my dear.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.739
Now that is

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.539
what you call celestial grace.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.420
I've missed you so much.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.340
Me too.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.980
You're so nice to me.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.339
Enough, both of you!

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.619
I can't take this anymore.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.299
I can dance for you every day.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.249
Let's get out of here.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.139
(Fuling Palace)

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.979
You're so perfect.
Let me take a look at you.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.860
Pah!

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.659
Aunt, what brings you here?

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.720
We've been pretending to
be at odds for ten years now.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.619
Alright now. There are no outsiders here.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.740
Drop the act.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.979
It's a relief to see you back safely.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.340
I heard the Zhenzhe tribe's kidnapping
turned out

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.700
to be a perfect test
of Uncle's true feelings.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.220
You must be pleased.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.899
Oh, you.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.579
Getting less and less proper
as you grow up.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.900
Now you're even teasing me?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.339
Your Majesty,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.820
stand up straight.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.500
Your Majesty,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.260
from this day forward,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.420
I shall serve only as your
support from behind the scenes.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.820
I now formally return
all authority to you.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.619
Henceforth, every matter of court

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.020
shall be yours alone to adjudicate.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.100
From now on,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.379
The vast lands of Great Qian

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.940
and the well-being of all its people

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.300
rest upon your shoulders alone.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.180
I swear

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.660
I will never fail the trust
you've placed in me, Aunt.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.820
Now that we're done with official business,
there's one more thing I'd like to ask you.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.620
What is it?

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.620
That dance of yours, how do you do it?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.980
Huh?

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.540
The dance one does
for the person they love. It looks rather fun.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.900
The dance?

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.500
Ah, I see.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.300
Watch and follow me.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.620
Hands up.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.660
Put them together.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.700
Lift it.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.220
To the left.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.980
Now right.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.420
Spin.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.900
Rise.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.020
Spin.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.259
You've been getting

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.820
a little too close
to the Emperor lately.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.620
Is closeness not advantageous?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.939
Don't let personal feelings
cloud your judgment.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.020
Remember why you returned to the palace.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.419
Every act of intimacy between him and myself
is undertaken solely to gain his trust.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.599
There are no personal feelings.
I haven't forgotten why I came back.

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.860
I've been acting on it all along.
Godfather, why would you say that?

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.540
Fair enough.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.980
You're usually so quiet.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.380
What's with all the talking today?

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.459
(The Grand Princess
seems to be testing me.)

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.100
(She might have
caught wind of our plans.)

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.940
(Don't worry.)

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.220
(So what if they know?)

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.740
(This palace is full of people
who have no agency.)

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.060
(They are the same.)

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.259
Are you drafting an edict, Your Majesty?

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.099
Yes.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.019
I'm preparing a decree for
the border troop reorganization.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.259
How can we trouble Your Majesty

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.140
with such a minor administrative task?

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.180
His Majesty bears the weight
of countless affairs.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.179
See such documents through
to completion for His Majesty.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.180
Ease His Majesty's burden.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.780
I will take my leave.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.860
(Xiao Man,)

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.300
(Jia Yi,)

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.540
(and Sun Gong...)

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.420
(What is the relationship
between the three of you?)

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.180
Go.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.220
Burn it.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.860
Yes, Godfather.
