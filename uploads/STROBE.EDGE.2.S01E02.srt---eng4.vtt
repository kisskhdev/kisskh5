00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.460
Stare at him like that, and he'll realize you still like him.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.780
When I realized I had someone else on my mind,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.940
I assumed I should make an effort to forget.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.750
Were your efforts in forgetting her a success?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.300
- Seriously?
- I enrolled here because of you.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.240
The guy my ex liked... I thought of him as my best friend.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.260
But one day, I saw them together.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.330
You could have at least tried to make an excuse.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.320
What was I supposed to say?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.760
"You should speak up when you're not feeling well."

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.280
Ring a bell?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.310
I just assumed I wasn't allowed to call him a friend anymore.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.240
I promise I feel better, really.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.530
Are you Takumi's girlfriend?

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.450
No.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.030
Then...

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.840
Do you have a crush on Ichinose?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.200
What?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.250
You two were lost in each other's eyes.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.410
No, we weren't.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.530
What makes you say that?

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.110
Ninako. You'll be late for your shift.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.320
Ando.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.350
I'll catch up with you at the cafe. You go ahead first.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.460
You should take time off today.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.590
I'll be fine. Just tell the manager I'll be running late, okay?

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.970
I need to tell this girl something.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.300
I promise it's nothing big. I only want to talk.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.640
Okay, see you later.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.860
I don't know what you're scheming,
but mess with her anymore, and I won't forgive you.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.790
Do you have a crush on her?

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.490
So what if I do?

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.360
But she probably likes Ichinose.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.850
That's none of your business.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.490
Right?

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.050
Your Margarita, and Pesto pizzas.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.940
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.540
- Enjoy.
- Time to dig in.

No.

I hope it'll be enough.
[Kou Tanaka]

What?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.020
Nothing. I was just admiring you.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.060
What's up with that?

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.320
I'll share if you're still hungry.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.860
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.860
- So dig in.
- Thanks a million.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.630
Will you go out with me?

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.960
I prefer older men who are tall, rich, and handsome.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.400
You tick off none of those boxes, so no. It's not happening.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.400
Manabu, Kashiwagi, feel free to take your break.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.560
I'll cook up dinner for us again.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.070
What're you in the mood for?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.710
Carbonara.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.060
One carbonara made with love, coming right up!

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.970
This cafe sure is full of one-sided crushes.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.800
Is something wrong?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.600
Did that girl say something to you?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.980
No.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.570
Ren said he fought with an important friend of his.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.790
I couldn't give him any advice,
even though he was feeling so down.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.280
Are you sure about that last part?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.150
That guy's always a downer.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.960
But I've never seen Ren like that before.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.450
What're you doing?

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.980
Heading to school.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.850
We're not best friends anymore.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.030
Stuff happened between us in the past.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.690
If anything, it's way more chaotic now.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.040
We're never going back to the way things were
in middle school.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.230
Still...

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.310
That doesn't mean we're not friends, alright?

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.970
Yesterday, I was just blowing off some steam.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.640
Sorry for the dramatics.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.090
If I'm being honest, you seriously piss me off.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.600
But I'm too prideful to let some girl trouble
ruin our friendship. So be grateful.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.080
That's some weird sense of pride you've got.

Did you come here with Ando? That's an unusual combo.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.420
Yeah. He was waiting for me by the walkway.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.890
Why?

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.350
Beats me.

You don't know?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.420
Nope. That guy's just an idiot.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.670
Huh? He seems different today.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.600
Did you end up making up with your friend?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.990
I wonder.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.020
I bet things ended well between them.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.880
Do you have a part-time shift today?

No.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.360
Wanna go sing our hearts out at karaoke after school?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.200
Heck yes!

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.150
But don't you usually walk home with Daiki?

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.470
Daiki lost a bet, and is on the library committee now.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.830
He has to stay back today to organize some books.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.800
Korenaga, where does this book go?

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.680
This book... goes on the upper shelf. Here, I'll handle it.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.400
Upperclassmen sure are reliable at times like this.

Say, is it true you were classmates with Ninako last year,
and in middle school?

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.000
- That's right. You know Ninako?
- I do.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.830
Isn't she just the cutest?

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.090
I sort of admire her.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.230
Really makes me wonder
why she doesn't have a boyfriend yet.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.950
That's probably because she has a crush on someone.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.140
Would that someone be Ichinose, perhaps?

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.940
Ninako is like an open book, isn't she?

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.650
I wonder why she fell for him in the first place.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.170
All I know is that they began talking last year,

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.670
when Ichinose bought her a keychain
to replace the one he broke.

Then I guess it's you and me, Ren.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.760
Yeah.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.510
Have you all grouped up? Good.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.660
Figure that out amongst yourselves.

Ninako, we shouldn't invite Ren's group, right?
Otherwise he'll catch on...

Yeah, sorry.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.720
Does that work with you, Yutaro?

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.030
Yeah.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.770

See you.

Why not?

Sayuri, where's your group headed first?

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.690
We're starting in North Kamakura.

- You're starting at the Zeniarai Benten Shrine, right?
- Yeah.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.110
- Yummy!
- That looks good, too.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.820
- Right?
- This is really good.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.900
Let's snag a shot with the Yoritomo statue.
[T/N: first shogun of the Kamakura shogunate]

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.190
- Sure.
- Woah, there it is.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.530
- It's bigger than I thought.
- Right?

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.340
Let's all stand here.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.060
Hurry up, Ren.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.800
You stand here.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.440
Ready?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.040
Say cheese!

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.190
How's that?

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.170
- Looks great!
- Right?

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.820
- I like it.
- Yeah.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.870
Yeah, nice shot.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.110
Come on, Ninako. We're leaving you!

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.200
Wait up!

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.450
Just don't get lost, okay?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.110
- I won't.
- Hurry!

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.480
Wait, stand there.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.430
Ready? Say cheese!

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.340
[No service]

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.280
I'm out of reach...

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.210
What should I do?

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.270
Come on!

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.480
Wait up!

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.500
You're too fast!

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.750
You're in the way, ugly!

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.700
Ugly...

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.700
Kinoshita.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.440
There you are.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.220
Ren.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:57.890
You found her?

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.580
Great.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.220
Where are you guys?

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.240
That's close to our next stop. We'll walk on over.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.620
See you in a bit.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.150
I'm glad he found her.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.250
I have to use the restroom. I'll catch up to you two, okay?

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.610
Sure.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.980
Not coming along?

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.190
Thanks for lending me your hoodie.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.500
Sure.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.280
I told Yutaro we'd be waiting for them here.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.900
Really? Thanks.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.930
Our past doesn't bother me anymore.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.930
So don't let it bother you too, okay?

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:08.060
If it doesn't bother you,
why haven't you told your friends we're exes?

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.080
Is it because you can't forgive me?

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.600
Or maybe because the whole thing
is awful to even think about?

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.350
It's because it's not worth mentioning.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:30.610
I regret breaking up with you, Uehara.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:41.170
Saying that now won't change anything, you know?
Especially because I have a boyfriend.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.080
I know.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.850
Then do your best to forget and move on, okay?

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.820
I'll certainly make an effort to act normal.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.710
Are you cold?

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.140
No.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.610
I shouldn't have taken your hoodie.
Let's see if I have anything...

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.990
I'm not cold at all. I promise.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.670
Really?

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.250
Really.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:33.950
Fine. But if you ever feel cold, I'll warm you right back up.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.010
So come at me.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.160
Okay. Sure.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.980
Pause.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.670
I... I was only joking.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.420
I didn't realize you make jokes like that.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.360
You definitely got me.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.630
I know it wasn't funny.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.080
I slipped up, big time.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.200
I'm so embarrassed.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.010
The only reason Ren is able to joke like that...

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.450
The only reason he laughs when our eyes meet...

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.010
is because he's at ease with me.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:07.010
Because he thinks
I don't want to be anything more than friends.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.670
Ren and I are only friends.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.750
We can remain this close
because we're friends, and nothing more.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.780
Even though I'm right at his side...

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.870
I'm the closest...

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:40.530
yet furthest I've been from him.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.340
Ninako!

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.210
I told you not to get lost!

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.850
- Sorry.
- I'm glad he found you.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:56.730
- I didn't even realize I'd gotten lost.
- Really? I'm so glad.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.060
Look, it's Gacchan.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.800
Yo.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.300
See you guys later.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.100
It's getting late. How about we all go sightseeing, together?

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.020
I think... it'd be difficult to hang out as one big group.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.960
Getting chummy with classmates is equally as important.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.440
I mean...

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.450
Sure, why not? Let's all go around together.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:25.490
If you say so.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.890
Come on, let's all take a big group selfie together.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.900
How considerate of you.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.990
Or is that just your composure speaking?

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.250
Do I look composed to you?

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.440
Whatever. You just keep on
being friends with her, Mr. Considerate.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.750
Ready?

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.440
- Can I squeeze in?
- Sure.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.350
- Is that Ren's hoodie?
- Move right a little.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.720
Yeah.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.610
- Or maybe left.
- I see.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:06.590
Which way should I stand?

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.100
Takumi, make a funny face for us.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.700
That's not in my repertoire.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.470
What? I wanna see.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.290
I wonder where your keychain from Ren went.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.480
Me too.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.750
Why not ask him for a new one?

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.690
That's definitely a bit much.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.610
Especially if we're just friends.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.590
And are you okay being "just friends" forever?

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.740
This is awesome.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.480
Aw, how cute!

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.300
I'll get this as a souvenir for Ritsuko.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.000
If it's for a girl, get her something else.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.680
- Why?
- Seriously?

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.400
Just go for it.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:25.410
A person will always appreciate someone
going out of their way for them.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.970
Such wise words, Ren.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.770
Then I'm getting this.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.390
I sure hope she'll appreciate it...

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.820
You're not getting anything yourself?

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.950
No, I don't think now's the time.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.920
Ninako! Sorry I'm late.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.150
Let's go.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.380
Come on.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.630
See you, Director.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.260
What should I do now?

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.940
I don't think I'll be able to hold back these feelings forever.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.610
- I have a crush on Kinoshita.
- What?

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.070
Give this back to Ninako. I bet she'd appreciate it.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.150
- Don't say that.
- When else would I tell you?

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:54.570
I want to be Ren's girlfriend.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.240
[Epilogue]

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.930
Thanks for lending me your hoodie.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.010
Sure.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.870
I told Yutaro we'd be waiting for them here.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.460
Really? Thanks.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.440
It's Enoshima!

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.770
I'd love to go there one day.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.250
Let's go the next time we're here.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.970
I meant we could go as the whole group.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.400
Right.
