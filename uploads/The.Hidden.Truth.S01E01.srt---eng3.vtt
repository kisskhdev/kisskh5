=The Hidden Truth=

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.700
=Episode 1=

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.880
You okay?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.860
It's fine, Master.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.510
The puppy just ran off on its own.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.200
It wasn't stolen.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.070
I've handled it.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.310
The department's clearing cold cases, right?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.650
Is that what it's about?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.500
The Nude Banquet Case 15 years ago.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.320
Time to reopen it?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.710
Why's it got nothing to do with me, Master?

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.760
It's the oldest case we've sat on.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.980
Who wouldn't want to crack it?

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.950
I'm a detective, Master.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.790
I can't...

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.590
I can't spend my days chasing dogs.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.790
Everyone's got a dream, right?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.510
Give me back Jinbao.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.480
(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)
Give me back Jinbao.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.320
Give me back Jinbao.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.260
Jinbao is 5 months old.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280
Everyone, calm down.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480
Give me back Jinbao.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.680
Jinbao is 5 months old.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.710
Give me back Jinbao.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.910
Everyone, calm down, please. Calm down.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.520
Seriously, when are you going
to solve this case?

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.120
My baby ate the poisoned sausage.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.870
It's still lying in the hospital.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.240
Who's going to cover all these expenses?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.750
Please don't worry.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.680
We're working on a solution as we speak.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.600
What exactly have you solved so far?

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.590
All you do is talk.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.430
We need you to catch the culprit.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.360
Otherwise, none of us will feel safe.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.590
Exactly, not safe at all.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.430
Not safe.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.710
We've already
worked out the plan and measures.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.280
We'll catch the offenders soon.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.710
Please don't worry, okay?

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.750
Do the job if you can.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.810
If you can't,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.360
might as well shut the station down.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.960
Yeah, shut it down.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.030
If there's no explanation,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.240
we're not leaving.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.120
That's right. We're not leaving.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.270
- Right.
- Tang Tang's back.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.400
Were you swimming or catching dogs?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.750
You think being a detective is easy?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.030
Even lost dogs are our job now.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.910
What a joke.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.960
If you can't be civil, don't say anything.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.840
Can't you see what's going on out there?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.360
Excuse me, coming through.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.080
Why are you so wet?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.270
Don't mention it.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.080
Please sit down.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.430
Comrades,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.870
I'm sure you've already

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.150
heard about our meeting today.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.310
The main topic

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.280
is clearing old unresolved cases.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.150
Many of these cases,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.710
due to investigative limitations at the time,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.480
ran into serious difficulties.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.960
But cold cases

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.590
shouldn't just sit in our file cabinets.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.710
They should weigh on the minds of us.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.870
The provincial department's launched

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.590
a campaign to crack cold cases.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.150
Our bureau must respond actively

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.440
and carry out the operation.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.800
The first case

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.630
to be tackled

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.190
is the Nude Banquet Case.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.960
Everyone's got the case file, right?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.120
Back then,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.000
the disappearance of businessman Liu Xijun

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.580
led us to uncover a nude banquet.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.510
Most of the victims were minors.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.190
The crime was heinous,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.270
with severe social impact and public outcry.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.680
Several businessmen involved were arrested,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.390
along with welfare home staff

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.720
who colluded with the ring,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.310
luring and trafficking orphans.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.070
There are three obstacles in this case.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.610
First,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.720
according to the confessions

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.680
of the welfare home social worker,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.920
the ringleader, Bai Qiming, is dead.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.160
But the cause of his death is unknown.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.790
Second,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.600
as stated by the arrested businessmen,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.270
they were all kept blindfolded

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.700
when taken to the banquet site.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.110
As a result,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.870
no one can identify

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.950
the exact location of the banquet.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.150
Third,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.590
after Liu Xijun disappeared,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.430
he was presumed dead,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.120
but his body has never been found.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.480
These three issues were never resolved,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.480
and the investigation

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.830
was brought to a standstill.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.790
Master.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.350
Zhao.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.160
You were one of the detectives

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.390
who worked this case back then.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.270
Fifteen years have passed,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.390
but you still need that drive.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.840
Chief,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.040
I may be close to retirement,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.760
but my drive

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.160
is definitely still there.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.350
However,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.310
the Dog Theft Case we're handling now

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.870
is causing a huge stir in the community.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.920
It's urgent.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.760
Sir.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.410
I volunteer to take this case.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.390
I'll sign a pledge.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.520
I guarantee I'll solve it.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.670
Sit down.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.600
The Dog Theft Case isn't closed yet.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.030
Why are you making that pledge?

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.670
Sit down.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.510
Master,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.240
the Chief practically named you just now.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.290
Why didn't you respond?

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.730
Team One gets all the major cases.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.640
You jealous?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.800
I'm not jealous.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.680
I just want the Nude Banquet Case.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.830
You're just upset our team gets small cases.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.870
Don't bite off more than you can handle.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.750
You might trip yourself up chasing that.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.880
Master,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.120
how is that aiming too high?

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.360
I want to work big cases.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.200
I'm a detective.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.190
I can't spend every day catching dogs.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.510
We finally land a major case,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.180
and you won't even fight for it.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.420
What do you expect me to do?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.510
Catching dogs doesn't change who we are.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.800
Look at the people outside.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.920
They're desperate.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.870
Aren't their concerns real too?

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.390
So everything I just said means nothing?

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.240
You're about to retire.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.270
I haven't even started yet.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.510
How are we the same?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.230
Captain Zhao.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.880
Something's happened.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.840
What is it?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:13.700
(Police)

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.660
(Crime Scene Investigation)

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.350
Captain Zhao.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.520
What do we have?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.720
Based on the body,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.390
time of death was about 4 to 5 days ago.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.920
No visible external injuries.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.480
The room is messy,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.160
but that appears to be how she lived.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.720
No signs of a struggle were found.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.830
We found that sausage in the victim's hand.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.790
As for what's in it,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.730
we need to take it back

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.950
for further testing.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.960
She was holding it?

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.230
Yes.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.760
Master,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.640
it's a poisoned sausage.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.070
Same method as the dog thief.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.240
Who found the scene first?

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.200
That old lady Liu Yan

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.080
usually dug through trash bins for bottles.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.540
A smell in her place is normal.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.720
But the neighbors on the same floor

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.130
said the odor was overwhelming.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.180
So they asked management

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.320
to check it out.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.780
I came over and took a whiff.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.150
It really didn't smell right.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:49.720
I knocked but no one answered.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.340
So I used the spare key to open the door.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.840
And then I saw her.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.270
What were Liu Yan's daily habits like?

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.080
Anyone she had contact with?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.870
That I really don't know.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.720
She didn't associate with anyone.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.840
Always alone.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.630
What about her daughter or any family?

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.550
She moved here alone about 5 or 6 years ago.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.200
I heard she did some time before.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.510
Never seen anyone visit her place.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.080
Most of the time,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.270
she was all by herself,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.870
living off collecting bottles, very stingy.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.480
Has she had conflicts with anyone?

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.840
Plenty.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.550
Over a single bottle,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.360
she'd go to any lengths.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.360
Did she do all that alone?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.870
She had a dog.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.000
Filthy thing.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.480
Guess it ran off hungry.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.240
Any other habits she has?

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.840
Let me think.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.030
She went every day

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.790
to Beifang Farmers' Market to buy veggies.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.030
But these past two weeks,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.870
she hardly went at all.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.000
Liu Yan had a routine of buying veggies.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.800
Half a month ago, she suddenly stopped going.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.120
That's suspicious.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.960
When we get to the market,

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.480
we'll do a quick round of interviews,

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.030
see if we get any leads.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.510
Liu Yan's death

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.550
is definitely connected to the dog thief.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.320
The sausages are the same.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.750
Wait for the forensic results.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.510
The poison used will be the same.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.520
What, your eyes are a microscope now?

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.240
One look and you can tell the ingredients?

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.200
Guess we don't need to interview anyone.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.320
Don't doubt it.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.750
We'll see.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.230
Over there.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.710
Sir.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.630
I had two questions.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.530
Have you seen her?

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.320
Her?

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.120
She's a regular at this market.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.000
She hasn't come much lately.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.960
Seems like she suddenly had money

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.910
and started eating at that wonton shop.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.120
Suddenly had money?

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.990
- Thank you.
- Sure, sure.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.050
Let go.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.360
That dog's hers.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.440
We've got proof.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.290
Proof my foot.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.270
You are working together.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.890
Can't pay, so you're stealing the dog?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.240
Let go. Let go.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.480
The girls don't look shady.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.080
It really might be their dog.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.240
This guy's trouble.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.320
I'd say

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.240
he's the thief.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.170
What did you say?

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.080
You with them or what?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.990
Here to stir things up.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.320
Let go or not?

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:39.480
Let go, or I won't be nice.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.510
Stop watching.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.480
We got jobs to do.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.630
The dog's been kept at her nail salon
for a while.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.210
Anyone who's been there's seen it, right?

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.510
- Yeah.
- Cut the chatter.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.240
Let go or I'll get rough!

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.790
Don't lay hands on girls.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.460
You're a grown man, what are you doing?

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.600
What's it to you?

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:54.880
Who do you think you are?

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.720
Not letting go? Fine!

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.560
Stop!

00:11:59.070 --> 00:11:59.970
What's going on here?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.030
And who are you?

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.510
Who are you?

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.440
Officer!

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.520
They cause trouble,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.560
trying to snatch my dog.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.650
Is that so?

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:08.850
- Yes.
- Move along, people.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.330
- I sell dogs here.
- Move along.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.350
Officer,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.790
this man is a dog thief.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.320
He stole her dog,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.530
picked on her for being mute,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.270
and slandered her.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.240
Who's slandering who?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.440
You're the one slandering me!

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.870
All dogs can look alike.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.150
What proof do you have

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.240
that this is your dog?

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.910
You just don't want to pay.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.480
Easy, easy.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.460
Don't be unreasonable.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.590
Look.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.580
The markings.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.630
The white fur on its head.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.870
They match exactly.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.110
Care to explain?

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.910
I... I...

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.040
I really don't know.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.000
Officer, this dog was left with me

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
by someone to sell.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.830
After it sold, we'd split the profits.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.440
I haven't sold it yet, alright?

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.340
I haven't made a dime.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.440
Who gave it to you?

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.080
Listen up.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.960
It's under serious investigation right now.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.630
If you don't want trouble,

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.080
you'd better cooperate.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.320
Of course. I will.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.350
I'll cooperate.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440
It's his dog.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.430
I'm not involved.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.480
I'm just the seller.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.480
This could be the gang we're after.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.270
Call him. Tell him to come over now.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.870
It's sold already?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.550
Yeah, that's him.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.970
Officer, he took the dog.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.840
Stop it.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.480
That hurts.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.320
Why are you running?

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.350
Why are you running?

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.030
She says he's her neighbor.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.390
You know sign language?

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.630
Just a little.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.840
Did you steal the dog?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.840
Yes.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.840
No, I...

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.880
Did you or didn't you?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.870
Yes, I caught it.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.750
That's enough.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:12.670
Come with us.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.840
No, wait, officer.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.510
This dog chased me

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.600
and tried to bite me.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.030
I had no choice but to catch it.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.750
Don't be fooled by its size.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.800
It's very protective.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.840
It won't let go.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.680
I really got bitten.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:23.750
Really bitten.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.240
Alright, that's clear.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:27.940
Give him to the patrol officers.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.990
We should take him.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.510
Could be tied to the Dog Theft Case.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.510
That's not necessary.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.720
No need for that.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.120
Why so much talking?

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.920
You're coming too.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.920
Move.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.040
Easy, go easy.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.200
Officer.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.390
It means thank you.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.080
The nail salon girl asked me

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.080
to pass it on to you.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.390
It's fine. It's the right thing to do.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.510
Are you investigating that Dog Thief Case?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.960
You just got back, right?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.390
You've heard about it too?

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.030
I heard when I called home.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.440
It happened near where I live.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.940
I know that neighborhood well.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.560
Why don't you

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.790
leave your number?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.390
If anything comes up, I'll call you.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.480
Just a way to thank you.

Morning, Mr. Wang.

Morning, boss.

Qiang?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.800
Dad.

Yimo.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.950
I'm back.

Dad.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.510
How long are you staying this time?

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.490
How did you get time off work?

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.040
Dad,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.090
I plan to stay here in our hometown.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.320
Not going back.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.520
Not going back?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.240
What are you doing?

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880
Sounds like

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.510
Yimo is staying this time.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.480
She's staying?

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.540
Really?

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.390
Seems like it.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.760
Don't go.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.960
Something feels off in here.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.550
Tell me the truth.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.240
Did you get laid off?

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.430
No.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.680
I'm doing great at work.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.270
I just want to be closer to you.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.480
I don't want to be that far away anymore.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.400
Isn't it nice for us to stay together?

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.440
Xinjing is such a great place.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.270
You were doing so well there.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.110
Why come back here?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.830
Did you forget what you promised me?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.880
I'd get settled in a big city,

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.970
then you'd transfer the place
and come find me.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.690
So why are you backing out now?

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.800
You keep changing your mind.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.750
Transfer the restaurant

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.310
is not easy at all.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.760
Dad,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.070
tell me the truth.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.830
Who exactly are you

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.430
staying for?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:03.830
Who else could it be for?

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.720
It's for the regulars downstairs.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.880
They've been eating here for decades.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.730
They're like family.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.720
I can't bear to leave.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.680
They're family?

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.830
Then what am I?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.750
You graduated from such a great school.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.920
You have a bright future ahead of you.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.980
You can't stay here forever.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.150
Dad.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.760
Ali.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.590
Come in.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.950
Yimo?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.320
Ms. Tong?

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.270
You're back.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.550
Ms. Tong, look at my dad.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.820
I just got back
and he's telling me to leave.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:42.590
Ali.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.720
Come on.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.070
You're always talking about Yimo,

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.590
saying how much you miss her.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.070
Now she's back,

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.780
why are you pushing her to leave?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.160
You don't understand.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.210
I'm doing this for her own good.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.080
Dad,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.590
I know what's good for me.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.990
Captain Zhao.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.870
Hey, Wen.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.680
Captain Zhao, I was looking for you.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.140
The autopsy report is out.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.450
After examination,

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.130
Liu Yan's time of death was 5 days ago.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.200
(Forensic Autopsy Report)
Cause of death was poisoning.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.790
The toxin in her stomach

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.550
matches what was found in the sausage.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.540
It's confirmed

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.100
the poison was added to the sausage.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.810
The same as the serial dog-theft cases.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.400
And one more thing.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.270
No signs of forced ingestion.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.880
Looks like she ate it willingly.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.160
Willingly?

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.440
Accidental ingestion?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.270
That would make it an accident.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.570
Hold on.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.030
Why was the dosage so high this time?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.830
The dosage was indeed

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.440
four times higher, actually.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.030
Far beyond the lethal dose for an adult.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.480
I only did it once.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.440
I didn't steal any other dogs.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.350
How did you steal it?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.670
Did you poison it?

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:48.630
No, no.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.000
I just used a net

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.390
and snagged it.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.910
I didn't poison anything.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.040
You can test it.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.720
Why did you steal the dog?

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.750
Stop stalling and just talk.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.830
I run the laundry shop next door.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.310
I thought she was pretty

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.200
and wanted to date her.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.510
But her dog...

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.680
Whenever it saw me, it came at me,
trying to bite.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.920
I couldn't take it anymore, so I...

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.680
She wouldn't date you,

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.590
so you stole her dog?

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.000
You went into her shop.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.590
Why would the dog bite you?

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.160
I thought she was pretty before,

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.830
so I touched her once.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.880
Didn't expect the dog to hold such a grudge.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.920
It's so protective of her.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.200
Don't be fooled by its size.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.070
It bit me bad. Took three stitches.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.830
I just wanted to get rid of the dog

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.550
so it wouldn't be in my way.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.540
(Suspect Profile)

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.140
(Interrogation Record)

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.280
What's going on?

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.600
Is he the suspect you're looking for?

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.110
I told you.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.340
No need to bring him back.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:01.590
Next one.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.670
The next one I catch will be the right one.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.770
Master.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.640
No victim details yet?

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.150
Not yet.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.030
I came up with something today.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.400
Let me run it by you.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.420
Look.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.030
All the dog-theft cases

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.400
happened in this area.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.790
None of them involve Liu Yan's neighborhood.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.590
And we found out

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.350
Liu Yan recently had some money.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.790
She even stopped buying veggies.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.720
There's no reason she'd pick up a sausage.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.030
I don't think Liu Yan ate it by accident.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.640
It feels more like

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.480
a poisoning case disguised
as the dog thief's method.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.110
Drop Liu Yan's case.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.950
Stick with the leads
on the serial dog-theft case.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.070
We need to catch the dog thief fast.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.390
That's the priority.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.240
Captain,

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.790
I'm taking on both tasks.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.330
I can handle them both, Master.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.640
I won't let Feng from Team One

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.750
keep rubbing it in my face.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.720
Alright.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.330
You've been working all day.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.320
Get some rest.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.500
I'm not tired, Master.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.910
You might not be tired, but I am.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.750
I'm not young anymore.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.480
Not like you, full of energy.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.920
We'll talk tomorrow.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.840
Okay, Master.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.830
Take care, Master.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.510
You've worked hard, Master.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.720
That stubborn old man.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.550
Lazy and stubborn.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.310
Tang Tang, what are you doing?

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.480
I need a small favor from you.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.960
I've already clocked out.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.440
Just a minute. One minute.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.680
You might not be in a hurry, but I am.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.240
I've been working overtime for two days

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.080
to finish this case file.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.110
Besides,

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.560
my wife is waiting for me at home

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.640
to have noodles with gravy.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.640
Hey, what are you doing?

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.350
Noodles won't lump up that fast.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.200
I'll treat you next time, okay?

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.670
Please.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.140
Please come in, Mr. Qin.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.000
Liu Yan.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.030
That name's pretty common.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.680
Why come to me to check her?

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.720
Her neighbor said she did some time.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.790
I thought if she'd been poisoned,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.480
I'd need to confirm her identity.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.270
I almost got the Nude Banquet Case today.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680
I know.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.350
Didn't you say in the meeting

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.510
you'd make a pledge?

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.830
If my Master hadn't stopped me,

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.960
I would've gotten the case.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.240
The three obstacles the Chief mentioned today

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.070
were really something.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.190
But, Mr. Qin,

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.920
you're experienced

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.330
and you know the background.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.990
Could you tell me more about it?

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.150
Alright.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.590
That case

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.480
really was eerie.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.480
At first, things went incredibly smooth.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.400
The businessmen involved

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.270
were all caught without much effort.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.790
But here's the strange part.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.750
None of them knew

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.480
where the banquet was actually held.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.000
As these businessmen got arrested,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.790
the welfare home staff

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.720
who lured minors into the nude banquet

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.000
were quickly exposed.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.270
And from the confession

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.750
of a welfare home contact we detained,

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.200
the key figure in the case

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.880
was Bai Qiming.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.740
He single-handedly organized

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.890
and ran the entire operation.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.030
After his death,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.830
several key leads were cut off.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.590
Everyone else involved

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.110
had unknown identities

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.350
and vanished without a trace.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.550
The case dragged on without progress.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.070
It really wore your master down.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.270
After the case hit a dead end,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.000
your master lost a lot of spirit.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.960
His hair even started turning gray.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.160
So that's why

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.240
he became disheartened back then.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.960
You think your master

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.790
has always been the way he is now?

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.750
He's a detective

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.990
who's worked his whole life

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.590
and weathered plenty of storms.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.270
He used to be full of ambition too.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.440
He had just as much swagger as you do now.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.390

the social worker who trafficked minors
out of the welfare home

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:11.630
was called Liu Yan.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.590
Hold on.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.950
Here it is.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.480

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.640
Ms. Tong, get some rest.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.750
You too. You've had a long trip.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.030
As her father,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.750
talk to her nicely.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.830
Don't be cranky.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.910
Dad,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.640
still mad at me?

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.640
Planning to never speak to me again?

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.510
Why don't you understand

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.960
I'm doing this for your own good?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.310
You don't understand me, either.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.070
Why didn't you tell me you were coming back?

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.550
Why come back all of a sudden?

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.270
Life in the big city is exhausting.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.920
I've been living out there all by myself.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.270
If I get sick,

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.560
even just a small headache or fever,

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.400
there's no one to look after me.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.640
No one like you,

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.350
making me soup,

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.030
boiling pear tea for me.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.350
There's no place as warm as home.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.110
You think life out there's been easy for me?

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.880
Dad, you have no idea

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.000
how exclusionary my company is.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.200
Just because I'm from a small town,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.480
they all look down on me.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.390
Lately,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.550
I've been having nightmares again.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.680
Dad,

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.640
I never had the courage to tell you before.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.000
But now I'm back.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.640
Are you still going to send me away?

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.830
Since you're back,

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:48.640
stay for a few more days.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.510
We'll figure it out later.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:54.750
I'm here for you.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.790
You'll never have nightmares again.

what are you doing?

Dad,

I've told you before.

can't remember his name.
