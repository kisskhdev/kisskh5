(Adapted from the Qidian novel)

("Losing Money to Be a Tycoon"
by Qingshan Quzui)

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
=Episode 13=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.140
Qian,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.940
the Four Wall Apartments look nice.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.580
(Ma Yang)
However, something feels off.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.270
I realized

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.500
the soft decoration is fine

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.030
but isn't the hard decoration
too emotionless?

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.630
Qian,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.790
should we discuss this

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.830
and upgrade its renovation?

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.180
Qian,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.460
we should talk about it.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.550
Are you in the room?

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.700
Qian,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.670
I miss you.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.270
Why do I feel like

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.580
the room's very empty?

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.510
Sure. I'm going to look for you.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.300
What are you doing, Qian?

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.550
Darn.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.670
Why didn't you reply to my texts?

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.550
Did you?

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.110
I did.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.550
I didn't see it.

00:02:34.657 --> 00:02:35.830
Let's have some fun. Come on.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.670
Ma.

00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:38.350
I just feel like going downstairs.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.550
Take a walk with me.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.460
Walk?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.670
Let's have a talk.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.700
I need to drink water.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.350
Li Shi?

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.550
Mr. Li Jr.?

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.350
You...

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.790
Why are you here?

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.790
What a coincidence.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.180
I heard

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.390
you moved here

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.110
to live with Tengda's employees.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.110
So,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.390
I've also paid ten years' rent

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.390
to move here.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.950
Are you crazy or what?

00:03:11.035 --> 00:03:12.140
This is Tengda's apartment.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.460
Why did you move here?

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:14.550
I'm rich. Why do you care?

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.900
Besides, there's no sign here

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.124
saying I can't rent this place.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.990
Mr. Pei,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.546
are you not going to invite me inside?

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:25.980
I have something to discuss with you.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.524
He didn't even
invite me inside just now,

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:28.480
so how can you go inside?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.670
What are you thinking about?

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.740
Let's go. Come inside.

00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:32.759
He's a guest after all.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.670
Are you allowing strangers
instead of a friend?

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.830
You can come along.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.670
Pei Qian.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.390
Qian!

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.390
Pei...

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.390
Li Shi...

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.950
I'm still outside, Li Shi.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.110
Li Shi!

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:43.740
It's time to drink water again.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.300
Mr. Pei,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.670
I moved to Four Wall Apartments

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.230
just for the sole purpose
of supporting you.

00:03:53.524 --> 00:03:56.350
Ever since you mentioned your intention
to invest in the old area,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.230
I've been observing your moves.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.860
Yes.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.860
At the moment,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.860
a profit might not seem possible

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.670
but I'm still willing
to trust your vision.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.420
Besides, I ask many of my friends

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.860
to rent this place.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.420
First of all,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.860
don't ask your friends
to rent this place.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.110
Why are you doing this?

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.110
I...

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.860
No, Mr. Pei.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.060
I did it,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.470
so you can have some revenue.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.060
Right?

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.940
Besides,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.230
I got this group of friends,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.620
including you, of course.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.990
I hope we can

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.110
purchase the abandoned factories

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.550
around this area

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.670
and create

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.420
an industrial-style art district.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.710
Li Shi.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.110
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.180
didn't you say you studied for an MBA

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.300
since you were young?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.300
Even if you use

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.180
a bit of your economics knowledge,

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.568
you'd know that what I'm doing

00:04:50.568 --> 00:04:51.420
is unreliable.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.180
That's humble.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.260
I'm ashamed.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.030
I'm ashamed.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.350
How ashamed.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.820
In the past,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.670
I made investments

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.990
through reading books.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.990
What's that called?

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.260
That's empty talk.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.420
It's even ridiculous.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.180
However, after I saw

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.550
how you practiced your investments,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.420
I was impressed.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.110
I was completely impressed.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.230
You've opened the door

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.524
to a whole new world for me.

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:16.620
Mr. Pei, it's like this.
I'll still say the same thing.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.613
If you expand the market,

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:18.768
we'll both be winners.

00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:19.820
No one will make a loss.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:20.670
All right?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.790
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.740
well,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.670
I'll go back and consider this.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.180
You should go back and rest.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.230
We'll discuss this tomorrow.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.420
Going back... I'm not tired.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.300
I'm very energetic.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.300
I'm very excited now.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.990
Well, come to my unit.
Let's discuss this.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.110
Come on.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.740
I'm telling you.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.550
Li Shi.

00:05:40.902 --> 00:05:42.300
Did you not hear that Mr. Pei say

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.180
he's tired?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.060
Why are you rushing him?

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.110
Seriously.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.990
No.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.550
I'm chatting with Mr. Pei.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.740
Why are you disturbing us?

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.110
I'm disturbing you two?

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.860
Do you know what our relationship is?

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.990
Why should I care about
your relationship with him?

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.740
Seriously.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.740
Do you know our relationship?

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.613
Why should I care?

00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:03.420
Your relationship isn't as close
as my relationship with him.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.720
Let me...

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.400
You don't even know our relationship
and you're talking to me about relationships?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.300
I'm telling you.
This has nothing to do with you.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.180
Seriously?

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.380
Li Shi. I'm going
to tell you one last time.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380
This is Tengda's building.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.620
Not a property of Fuhui's.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.229
I can just return
your ten years of rent.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.110
You? Return it to me?
Do you have the permission?

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.524
Do you have the right to do it?

00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:20.180
I'm telling you.
Do you think I lack money?

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.300
I didn't do this for you.
I'm doing it for Mr. Pei.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.902
Why do you think I'm doing it for you?

00:06:23.924 --> 00:06:25.990
You are just a Vice CEO in name only.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.110
You have no power.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.110
Don't think of yourself
as someone important.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.260
Someone like you is a typical

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.550
pretender.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.990
Stop pretending.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.300
I'm pretending?

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.990
You're like an idling turtle

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.740
in a jar.

00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:40.860
Are you saying that I'm idle?

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.860
I'm calling you a turtle!

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.670
Idle? You don't
even understand my words.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.550
Seriously, Mr. Pei.
Is this your employee?

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.990
Is this the quality of your employee?

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.524
My employee...

00:06:47.546 --> 00:06:47.990
Wait...

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.740
Okay.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.480
What's wrong?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.302
You have a long face.
I was too embarrassed to say that.

00:06:51.302 --> 00:06:52.891
I have a long face? Are you insulting me?

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.990
You are a turtle.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.060
You have a long face.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.060
I'm tall.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.420
Your legs are short.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.180
I...

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.380
I...

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.620
This is the commemoration mug
between Pei Qian and me.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.420
This is the proof of our friendship!

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:32.080
What friendship do the two of you have?

00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:32.670
Friendship?

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.550
You're doomed.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.060
Let me clear my throat.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.470
Let me take my medicine.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.300
One, two, all right.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.940
Are you done?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.740
Okay. Faster.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.860
Give me a moment.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.300
Okay?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.990
Okay.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.550
Are you crazy?

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.990
Who do you think you are?

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.670
Do you think you can use my mug?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.110
Let me tell you. Someone like you

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.013
can be found everywhere!

00:07:55.035 --> 00:07:57.420
- Being Vice CEO at your company...
- Enough.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.550
Did I interrupt your business?

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.300
Sure.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.060
I'm telling you.
How dare you style your hair?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.180
You even made a wolf tail.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:02.670
Tell me.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.300
Did I interfere with you in any way?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.910
You're still doing a wolf tail?

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.230
All right.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.340
(Willows by the bridge over the stream.
Your home lay west of North Bridge.)

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.780
(It felt unlike the mortal world.
Warm sun, fragrant blooms, birds sing)

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.910
When Tang suggested I do WeMedia,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.900
it has been a month

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.310
since I quit Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.830
I still don't know what I should do
for the first episode.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.350
I'm also lacking resources

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.589
to write web fiction.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.813
I've had this feeling
that other people had done everything

00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:42.740
that I feel like doing.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.900
You should eat first.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.540
Let me tell you.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.230
Lu Xun said, if you
didn't know what to write about,

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:55.968
just start with the people around you.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.710
Did he really say that?

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.380
Just assume he said that.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.590
Regardless, I said it before.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.430
Stop joking around.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.350
I think you are right.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.140
Start with someone around me.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.350
Why don't I start

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.260
from Tengda's Four Wall Apartments?

00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:25.568
Let me see if there are
any highlights I can write about.

00:09:25.568 --> 00:09:26.124
See?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.710
Lu Xun and I are correct.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.900
I'm telling you.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.410
Everything is difficult
in the beginning.

00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:31.260
Just do it.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.500
The more you do it,
the more inspiration you'll get.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.900
Eat first.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.590
I'll go and write a proposal right away.

00:09:38.068 --> 00:09:40.570
You're getting more and more like me
when it comes to taking action.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.780
I'll heat it up for you later.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.590
Sure.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.590
Mr. Pei.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:17.710
Mr. Ma.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.780
Mr. Li Jr.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.310
All three of you are here? Good morning.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.190
Did any of you hear

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.740
someone arguing yesterday?

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.540
How weird.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.710
One of the units upstairs kept arguing

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.500
and arguing

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.590
last night.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.500
I couldn't even sleep well.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.540
Later, I'm going to sleep in the car.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.710
Sleep for a while.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:44.710
That sounds nice.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.780
Do all of you feel itchy?

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.230
No.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.470
This elevator is so slow.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.880
The bus is here.
Get on and catch some sleep.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.279
It was so noisy last night.
I'm sure all of you didn't sleep well.

00:11:05.168 --> 00:11:06.302
Why are you getting on?

00:11:06.346 --> 00:11:07.190
What are you doing?

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.900
Don't you see this?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.070
This bus belongs to Tengda.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:09.500
No.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.470
I'm getting on because
I know this is Tengda's bus.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.780
Hold on. Let me tell you once again.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.260
This is an exclusive bus of Tengda.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.780
It is not for non-Tengda employees.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.140
Let me tell you again.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.590
I'm already
a part of Tengda spiritually.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.710
Besides, I can buy a ticket.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.140
No.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.350
You don't need to buy a ticket.

00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:25.480
Go wherever you should.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.519
You can hail a cab or find a driver.
I don't care.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.900
- You can't take this bus. Go away.
- Why should I get a ride?

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.140
Don't I have a car?

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.900
I'm telling you.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.020
Enough is enough.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.710
I must take this bus.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.470
You can't.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.990
I dare you...

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.500
You can't.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.350
Why do you mean?

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.140
Why?

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.620
Because I...

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.230
Why?

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.310
I must take this bus.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.740
Mr. Pei!

00:11:41.102 --> 00:11:42.020
Can't I take this bus?

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.546
Say something.

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:43.140
This bus...

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.339
Mr. Pei! Stop pushing!

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.140
What do you mean?

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:45.740
Close the door.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.020
Wait!

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.780
- Go. I'm not taking it.
- What are you doing? Mr. Pei!

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.470
Mr. Pei!

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.380
I won't be taking it.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.500
- Go!
- This is too much!

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:50.780
Go!

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.470
Mr. Ma!

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.780
- Are you a decent person?
- Go!

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.710
- I'm telling you!
- Go!

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.710
- Stand right there.
- Go!

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.620
I won't take it, all right?

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.380
Fine. You won't be able to take it.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.020
I'll get a ride.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.140
I'm not taking the bus.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.470
Go get a ride!

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.470
Li!

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.260
I knew it.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.260
I knew you'd still try
to get on the bus.

what are you planning for the future?

I have no plans.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.620
I mean

plans for your career development.

I plan to work at Tengda forever.

You treat me so well

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.020
and Tengda is developing well.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.350
I will never leave Tengda forever.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.430
if it happens.

what will you do?

Tengda is developing well.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.950
It will not be gone.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.020
I was just simply asking.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.260
Ma Yang, rest early.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.660
I'll stop here. I'm leaving.

Congratulations, Mr. Pei.

00:14:07.857 --> 00:14:10.470
You invested in Four Wall Apartments
with Tengda's financial strength.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.830
Wise decision.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.249
If nothing goes wrong,

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.302
you will realize your dream
of being financially free

00:14:15.302 --> 00:14:16.480
during next week's calculation.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.430
Mr. Pei,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.500
you are calmer than I imagined.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.310
Actually, I didn't expect

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.260
to be so calm

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.710
when the day really comes.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.950
However, experience tells me

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.860
that I shouldn't celebrate too early.
Right?

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:36.950
Ms. Xin,

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.660
according to my agreement with Mr. Sima,

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.950
I have the right to quit at any time.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.035
Mr. Pei, are you planning

00:14:44.057 --> 00:14:46.070
to treat Four Wall Apartments
as your last project

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.430
and retire after this?

00:14:48.635 --> 00:14:51.102
The money is already enough
to pay for my housing loan

00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:52.430
and renovation fees.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.310
In the beginning, I only planned

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.540
to leave
after losing all my initial capital.

00:14:56.591 --> 00:14:58.391
After such a long time, I'm also tired.

00:14:59.257 --> 00:15:01.470
If I can let my parents
and Yintang live in a new house,

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.568
that's good enough for me.

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:04.902
There'll always be a time
when we have to part.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.540
This is enough.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:08.620
I don't want to become

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.830
an extremely greedy person.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.070
I think

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.020
Mr. Sima will
respect your decision, Mr. Pei.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.260
However,

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.950
if Tengda is closed down,

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.380
can the employees

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.540
still use Four Wall Apartments?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:27.830
Just...

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.020
Think of it as their final compensation.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.990
Mr. Pei,

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.590
you're making me see you in a new light.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.260
Thank you.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.350
You're welcome.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.740
Hao Qiong.

00:15:49.346 --> 00:15:51.710
Why hasn't DreamForge Capital's money
been approved yet?

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.391
It's losing money? How is that possible?

00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:55.260
DreamForge Capital
has always made a profit.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.413
You're only allocating money
to Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:15:57.413 --> 00:15:58.140
Listen to me.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.780
Increase a little budget for me.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.860
I can't.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.457
I'll make more money over here
compared to Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.380
Do you not believe me? I...

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:05.950
I believe you,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.620
but I can't make a decision.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.260
I'll go and make an application.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.190
Lin Wan, sorry.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.430
I haven't read your proposal.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:15.780
However, I believe

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.140
you will surely
develop a better game in the future.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.780
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.110
I'll go back to work, then.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.190
Come on.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.430
Triple kill.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.500
Keep up.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.310
Bring it here.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.900
Penta Kill.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.900
Bao.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.540
What is it?

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.080
I know you are an introvert
but don't be too much of an introvert.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.540
You need to go out and exercise.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.310
Look at your body now.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.020
Isn't it better than it was back then?

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.500
I'm a tester.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.710
It's work.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.310
Ma Yang.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.310
Mr. Pei.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.020
I still have many dreams to fulfill.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.140
Mr. Pei.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.440
Sibo. Zhongdian Web Fiction
is finally improving thanks to you.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.800
What? It's because of you, Mr. Pei.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.530
Let me find Hao Qiong
to allocate some extra budget.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.190
Let's talk later.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:12.950
Lv.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.580
It's nice to get off work on time.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.230
In the future, just be yourself.

00:17:17.447 --> 00:17:20.020
Of course.
Combining work and relaxation.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.580
Mr. Pei,

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.740
join me?

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.710
Hit the tower.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.910
Keep pushing.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.740
Hit the tower.

00:17:44.102 --> 00:17:45.502
Everyone has worked hard.

00:17:55.613 --> 00:17:58.810
- It's all you when it comes to traveling.
- Please, don't. I don't want to hear it.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.580
You are experienced.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.820
I don't want to travel there.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.613
Where should we go?

00:18:03.613 --> 00:18:04.190
Yes. Say it.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.740
Where?

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.100
We can go to Sanya or Jiuzhaigou.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.190
Sure. I'll pay.

00:18:07.613 --> 00:18:08.440
I'll pay. Will you go?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.950
Thank you. I won't go even if you pay.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.270
Pay for me. I'll go.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.610
Gosh, I can't.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.230
Qian.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.710
Wake up, Qian.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.590
- Who is this?
- There are too many people here.

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.968
Come and take a look
with me! Hurry!

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:37.840
Is it the group of people
who came to cause trouble?

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:39.670
Qian!

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:42.910
Thank you!

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:43.910
Thank you, everyone.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.710
Do you have any more units?
I want to one!

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.670
We do!

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.430
When can we sign the contract?
I want to rent too!

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.409
Please line up.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.950
We are a family of three.
We want to rent!

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.029
I'm willing to pay a high price.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:52.910
No problem! Register later.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.946
I'm renting a unit
for my son and daughter-in-law.

00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:56.190
Sure. Sir, you first.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.260
Don't push.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.430
We have enough.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.780
We have enough. Stop pushing.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.500
Mr. Pei!

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.190
Mr. Pei!

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.990
Mr. Pei!

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.260
Excuse me.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.190
Line up!

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.260
What happened?

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.430
Congratulations, Mr. Pei.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.390
What's going on?

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.950
What happened?

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.950
Why did this happen?

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:12.500
Mr. Pei,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.813
didn't you see what's trending?

00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:16.020
Zhujia Apartments
has a formaldehyde issue.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.324
There are also issues
in a few long-term rental apartments.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.740
You insist

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.020
on only having four walls.

00:20:21.124 --> 00:20:23.502
(Four Wall Apartments, Unique)
I, Liang Qingfan, did not understand.

00:20:23.502 --> 00:20:25.413
(No renovation and formaldehyde)
Now, I finally understand.

00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:26.950
Mr. Pei, your vision is incredible.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.020
You asked

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.230
for no paint,

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.470
no wallpapers,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.950
no flooring,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.500
and only use cement.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.990
This is the highest
environmentally friendly standard.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.740
It's completely
zero-formaldehyde, Mr. Pei.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.820
This is incredible.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.500
Congratulations, Mr. Pei.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.780
Still, there shouldn't be so many people

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.950
trying to rent a house.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.780
Mr. Pei,

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.710
you know nothing.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.710
When it comes to rentals,

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.524
tenants are always at a disadvantage.

00:20:50.546 --> 00:20:52.657
Many property owners
will chase them away as they wish.

00:20:52.657 --> 00:20:55.670
Four Wall Apartments is the only place
that allows for a ten-year long-term rent.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.910
You decided on this.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.470
Yes, Mr. Pei.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.580
You said it. You want everyone
who can't own a house

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.950
to have a stable home.

00:21:02.035 --> 00:21:03.457
Yes. You also get thank-you letters.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.670
Come. Bring them here.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.710
Mr. Pei, look.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.813
This is a thank-you letter

00:21:06.813 --> 00:21:08.902
(Thank-you Letter)
written to you by a wandering tenant

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:11.500
who has been troubled
with formaldehyde poisoning.

00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:13.902
(Ensuring a safe standard)
She wants me to pass it to you.

00:21:13.902 --> 00:21:14.950
(Controlling levels of formaldehyde,
so everyone is safe.)

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:15.540
Mr. Pei.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.950
Everyone is hoping

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.470
for Four Wall Apartments
to expand outside of Jinchuan,

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.230
so tenants from all over the country

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.230
can have a home
where they can stay with ease.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.500
Qian.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.470
Mr. Pei.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.820
Qian.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.630
Take a look, Qian.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.230
Mr. Pei.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.950
(Pure cement! Zero Formaldehyde!
Bringing you into Four Wall Apartments)

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.870
Hello, viewers,

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.470
the apartment

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.470
that you tagged me

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:33.500
will be introduced today.

00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:37.430
(Revival of an unfinished building)
It was an unfinished building.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.400
However, it has been
given a new lease of life recently.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.670
It is located in the old area.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.990
Transport is inconvenient.

00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:43.629
According to insiders,

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.580
its interior

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.710
is absurd.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.740
So, what's so special about it?

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.390
This time,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.430
the poisonous property

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.430
observational team

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.950
will bring you to explore this building.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.190
We are now inside the room.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.470
Doesn't it have

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.820
a unique vibe to it?

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:10.470
Follow me.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.740
It's cement.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.060
This table

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.710
is cement.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.430
The TV cabinet,

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.950
floor,

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.230
and ceiling

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.430
are all made from cement.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.580
Viewers,

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.820
I finally know

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.500
why it is called Four Wall Apartments.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.060
Because it is fully made from cement

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.580
from renovation to the walls.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.950
Right now,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.710
pollution from renovation

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.368
creates formaldehyde,
benzene, toluene,

00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:39.190
and TVOC

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.470
which seriously endangers

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.710
all of your health.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:42.950
Renovation pollution

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:43.820
mostly comes from

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.230
interior construction materials

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.580
and various furniture.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.190
You think

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.630
you are using natural wood flooring

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:50.950
but when it is installed,

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.820
it will use a lot of artificial glue.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.870
Meanwhile, all kinds of plywood

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.580
in the cabinet

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.500
will also produce harmful gases.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.670
After our professional testing,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.710
the formaldehyde reading

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.190
of Four Wall Apartments

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.740
is so much lower
than the national standard.

00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:08.035
With this concept,

00:23:08.057 --> 00:23:09.670
we also did
some undercover investigation

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.670
on a few mainstream

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.580
city apartments in Jinchuan.

00:23:12.613 --> 00:23:13.990
(Test Results)
As you can see,

00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:16.870
many long-term rental apartments
in Jinchuan have various levels

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.470
of formaldehyde safety issues.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.910
Among them, Zhujia Apartments

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.740
under the rental brand of Zhujia Group

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.160
has the most serious problem
of excess formaldehyde levels.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.470
Right now,

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.100
do all of you understand

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:27.910
the effort

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.430
put into Four Wall Apartments?

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.950
Are you also interested

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.780

he passed out immediately.

he stood up immediately.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:25.470
Yes.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.670
People like us

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.950
are always facing harsh criticisms.

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.780
We always have
a group of people around us.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.390
It's difficult to face ourselves.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.710
Living like this is good.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.540
This is the life I'm looking forward to.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.540
Heal your soul and leave
the city's hustle and bustle.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.670
Thanks to Harbin Beer

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.190
for sponsoring this show.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.540
Welcome to...

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.870
- Beautiful Villa.
- Beautiful Villa.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.460
(Beautiful Villa)

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.250
Cut.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.600
It's a wrap.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.710
Everyone, you've worked hard.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.760
You've worked hard.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.710
The variety show is very popular now.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.871
Did you not watch it?

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.740
A variety show

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.990
won't turn Mingyun Villa into this,

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.100
no matter how popular it is.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.150
It's all because

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.340
of the long face who came
to inquire about things from me.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.500
What's his name?

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.390
Mr. Li Jr.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.260
After the variety show went viral,

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.230
he invested in Mingyun Villa

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.470
for some kind of
cultural travel project.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.470
I don't get it.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.230
Anyway, the roads have been fixed

00:32:30.324 --> 00:32:32.020
and it's really bustling here every day.

00:32:35.052 --> 00:32:36.252
Here's a sausage for you.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:37.580
I'm changing shifts,

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.990
so I'll be leaving. Bye.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:58.100
(It's close and beautiful.
Come to Mingyun this weekend.)

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:08.740
Mr. Sima,

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.430
this is all a trap you set for me,

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:12.580
right?

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.950
I knew it.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.500
Those nonsense projects

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.190
would never be successful.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.260
I'm sure you manipulated
all the results in secret.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.740
Mr. Sima,

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.060
did I offend you in any way previously?

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.740
Why are you torturing me like this?

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.670
The Truman Show.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:43.670
I knew it.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.630
Everything is a rich man's toy.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.910
I am Truman.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.670
All the people at Tengda who betrayed me

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.990
and Li Shi

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.630
were all actors you hired,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.670
right?

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.100
I completely understand you.

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:09.580
No one in the world

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.140
can feel another person completely.

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:15.470
I quit.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:21.790
Where are you going?

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.220
Back home.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.020
The plane is still flying.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.220
Help me buy a ticket back home.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.013
(Profits: Private Kitchen,

(Tengda Total Asset)

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.180
Mr. Pei, let me remind you.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.430
After you leave,

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.620
you can't take your car

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.830
and house keys with you.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.100
However, we always
welcome you to come back

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.790
and enjoy your exclusive car.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.350
Who wants that?

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.830
According to your resume,

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.540
(Resume)
you worked at Tengda previously.

00:36:27.657 --> 00:36:29.180
However,
we did not find your information

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.790
through any channels.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.270
While doing background checks,

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.991
they say it's part of
the internal name list

00:36:34.057 --> 00:36:35.620
and they have no liberty to reveal it.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.990
When you do background checks,

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:39.700
did you ask the assistant of Tengda

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.500
called Xin?

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.310
Since I know she's called Xin,

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.430
I'm definitely an outsider.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.540
I was part of the back-end team,

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.746
so she might not know
many things about me.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.390
Your previous work experiences

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:54.750
are all related to games.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.020
Why do you suddenly

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.180
feel like changing industries?

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.140
I think developing games is too boring.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.350
Right now,

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.990
I'm more interested in fashion.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:04.350
However,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.790
we still want

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.500
to find someone
with relevant experience.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.180
Even a small web store
does background checks?

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:27.430
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.750
I want to know

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.580
if you've

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.020
watched any series or movies recently.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.950
I love to watch series.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.020
The most recent series I watched was...

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.750
Recently, I've been
visiting the cinema more often.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.910
When was the last time

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.830
you went to a cinema?

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.580
When was the last time
I went to a cinema?

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.950
What does this mean?

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.540
It means

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.910
I'm not a good fit for your company?

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.470
It means

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.700
my company

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.660
will soon go out of business.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.950
Why are you
making recruitment posts, then?

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.660
When you sent me your resume,

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.020
I had a project
that I planned to start filming.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.830
In the end, the platform
changed to focus on short series.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.870
So, the project fell through.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.870
I also

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.620
need to leave this place.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:17.750
Why don't you

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.060
help me move some things?

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.420
(Qian)

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.057
Qian, where are you?

00:38:33.057 --> 00:38:36.457
I haven't seen you in the company for days.
You're not back at the apartment.

00:38:36.524 --> 00:38:37.280
Ma...

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.950
I have a very important thing
to tell you.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.220
Go ahead.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.430
Can you lend me some money?

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.950
You're a boss and
you're asking me to lend you money?

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:50.950
Is today April Fool's Day or what?

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.350
Did you lose a dare?

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:53.790
Are you playing Truth or Dare

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.750
with Li Shi behind my back?

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.060
No.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.470
It's like this.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:01.870
I've saved up

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:03.613
all my money in funds.

00:39:04.346 --> 00:39:06.270
I can't withdraw the money
at the moment,

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.390
so I'm wondering
if you can lend me some money.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:10.470
I can't guarantee
that I'll pay you back very soon.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.060
There's no rush.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.060
I'll just transfer the money to you.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.650
(Our Housing Loan)

00:39:21.657 --> 00:39:23.620
(This week's bills)
(Withdrawal Verification Code)

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.470
I paid my bills this month.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.950
What about next month?

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.540
(You've paid your bills this month.)
(Unknown Call)

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.620
Hello.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.100
Are you Mr. Pei?

00:40:01.235 --> 00:40:02.790
I'm Wu Bin, from the headhunter company

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:04.180
that has agreed to meet you.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:05.830
Hello.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.470
Do you know

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:08.470
why I asked you to meet me

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:09.990
after I saw your resume

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.350
on the Internet?

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.100
Because

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.270
of my work experience?

00:40:17.057 --> 00:40:18.180
You are only half correct.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.540
It's because

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.060
you used to work in Tengda.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.580
Don't mention that company anymore.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.820
I've been paying attention
to Tengda in recent years.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.580
This company is developing quickly

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.620
and the employees gel really well.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.580
You are the only employee

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.470
who left Tengda over the years.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.990
What does it mean?

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.180
You are a headhunter.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.350
I asked you to meet me

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.620
because I'm looking for a job.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.140
I've sent my resume around.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.270
All your previous jobs

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:57.910
were related to games.

00:40:58.857 --> 00:41:00.191
If you find another job,

00:41:00.235 --> 00:41:02.146
it's easier
to find work at a gaming company.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:05.660
There's a company

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.660
that suits you.

00:41:06.924 --> 00:41:08.220
The position they are hiring now

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.580
suits your profession.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:10.790
Which company?

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.100
Sky Fire.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.540
Sky Fire?

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.020
I know.

00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:19.020
Working in Sky Fire
requires you to leave Jinchuan

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.180
to work in Xinyang.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.350
However, they really need

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:23.390
a talent from Tengda.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:25.500
Besides, they offer high pay.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:27.870
It might not be as good as Tengda,

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.220
but they are still

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.750
one of the best in the industry.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.060
Mr. Pei,

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.470
in my opinion,
