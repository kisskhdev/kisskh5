[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.820
[Episode 8]

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.120
Xiaoman.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.710
Xiaoman, come out. I need to talk to you.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.370
Xiaodan.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.259
Are you home...

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.880
What's up?

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.450
Where are you?

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.350
Over here.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.600
What are you doing up there?

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.220
Hurry up. I need to
discuss something with you.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.220
I'm watering the neighbor's field.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.870
You know I want to go to Beijing

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.840
to enter that hosting competition, right?

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.430
But after that mock exam incident,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.030
my dad completely forbade me from going.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.960
What should I do?

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.430
That's tough.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.190
But, Zhuang Sen once said,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.560
"Never give up on your dreams."

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.560
Right?

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.860
Yeah, that's what I think.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.520
I don't want to give up either.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.400
Convincing your dad

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.120
will be difficult.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.840
But you know,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.470
on the road to success,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.910
there are countless stumbling blocks.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.520
My dad is only the second one.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.710
Your dad is the second one?

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.400
Oh my God.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.860
Then what's the first one?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.079
Money.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.380
I have no money.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.030
What should I do?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.120
I'll work with you?

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.920
But what can I do?

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.430
Money.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.030
What do you think?

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.910
So much money?

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.310
Of course.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.870
Where did you get the money?

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.680
I get subsidies
from the factory every day,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.280
and I do so much work.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.410
Of course I can save this much.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.760
Isn't Mr. Ding keeping your money for you?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.450
Didn't you say you were
going to Beijing long ago?

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.579
Right? You need money wherever you go.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.100
I've saved it up for you
for quite a while.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.250
It wasn't easy for you to save this much.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.630
And you're giving it all to me?

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.680
Just take it.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680
What do I need it for?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.680
I have food, drink,
and a place to stay here.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.680
There's nowhere to spend it anyway.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.360
Besides, I saved this money

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.680
just to invest in your dream.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.640
Why are you so good to me?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.400
Don't just invest in me.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.560
Invest in yourself too.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.960
What do you want to do in the future?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.150
What do I want to do?

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.930
I'm fine with anything.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.390
I have my ways of making money, right?

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.390
No need to invest in me.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.190
It's all for you.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.000
I'll be a full-time earner from now on,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.400
investing in your dream.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.630
Okay. Then from now on,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.920
I'll be with you whatever you do.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.390
Really?

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.190
Really.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.390
Then help me water the field first.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.680
I'll count the money for you first.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.190
Over 300.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.630
Over 300?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.640
When do you want to leave?

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.240
In about a month.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.430
Over a month?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.510
Don't worry. It'll definitely be enough.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.430
By then, the stack will be much thicker.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.190
Really?

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.159
Definitely enough for you to go.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.330
Take your time counting.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.240
I'll take this, then.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.970
Take it. Don't leave any for me.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.900
Take it all.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.750
Director, I have an urgent page from home.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.100
Can I borrow your mobile phone?

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.490
Sure.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.680
Thank you, Director.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.240
Thanks.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.350
He's calling.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.840
Xiaoman.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.600
Sen.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.040
It's Xia Lei.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.490
Lei is there too?

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.600
Xiaoman is at my place.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.200
How are you doing in Beijing?

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.120
Pretty good.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.460
I just finished shooting a scene.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.190
The director was afraid I'd delay things,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.830
so he lent me his mobile phone.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.950
You're on such good terms
with the director now?

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.830
You bet.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.970
Right. Why did you page me?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.830
Right. Well,

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.950
didn't I tell you before?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.480
Xiaodan is going to Beijing for that

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.600
hosting competition.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.510
Do you remember?

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.840
Come on. I'll find a professional for you.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.920
My god, look at you now.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.160
You even know hosts.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.190
Let me tell you something.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.800
Broadcasting and acting
are part of the same family.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.140
Once you get guidance
from a professional,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.950
your level improves immediately.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.480
Then I'm counting on you for this.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.720
Xiaodan and I will get ready at home.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.920
You hurry up and contact your friends.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.510
We'll come to you when we get there.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.170
No problem.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.950
By the way, when will you buy a pager?

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.580
It's easier to keep in touch.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.360
That thing is so expensive.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.420
Why would I need it?

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.950
Buy a second-hand one.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.000
It won't cost much. Don't be so stingy.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.070
I'll go check it out someday.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.950
Extra A!

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.400
The director is calling me.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.000
I can't talk anymore.

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.310
They're calling the actors.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.310
When they go to Beijing,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.360
I'm counting on you, Sen.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.890
It's been 59 seconds.
Stop asking for favors.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.120
Okay, got it.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.870
Over here.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.750
Sir.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.800
Let me see. This one.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.490
Where is the screen?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.910
-Buy one like this.
-Sir.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.670
Let me take a look at this.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.860
This screen is big.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.310
This looks okay.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.790
This one looks good.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560
Bro, you've been looking for ages.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.360
Are you buying a numeric
or a Chinese display pager?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.360
How much is the numeric one?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.000
How much is the Chinese display one?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.200
Numeric is 300. Chinese display is 600.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.360
The Chinese display one
is so much more expensive.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.800
It's not expensive, I'm telling you.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.190
A new one is over a thousand.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.430
Do you know why? Because it's second-hand,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.600
that's why it's cheap.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.540
But let me tell you,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.940
it works perfectly fine.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.310
Six hundred? Isn't that a bit pricey?

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.600
Yeah, six hundred is too much.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.930
You get what you pay for.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.240
Well, let me... let me think about it.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.430
Don't overthink it, bro.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.640
Listen to me,
just buy this Chinese display pager.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.840
Clip it to your waist,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.510
and you'll look real sharp on the street.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.120
Really?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.750
Gotta have
the Chinese display pager, right?

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.510
Right.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.310
Let's get the Chinese display pager.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.250
Go for the big Chinese display pager.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.159
Get a Chinese display pager.

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:00.650
If I don't end up with
a Chinese display pager after all this,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.650
what's the point?

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.510
Six hundred?

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.560
One hundred.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.070
Two, three, four hundred.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.560
Five-ten, five-twenty,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.560
five-thirty, five-forty.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.890
Five-fifty, five-sixty, five-seventy.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.750
Five-eighty.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.800
Exactly right.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:22.430
Bro,

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.950
help me break this 50.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.870
What's wrong?

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.320
It's a bit old.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:28.870
How is this old?

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.680
So what if it's old?
You can still spend it.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.540
Look how new it is.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.539
Stop pretending.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.919
Don't understand me?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.240
This... this is fake.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.260
What's fake?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.169
How can you tell?

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.760
Is... is this really fake?

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.790
Boss.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.750
Xiaoman, you're here.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.480
Well...

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.530
I got paid here a couple of days ago,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.240
and there was
a fake fifty-yuan bill in it.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.550
Impossible.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.290
Impossible.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.200
Look at it.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.730
I don't need to look.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.400
I withdrew the money from the bank.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.600
What,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.670
you think the bank can give me fake money?

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.790
Besides,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.840
it's been days since payday.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.290
You come running to me today saying

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.890
you have a counterfeit bill.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.390
How do I know where that money...

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.670
-...came from?
-Wait. What do you mean?

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.340
What, you think I picked up
this fake money

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.410
to come and exchange it with you?

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.070
Exactly. I run such a big shop.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.200
Would I give you fake money?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.000
No matter how big your business is,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the money is fake. It's right here.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.440
Where this counterfeit bill came from

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.140
isn't something that can be
explained just by talking.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.690
You work here for us.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.750
Between us,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.080
shouldn't there be basic trust?

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.790
I could exchange this 50 yuan for you.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.960
But think about it.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.620
Do you still want to work here?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.120
When we see each other again,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.030
will there be hard feelings between us?

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.000
What hard feelings?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.200
If you replace the money,
I won't have any hard feelings.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.960
That's not how it works.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.390
Look, who hasn't received
counterfeit money these days?

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.840
If everyone keeps thinking,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.050
"Where did I get this fake money?"

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.510
"What should I do with it?"

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.440
Then forget it.
Nothing would ever get done.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.170
Wait, what do you mean?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.630
You're just not going
to replace it, are you?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.920
Fine. I'll take the loss.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.600
-It’s on me.
-Xiaoman.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.390
Have some water.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:11.920
Xiaoman.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.890
Xiaoman.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.320
What are you up to?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.670
Still fussing over that fake money?

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.150
I'm reminding myself.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.200
To stay on guard.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.250
The gas station gave me fake money.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.510
How many gas canisters do I have to change

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.960
to earn 50 yuan?

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.600
That boss is really heartless.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.960
My mom sent this for you.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.350
-What is it?
-It’s ginseng bee magma.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.240
Auntie is the best.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.270
She always thinks of me
when there's something good.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.200
My mom said

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.080
it's rich in

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.360
over 20 vitamins and minerals.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.240
She said hauling gas canisters

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:06.930
is exhausting,

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.310
so drink this every day
to boost your health.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.320
Thank your mom for me when you go home.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.720
This is good stuff.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.080
My mom also said...

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.080
She wants you to take this cardboard,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.630
cut it up, and put it on your cart.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.440
If anyone asks,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.550
"What's this about?"

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.890
you say our family sells it.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.350
That way, we can sell some.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.270
This looks expensive.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.540
You want me to stick it on my tricycle?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.550
You never know.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.620
You go through streets
and alleys every day.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.740
You meet a lot of people.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.520
They'll see it.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.790
"Xiaoman, what is this?"

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.740
"Ginseng Royal Jelly?"

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.070
"What's this about?"

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.390
"It's from Xia Lei's family."

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.080
"Go check out Xia Lei's place."

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.360
See? It's promoted.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.030
I'm fine with it,
as long as you don't mind.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.790
I don't mind.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.210
It'll be conspicuous on your cart, right?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.720
Sure.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.770
Let's see what this is.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.510
Auntie.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.440
Are you cooking?

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.480
Have a seat.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.780
Xia Lei gave me this royal jelly.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.970
I brought it for you. It's really good.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Why are you acting like a stranger,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.930
bringing gifts?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.720
Sit down.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.550
I read the label.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.000
It has ginseng and vitamins.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.360
It has everything in it.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.630
Don't do this again.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.260
Okay.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.030
Guoqiang isn't back yet.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.960
Let's eat first.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.690
I stewed some beef.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.320
How is it?

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.640
Smells great.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.630
Does it?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.960
You stewed such a big pot.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.270
It must have taken all morning.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.980
Exactly. Usually, it's faster than this.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.310
The flame is weak today.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.300
Is it out of gas?

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:32.790
Let me take a look.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.680
It's okay. It's still got plenty of gas.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.620
It's not working well.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.200
Right?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600
Anyway, when I shake it,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.960
it always sounds like water.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.080
Yeah, I see.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.270
It's been used for too long,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.030
so the gas inside isn't burning well.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.670
It needs to be emptied.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.900
Get a new tank and it'll be fine.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.080
Can this be poured out?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.670
Yes. I do this every day.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.240
I'll pour the water out in a bit.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.470
I'll get a new one.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.360
It will be better when I come back.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.960
All right.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.080
Come chase me.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.170
You're dead.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.660
Don't run up there.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.610
You just had to crowd me now.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.080
Hurry! Go away!

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.080
Don't run!

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.270
Hello, Mr. Ding.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.000
Hello.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.630
Call me Big Uncle.
I'm older than your dad.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.000
Picking flowers? Or chili peppers?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.860
Chili peppers.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.200
Mr. Ding, you're back!

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.060
Big Uncle Ding.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080
Right, Big Uncle.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.350
Where did you buy the scallions?

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.390
That smell...

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.320
Go inside.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.200
What's wrong, Mr. Ding?

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.140
What are you doing?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.060
What's the matter?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.080
What on earth are you doing?

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.440
There's leftover gas
in this tank. It's hard to light.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.210
I want to pour it out and get it refilled.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.000
If a cigarette butt falls,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.200
we'll both go flying.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.730
Not a single person will be left standing.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.210
No way.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.240
That gas... none of it is flammable.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080
It smells so strong. Smell it.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.880
You think this won't catch fire?

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.670
Can it?

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:02.670
Then... what should I do?

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.070
How do I empty this thing?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.510
Did you ever play with mud
and pee when you were a kid?

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.370
Well, but I... I didn't do it much.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.030
Go upstairs and get a shovel.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.810
We need to take the soil
soaked with this liquid,

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.070
dig a hole, and bury it.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.440
Okay. Just a shovel, right?

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:17.990
Yeah.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.250
Mr. Ding.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.200
You pee first. I just went to
the bathroom at home.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.480
When you guys played
with mud and pee as kids,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.610
did you use real pee?

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.720
Didn't you use real pee?

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.400
We used real pee too.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.070
Okay.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.200
Xiaobo.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.840
Going to swap the gas tank?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.390
Yeah.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.720
Since my tank has residual liquid,

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.600
take it to the gas station for me

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.130
and have them dispose of it.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.390
Just dump the residue in the river.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.320
I wouldn't dare.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.800
Won't that cause trouble?

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:53.450
You wouldn't dare?

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.790
Did you forget
what you did to me in school?

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.380
Hurry up.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.120
Come on. Help me get this up.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.580
Come on.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.890
We're loading all of these, right?

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.080
Put it there. I don't need your help.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.840
Hurry up. It's really heavy.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.080
Xiaobo,

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.910
this can is lighter than normal cans.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.100
Of course it's light,
because there're no residuals.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.200
It's not about the residue.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.390
I deliver canisters every day.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.480
This is several pounds
lighter than normal.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.700
Weigh it if you don't believe me. It is.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.570
I don't have time for this.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.270
Go do whatever you need to do.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.540
Then when will you be back?
I'll wait for you.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.150
In a hurry?

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.240
They're waiting for it at home.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.500
There's a spare tank inside. Come on.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.650
What's going on today?

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.790
Take it. Just swap it back
before I return this afternoon.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.440
Okay. I'm taking it then.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.030
Go ahead.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.840
Thanks.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.320
Uncle.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.270
He might have got suspicious.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.670
So what if he has?

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.910
It has nothing to do with him.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.790
Move away. Let me see what's happening.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.160
Everyone steals from the public pot.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.890
You'd be a fool not to. Let's go.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:22.440
Xiaoman,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.200
here are your wages for the week.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.630
Okay.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.240
Isn't this an extra hundred?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.840
No, it's not. You know what happened?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.440
I went to the bank a couple of days ago
to withdraw money,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.100
and found a counterfeit bill.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.720
I was thinking,

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.750
that fake 50 you got last time,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.630
maybe I was the one who gave it to you.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.480
Look.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.550
Won't there be a problem?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.150
It's fine.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.670
Even banks have fake bills.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.670
It's okay. No need. 50 is enough.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.240
No, you take it all.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.440
You're young.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.550
You're growing.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.200
Buy yourself something good to eat.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.860
Really, it's fine. 50 is fine.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.840
Just take it.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.730
We all earn hard money.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.200
It's not easy for everyone.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.490
That's why we need
to look out for each other.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.970
Don't you agree?

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:12.680
I'll pocket it then.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.160
Keep it.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:14.880
Take it.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.099
Thanks, Boss.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.050
What's going on today?

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.250
Everyone is so happy.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.930
We're happy.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.030
Alright, I'm off.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:24.920
Take care.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:26.510
Ride safe, Xiaoman.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.030
Okay.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.680
Uncle,

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.520
he won't find out, right?

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.920
It's fine. Let's go.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.160
It's fine.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.170
The gas tank Xiaoman got us is great.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.110
The flame is bright blue.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680
Come on.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.940
Isn't every newly filled tank like that?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.400
You don't go into the kitchen,
what do you know?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.030
It's just better than before.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.510
Yeah. There was...

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.680
There was a lot left inside.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.740
I poured it all out.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.950
Let's eat.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.720
Dig in.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.510
Come on, try this beef.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.710
-It’s tender.
-Okay.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.400
You seem distracted.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.550
Eat up.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.640
Mr. Ding.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.160
Didn't I just go to exchange the tank?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.680
I found that the tanks
at that filling station

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.540
have a problem.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.820
I lifted one while I was there.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.680
Their empty tank

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.140
is much lighter than ours.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.170
I think they tampered with it.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.790
They must have added
something to the tank,

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.480
so it holds less gas.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.620
And when I lifted the tank,

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.790
the boss's wife saw me.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.030
She slipped me 100 yuan

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.680
to keep my mouth shut.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.720
That's how it is now.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.260
Only crooked ways make money.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:38.930
Mr. Ding,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.370
I'm thinking of reporting them
to the Security Department.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.550
Report them, right?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:45.870
If not,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:46.830
it'll be our turn.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.290
Since when do you
put soy sauce in dried tofu?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.060
Is it too salty?

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.830
Yes.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.880
Let's eat.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.240
I'll go after the meal.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.280
Xiaoman,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.830
what's the use?

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.870
This happens at the factory too.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.660
You can't fix everything.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.270
Don't you need this job?

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.390
Just turn a blind eye.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.400
The liquefied gas...

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.440
Xiaoman, what are you doing?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.700
Why aren't you eating?

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.030
If the cylinder valve is loose,

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.400
or the seal isn't tight...

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.350
These chicken legs
my dad braised today are delicious.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.640
Much better than before.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.370
Come try one.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.480
Save one for me.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.210
It diffuses rapidly in the air,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.640
mixes with the air,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.350
and forms an explosive gas.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.270
Xiaoman, is it that dangerous?

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920
It's not that dangerous.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.720
They just film it
like that to scare people.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.160
I do this work every day.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.480
Carrying that tank all over the streets,
nothing happens.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:52.960
Here.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.750
I've had a bite of this one.
Take the one underneath.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.920
It's really big.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.510
Undermining the foundation of socialism.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.480
I'm telling you,
these chicken legs your dad made...

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.340
Not bad, right?

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.070
They're exploding with juice.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.720
For factory production
and residents' lives,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.680
it poses a huge safety hazard.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.070
It has caused multiple casualties

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.270
and property damage.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.030
To ensure safe production...

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.090
Why put cilantro in the braised pork?

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.680
You eat it.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.510
Okay, I'll eat it.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.940
...strictly follow the rules
for using liquefied gas.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.900
Why do you keep watching this?

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.240
I'm just...

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.550
taking a look.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.490
Just taking a look.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.790
I don't like watching
these fires and explosions.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.120
It's so scary
with all that blood and gore.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.880
Stop watching. Turn it off.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.550
Okay.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.480
I'll turn it off.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.310
Xiaoman.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.240
How's that gas station you work at?

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.600
We can't do this anyway.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.750
Honey!

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.680
Open the door.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.360
This...

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.680
Is the pigsty not closed tight again?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.210
The smell

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.110
is way too strong.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.480
Uncle.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.120
Let's stop raising them.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.750
We deal with gas every day.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.590
We rely on these pigs to cover the smell.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.150
Cut the crap. Get to work.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:09.410
Let's go.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.720
How many times have I told you?

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.380
How many times have I told you?

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:15.990
When filling with LPG,

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.750
you need to ventilate the room.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.020
I'm sorry.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.270
Are you trying to kill me?

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.200
Sorry, I forgot.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.110
Hold this end.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.340
The empty tank weight is fine.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.030
Start filling.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.200
Uncle,

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.560
aren't we being a bit too cruel?

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.790
It's almost ten jin over.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.070
I'm worried this can...

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.270
I know what I'm doing.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.780
This thing is sturdy.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.590
Besides, filling 30 jin

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:10.010
will fill it up.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.680
Isn't this much faster money
than refilling for others?

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.310
Yes.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.480
Well,

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.750
you're scared?

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.240
Let me tell you, I brought you in

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.160
only because you're my nephew.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.220
Do you understand?

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:24.510
Uncle, don't be mad.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.510
Aunt, look, my uncle is getting mad.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.640
I know you mean well.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.590
If you take me to make money, I'm in.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.790
It's full.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.190
Bro.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.830
Bro, slow down.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:35.560
Bro.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.270
My problem is nothing.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.310
Why don't you go after
those material suppliers?

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.110
They bring in a truck of oil,
but half of it is water.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.550
They deliver a truck of steel,
but half of it is rust.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.050
East Chemical Plant
is an independent system.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:49.940
It's not under our jurisdiction.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.600
I can only control you. Got it?

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:53.200
Wait.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.920
Help me out.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.920
No, don't.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.110
No, don't. No.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.400
No. I can't help you this time.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.350
I can't help you this time.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.440
I can't help you.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.980
Do you understand?

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.310
I treated you well back then.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.210
What do you mean "back then"?

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.450
What about back then?

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.330
I really hate your type, you know that?

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.270
You drag everyone down
when you're in trouble.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.880
Let me tell you, someone like you

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.160
won't have anyone
to bail you out of the slammer.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.680
Get it?

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.710
What's going on here?

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.330
Moving up in the world?

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.920
From a tricycle to a truck?

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.250
What are you doing here?

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.590
I was passing by on my way home.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.480
Thought I'd check on my ex-boss.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.000
Get lost.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.310
Get lost!

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.030
You're upset?

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.410
Fine. I'm leaving.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.020
By the way,

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.880
let me know if you need help.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.250
Wait.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.130
[Seal]

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.330
[Huafu LPG Filling Station]

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.400
553.60.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.550
I can't believe we scraped
together so much money.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.470
I'm telling you,

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.160
we should bring plenty of food, right?

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.160
-We can eat on the way or wherever we go.
-Yeah.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.000
People say the boxed meals on the train

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.680
are expensive and taste terrible.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680
We won't eat theirs.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.140
Okay, we'll bring our own.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.280
Look.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.480
This single hard seat is 48 yuan.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.480
This covers our round trip.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.520
And accommodation.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.360
About the guesthouse...

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.440
Don't worry about that.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.110
Zhuang Sen said

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.660
he has a place for us to stay.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680
We can just go to him.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.270
No need to be polite with him.

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.160
That's great.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.910
Then take this 50 back. We don't need it.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.240
Just keep it.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.000
Buy whatever looks delicious in Beijing.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.160
We won't need that much.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:41.750
Take it back.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.830
It wasn't easy for you to save this.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.680
Listen to me.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.260
It's better to be safe
than sorry with extra money.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.160
Alright then. I'll bring you
some Beijing specialties.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.510
-Yeah, bring more back.
-Okay.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.990
Okay.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.440
I really envy you guys going to Beijing.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.380
I want to go too.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.830
You have a record.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.690
If you didn't have that incident,

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.830
I could sneak you along this time.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.510
No problem.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.310
But if I dared to take you now,

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.040
your mom would kick me to death.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.210
When do you leave?

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.160
We have the exam this weekend.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.440
Xiaoman and I plan
to take the night train on Friday,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.440
and come back right after the exam.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.840
This saves the most time.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:14.750
Right.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.150
It's a sensible plan.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.410
Where did you go?

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.230
I walked around to have a look.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.390
I haven't taken a train in years.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.440
The heating is really strong. Are you hot?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.140
I'm not hot.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.350
Take it off for a while. You're sweating.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.030
I'm not hot.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.190
Do you want a boxed lunch?

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.010
Didn't we bring instant noodles?

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.270
This boxed meal looks good.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.510
Don't waste money.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.920
We'll add a sausage. It's the same.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:06.680
Fine.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.780
If you want some, just tell me.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.180
I'll go make the noodles.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.680
Dear passengers,

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.340
our train is bound for Beijing.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.310
The Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.640
witness the historical changes of China.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.880
The Summer Palace combines
the delicacy of Jiangnan gardens

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.270
with the grandeur
of northern architecture,

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.510
making it a model of Chinese garden art.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.750
Don't move.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.950
Just like that. Good.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.070
Hot, hot!

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:37.640
It really burned me.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.470
Are you okay?

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.160
I'm fine.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.850
Let it soak for a bit.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.660
But it's not as good as what you cook.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.180
Right?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.450
I'll go buy you some snacks.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.000
Okay.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.560
It's so beautiful outside.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.200
Come on. For this trip to Beijing,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.510
I specifically learned how to take photos.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.710
I'll take beautiful photos of you then.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.100
Figs.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:06.420
Here.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.950
Is it good?

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.730
I don't like carrots.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:13.150
Here.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.200
This food is so salty. Have some water.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:19.960
I don't want plain water.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960
I just had a drink.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.260
You won't drink it?

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.550
Do you want water?

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.940
What are you doing?

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:27.680
Drink water.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.610
I'm not thirsty.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.320
Don't eat so fast next time.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.030
Bro,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.920
let me grab a piece of tissue.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.830
-Go ahead.
-Go ahead.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.390
Thanks.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.880
I don't like it.
Let's just have a bite to tide us over.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.740
I don't like it.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.760
Is my mouth dirty?

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:43.240
Yes.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.040
There's nothing there.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.570
There is. Wipe it.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.920
They are copying us.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.230
Sweetie,

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.490
time to get up.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.250
The sun is already high up.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.340
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:39.000
welcome aboard train K825.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.480
We are arriving at our

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.680
terminal station, Beijing Station.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.160
Buddy, wake up. Ticket check.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.160
What is this?

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.530
Come on, everyone. Wake up.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.680
We're arriving soon. Ticket check.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.940
Beijing! Beijing!

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:58.790
-What?
-We’re in Beijing.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.990
We're in Beijing now.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.110
Look!

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.240
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.720
How can I not worry?

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.200
Look at that little brat Xiaoman.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.960
Where did he take my sweetie to?

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.050
It's so irresponsible.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.200
What's the use of saying this now?

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.720
Right? She's already gone.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.380
Just wait for her to come back.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.100
How can she be back so soon?

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.790
She hasn't even called yet.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.830
I'm worried to death.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.020
-It’s just a matter of time.
-What’s wrong with her?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:31.920
Who is it?

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.550
Hello?

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.460
Sweetie. Sweetie.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.480
You finally called.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.270
I was so worried.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.790
Have you eaten?

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.680
Is it cold in Beijing?

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.960
Say something useful.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.060
Something useful.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.270
Here's your dad.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.180
Dad wants to say something useful.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:46.580
I...

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:47.410
Quick, speak.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.880
Sen, didn't you say you'd find Xiaodan

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.290
that professional host

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.400
to give her some pointers?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.480
Did you forget?

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.400
How could I forget something so important?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.240
Where are they?

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.570
Don't worry. He's here.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.900
But is there enough time
for the competition?

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.810
There's time. He's almost here.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.240
Liu.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.540
Zhuang Sen.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.950
You brought friends.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.160
Hello. Hello.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.400
Hello.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.070
Hello.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.320
Let me introduce him.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.350
Even though Liu is a security guard,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.840
after 5 years of self-study,

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.870
he qualified in broadcasing and hosting.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.980
Broadcasting.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.750
Broadcasting.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:27.750
Show them.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.750
Eight hundred sentries
ran to the north slope.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:35.030
Artillerymen ran
side by side to the north.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.960
The artillerymen feared
bumping the sentries.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.160
The sentries feared bumping
the artillerymen's cannon.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.030
Eight hundred sentries
ran to the north slope.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.920
Artillerymen ran
side by side to the north.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.640
The artillerymen feared
bumping the sentries.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.840
The sentries feared bumping
the artillerymen's cannon.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.270
Wow. That's amazing.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.590
Quick, give this girl some pointers.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.240
Well,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.720
the most important thing
about being a host

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.590
is that you have to be infectious.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.680
Infectious? Xiaodan is good at that.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.270
Whenever Xiaodan speaks,

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.090
it's very infectious.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:07.920
Right. In this regard...

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.920
I haven't finished.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.200
Besides being infectious,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.110
you need the ability to improvise

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.590
and adapt on the spot.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.450
I can do that. I think I can do that.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.270
I've hosted the factory gala.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.510
Right.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.270
Really?

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.680
She has no stage fright at all.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.960
Getting on stage is no problem.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.790
Then there's no problem.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:23.790
No problem at all.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.720
No...

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.210
Number 32, Yan Xiaodan.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.170
Oh my god.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.270
It's my turn. So I...

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.330
It's already done?

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:29.940
No need for tips.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.110
It's fine. No problem.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.000
You nailed the factory gala.
This is a piece of cake.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.920
I'm going then.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.720
-Go.
-Come on! Come on!

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.270
You'll nail it.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:40.110
Good luck.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.790
It'll definitely work.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.640
As for Xiaodan,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.640
didn't we see her hosting back then?

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.760
She was amazing.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.790
Let me ask you something I shouldn't.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.330
Does her family know you brought her out?

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.490
I left a note when we left.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.080
They should know by now.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.920
You just left a note?

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.440
To put it lightly,

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:00.750
it's a kidnapping.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.030
To put it bluntly, you...

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.830
You're holding her hostage, you know?

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.160
What are you talking about?

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.880
What? Why would I abduct her?

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.440
If she even chips a tooth,
that counts as a minor injury.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.600
You brought her out.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.820
You must be involved.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.750
Oh my god.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.240
Don't let this thing with Xiaodan

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.500
get you thrown in jail.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.790
Don't scare me like that.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.590
Why would I get myself thrown in jail?

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.230
Liu is making it sound so serious.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.360
I'm not trying to scare you. It's true.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.790
Really?

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.880
Use your head.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.830
Liu.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.850
You said you'd give

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.270
some professional guidance,

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.840
but you didn't offer anything useful.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.100
You're just cramming at the last minute.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.110
Isn't it just for peace of mind?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.440
Is that so?

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.950
I studied for 5 years,

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.420
and I never even hosted the factory gala.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:53.960
Well, that tongue twist

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.820
is impressive.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:56.750
Right?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.400
Your tongue is really...

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.680
You're out. Xiaodan.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:00.840
How was it?

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.070
How did it go? You passed, right?

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.910
Are you acting right now?

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.640
Trying to surprise me later?

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.630
Is this a plot twist, Xiaodan?

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.570
Something's wrong.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.889
Looks like she didn't make it.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.440
It's okay if you didn't pass.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.710
Just treat it as fun.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.630
We just came out for a stroll.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.070
Not bad.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:21.840
Sorry for the trouble, Liu.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.500
No problem.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.440
I'm going to work. You guys carry on.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.030
I'm off.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:25.969
Xiaoman!

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.690
Why are you running so fast?

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.150
I've been chasing you the whole way.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:51.900
Are you going to the restroom?

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.430
What's wrong?

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.060
You're asking me?

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.760
We agreed before we came.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.470
Tiananmen, the Great Wall,
the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.400
But since we got here,
we haven't been to a single one.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.760
Look.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.240
Isn't this...

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.840
It's not that I won't go.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.670
I'm just worried about you.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:23.820
Worried about what?

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.840
Sen said

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.050
that we're

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.440
not adults yet.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.960
I took you away,

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.670
and we went so far.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.840
Our families must be worried.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.840
If I take you out again,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.110
and something happens,

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.780
like you getting hurt...

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.510
The Gaokao is coming up.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.410
I'm afraid if something happens,

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.570
I won't be able to explain it back home.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.880
Don't you have any regrets?

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.550
Regret what?

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.440
We went through all this trouble
and went nowhere.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.760
What do you mean we didn't make it?

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.220
Didn't we come to Beijing?

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.400
Didn't we participate in the competition?

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.460
It's their loss for not choosing you.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.760
At least you tried to pursue your dream.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.880
Right? We won't regret trying.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.530
Even if it seems like we didn't succeed,

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.230
not trying at all
would be the real regret.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.090
What is there to be unhappy about?

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.150
True.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.400
You coming with me

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.790
is the happiest thing for me.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.980
We can come back later.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.020
Right?

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.920
Anyway, we know the way now.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.520
We know how to take the train.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.320
It'll be more convenient next time.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.960
Let's just treat this as a scouting trip.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.770
We'll come back after the exams.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.290
Okay?

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.610
Don't be mad.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.140
You scared me to death.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.510
We're back.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.440
That was so fast. It feels like a dream.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440
It wasn't that far.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.190
We just sat for a bit and now we're back.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.650
We're back safe and sound.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.590
My parents won't scold me, right?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.040
Think about what to do when you get home.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.710
I won't think about it.
I already went anyway.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:28.290
What's wrong?

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.060
My dad.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.960
Dad.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.840
How did you know I was on this train?

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.710
There are only a few trains

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.310
back from Beijing every day.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.510
So I just waited.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.890
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.400
I made you worry.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.230
It's just...

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.030
if I hadn't gone,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.090
I wouldn't have been able to let it go.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.020
You can let it go now?

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.800
Let me carry it.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.470
Now that you can let it go,

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.380
it's time to settle down.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.910
You know

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.270
it's time to get down to business, right?

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.390
Are you okay?

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.710
Mrs. Ding, have you eaten?

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.890
Xiaoman, you're back.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.880
Nice accent.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:47.210
Why are you saving all these underpants?

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.110
Go check on Mr. Ding.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.310
He needs comforting.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.210
Is he inside?

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.460
I'll go take a look.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.880
Mr. Ding.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.360
I bought you the Beijing Erguotou.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.560
What's going on?

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.590
Mr. Ding.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:03.460
I'm fine.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.470
What are you doing?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.380
Put it in the wine cabinet.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.110
Well, what's wrong?

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.710
Why are you using a hot water bottle?

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:11.630
It's nothing.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.360
What do you mean nothing?

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.360
He has had the runs since last night.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.730
His legs are jelly.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.150
He's so big. I can't handle him.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.370
Oh my god.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.070
You don't look good.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.070
Hurry up.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.920
Let me take you to the hospital.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.760
All right, forget it.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.550
Forget it.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.740
You'll let them make all the money off us.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.400
Besides, I've emptied my bowels.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.800
If they want a stool sample or something,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.710
what am I supposed to give them?
There's nothing left.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.550
Didn't you say being empty is good?

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.610
Saves you from soiling the mattress.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.630
Why are you getting so nasty?

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.550
Well, what kind of nasty stuff did you eat

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.920
to end up with the runs like this?

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.550
Never mind that.
Put it in the liquor cabinet.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:43.710
Hurry. Come to the hospital with me now.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.700
Don't stay at home.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.490
Let's go.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.330
Xiaoman.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:47.710
Make way.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.280
What?

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.110
Make way for me. Quick.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:49.880
Who is it?

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.030
Put... Put your shoes on.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.880
Bring me my slippers.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.880
Shoes, shoes, shoes. Here they are.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.570
How did it go?

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.920
The supplier isn't answering.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.030
Don't worry.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:08.780
Don't panic.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.800
Let's take back
everything we gifted or sold,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.000
and recall it all.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.630
Full refund.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.360
No, but we can't just say

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.480
it's the royal jelly's fault yet.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.920
Honey, let's be sure first.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.550
If it's not the royal jelly,

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.630
we'll keep selling it.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.900
But if it really is the royal jelly,

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.430
aren't we scamming people?

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:30.440
Who is it?

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.590
Third Aunt.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.550
Coming.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.400
Third Aunt,

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.500
what brings you here?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.390
W-W-What's wrong?

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.320
Third Aunt.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.320
Xia Lei's mom.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.920
You need to give me

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.580
a refund for this royal jelly.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:48.190
Well...

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.030
I've heard from so many people,

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.230
drinking this stuff gives you diarrhea.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.080
Third Aunt, it might
not be the royal jelly.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.670
It could be... with some other food...

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.670
Did it clash?

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.070
Or cause a reaction?

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.880
Yes.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.920
Then tell me.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.320
What food does your royal jelly

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.550
clash with or react to?

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.840
Is it persimmons?

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.000
Or tangerines?

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.480
Third Aunt, let's not discuss this now.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.690
We'll refund everything.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.690
-We'll return them by box.
-No.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.820
We'll refund it all.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.670
All my money is tied up in royal jelly.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:18.230
-Well…
-I know.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.440
But payday isn't until next month.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440
I know.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.640
I've got you covered.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.650
Don't worry.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.710
Auntie, don't worry. I'll refund you.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:36.360
Don't look.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.070
Auntie.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.400
200.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.090
I've refunded you everything.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.780
I drank a few bottles.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.920
It's fine. No deduction.
I'll refund the whole box.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.400
You actually wanted to deduct money?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.610
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.570
Let me tell you,

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.000
if my old man gets diarrhea,

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.110
you have to take responsibility.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.440
We will. We'll take full responsibility.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.230
You can go with peace of mind.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.360
I won't see you out, Third Aunt.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.360
She's got quite a temper.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.360
Nice private stash.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.760
You've saved quite a lot.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.190
This...

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.740
...doesn't spoil your joy
of redistributing the wealth, does it?

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.300
Here.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:30.370
Not at all.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.760
That's good.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.630
I just wanted to save
some living expenses for Xia Lei.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:41.760
I just want him to...

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.630
...have some tuition money.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.360
What a mess this is.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.590
I know.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.490
Alright. It's in the past.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:49.960
It's okay.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:51.070
Yeah.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.400
How does that saying go?

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.280
The strong pass is like a wall of iron.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.400
But now we step forward from the start.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.320
Alright. That's the only phrase I learned.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.440
I finally got to use it today.
