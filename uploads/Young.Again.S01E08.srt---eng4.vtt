00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.120
I say, Professor Fan.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.420
Why are you always distancing yourself from the masses?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.500
Why are you always distancing yourself from the masses?

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.219
You're labeling me right from the start.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.819
How am I distancing myself from the masses?

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.039
Look, let me count the ways for you.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.300
You don't join the choir.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.740
You don't sign up for the sports meet.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.500
You don't learn ballroom dancing.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.020
You don't attend the art class.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.659
Anything related to group activities,

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:23.580
you don't participate in.

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.500
Last time everyone at Evergreen Residence caught a cold,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.699
and you were the only one who didn't.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.620
Tell me, aren't you out of touch with the masses?

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:30.900
So catching a cold

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.379
counts as a group activity to you?

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.139
Alright.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.539
Stop reading.

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.539
All you do is read books all day long.

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.539
As if you're so learned.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.860
What do you mean "as if"?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.259
I am learned.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.180
Learned, huh?

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.740
Then let me ask you a question.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.539
Do you dare to answer?

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.259
I wouldn't dare.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.819
Yeah, right.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.819
With those little questions of yours.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.780
Bring it on.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.419
Good.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.860
I'm asking then.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.580
Go ahead.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.740
There are two children.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.620
They go to the same school.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.740
They live in the same alley.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.419
When the two children go to school,

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.180
one goes left out the door,

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.539
and one goes right out the door.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.500
What's going on here?

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.219
That's too simple.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.500
These two students,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.300
their homes,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.539
one lives to the left of the school,

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:12.780
and one lives to the right of the school.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.500
Wrong.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.180
The two children are neighbors.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.139
They're no more than two meters apart.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.740
How is that possible?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.539
You don't know, do you?

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.020
The two kids live across from each other.

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.180
Such a simple little question,

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.300
and you can't even answer it.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.819
And you call yourself learned.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.219
That doesn't count.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.740
That's too misleading.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.060
Ask another one if you've got the guts.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.520
Fine.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.819
Then I'll ask another one.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.219
Old Zhang is reading in his room.

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.060
Suddenly, the power goes out.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.800
Why can Old Zhang keep reading?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.259
This question is too childish.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.759
Because it's daytime.

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.159
Right?

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.699
Wrong.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.099
It's twelve o'clock at night.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.580
After the power goes out,

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.539
you can't see your hand in front of your face.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.340
But Old Zhang can still keep reading.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.219
How is that possible?

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.780
That's impossible.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.740
Absolutely impossible.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.379
Tell me why.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.180
The answer definitely won't hold water.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.979
Old Zhang is blind.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.580
He's reading Braille.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.819
You can't even answer such a simple question.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.620
How did you do your studying?

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.080
University, graduate school...

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.180
All for nothing.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.680
You're worse than me, from the school of life,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.479
a worker-peasant-soldier.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.099
Honestly.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.160
Coming up with two brain teasers isn't a skill.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.220
If you're capable, let's...

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.980
compete in something else.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.939
Compete in something else?

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.459
What other skills do you have?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.459
Besides spouting a few phrases of a foreign language,

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:23.980
correcting a few typos,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.699
and writing a few lousy critiques.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.259
Tell me, what other talents do you have?

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.500
What else can you do?

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.420
I can do magic tricks.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.459
I can make a living person disappear.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.399
I can channel my energy and make you vanish.

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:36.019
Do you believe me?

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:37.379
I don't believe a word you say.

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:40.220
This old man is very wicked.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.300
I'm a big living person.

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.779
You can make me disappear?

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:45.740
Did everyone hear that?

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.779
Professor Fan said,

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.060
he can make me disappear.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.220
What are you shouting for?

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.220
Scared?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.180
Afraid to face the masses?

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.100
Who's scared?

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.160
If you're not scared, channel your energy.

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:54.040
Do it.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.220
Do it!

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.379
Fine, I'll do it.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.420
But before I do, you have to cooperate with me.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.939
Cooperate how?

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:00.220
Come on, um...

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.779
Stand with your legs straight.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.459
Shoulder-width apart.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.980
Come on, squat down.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.819
Thighs and calves at a right angle.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.139
Isn't that just a horse stance?

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.139
Here, hold this book.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:10.660
Hold this book.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.500
Pretend to read.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.660
Why pretend?

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:13.939
I'm actually reading.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.060
This is an English book of mine.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.220
You can't understand it anyway.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.180
Fine.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.459
I'm going to start channeling now.

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:21.139
In the army, I could do this for an hour. Come on.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.779
Hurry up

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.860
Done

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.980
Darn it

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.139
I'm still right here

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.420
Immovable

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.459
Don't be impatient

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:34.220
This power I'm channeling

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.500
Has a bit of a lag

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.899
You'll disappear completely in a minute

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.100
Let's time it now

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:39.939
Hello, Old Zhang

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:40.639
Alright

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.860
One minute on the clock

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:42.980
Start. Come on

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.519
Okay

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:44.779
It's just one minute

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:45.819
Channeling this power

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:46.459
I can hold it

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.939
I'm getting a bit tired

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:47.980
I'm going to replenish my qi

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.740
Go ahead. Okay

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.939
You keep this pose

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:50.439
Fine

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.279
If you move, it won't work

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.819
Got it

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:52.459
Okay, I'm going

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.860
Everyone watch, one minute

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.579
I haven't moved

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:55.819
Haven't moved

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:57.620
How is it?

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.939
Hello comrades. Hello

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:00.540
President Liang

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.540
Boss Li

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.180
What kind of kung fu are you practicing?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.939
He...

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.300
Professor Fan said

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.660
He can make a living person disappear

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:09.579
Said if I stay still for a minute

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:11.019
When he comes back in a bit

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.100
I'll have disappeared

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.500
I don't think this looks like a disappearing act

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.259
What does it look like?

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.019
You look like a living person taking a dump

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.500
Alright, Old Fan

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.540
You dare trick me

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.600
Watch how I...

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.339
I'm going to fix you good

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.300
Old Fan

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:29.379
Old Fan

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.819
How did it go today? Who won?

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.420
Why you, Old Fan

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.079
What's going on?

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:42.500
Boss Li

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:44.620
Why did you scare the girl away?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.439
Who scared...

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.579
I was just about to ask you

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:49.279
Right, I was just about to ask you

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:50.779
Why did you trick me?

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:53.959
Happy April Fools' Day

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.579
What are you cursing me?

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.699
Don't think I can't tell

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.779
Who cursed you?

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.620
I'm wishing you a happy holiday

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.939
Who are you fooling?

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.860
It's still a month until May Day

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.459
Who said May Day?

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:07.779
Today is April 1st, April Fools' Day

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.300
In English, it's called April Fools'

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.339
And in French?

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:11.339
Don't show off to me

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.259
I'm asking you why you tricked me

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.819
April Fools' Day

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.939
Is a holiday for pranks

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.660
You can't even take a joke

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.180
You're a sore loser

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.060
Who's a sore loser?

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:23.339
What April Fools' Day pranks?

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:25.660
Isn't it just everyone tricking each other?

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.660
You just wait

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.339
I'm going to trick you good today

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.819
April Fools' Day

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.220
Just you watch.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.899
I'm gonna prank you so hard today you'll foam at the mouth.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.779
Hello, President Li.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:07:59.259
Xiao Chang.

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:01.660
What are you doing?

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:04.300
I felt a bit hungry.

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:05.379
Having a snack.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:06.819
Then what's this?

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.740
The toothpaste.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.379
Eating cookies while...

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.899
...brushing my teeth.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.860
How can you eat cookies while brushing your teeth?

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:15.819
That's just it.

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:18.180
Aren't these dentures?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.339
Alright.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:21.699
President Li, let me introduce you.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:22.339
Director Xu.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.199
This is Director Xu from the TV station.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:28.939
Hello, Director Xu.

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:29.779
President Li.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.980
No need to be so formal.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.460
Just call me Xiao Xu.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.179
Young and promising.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.120
Thank you.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.100
Here's the thing.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.179
Our station...

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:37.899
...has revamped the Life Channel.

00:08:38.139 --> 00:08:40.019
We came to the retirement community today...

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.299
...to look for inspiration.

00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:43.659
We have a program...

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.000
called "Aging with Purpose."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.500
Good.

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:46.860
So...

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.919
You've heard all about my deeds.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.500
I haven't done nearly enough.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.500
In painting, I can't compare to Fan Zeng.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.299
In calligraphy, I can't compare to Qi Gong.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.139
In dancing, I can't compare to Yang Liping.

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:04.860
In piano, I can't compare to Kong Xiangdong.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.299
I am ashamed.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.379
Listen to that.

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:09.740
Mr. Li's standards for himself...

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.139
...are way too high.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.740
Mr. Li.

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:14.100
Don't be so formal with me.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.419
Just call me President Li.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.559
How is the lighting in this room?

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.059
Do I need to...

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:19.960
...put on some makeup?

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.019
No...

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.480
President Li...

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.740
...you've misunderstood.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.259
We came here this time...

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:27.659
...to look in this community...

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:29.620
...for a highly respected guest.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.320
Yes.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.840
Right?

00:09:31.139 --> 00:09:32.139
We're not recording here.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.220
We want to take him...

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.639
...to our station...

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:38.139
...to record there.

00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:39.299
Is that so?

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:39.820
Then let's...

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.659
So the person we want to invite is your...

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.340
...roommate.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:43.700
Right.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.620
Professor Fan Dacheng.

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:45.659
Yes.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.200
Is that so

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:55.419
It's actually okay

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.700
But about Professor Fan

00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.519
Boss Li

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.460
The TV station's car

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.620
Is waiting outside

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.379
Why don't you tell us

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:04.659
Where Professor Fan went

00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:05.980
Where did he go

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:07.740
How about this

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:09.179
I'll go get him for you

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.620
No, Boss Li

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.419
Don't trouble yourself with this

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:13.980
Let Xiao Fang or Zhu Zhu go

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.940
No

00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:17.419
I have to be the one to get him

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.539
Why

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.620
Because today, my words

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.419
He won't

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:23.860
He won't disbelieve them

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:28.100
Why is that

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:29.580
He

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.179
He said he wants to break up with me

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.399
Maybe he

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.940
Was just speaking out of anger

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:41.019
Professor Fan has already blocked me

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:43.179
If that's the case, let me tell you

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:44.500
This works

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.740
What are you doing again

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:49.379
Why did you make the girl cry again

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:50.019
You

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:52.860
Lao Li, stop talking nonsense, will you

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:53.820
What do you mean nonsense

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:54.980
You tell me

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.899
What did you call me for

00:10:57.139 --> 00:10:57.940
By the way

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.980
I have some very unfortunate news for you

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.179
What is it exactly

00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:03.559
The TV station

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:04.539
Some program or other

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:05.799
Wants to do an episode on

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.059
Aging with Purpose

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.019
Dr. Chang recommended me

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:09.960
But I turned it down

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.419
Dr. Chang is so clueless

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:14.779
He recommended you instead

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.019
Lao Li

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:19.019
It doesn't matter what you say about me

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:20.740
But you can't slander Dr. Chang

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.500
Little Chang

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.539
He's the director of our retirement community

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:25.259
The way he looks at things

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.860
Is so sharp

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.100
Fine, sharp

00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:29.620
I'm telling you

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.299
It's up to you whether you go or not

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:33.059
He's waiting for you inside

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.980
Then I'll just

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:37.139
You're tricking me again

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:38.740
I almost fell for your trap

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.820
What trap

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.659
I'm telling you

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:42.659
Believe it or not

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:44.500
They really are waiting for you inside

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.539
I won't go even if you talk the sky down

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.320
Not going

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:49.379
Don't you regret it

00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:50.860
I won't regret it

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.159
I

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.019
The TV people really came

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:56.539
Look, would I fake that

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.980
They're waiting inside

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.100
Alright then, you go back first

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.500
I'll tidy up and go

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.100
Okay

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.259
Stop fishing

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.620
Hurry up

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:11.220
I'm not going back

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.379
Want to see me make a fool of myself

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:13.179
No way

00:12:21.179 --> 00:12:22.500
Why isn't he back yet

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.220
Boss Li

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.700
Did you explain clearly to Professor Fan

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.700
I explained it clearly

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:28.419
Absolutely clearly

00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:30.100
Your exact words, word for word

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.539
Professor Fan said

00:12:31.539 --> 00:12:32.860
He'll catch one more big fish

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.700
And come back immediately

00:12:34.299 --> 00:12:35.539
Should I go check again

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:36.600
No

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.220
No need

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.460
If Professor Fan Dacheng

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.580
really doesn't want to be interviewed,

00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:46.860
then let's leave it for another time.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:47.740
That would be

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:50.340
too embarrassing.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.340
It's fine.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.379
Let me tell you, Director Xu,

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:53.379
this Professor Fan,

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.700
he's definitely not unwilling to be interviewed.

00:12:56.779 --> 00:12:58.299
And he didn't mean to be late.

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.860
He must have some unspoken difficulty,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.899
or he's locking horns with someone.

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:03.899
Just wait a little longer.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.259
All right.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.940
Maybe we shouldn't wait.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.899
Could you recommend someone else?

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.100
Recommend someone else... well,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.700
on such short notice,

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:19.259
it's really hard to find someone.

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:20.940
What's so hard about that?

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:22.340
Far on the horizon,

00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:23.940
yet right before your eyes.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.500
President Li

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:30.019
You mean...

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.419
Professor Zhu from Longevity Residence next door?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.860
Thanks for reminding me.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.220
What did I remind you of?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.100
Professor Zhu is reliable.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.860
Professor Zhu.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.340
Go do a pre-interview.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.200
Let's go, follow me.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.659
Okay.

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:46.860
Wait, what do you mean?

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.620
Did I just shoot myself in the...

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:51.179
Teacher Liu, April Fools!

00:13:51.179 --> 00:13:51.620
Hello.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.500
I wasn't talking about you.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:56.299
Why are you so happy?

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.659
Well, I trade stocks.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.059
And I made a small profit.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.419
I'd like to treat you to a simple lunch today.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.460
Oh, I couldn't possibly impose.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.299
It's fine.

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:08.379
Where are we eating?

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.860
Let's use the private room in our canteen.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.899
At 12:00 noon.

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:13.100
Be there or be square.

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:14.379
Just the two of us, right?

00:14:14.659 --> 00:14:15.899
And Professor Fan.

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:18.039
Him too?

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.820
Of course he has to be there.

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:22.980
The reason I made money on stocks this time...

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.299
...is because of Professor Fan's expert advice.

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.299
Wouldn't it be inappropriate not to invite him?

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:28.659
That wouldn't be right.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:29.740
Right, not right.

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:32.100
I called him, but he didn't pick up.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:32.980
Is he around?

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.480
No.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.659
When I see him later...

00:14:35.659 --> 00:14:36.659
...I'll just tell him.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.500
You tell him?

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:39.820
This matter...

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.720
...won't it make me look...

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.379
...completely insincere?

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:43.779
I have to go personally.

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:45.539
This thing...

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.419
...must be told by me.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.820
Why?

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.500
Because...

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:52.379
...because right now...

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:54.980
...the person he trusts the most...

00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:56.299
...is me.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.399
Huh?

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:00.820
Why is that?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.419
How could they just break up like that?

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:05.340
Doesn't the saying go...

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.100
"Better to destroy ten temples..."

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.620
"...than to ruin one marriage"?

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:10.860
They weren't married.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.940
I know.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.600
But you can't just split up like that.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.940
Who is her boyfriend?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.299
Not me.

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:20.860
He's not from our department.

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:22.059
His name is Wu Di.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.139
He graduated from our school's Journalism College.

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:24.860
Him?

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:27.259
It doesn't matter which college he's from.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.100
If his values are twisted...

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.899
...how can he produce good news?

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.480
Which unit does he work for?

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.860
I'll go have a word with his boss.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.740
Auntie Cai.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.019
Please don't.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.460
What is it?

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.659
You still care about that Chen Shimei?

00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:43.179
Listen, Xiao Cai.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.700
Don't be impulsive, okay?

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.700
You can't just...

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.379
...ruin the kid's future over this.

00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:49.860
Old Fan.

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:52.259
I finally found you.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.539
I have some unfortunate news for you.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.940
Why did you make the poor girl cry again?

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.340
Shoo.

00:15:59.059 --> 00:15:59.700
What is it?

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.340
Spit it out.

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:02.340
Teacher Liu asked me to tell you...

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.860
...that today at noon...

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.820
...she's treating you to lunch.

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:06.980
How can that be unfortunate news?

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:09.100
That's wonderful news!

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:10.659
She's just inviting me, right?

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:11.159
Of course...

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:12.179
...and me.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.659
That is indeed unfortunate news.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.019
I'm telling you now.

00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:16.220
12:00 sharp.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.700
Second floor private room.

00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:18.980
Be there or be square.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.779
Be there or...

00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:23.659
Not bad, Little Li

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:26.299
You've learned to use my weakness to trick me

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:27.279
That's progress

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.340
That's progress

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.100
No

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:30.899
Who's tricking you?

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:32.460
If you don't believe me, let's go ask Teacher Liu

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.340
Fine, let's ask

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.539
Who are you trying to fool?

00:16:35.539 --> 00:16:36.580
Once I ask her

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.860
and she says no such thing happened

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.159
you'll just stand there laughing at me

00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:39.779
Right?

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:40.700
You...

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:42.779
Anyway, I've told you

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.860
It's up to you whether you go

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.259
Good thing I was extra careful

00:16:48.259 --> 00:16:50.580
Or I would've been fooled by you, you old rascal

00:16:57.299 --> 00:16:58.100
Auntie

00:16:58.259 --> 00:16:59.539
Please listen to my explanation

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:00.179
Explain what?

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:01.740
What is there to explain?

00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:04.660
I was the one who broke up with Xiao Xin

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.980
But it's not because I had a change of heart

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.920
or that I don't love her anymore

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.539
Ideals are full

00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:09.779
but reality is harsh

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.319
That Xiao Xin

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.819
although she isn't a material girl

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.220
she's very clingy

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.299
After graduation

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:16.440
all she thinks about is

00:17:16.759 --> 00:17:17.859
getting married and starting a family

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.059
supporting a husband and raising children

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.900
But look at my situation

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.259
I kept thinking when her birthday comes

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.539
I'd give her a new phone

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.099
But I've been working for six months

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.940
and haven't even saved a thousand yuan

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:31.259
I'm not afraid you'll laugh at me for saying this

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.299
look at this boxed lunch I'm eating

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.140
I couldn't even bear to add a soy egg

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:37.380
Child, you...

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.599
have it pretty hard too

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:40.859
How about this

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:43.140
Auntie Cai will add a chicken leg for you

00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:46.059
Tell me

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.740
how could I bear to let her squeeze into a rental with me?

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:50.380
If she leaves me

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:52.220
she could find anyone she wants

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.220
I really don't want to drag her down anymore

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.940
Don't say anymore, don't say anymore

00:17:57.099 --> 00:17:58.019
Your Auntie Cai

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.740
cries easily

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:01.980
You're going to make me cry

00:18:03.339 --> 00:18:05.140
I'll go buy you a chicken leg first

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.339
You definitely told him

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.500
I did

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.980
Noon today, right here

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.619
I absolutely told him

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.980
I guarantee it on my character

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.299
Teacher Liu, don't you trust me?

00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:45.440
Then why isn't he here yet?

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.740
That I don't know

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.339
Should I go invite him again?

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.460
No need for that

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.940
Let's eat first

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:55.359
Okay

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:01.940
Come on

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.019
President Li, listen to me

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:03.799
Teacher Liu is here too

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:04.460
Come

00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:06.740
Play a couple of rounds with us

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.819
We'll follow

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.579
the rules set by the General Administration of Sport

00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:11.140
No gambling

00:19:11.299 --> 00:19:12.339
No, I don't know how

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:14.099
I don't know how to play, President Li

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.019
East, West, South, North, Red, Green, White

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:17.619
Watch four rounds and you'll get it

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.500
Just sit and watch a couple of rounds first

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.599
I'll teach you, I'll teach you

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:21.380
Come on

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.619
Give it a try

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:25.920
About our...

00:19:26.059 --> 00:19:27.980
when will the physical exam results be out?

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.019
Should be soon

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:30.180
I heard Royal Physician Sun say

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.240
it seems they'll be ready this afternoon

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:36.859
President Li

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.660
I finally found you

00:19:38.819 --> 00:19:40.779
Old Sun, what do you need me for?

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:42.900
You...

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:44.759
look at this X-ray

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.700
Here in the lungs

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.299
there's a noticeable shadow

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.299
Shadow

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.420
Isn't that cancer?

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.019
Someone pour me a glass of water.

00:19:58.019 --> 00:19:58.599
Hurry.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.299
Royal Physician Sun.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.140
Tell me the truth.

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:05.819
How many days do I have left?

00:20:06.819 --> 00:20:07.619
Boss Li.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.700
This film isn't yours.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.980
It's Professor Fan Dacheng's.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.259
It's not me?

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:15.880
That's great!

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:19.319
No, it's not mine.

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.720
Then why did you show it to me?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.059
I...

00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:22.200
You'll scare someone to death.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.400
I came to ask you...

00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:26.119
...where Professor Fan Dacheng is right now.

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:27.640
Aren't you roommates?

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.240
With this condition, he must be re-examined immediately.

00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:33.279
You guys keep playing.

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:34.720
I need to go find Professor Fan right away.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.079
Teacher Liu, play a couple of rounds for me.

00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:37.240
I don't know how.

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:38.640
I don't know how.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:41.799
I mean, we should probably go over there too.

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:42.440
Right.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.799
Let's go check on him.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.119
Let's stop playing for now.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.200
This...

00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:46.940
This...

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.279
So the game's over?

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:51.319
Fan...

00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:52.839
Professor Fan.

00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:54.599
Stop reading.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.880
Bad news.

00:20:56.539 --> 00:20:56.920
You...

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.960
Are you going to tell me...

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.440
...some unfortunate news again?

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.400
At a time like this...

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.759
...you're still joking around with me?

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:02.759
This time, I really...

00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:04.200
...bring you unfortunate news.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:06.079
Royal Physician Sun just told me...

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:07.319
...that your lungs...

00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:08.279
...have a shadow on them.

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:10.160
He said to go to the Medical Center for a re-check.

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:11.420
Oh my god!

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.519
Is it true?

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:13.160
This...

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:14.359
What are we going to do?

00:21:14.359 --> 00:21:16.799
Stop with your little tricks.

00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:19.359
Do you think I'm that easy to fool?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.240
What tricks?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.440
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.079
I must admit...

00:21:24.079 --> 00:21:25.400
...the lie you made up this time...

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.759
...is quite creative.

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:28.640
It's quite sophisticated.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.319
You really used your brain.

00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:31.400
But when it comes to fooling me...

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.000
...you'd better come up with a better plan.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.720
What creativity?

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.519
Royal Physician Sun told me personally.

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:38.359
He said there's a shadow on your lungs.

00:21:41.319 --> 00:21:42.220
Look.

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:43.759
Is he here yet?

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:45.839
Professor Fan, we finally found you.

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:47.799
Hurry up, come with me to the Medical Center for a re-check.

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:48.640
Royal Physician Sun,

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:49.920
you, my elder,

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.160
such a highly respected gentleman,

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:54.000
are joining him to trick me too?

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:55.160
Naughty.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.680
Professor Fan, we really aren't tricking you this time.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.839
Old Liang, are you in on it with them too?

00:21:59.839 --> 00:22:00.920
Shut up, stop babbling.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.660
Go to the hospital.

00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:02.980
I'm not going.

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:04.519
I won't fall for it.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.079
Stop wasting breath on him.

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:07.000
Grab his arms and waist.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.440
We're dragging him to the hospital today no matter what.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.940
Okay.

00:22:09.359 --> 00:22:09.920
Don't.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.839
Don't move.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.759
You, surnamed Li!

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:12.839
You can't play like this!

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:14.079
No, Old Fan...

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:14.759
Don't get excited.

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:15.640
President Li really...

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.000
and all of us just mean well.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.039
Come on, hurry up.

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.519
What do you mean "mean well"?

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.720
I taught him about April Fools' Day, didn't I?

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.200
You guys...

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.319
Fine, everyone together.

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:23.759
Get him!

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:24.640
Stop it!

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.319
What April Fools' Day?

00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:26.400
This April Fools' Day...

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.640
I'm telling you,

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.079
don't play with people's lives!

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:29.680
Easy now.

00:22:30.039 --> 00:22:31.519
Easy! What are you doing?

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.799
Stop it!

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.480
It's for your own good.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.000
You've all been tricked by Old Li!

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.640
Don't!

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.339
Seriously, stop messing around!

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:53.779
I kind of understand you young people now.

00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:55.339
That Wu Di...

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.740
he doesn't have it easy either.

00:22:58.539 --> 00:22:59.460
Auntie Cai,

00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:01.299
you just went there once,

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:02.859
and you've already defected to "Di"?

00:23:03.539 --> 00:23:04.599
It's not defecting.

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:05.539
That "Di"...

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.539
he has his difficulties.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.019
Child,

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.180
you have to cherish your school days.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.299
Once you step into society,

00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:16.740
you have to fend for yourself entirely.

00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:18.299
You can't count on your parents.

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:21.539
Wu Di was determined to break up with Xiao Xin.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.940
There's no way to salvage it now.

00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:28.259
I didn't complete the mission.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.019
I don't even know

00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:30.720
how to explain it to Xiao Xin.

00:23:31.099 --> 00:23:31.900
Okay.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.460
He added me back.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.059
We aren't breaking up anymore.

00:23:35.059 --> 00:23:36.339
For real?

00:23:36.339 --> 00:23:37.259
What's the situation?

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:38.420
What happened?

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.180
Tell us.

00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:40.099
Wu Di said

00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:42.579
he received some profound education today,

00:23:42.579 --> 00:23:45.059
and decided never to give up, no matter how hard it gets.

00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:46.660
He'll stay with me through thick and thin.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.859
You old rascal.

00:24:12.859 --> 00:24:14.380
You actually came back?

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.200
Look at you.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.140
You just ruled out the possibility of lung cancer,

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.380
and now you're blowing your top again.

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:21.460
That's really bad for your health.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.140
Besides, what did I do to you today?

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.059
You really tricked me today.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.940
I didn't trick you today.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.460
Every word I said was the truth.

00:24:28.819 --> 00:24:30.299
That is a trick!

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.539
You said you were going to trick me today,

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:34.299
but you actually didn't trick me.

00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:35.940
That is the biggest trick of all!

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.140
You went back on your word!

00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:38.599
I said I'd trick you,

00:24:38.779 --> 00:24:39.700
but I didn't trick you,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.819
yet you were tricked.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.180
I kept my word.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.819
How can you say I went back on my word?

00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:45.900
Tricking you with lies...

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:46.579
that...

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.019
isn't real skill.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.339
It doesn't show Boss Li's true mastery.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.299
So?

00:24:52.819 --> 00:24:53.619
Impressed?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.579
Serves you right.

00:25:01.579 --> 00:25:03.059
Choked on my biscuit, didn't you?

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.339
Luckily, I learned the Heimlich maneuver.

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:07.000
Move! Quick, move!

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.859
Boss Li, how are you?

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.220
Is it serious?

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.980
Should we call Royal Physician Sun?

00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:22.940
Don't call Royal Physician Sun.

00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:24.059
I only have myself to blame.

00:25:28.859 --> 00:25:30.539
In that biscuit I gave you this morning,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.859
I squeezed a tube of toothpaste.
