00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:08.839
Xiao He.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.639
Are you really cutting it short?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.320
Cut it.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.560
Shorter.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.399
Even shorter.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.680
It should be even shorter.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.840
It can't go any shorter.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.200
Any shorter and you'll look like a boy.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.800
It won't look good at all.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:38.519
That's perfect.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.840
No.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200
I don't agree.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.600
"Candy"

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.900
(Episode 2: Take Recharging Seriously)

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.199
Wen Nuannuan.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.040
Have you thought about how to pay me back?

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.479
Don't go.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800
Don't leave me.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.199
Help me dry my hair.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Put this on.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.479
No...
It's fine.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.680
I don't want to trouble you.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.960
You want to go out like this?

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.599
I'll wear it.

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.280
Does she like clothes in this style now too?

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.039
Um…

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.319
I need to change.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.439
If you want me to help you change,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.719
I wouldn't say no.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.039
No, no, it's fine!

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.080
Could you…

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.479
close your eyes first?

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.399
Hmm.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Done.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.800
Not bad.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.160
Fits well.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.079
I think so too.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.399
Didn't expect…

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.560
you to like this style of clothes now.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.720
No,

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.239
I prepared it for someone else.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.399
What are you thinking?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
Trying to run again?

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:56.879
Teacher Lin Can.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.720
It's getting late,

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.759
you should get some rest.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.639
First,

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.160
given our relationship,

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:06.279
don't call me "Teacher Lin Can" from now on.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.800
Second,

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.399
I'm not tired.

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:09.519
I like staying up late.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.800
But…

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.560
I live pretty far away.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:14.480
In a bit,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.399
the last bus will leave...

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.519
You're staying here tonight.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:18.959
That's not okay.

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:20.879
I should really go back.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:21.879
Relax.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.240
There are toiletries.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.120
But it's too much trouble for you.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.600
I'll just go home.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.439
What's wrong?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.040
My head hurts a bit.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.879
And my stomach feels off.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.920
Is it from the alcohol earlier?

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.920
Probably had too much.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.800
It's fine.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.279
I can tough it out.

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:58.800
If you want to go back,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040
then go.

00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:18.334
["Pain in the Ass" calling]

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.199
Lin Can.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.399
You finally picked up.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.839
Hello, Sister Si Han.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It's Nuannuan.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720
Nuannuan?

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.240
Is Lin Can home?

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:39.439
Is she okay?

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.399
She's home, yes,

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.160
That's good.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.399
Let me talk to her.

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:46.879
Sorry, Sister Si Han,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.560
Teacher Lin Can is drunk,

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.240
and she's passed out now.

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:51.639
What should I do?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.800
Drunk again?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.480
Okay.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:55.639
Don't worry, Nuannuan.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:58.079
Lin Can has anemia and gastritis,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.520
so she faints easily when drunk.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.959
Please stay and take care of her.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.879
Xiao He.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.759
How have you been all these years?

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:04.319
Hello?

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:05.199
Nuannuan?

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:06.199
I'm here, I'm here.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.079
Good.

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:07.879
Nuannuan,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.456
listen carefully to what I say next.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.480
Remember it clearly.

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:13.079
Lin Can gets stomach cramps when drunk.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.480
Have stomach medicine ready.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.480
It's in the third layer of the medicine cabinet.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.639
Also, before she sobers up,

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.120
prepare warm milk in advance.

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.279
The milk is in the fridge.

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:25.319
Remember, use the yellow cup specifically.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.160
All cups have specific uses.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.319
Don't mix them up.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160
I see it.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:32.399
Hold on, Sister Si Han.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.000
That's about it.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:35.159
Oh,

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.000
also get some candy.

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:38.720
Candy?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080
And one more thing…

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.639
Sister Si Han,

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.799
right now,

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.039
I have no hands,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.159
no feet…

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.919
Candy helps calm her
intense emotions after drinking.

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:50.279
When she's drunk,

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.279
she can be pretty scary.

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:52.519
Nuannuan,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.399
be careful, okay?

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:54.799
I'll go do it now.

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:56.159
I have things to do,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.480
you take care of Lin Can first.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720
Okay.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.679
Xiao He.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.039
We promised.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.399
We'd never be apart.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You promised.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240
Hmm.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.639
Xiao He.

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:58.759
My head hurts…

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.799
My stomach hurts…

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120
You're awake?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:06.960
How do you feel?

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.320
Any better?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.519
Oh,

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.159
Sister Si Han said

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:13.039
you need stomach medicine for cramps.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:13.919
And,

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:15.159
warm milk.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:22.159
Did a burglar break into my house?

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:29.759
Sister Si Han gave a lot of instructions.

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:32.080
I couldn't find some things.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.840
So…

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.000
Oh right!

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.159
Candy.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200
Sister Si Han said

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.320
candy helps calm you down.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320
But…

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.559
Sister Si Han seems really concerned about you.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.440
Jealous?

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720
No.

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:12.759
Then sleep with me tonight.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120
Okay.

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:24.080
Online rumors say your studio is
involved in fraudulent invoicing,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.639
with tax evasion over seven figures.

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:26.600
Is it true

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.720
that's how you bought the limited-edition motorcycle?

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:30.240
During the tax scandal,

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:31.000
you still showed off riding it?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Is that true?

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.960
Tax evasion to get
the car you bought?

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:35.655
Don't you think
you're letting your fans down?

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:36.639
Nonsense!

00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:39.025
Oh my god!

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:41.679
Really?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.040
You really bought this for me?

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.879
From now on, no rejecting any work offers.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.639
Why?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.320
Because after this,

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.039
we have to pay off the car installments.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.279
Where's my money?

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:06.320
That's so crazy.

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.600
Then please explain

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.440
snatching the female lead role from actress Jiang Wan.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440
That's true, right?

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:12.000
I saw it myself.

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:14.240
She can blame her own poor acting.

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:15.799
Why blame someone else?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.519
You were seen on the new drama set

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.976
acting intimate with the married director.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.296
Multiple instances of
physical contact occurred.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.274
Are your acting resources all obtained?

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:22.082
That one is definitely fake.

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:23.948
It's 50/50.

00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:27.480
Look,

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.399
your palm lines, show you'll
be hugely successful this year.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720
Please don't.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480
Let me tell you,

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:39.959
this isn't the first time, is it?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.440
If I see you

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.080
touching actresses inappropriately again,

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:44.279
you'll regret it.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.440
In the future,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.919
you won't hit me, will you?

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:53.759
Depends on your behavior.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:05.360
And the rumors about you and your agent, Si
Han, being a lesbian couple are everywhere.

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:06.519
Is it true or not?

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:08.200
Right.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.960
Did something happen between you two?

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:11.279
Are the rumors true or not?

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:12.679
Please respond.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.519
And the gossip about her and her agent Si Han,

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:15.519
is it true or not?

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.519
Who knows?

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:17.759
Gotta say though,

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:18.919
they look good together.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.919
Home by 3 a.m.

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:24.559
Watch your mouth in front of the media.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:30.279
So you and Sister Si Han…

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.360
Have some milk.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Don't want it.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.600
Sorry.

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:41.919
Mentioning Sister Si Han upset you.

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:44.080
But drinking hurts your body,

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:45.639
have something warm.

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:49.879
Who said I'm upset?

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.240
Just tired of the news.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.399
All of that is stuff they made up.

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:01.759
Don't take it to heart.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.799
Being in this industry so long,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.559
if I got angry at everything they say,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.680
I'd have died from rage long ago.

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:16.279
Feed me.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720
Feed me.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.080
Monster.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:33.759
After all these years apart,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.240
how did you become like this?

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:40.440
Assistant Rule Number One:

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.799
No gossiping about me behind my back.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.360
I didn't say anything.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.519
Not even in your mind.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200
Sleepy.

00:14:54.039 --> 00:14:55.039
Come sleep with me.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:58.879
But

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:00.440
I still have work to do.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.080
Go to sleep now.

00:15:12.039 --> 00:15:13.159
We have work tomorrow.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.440
But I can't sleep.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.320
I'm sleepy.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.840
Xiao He.

00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:27.279
Being by your side

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.799
feels so unreal.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.679
Who hit you?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320
My mom.

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:49.639
She saw this haircut,

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:50.720
didn't like it,

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.080
and beat me up.

00:15:52.853 --> 00:15:53.320
Hmph.

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:54.960
You can still laugh?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.840
Here.

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:03.399
I saved for a week to buy this.

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:06.759
I was going to give it
to you on your birthday.

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:08.799
Thanks.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Feed me a bit.

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:16.679
Open up.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480
Still hurts?

00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:23.480
Xiao He,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.720
don't scare me.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.039
You tricked me again.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720
So annoying.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.600
You folded this?

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:36.279
Hmm.

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:37.679
For you.

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:38.919
It's ugly.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120
Ugly? Give it back.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.240
Give it back to me.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.615
Are you giving it back or not?

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.639
Give it back!

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.399
Stop tickling me!

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.039
Give it back!

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:49.440
No!

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440
Give it back!

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.960
Xiao He.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Seeing you again

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120
is so good.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Xiao He.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.799
From now on,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.039
come live at my place.

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:31.519
I'll protect you.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480
Having you is so good.

00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:22.480
Good morning!

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.480
Teacher Lin Can.

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.559
Good morning,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640
Young Miss.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.720
Sorry,

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:31.359
I overslept by accident.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.880
This…

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.200
is for me?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Hmm.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.400
I threw away your old clothes.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
As my assistant,

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:54.399
you need to dress stylishly.

00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:55.880
These are too expensive.

00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:57.079
I can't accept them.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.200
They're deducted from your salary.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.279
Alright.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.160
Drink up.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440
We have work later.

00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:33.079
What's wrong?

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640
I want you to take a good look.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.400
Sister Si Han is here.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240
Morning, Sister Si Han.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.400
Morning.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720
Nuannuan's here too.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.079
Seems you two get along well.

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:55.319
That puts me at ease.

00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:58.519
Sister Si Han, don't misunderstand.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.839
Teacher Lin Can and I

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.640
just slept together innocently last night.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720
Not "slept together,"

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.240
not that kind of sleeping together.

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:07.559
I…

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.480
We didn't do anything.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.160
It's not like that.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680
Sister Si Han,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:12.880
I…

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:15.079
I really don't want to ruin your relationship.

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:16.359
Alright.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.640
Ready? Get in the car.

00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:18.799
Let's get going.

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:20.519
Where to?

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:23.680
So many questions.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200
Get in.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.920
I heard they hired Lin Can for this ad.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.519
Lin Can?

00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:38.279
She's been surrounded by bad press lately.

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:39.039
Wonder what her condition is like. Yeah.

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:39.599
Hot, isn't it?

00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:39.920
Yeah.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.400
Hope she doesn't delay our shoot.

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.039
Everyone ready?

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.400
Let's start if ready.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:48.880
Over here.

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:50.519
Okay, Teacher Lin Can.

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:52.159
Tilt your head a bit more this way.

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:53.279
Yes.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:54.319
Perfect.

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:56.079
Good.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.400
So beautiful.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.079
I didn't expect Lin Can
to be so professional at work.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.200
A top-tier star indeed.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:16.119
She's totally different
from how she is at home.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.519
Sorry, Sister Si Han,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.960
I didn't mean it like that.

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:25.519
I just genuinely admire Teacher Lin Can.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.240
It's fine.

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:28.559
Why so nervous?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:29.920
You

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:31.079
aren't angry?

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960
Why would I be angry?

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:35.839
I didn't expect Sister Si
Han to be so understanding.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.400
What's going on?

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:42.200
Should be wrapping up by now.

00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:44.400
Teacher Si Han,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400
so sorry,

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:47.240
the director suddenly had new ideas,

00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:48.599
he wants to shoot a few more looks.

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:49.200
You see,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.416
according to the contract,

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.440
Lin Can's schedule for today is done.

00:21:53.359 --> 00:21:55.159
No wonder they say Teacher Lin Can is a diva.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640
Excuse me,

00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:58.839
it must be tough.

00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:00.319
What?

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960
Nothing.

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:03.319
I just think

00:22:03.359 --> 00:22:04.480
since you hate Lin Can so much,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.960
serving her here is so pitiful.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.599
You're just an assistant too,

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:11.319
no better than me.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:12.720
Right,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160
I am an assistant.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:17.640
But Teacher Lin Can pays me

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240
this much.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:26.119
Alright, Nuannuan,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.680
take me to change.

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:33.640
Sister Si Han,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
what do we do?

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.400
Leaving now

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:39.160
will just give them more to talk about.

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:44.999
You take care of Lin Can first.

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:46.160
I need to handle something.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640
Okay.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
What,

00:22:58.079 --> 00:22:59.079
feeling sorry for me?

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:02.119
They're bullying you.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
By the way,

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:06.519
can your body handle it?

00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:09.440
My battery's dead.

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:10.799
I need to recharge.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640
Recharge?

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.000
And how does one recharge?

00:23:20.797 --> 00:23:21.799
Recharge.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.920
Like this?

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.960
Feeling better?

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720
Far from it.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.640
Take it more seriously.

00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:45.119
Like this?

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:48.359
A little better.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.359
But to fully charge,

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.640
it'll take a while.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.160
Then…

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:58.920
Then…

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.960
what do we do?

00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:07.039
Kiss me.

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:10.359
Kiss you?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.000
Hmm.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.800
One kiss and I'll be fully charged.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720
I don't know how.

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:22.880
It's simple.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240
Got it?

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:36.519
Fully charged.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.400
Back to work.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.920
Go, Teacher Lin Can!

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:07.000
After this set,

00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:08.119
we have one more!

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.840
Truly impressive, Teacher Lin Can.

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:11.799
Wind, a bit stronger.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440
Stronger wind!

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.319
Remember,

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:17.839
the next set is royal style.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.160
The set after is the black dress.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.759
Miss Jiang,

00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:25.079
since when do you care about the shooting schedule?

00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:27.599
Si Han.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.160
Stop shooting!

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400
Stop the wind!

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920
It's twisted.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:37.839
Does it hurt?

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.960
It's fine.

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:41.039
"Fine"?

00:25:41.319 --> 00:25:42.799
Your foot is swollen.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.240
I'll record you all

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.400
and post it online.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Let everyone see

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:50.559
how you bully Lin Can.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.400
No, no,

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:52.519
let's talk this over.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.240
Teacher Lin Can,

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400
rest for a bit.

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:03.079
Better?

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:05.559
I'm really fine.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.720
Xiao He,

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.880
all these years,

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.599
have you been struggling like this?

00:26:09.987 --> 00:26:11.266
I have too much bad press now.

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:14.240
Who knows how far the rumors will go.

00:26:14.759 --> 00:26:15.759
Before that,

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:18.880
I want to do my current work well.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920
It's okay.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:24.880
Si Han,

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:26.359
I just…

00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:27.599
Just what?

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.519
Jiang Wan,

00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:30.160
all you know how to do

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.319
is these sneaky, underhanded things.

00:26:31.319 --> 00:26:32.359
What else can you do?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Si Han,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200
don't forget,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.720
it was you and I who went through those tough
times when we couldn't pay rent, not Lin Can.

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:42.640
You and I ended long ago.

00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:44.160
Don't use these tricks anymore.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.319
You know I hate it most—

00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:46.319
Know what?

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:47.799
Hate me the most?

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.976
The suffering I've endured these years,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.040
what do you know about it?

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920
Not my concern.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.880
A word of advice:

00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:00.319
focus more on yourself.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.379
If you're really bored,

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.640
work on improving your acting.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.720
How long do you think you can
protect that bitch?

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:10.399
Let me tell you the truth.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.759
Lin Can will soon be nothing.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.400
Jiang Wan,

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.240
what are you scheming now?

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.760
You don't know yet, do you?

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.880
To silence the public,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.599
the company decided to blacklist Lin Can
completely, withdrawing all her resources.

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:28.599
What nonsense!

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480
Si Han,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.640
if you knew this day would come,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.079
would you still be her dog?

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200
What else?

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:39.440
Be your little lapdog instead, Miss Jiang?

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240
Still so stubborn.

00:27:44.319 --> 00:27:45.319
But...

00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:47.599
I like it.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.680
Sister Si Han!

00:27:50.599 --> 00:27:51.599
Jiang Wan,

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.079
so it was you behind all this.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.400
So what if it was?

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.200
Lin Can,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.519
your days are numbered.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.920
It's fine.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.240
I expected this day
ever since the tax scandal.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.279
What "highly sought-after top star,"

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.759
"limited-edition motorcycle,"

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:11.920
"luxury mansion"—

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.480
starting now,

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.200
you're nothing.

00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:20.799
Jiang Wan,

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.560
instead of worrying about others,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.799
worry about yourself.

00:28:25.759 --> 00:28:26.880
Maybe my today

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:28.400
is your tomorrow.

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.319
Let's go.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.200
Lin Can,

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:42.279
Sister Si Han,

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.079
is what Jiang Wan said true?

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:46.319
What's really going on?

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400
It's true.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440
What do we do?

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.839
Now I have nothing.

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:52.839
I'll have to rely on you to support me.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.359
It's okay,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640
I'll support you.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.839
So, Miss Nuannuan,

00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:00.479
how do you plan to support Lin Can?

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.920
From what Jiang Wan said,

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.200
Lin Can's house

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.440
will probably be gone soon too.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.440
Now you won't even have a place to stay.

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:11.440
It's fine.

00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:12.799
Move in with me.

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:14.119
I'll protect you.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.319
Okay.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480
Let's move now.

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:19.119
So soon?

00:29:19.839 --> 00:29:21.119
But my place is tiny

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
and a bit messy.

00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:24.599
Don't look down on it.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960
Silly.

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.079
A big star like me

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:30.839
would never live in such a place.

00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:34.759
Be grateful you have a place.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920
Still complaining.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.640
Si Han,

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:38.279
come to my place for a drink.

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:41.400
Another time.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.720
I have things to do later.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.719
Then Nuannuan, stay with me.

00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:52.119
Okay.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.440
I think this job is pretty fun.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440
What's going on?

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.160
What are you all doing?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
(Easter egg)

00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:26.640
See my hairpin?

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640
Pretty?

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:29.000
Bought it new.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Nice, right?

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.519
Xiao He, Xiao He,

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:34.519
come out for a sec.

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:45.279
What's happening?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.400
And they have gifts?

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240
Three girls.

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:49.519
She's coming out.

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:51.759
Today is Valentine's Day.

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:53.400
This is my gift for you.

00:30:53.599 --> 00:30:54.279
And mine.

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:55.279
And mine.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.039
She accepted it.

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:03.039
Let's go.

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:08.039
Today's Valentine's Day.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.680
Those girls,

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.039
are they confessing to Xiao He?

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:11.319
Can't be helped.

00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:13.039
Ever since Xiao He cut her hair short,

00:31:13.119 --> 00:31:14.879
all the girls at school are crazy about her.

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:16.640
Look, so many gifts.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.480
What's going on?

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:27.679
No idea. Just focus on the problem.
