[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.810
[Episode 9]

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.870
You know what?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.710
Visiting Beijing is no big deal.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.560
I just went there casually!

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.610
What's so special about it?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.759
Where have you been?

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:45.710
We went to that...

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.150
When I was little, I got sick of visiting
the Forbidden City, Tiananmen,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.090
Wangfujing, the Yuanmingyuan Park,
the Yihe Garden,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.690
and the Badaling Great Wall.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.430
Locals don't even like
going to those places.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.330
Which places did you visit?

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.920
Where did you visit?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.950
-Tell us where you've been.
-Where have you been?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.150
Beijing just has those scenic spots.
The Forbidden City,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.000
Tiananmen,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.310
Wangfujing,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.570
the Yihe Garden,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.550
and the Badaling Great Wall.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.310
What's the point of going there?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.870
You didn't go, did you?

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.710
Bragger.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.450
Hey, if locals don't go, why should I?

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.660
Then what did you do?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.650
I went to that school first.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.800
Their campus is huge,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.730
much better than ours.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.660
What's more,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.160
I met a legendary figure there.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.520
-Who?
-A legendary figure?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.590
Their school's... that... that...

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.890
Security guard.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.460
What's so special about a security guard?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.120
Why do you look down on security guards?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.750
That guard's exceptionally capable.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.630
-He's awesome.
-That's all?

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.280
Anything else?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.800
Yeah.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400
Then we went to a mysterious alley.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.250
They say there's an old lady
in that alley.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.220
Whoever meets her
gets their souls hooked away.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.440
I met her.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.800
Judge Ma'am?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.540
So basically, you just didn't go anywhere.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.000
What are you so smug about?

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.630
What do you mean, I didn't go anywhere?

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.910
I've been to a whole lot of places!

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.680
-Well...
-Then how did Xiaodan do on the exam?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.570
What do you mean by "how she did"?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.290
Look at you.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.000
So snobbish. Isn't the process important?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.960
The process is more amazing, you know?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.420
Oh, no,
sounds like she didn't pass the exam.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.740
What are you talking about?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.710
Look.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.780
Xiaodan...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.710
X-Xiaodan.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.800
Well.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.750
Take a look.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.470
See?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.330
What did I say?

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.370
What did I tell you?

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.000
She didn't pass.
She was just there enjoying the process.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.660
What's wrong with your class?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.910
I walked over from there,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.910
and your class is the only noisy one.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.170
What class is this? Where is the teacher?

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.520
Director Hou, Mr. Gu is sick.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.310
We're having self-study this period.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.750
Right.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.560
Self-study.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.620
Do you know what "self-study" means?

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.210
Class president, maintain some order.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.800
Alright, alright.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.870
Go back to your seats. Go back.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.630
-Let's go back.
-Class is starting.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.630
Xiaoman, Ms. Tong is sick,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.310
and Ms. Dai is also under the weather.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.960
Is there a flu going around our school?

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.280
It's not the flu.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.160
Don't you know?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520
Our teachers were almost all

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.320
taken out by the royal jelly
from Xia Lei's family.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.930
What are you doing?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.050
Who are you throwing a tantrum at?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.560
What am I doing? It's
all because of this lousy royal jelly.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.280
It made all our teachers sick.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.560
Now the whole grade's students are
blaming me

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.960
and this junk royal jelly
our family makes.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.150
Watch your tone with your mother!

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.800
She works hard all day

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.150
and has to sell royal jelly
when she gets home at night.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.279
What for? Isn't it for your education?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.000
To earn some money for our family!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And here you are, yelling at us.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.750
You sell this lousy royal jelly
to make money?

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.830
It's a shoddy product.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.360
Y-You're talking back to me now?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.630
H-How was I supposed to know...

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.560
If I knew it was shoddy,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.510
would I... would I have
stocked up on it? Honestly.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.000
Your mother was scammed, too!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.330
It's okay. D-Don't cry.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.000
You brat. We are victims, too!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.070
Stop yapping!

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.600
Besides, we didn't sell many boxes.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.240
We've bought back the few we sold,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240
you know?

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.800
Well...

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.510
What?

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.000
Nothing. I... I was just asking.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.330
Did you get your answer?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.060
Go! If you get it, go do your homework.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.510
We'll call you for dinner.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.710
Mom, don't get upset.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.620
I-It's none of your business.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.680
Stay o-out of this.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.750
Go, just go!

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.710
Brat, how could you yell at your mother?

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.830
Was that okay, Honey?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.690
Did I show enough authority

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.730
as the head of the family just now?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.630
Why were you so harsh with our son?

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.890
Why were you so fierce?

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.390
H-He was yelling at you.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.360
Okay, okay.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.630
Then I... I'll go apologize to him.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.510
That's not necessary.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.120
Save it.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.450
Just watch it next time.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.450
Don't drink that.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.120
It'll be a waste.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.630
What if you get diarrhea?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.630
That's like suicide.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.960
It is a bit of a waste.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.070
If we get sick, we get sick together.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.980
Alright. It's okay.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.180
Let it go.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.680
Oh, my...

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.630
Studying hard?

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.850
What brings you here?

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.180
Nothing really. Are your parents asleep?

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.010
At this hour? Definitely.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.580
The weather's nice today.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.270
Let me take you out for a walk

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.330
to clear your head.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.680
Nice.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.400
Let's go.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.490
Why don't you go to sleep at night?

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.210
I don't want to.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.840
The plant is full of people
during the day.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.240
Too noisy.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.420
That is everyone's East Chemical Plant.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.120
At night, everyone's off work and home.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.159
There's no one left in the plant.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.310
That is my East Chemical Plant.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.010
I hold sway over this place.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.430
So free.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.870
I'm envious, really.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.120
I walk on the pipes
whenever I'm free at night.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.270
There are countless pipes in our plant,

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.750
reaching every nook and cranny,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.480
making it easy to get anywhere.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.000
[East Integrated Chemical Plant]

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.400
You'd better be careful.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.070
Those ladders are rusty.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.750
Don't miss a step and fall.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.130
How do you know the ladders are rusty?

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.650
It's been so many years

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.740
since our plant had any maintenance.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.430
You really are a smart one.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.020
What do they call people like you?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.820
A scholar who never leaves home,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.050
yet knows everything about the world.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.130
I'm different.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160
People like me...

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.230
People like me

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.240
won't realize anything

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.360
until the eleventh hour,

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.480
until it's right in front of my face.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.940
What's wrong with you?

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920
Nothing.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:53.040
I just wander around at night
when I'm free.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.040
Just roam around. But sometimes,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I keep walking

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.630
and end up reaching Xiaodan's place.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.160
Since I'm already there,

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.790
I'd sit on the heating pipes
to keep her company.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.540
But the pipes are so close to her house

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.870
that I can hear Chief Engineer Yan
talking inside.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.190
And then?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.950
Then...

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.510
And then?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.360
Chief Engineer Yan's transfer order
has been issued.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.960
He's going back to Shanghai.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.850
Xiaodan is supposed to move back

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.880
after the college entrance exam.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.059
So this time, they'll go back to Shanghai

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.990
not just to visit their relatives?

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.030
Xiaodan...
Xiaodan is going back to Shanghai.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960
And you,

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.910
you're off to college.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.480
I'll be the only one left.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:09.930
You...

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:11.670
Don't be so pessimistic.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.200
You've still got Dongdong.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.360
Don't be down.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.690
Who says going to college is the only way

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.200
to get out of the East Chemical Plant?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.730
You can also get a job out of town
in the future.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.900
Y-You're going to college.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.630
Have you decided where to apply?

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.430
Is it far away?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.780
I also have no idea.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.030
I don't know where these tracks

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.230
will lead me, either.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.350
Haven't you ever thought about going out
to see the world?

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.750
No, I haven't.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.210
I think our plant is great.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.550
Right? It's comfortable.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.360
Besides,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.160
no matter how fast or far a train runs,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.960
it goes out along the tracks,

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.900
and it has to come back sooner or later,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.000
right?

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.410
Won't you guys come back after you go off

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.750
to college?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.720
You mean, after graduation?

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.120
If I'm not working at the plant,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.250
I-I wouldn't know what to do back here.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.440
Your dad, right?

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.720
Mr. Ding.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.720
And all the other uncles of yours.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.800
They've spent their whole lives
at the plant.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.060
Isn't that fine? What's wrong with that?

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.170
Everyone knows everyone else inside out.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.510
If anyone runs into any problems,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.870
they call for help,
and everyone will respond.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.400
Everyone will come to help.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.290
How great it is!

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.980
Where else can you find
that kind of atmosphere?

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.790
My mom says

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.550
some people are just sheltering
from the rain at the station.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.080
Some

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.840
leave in private cars.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.120
Some

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.260
leave on the bus.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.170
And some just stay where they are.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.470
I'll miss you, too.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.860
Actually, what my mom says isn't

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.260
necessarily right.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.550
I think as long as we work hard,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.410
we can all stay on the same train.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.240
So, don't give up, Xiaoman.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.680
Xiaoman, let's go. Xiaoman.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.000
Zhang Xiaoman, why aren't you answering?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.980
Didn't we agree
to go to the sports school today?

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.630
I've got it in my heart.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.390
I was just planning to go look for you.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.390
-Yet I fell asleep while lying down.
-Hurry up.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.360
I have to get home
before my dad gets off work.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:19.870
Coming.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.350
Sir, I really don't need to do it?

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.960
You really don't. Listen to me, Xiaoman.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.820
Go on, Xiaoman.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.040
How was it?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.150
Wasn't it just a physical test?

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.410
Why did it take so long?

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:38.750
Well,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.750
they got a student to fight me.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.240
They were so rough.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.170
Did you get hurt?

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.430
I'm fine. I was wearing protective gear.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.200
What did the teacher say to you just now?

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.360
He told me not to bother
thinking about junior college.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.450
W-What does he mean?

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.360
H-How could he say that?

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.720
I think he makes a good point.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.030
I don't think so.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.720
L-Let's ignore him.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.500
We'll turn to another... another teacher.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.320
Someone with good judgment.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.850
Why should we listen to him?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.840
No, he asked me to go straight
for the sports academy.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.890
I knew you were the best.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.690
I don't want to go back to the plant.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.200
I want to stay here for a while.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.130
Stay for a while?

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.400
Okay! Then let's stay here for a while.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.320
Xiaoman.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.960
I've been giving thought
to the college entrance exam lately.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.260
I was wondering

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.240
how to turn a hobby into a career.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.300
I'm not good at math

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.180
or algebra.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.970
I'm no good at geometry either.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.420
But I'm good at drawing.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.800
So I wondered

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.200
how to make a career out of it.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.630
Then I realized

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.720
I could go
for the architectural design major.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.550
I-I could go to Shanghai

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.760
and apply to the Tongzhou University.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:23.760
How about you try to enroll at a college
in Shanghai, too? We could be together.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.030
Are you applying to Tongzhou

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.700
because it's in Shanghai?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.910
Of course not.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.520
It's because Tongzhou
has the best architecture program.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.000
You don't want to go to Shanghai?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.660
It's not like that.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.410
I know your family is moving to Shanghai.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.630
I didn't actually want to go.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.720
But as you know,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.630
I can't change my dad's decisions.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.150
I definitely want to stay with you.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.300
I want to be together with you
wherever we go.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.550
And I didn't know how to tell you.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.750
I thought I'd wait
until after the college entrance exam.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.230
We could just enjoy our time together
in these few months.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.080
But you knew all along.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.360
Chief Engineer Yan, what brings you here?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.490
Go easy on the chili.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.180
Our family likes chili.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.910
Mrs. Liu, going to buy groceries?

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.750
Yeah.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.360
Xiaoman.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.550
Welcome, Chief Engineer Yan!

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.550
What brings you here?

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.630
Here, come on inside and have a seat.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.550
No need to go inside.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.790
My wife cooked a few Shanghai dishes

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.270
and asked me to bring them to you.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.280
She wanted you to have a taste.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.010
That's great.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.150
She's so good at cooking!

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.870
Last time Xiaodan brought over
some steamed buns,

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.070
I gobbled them all up.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.460
-Have a seat, please.
-I'm glad you like them.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.090
Here.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.960
Oh, God. Doing the big washing?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.320
Yeah.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.150
My school uniform got dirty.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.550
Haven't washed it in ages.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.810
Let me put this inside.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.990
Speaking of this courtyard,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.530
I haven't been here
for more than a decade.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.960
It hasn't changed a bit.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.550
Yeah. We were assigned
an apartment back then.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.720
But my grandma didn't want to leave.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.030
She just loved this place.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.750
So we didn't move and just stayed here.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.480
Old people never like to move.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.030
Well,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.410
Chief Engineer Yan, did you come
to see me about something?

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.150
It's fine.
I just want to have a chat with you.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.550
Chief Engineer Yan, I took Xiaodan
to Beijing this time.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.080
It was indeed us... messing around.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.200
The families must have been worried.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.320
-We two…
-Let's not talk about this.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.050
We just decided and left.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.690
It's fine. Sit, sit down.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.790
Where did you two go for fun in Beijing?

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.960
We didn't do anything fun.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.100
We just w-went there for the competition

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.270
and came back right after.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.370
But the train ride back and forth
took a really long time.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.360
What a wasted trip.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.560
There are so many fun places in Beijing.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.720
The Great Wall, the Yihe Garden,

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.050
the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven,

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.280
right? And the Temple of Earth.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.200
Yeah, we wanted to go.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.460
But we didn't have time during this trip.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.750
You can go next time
when you have the chance.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.000
Time was indeed tight.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.490
You know, for you guys,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.310
the college entrance exam is
only in a few months.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.660
It's the same for both of you.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.790
Especially Xiaodan,

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.400
she must focus on her studies.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.830
Well,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.790
there are way too many distractions
for her right now.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.570
Let me name a few examples.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.250
Like this competition,

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.200
right?

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.420
Chief Engineer Yan.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.160
This was a legitimate competition.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.550
It was organized by... by...

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.350
the Institute of Broadcasting.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.700
There were hosts all over there.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.700
We checked it out.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480
It means nothing.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.120
And for another example,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.700
your influence on her.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.790
Xiaodan... Regarding Xiaodan's studies,

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.160
although I can't help much,

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.960
I haven't affected her studies.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.400
About this competition,

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.960
it's actually just a dream.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.510
I... I wanted to take her to fulfill it,

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.510
so she won't regret it in the future.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.440
I didn't think too much about it.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.960
I know you care about her.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.730
Let me be straight with you.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.210
In these days
before the college entrance exam,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.310
I hope you can help her

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.720
as her friend.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.680
As for how to help...

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.110
I think you should understand what I mean.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.370
I know, I know.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.870
Well,

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.350
do not affect Xiaodan's studies,

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.570
and do not distract her.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.190
Um,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.570
she needs to get a good score
on the college entrance exam

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.060
and get into a good university.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.060
I... I know.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.080
Keep my distance.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.480
It's a deal.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.580
Listen, Xiaoman.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.480
You're not 18 yet,

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.720
but I see you

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.270
as a real man.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.240
You know I like you very much.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.880
So I think we had a good talk today.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.480
It was a good man-to-man talk.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.400
Right?

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.720
Of course,

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.400
since it's between men,

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.440
I don't want Xiaodan to know about it.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.960
Okay?

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.820
I u-understand.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.990
After the college entrance exam, well,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.590
you're welcome at our place anytime.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.890
You two can have all the fun you want

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.720
and do whatever makes you happy.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.760
As for the future and the path ahead,

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.190
the world is boundless. I won't interfere.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.970
I understand, Mr. Yan.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:51.430
Really?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.030
I'll definitely support Xiaodan

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.670
to do well on the college entrance exam.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.510
I-I'll help out.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.160
Good.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.930
Enjoy the dishes now.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.090
If they get cold, it won't taste right.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.230
As Shanghainese say, the flavor is gone.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.270
Alright?

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.730
-Okay.
-You eat. I'm leaving.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.920
Let me empty the lunch box,
so you can take it back.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.980
Don't bother. We'll handle it later.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.030
I'm off.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.780
Take care, Chief Engineer Yan.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.440
Bye.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:36.550
Everyone, stay in your seats.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.700
The power will be back soon.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.000
Forget about the power!

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.930
I'll be the first to run! Follow me!

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.960
Don't go!

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:44.890
Who said you could leave?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.110
Why didn't you go?

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.490
You also didn't go, right?

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.510
Then I'm leaving now.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.290
Don't you want to ask...

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.960
where I'm going?

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.800
Where are you going?

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.880
Let's go.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.700
Hurry! You guys are so slow.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.550
Don't push me!

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.960
Run that way!

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.680
She went to the rooftop.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.580
Sorry.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.590
Wait for me.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.650
Zhang Xiaoman!

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:32.830
They said

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.070
you went to the rooftop
to look for me last night.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.830
Who said that?

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.510
Never mind who.
Just tell me. Did you go there?

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.270
Does it matter whether I went or not?

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.730
Did... Did you wait for me?

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.290
Of course not. Why would I wait for you?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:49.790
I'm asking you.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.000
Did you go?

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.390
No, I didn't.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.240
You...

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.400
Just admit it if you went there

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.800
and deny it if you didn't.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.030
I didn't go. I really didn't.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.010
Just keep being stubborn.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.240
So stubborn!

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.440
Mom, Dad, what's the occasion today?

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.840
Why are there fireworks?

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.350
Why was there only one?

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.760
W-What?

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.300
You're not keeping your distance today?

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.710
Were you home last night?

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.200
Yes. Where else would I be?

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.050
Then did you see the fireworks?

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.640
Yes, I did.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.640
It was really weird.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.680
They just went off twice

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680
and then stopped.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.680
I set them off.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.240
You did it?

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.830
For me?

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.980
Who else would it be for?

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.110
It was for you to see.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.760
How was it?

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.880
Is this your way of keeping me company?

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.400
Yeah. When you see fireworks,

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.730
you'll know I'm around.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.070
What do you think?

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.830
I like it.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:56.590
That's good.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.200
If you like it,

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.970
then every Friday from now on,

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:02.260
I'll set off fireworks for you,

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.390
so you know I'm here.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.440
Okay. Then we have to set a time.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.280
Otherwise, I might miss it.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.770
Whatever time you say.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.350
Then let's say 9:17.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.350
9:17. Okay.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.490
That's easy to remember.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.330
From now on, every Friday

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.640
at 9:17 PM,

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.860
I'll set off fireworks for you. Behold.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.730
Okay. I'll be waiting.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.070
Xiaoman.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.510
Keep me company to the end.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.640
Deal?

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.550
"Housing reform.
Are you really going to reform?"

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.180
Look at the headline in the newspaper.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.840
Even they don't have a clue.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.570
Xiaodan has been behaving well recently.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.210
She doesn't even take a glance
at such a good TV show.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.930
Sweetie.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.240
Yang Zheng and Wen Hui are
back together in the end.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.270
Stop it.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.310
Yes. They will definitely be together
in the finale.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.830
What's wrong?

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.460
Our girl is studying. What are you doing?

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.220
Who? Who is with whom?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.920
It's "Cherish Our Love Forever,"

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.790
the TV drama I'm watching.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.050
With a mother like you, she won't do well.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.480
We haven't walked
side by side for a long time.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.140
I wish it would rain every day.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.350
I made an exception this time.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.310
I was worried
it'd be unsafe for you to go back alone.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.030
Go back.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.590
Bye.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.750
Get him!

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:43.220
Beat him!

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:43.900
Beat him up!

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.230
Get him!

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.910
Beat him up!

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:58.790
Get him!

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.460
Learn your lesson.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.350
Use this to hit him! Break his arm!

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:07.960
Hit him!

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.550
Xiaoman!

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.590
Smash him to pieces!

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:19.540
Boss!

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:22.510
Xiaodan!

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.960
Xiaodan!

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:25.830
Xiaodan!

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.040
Don't come over!

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.920
Let go of me! Let go!

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.270
Let me go!

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.790
Let go!

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.110
Let... Let go of me!

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.450
Let go of me!

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.750
Do you want to die?

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.390
Xiaodan, run!

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.590
Run!

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.720
-Boss!
-Boss!

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.350
Bro! Bro!

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.280
Are you okay?

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.370
Bro, wake up! Bro!

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:07.820
Bro!

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.960
Xiaodan, regarding what happened tonight,

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960
if anyone asks,

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.530
say nothing. I'll handle it.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.750
Come over here.
