WEBVTT

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.059
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:41.062
{\an8}I'll get right to the point.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:43.731
{\an8}This is what Uncle Myeong-hwi compiled
to blow the whistle with…

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:45.650
{\an8}It's the slush fund ledger.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.986
{\an8}The FSS does not want to investigate,

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:50.738
{\an8}and Hanmin is being targeted
by both internal and external forces.

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:52.365
{\an8}You mean DK Ventures and President Shin?

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:53.575
{\an8}We figured out as much.

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:56.327
{\an8}Our ultimate goal is to steal
the slush fund, buy up the stock,

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:58.913
{\an8}and become the major shareholder
to protect the company.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.457
{\an8}Hold on.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.336
{\an8}The company would fall right into your lap
even if you did nothing, Big Al.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.838
{\an8}Why take such a big gamble?

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:08.798
{\an8}How can we know you're serious?

00:01:08.882 --> 00:01:11.634
{\an8}Let's say I do become Hanmin's president,
just as my father wishes.

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:13.136
Then what?

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.637
What if I get replaced
like Uncle Myeong-hwi did?

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:16.306
That's not the ending I want for myself.

00:01:17.265 --> 00:01:19.976
All right, we've decided to
board the same boat,

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:22.520
so even if we end up hating each other
enough to throw someone overboard,

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:25.398
we'll still work together
until we reach our destination.

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:26.316
Okay?

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:29.068
Division Manager Oh.

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:30.778
I'll be watching you.

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:31.696
So what?

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:34.407
Okay.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:36.701
Let's get back to it.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.455
Our first target is
the domestic slush funds.

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:41.497
Who manages them?

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:47.295
DOMESTIC SLUSH FUNDS

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.547
{\an8}"Managed by Executive Director
Oh Deok-gyu"?

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:51.466
My dad?

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:00.850
Good day, sir.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:04.646
I'll leave you to it.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.064
- All right.
- Yes.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.949
Now that the election has wrapped up,

00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.119
I've been thinking it's about time
to deliver the interest payments.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.580
It's our annual event, after all.

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:24.540
Executive Director Oh,

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:26.834
I appreciate your hard work.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.586
Not at all, sir.

00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:31.089
Just keep it up for one last year.

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.219
By one last year, do you mean…

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:37.845
Could it be?

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.932
Is he finally rolling out
a new succession plan?

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:44.811
Tasks like these
are better suited for young people.

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.022
Or I can have Ms. Song take on the task.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:51.651
Wait, sir.

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:53.111
Ms. Song isn't fit for this.

00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:56.322
We must treat our VIP clients
with full honors,

00:02:56.406 --> 00:02:59.075
and they would be insulted
if a chief of staff showed up.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.452
Ms. Song isn't suited to their level.

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:02.453
Is that so?

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.289
Then how about Shin Jung-woo?

00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:06.457
He's a president.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:09.002
You would already entrust
the young president

00:03:09.085 --> 00:03:11.087
with a task of such paramount importance?

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.132
You should've done a better job then.

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:19.137
Our failure to secure that public funding
was partly your fault too.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.016
You clearly failed
to properly manage our VIP clients.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.101
Even the total balance is lower this year!

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:26.769
Father-in-law… I mean, sir.

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.147
I promise I will do better.

00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:41.534
That's not a place for Ms. Song.

00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:43.619
Not for Shin Jung-woo either.

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:47.165
You two will be bowing down to me.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:49.459
I will make sure of it,

00:03:50.043 --> 00:03:50.918
no matter what.

00:03:56.841 --> 00:04:01.012
You and I share
so many similarities, don't we?

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:02.930
We do?

00:04:03.681 --> 00:04:05.600
Live-in son-in-laws.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.979
We're family chosen by the chairman.

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:13.191
The world is
so full of surprises, isn't it?

00:04:13.274 --> 00:04:15.360
We were strangers just three months ago,

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:17.820
but in the new year,
we'll be brothers-in-law.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:22.408
I'd like to ask you to briefly state
the purpose of your visit.

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:25.370
As you can see,
I have a lot on my plate right now.

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:28.956
I had an important chat

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.584
with the chairman just a while ago.

00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:32.919
Gosh.

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:37.131
It seems like he believes
you share some of the blame

00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:39.425
for failing to secure that public funding.

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:41.886
I'm sure he was very disappointed.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.015
But I still made sure to safeguard you.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:51.187
Despite how things may look,
the chairman has great faith in me.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.106
He even entrusted me with a special task,

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.983
but I recommended you
as my successor earlier

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:57.193
for that very position.

00:04:57.944 --> 00:04:59.529
And what exactly is this task?

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:03.324
It's still confidential,
so I can't say more.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.330
If the chairman summons you,

00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:11.332
be sure to reach out to me first.

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.752
Then I'll gladly turn over
the task to you.

00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:16.629
All right?

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:35.022
Hello, I'm calling from Admin.

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:36.858
Are you all set?

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:38.109
Is my dad already on his way?

00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:40.361
I haven't found it yet.

00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:42.822
- The white pot.
- The white pot?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.035
Okay.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.304
Dad, you seem to be in a good mood.

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:09.849
I heard you were meeting with the chairman
when I called earlier.

00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:10.808
Did something happen?

00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:11.851
Is your dad…

00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:16.647
someone who only goes to see the chairman
when something happens?

00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:19.775
You keep so many secrets from me.

00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:23.196
Especially when it comes to
anything about the chairman.

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:25.907
My son.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.784
Such a handsome guy.

00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:31.621
Albert, Oh Deok-gyu's boy.

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:34.999
Where should I begin

00:06:35.082 --> 00:06:39.170
in sharing my wisdom with you, son?

00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:44.508
Under the chairman's orders,

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.386
I've been running a small operation.

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:51.057
Then out of the blue,
he wants someone else to take over.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.225
What sort of operation?

00:06:56.062 --> 00:06:59.774
Delivering the interest payments
of politicians' slush funds.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:01.400
Bang.

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:05.905
Why would you bother?

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:07.698
Just hand it all over.

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.033
It's nice not having to work.

00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:11.535
But wait.

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:13.246
I thought you knew nothing
about the slush fund.

00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:15.039
Yeah.

00:07:15.122 --> 00:07:17.124
You said only Grandpa
and Ms. Song knew about it.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.259
This is why I'm always a step behind
Auntie Nora and President Shin.

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:28.386
You feel it too, right?

00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:31.138
Tasks like these

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:33.266
are better suited for young people.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.518
Right?

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:37.520
I can't hand this over to President Shin.

00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:38.688
I could, if it were you.

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:41.357
All right.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:45.570
You see, all politicians need funds.

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:01.127
Did you meet with your father?

00:08:03.087 --> 00:08:06.132
It turns out my dad secretly went around
making deals with politicians every year.

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:10.052
He offers to manage funds
they want kept hidden,

00:08:10.136 --> 00:08:11.762
with annual interest payouts.

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:12.972
So it's a political slush fund.

00:08:13.973 --> 00:08:15.099
Just forget about it.

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:16.058
We can't steal that money.

00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:19.478
You're saying
the slush funds will be moved again

00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:20.688
if we miss this chance, right?

00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:21.814
Right.

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:24.942
It's a one-year contract, so there are
withdrawals and new clients every year.

00:08:25.526 --> 00:08:26.944
And according to my dad,

00:08:27.028 --> 00:08:29.280
the chairman wishes to appoint
a new manager.

00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:30.615
Listen to me.

00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:32.491
We can't go after a political slush fund.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.619
Damn it.

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:37.788
We'll have to make
Executive Director Oh invite us in.

00:08:38.497 --> 00:08:39.540
It won't be easy.

00:08:40.124 --> 00:08:42.460
He's just as vigilant as the chairman,

00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:44.712
and he only associates
with vetted individuals.

00:08:44.795 --> 00:08:46.922
Schooling, money, and social influence.

00:08:47.757 --> 00:08:49.300
Those kinds of power
matter very much to him.

00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:53.387
{\an8}OH DEOK-GYU 9%

00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:54.430
Hello, Assemblyman.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:55.598
I hope all is well.

00:08:56.265 --> 00:08:58.017
Thank you for your service
to this country.

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:01.270
Take care, sir.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.106
When's the next one?

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.025
- In 30 minutes, sir.
- Make sure we're ready.

00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:24.460
A HISTORY OF FINANCIAL CRIMES
WRITTEN BY YUN JAE-BEOM

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:26.587
"A History of Financial Crimes"?

00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:29.590
It's training material
from the FSS new hire training.

00:09:29.674 --> 00:09:32.385
It's a compilation of case studies
on various financial crimes

00:09:32.468 --> 00:09:35.930
that were prevalent in Korea
from Liberation through the late '80s.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.975
Have you heard of the old banknote scam?

00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:44.939
Five suspects,
including a man surnamed Kim,

00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:47.733
have been indicted while in custody
for a scam involving old banknotes.

00:09:47.817 --> 00:09:49.193
The group approached victims,

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:52.697
claiming to manage
tens of trillions of won in slush funds

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.990
a former administration siphoned
from the national mint.

00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:57.827
They lured victims
by proposing to exchange

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.913
6 billion won in old banknotes
for 4.2 billion in 10,000-won notes,

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:04.291
promising the remaining 30% as commission.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:07.044
They hooked them
by promising a huge commission

00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:09.255
just for exchanging old bills
for new ones?

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.173
But we don't have any old bills.

00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:12.842
We'll pretend to,
which is why it's a fraud.

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:15.845
It's a con by reverse-engineering
existing criminal schemes.

00:10:15.928 --> 00:10:17.096
You got it, Mr. Lee.

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:20.725
But wouldn't we still need
some old bills to use as bait?

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:22.309
I've already acquired some.

00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:25.229
I asked when we went to that office
near the Bank of Korea.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.658
Can you source about 500 million won
in old 10,000-won bills?

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:38.701
What?

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.004
Wow.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.799
First phase of the operation,

00:10:53.883 --> 00:10:56.302
we start a rumor about old banknotes.

00:10:57.303 --> 00:10:59.555
This rumor must start quietly spreading

00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:02.099
from the Myeongdong markets to Yeouido.

00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:05.978
But Yeouido Pirates,
the perfect rumor mill, was shut down.

00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:08.898
If it resurfaces now,
it'll only arouse suspicion.

00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:10.858
So let's utilize other speakers.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.414
EPISODE 12: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:31.003
{\an8}DIRECTOR YUN JAE-BEOM

00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:32.505
She hands in her resignation,

00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:35.758
and now she's with Hanmin, inside and out.

00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:38.052
Damn it.

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:41.555
Jeez.

00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:47.102
You've reached--

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:49.188
- Still at the office, Director Yun?
- Hong!

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.148
Hey!

00:11:51.232 --> 00:11:52.191
Hold on.

00:11:53.776 --> 00:11:56.070
Speak of the devil, huh?

00:11:57.863 --> 00:12:00.574
Wait, are you watching me from somewhere?

00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:04.119
You answered in that tone you use
when you're at work.

00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:07.414
I called thinking you might be interested
in a progress report.

00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:08.666
And I have a favor to ask.

00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:10.584
You think I have time to waste like that?

00:12:10.668 --> 00:12:12.878
Why would I care
what you people are up to?

00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:14.046
My goodness.

00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:16.507
Forget it then. Bye.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.133
Wait, no. Hey!

00:12:19.802 --> 00:12:22.221
You need to hear me out to the end.

00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:25.933
Before I'm your boss,
I'm your mentor in life.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:28.102
A mentor could offer some aid, right?

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:31.397
So what is it?

00:12:43.951 --> 00:12:46.161
Sir, what did you want to
speak to me about?

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:49.623
The thing is…

00:12:49.707 --> 00:12:50.791
Yes?

00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:55.629
No, never mind.

00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:00.676
Since when did we have secrets between us?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.845
Please don't hesitate to tell me.

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:05.180
You know I can keep a secret.

00:13:07.891 --> 00:13:10.102
I need a rumor to spread like wildfire,

00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:13.147
and I was hoping to use
Nam Dong-gi as the loudspeaker.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.407
- You cannot tell anyone else.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.994
I went through back channels
to pry this intel out of an informant.

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:28.245
Okay.

00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:32.416
They've already swept through
the Myeongdong markets.

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:33.334
What did?

00:13:33.876 --> 00:13:35.377
Exactly.

00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:37.504
That's precisely why I'm only telling you.

00:13:37.588 --> 00:13:39.423
This must stay between us.

00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:41.675
Of course. I won't tell a soul.

00:13:49.725 --> 00:13:52.186
I swear I won't tell anyone,
even with a knife to my throat.

00:13:55.314 --> 00:13:56.231
Not a word.

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:15.084
Let me get this straight.

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:16.251
So,

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:21.298
they're exchanging banknotes
to launder political funds?

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:25.469
Sir, you summed it up perfectly.

00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:26.929
This is clearly top-tier intel.

00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:28.722
It sounds like a scam.

00:14:28.806 --> 00:14:30.099
They could just use the cash,

00:14:30.182 --> 00:14:32.601
so why would they bother
paying a 30% commission?

00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:34.812
They're just laundering it.

00:14:34.895 --> 00:14:38.065
Old bills draw attention from the start,
just by how they look.

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:40.484
That commission is
just a drop in the bucket for them.

00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:44.947
Word is they've already swept through
the Myeongdong markets once.

00:14:46.407 --> 00:14:47.449
Then again,

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.454
Myeongdong and Yeouido
are overflowing with easy money.

00:14:55.249 --> 00:14:56.083
Don't push it.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.012
Time for some music.

00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:12.391
Let me try an approach shot
while listening to music.

00:15:13.308 --> 00:15:14.810
You need a clean spin for…

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.982
Word is they've already swept through
the Myeongdong markets once.

00:15:20.065 --> 00:15:23.152
I hear they call you directly
as if you've been personally selected.

00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:27.156
Damn fool.

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:29.825
Nothing is free in this world.

00:15:32.077 --> 00:15:33.412
Focus.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.753
Yes, hello?

00:15:41.378 --> 00:15:42.629
Executive Director Oh Deok-gyu.

00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:45.299
Yes, that's me. Who might you be?

00:15:45.382 --> 00:15:47.217
I'd like to make you an offer.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.179
I'm in need of some fresh,
crisp 10,000-won bills.

00:15:52.723 --> 00:15:54.183
You're the 30% commission guy.

00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:56.226
If you can meet the timeframe,

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.145
I can even offer up to 50%.

00:15:58.228 --> 00:15:59.730
Right. Sure.

00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:01.648
Who the hell are you?

00:16:01.732 --> 00:16:03.901
How dare you try to scam me?

00:16:03.984 --> 00:16:05.235
Do you know who I am, punk?

00:16:06.445 --> 00:16:08.655
How are you going to gain
Executive Director Oh's trust?

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:11.742
I get that you'll spread a rumor
that seems convincing,

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:14.495
and that you'll use
Mr. Lee's voice-altering program.

00:16:14.578 --> 00:16:15.662
But still,

00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:17.414
you won't be able to
make the deal in person.

00:16:18.582 --> 00:16:20.125
My dad is a greedy man,

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:21.668
and he's just as wary.

00:16:24.254 --> 00:16:25.631
We have this.

00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:30.385
- Yehppee!
- The names of politicians

00:16:30.469 --> 00:16:32.846
who have entrusted Hanmin
with their slush funds,

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.473
as well as their account balances.

00:16:35.766 --> 00:16:37.559
Song Hui-seop, five billion won.

00:16:37.643 --> 00:16:39.186
Lee Yong-ja, 1.2 billion won.

00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:41.897
Lee Cheong-ju, 1.5 billion won.

00:16:43.065 --> 00:16:45.192
Wait, how do you know about that?

00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:46.902
I'm only reaching out to you

00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:49.154
because I'm on solid terms of trust
with them.

00:16:49.238 --> 00:16:50.739
Even this past Tuesday,

00:16:50.823 --> 00:16:53.242
you worked late into the night
running your operation.

00:16:53.867 --> 00:16:57.162
May I ask for your name?

00:16:57.246 --> 00:16:59.248
I'll call you again
at the same time in two days.

00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:00.415
Wait.

00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:08.340
What the hell?

00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:20.435
Do you think he'll buy it?

00:17:22.104 --> 00:17:24.064
He'll probably try to
verify the facts once more.

00:17:24.857 --> 00:17:27.067
But I bet he already has an answer
he wants to hear.

00:17:34.491 --> 00:17:37.327
Why would I suddenly have a meal
with Director Yun Jae-beom?

00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:38.412
Well,

00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:40.247
I suggested we get together
for a casual meal

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.291
to celebrate the year's end
and the new year.

00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:44.168
A get-together
to verify some facts, if you will.

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:46.962
Unnecessary meetings
can easily lead to mistakes.

00:17:47.504 --> 00:17:51.049
What if the FSS was still determined
to pursue the slush fund investigation?

00:17:51.133 --> 00:17:52.843
Who? Them?

00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:57.347
That ship sailed ages ago,
and no idiot would cling to that case.

00:17:57.431 --> 00:18:01.393
And with the consolidation of securities,
banking, and insurance regulators,

00:18:01.476 --> 00:18:03.562
they're too busy saving their own skin.

00:18:03.645 --> 00:18:05.898
Saving their own skin…

00:18:05.981 --> 00:18:09.526
The problem is, there's an idiot
who refuses to do just that.

00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:11.153
So?

00:18:11.236 --> 00:18:12.070
Are you saying

00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:15.449
you're not joining me for the meal?

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.868
No, I'll join.

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:27.711
The other day, Mr. Nam Dong-gi

00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:29.922
shared something very interesting with me.

00:18:30.005 --> 00:18:31.548
Something about old banknotes,

00:18:31.632 --> 00:18:33.258
and exchanging them and such.

00:18:33.342 --> 00:18:34.551
My goodness.

00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:35.677
Pardon?

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:39.306
That damn punk.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:43.602
That's a top-secret matter
we're handling jointly and off the record.

00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:46.730
Did he already spill
all the details to you?

00:18:47.231 --> 00:18:51.276
That damn loudmouth can't keep
his mouth shut to save his life.

00:18:53.237 --> 00:18:55.989
Am I the only one in the dark about this?

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:01.328
Oh, please allow me to explain.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.455
I was actually planning

00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:06.333
to reach out to Hanmin
to discuss this matter.

00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:10.921
I mean, private currency exchanges
with premium charges?

00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:12.506
If the money's source was legitimate,

00:19:12.589 --> 00:19:15.926
nobody in their right mind
would go through all that trouble.

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:18.428
We can't allow
such disruptions in our market.

00:19:18.512 --> 00:19:21.056
They could reach out
to the financial or securities sector,

00:19:21.139 --> 00:19:22.516
where capital is easily mobilized.

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:25.269
If, by chance,
you ever receive such an offer,

00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:27.729
please be sure to report it to us.

00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:29.815
Yes, I will gladly do my part.

00:19:29.898 --> 00:19:30.774
Thank you.

00:19:32.651 --> 00:19:35.028
Have you already received such a call,
by any chance?

00:19:36.822 --> 00:19:37.823
What?

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:40.659
It looks like you have.

00:19:44.204 --> 00:19:45.038
Nope.

00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:47.416
Never.

00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:50.002
What do you take me for?

00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:56.591
What a fun world we live in.

00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:21.199
Hello, you've reached Oh Deok-gyu.

00:20:21.283 --> 00:20:23.118
Have you given it some thought?

00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:25.996
Yes, I did give it some thought,

00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:30.375
but you should at least tell me
your name and where your office is…

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:32.210
If I said it's a house
with a blue-tiled roof,

00:20:32.294 --> 00:20:33.462
would that be enough?

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.385
Well, for the first deal,

00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:44.014
I was hoping I could suggest the amount.

00:20:44.723 --> 00:20:45.640
What do you say?

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:56.485
- Careful.
- Be careful right here.

00:20:59.654 --> 00:21:02.074
It's 1.5 billion with the 50% commission.
You double-checked, right?

00:21:02.657 --> 00:21:03.533
Of course.

00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:05.160
We're not giving him a single cent more.

00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:08.955
They were so confused when I asked
to exchange new bills for old ones.

00:21:15.128 --> 00:21:17.297
We'll drop off the old banknotes
at the meeting spot,

00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:20.050
and then take the new bills
Executive Director Oh leaves behind.

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:22.427
I hope he doesn't just steal it.

00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:25.180
What if he won't agree
to another deal after this?

00:21:25.263 --> 00:21:27.474
He'll change his mind
once he sees the money.

00:21:47.702 --> 00:21:48.703
"5879."

00:21:48.787 --> 00:21:50.247
"5879." Okay.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.809
Please let it be real.

00:22:11.518 --> 00:22:13.019
Come on, let it be real.

00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:25.866
Yes!

00:22:43.466 --> 00:22:46.178
LUCKY APPLES

00:23:03.278 --> 00:23:05.322
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:10.702
DO NOT TOUCH

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.682
I can't believe it worked.

00:23:33.725 --> 00:23:35.435
That was the easiest 500 million won.

00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:37.187
Nice!

00:23:37.771 --> 00:23:41.024
Long live Korea!

00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:43.902
Way to go, Oh!

00:23:45.528 --> 00:23:46.363
Come in.

00:23:51.743 --> 00:23:53.787
A courier just dropped this off for you,

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.497
and the sender was listed as "K."

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.456
"K"?

00:23:57.749 --> 00:23:58.583
Thanks.

00:23:59.417 --> 00:24:00.252
You may leave.

00:24:02.837 --> 00:24:03.713
Good work.

00:24:04.589 --> 00:24:07.175
You can wrap up for the day
if there's nothing urgent.

00:24:09.302 --> 00:24:10.262
Thank you, sir.

00:24:28.947 --> 00:24:30.031
I'm glad the deal went smoothly.

00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:31.533
How about ten billion won next time?

00:24:31.616 --> 00:24:32.450
Ten billion?

00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:34.703
I'll be in touch soon.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.288
From K.

00:24:36.371 --> 00:24:38.915
The only place that could come up
with an amount like this

00:24:38.999 --> 00:24:40.792
would be a shell company.

00:24:41.793 --> 00:24:42.752
Wait a minute.

00:24:43.378 --> 00:24:45.088
The commission is 50%…

00:24:46.589 --> 00:24:47.507
so that's five billion won.

00:24:53.096 --> 00:24:54.180
Five billion won…

00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:57.934
just there for the taking.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:00.186
Five billion won.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.647
Jingukjeong Liquor,
the domestic industry leader,

00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:06.568
was placed in initial default
after failing to settle a promissory note.

00:25:07.152 --> 00:25:09.487
With the foreign exchange crisis
destabilizing the market,

00:25:09.571 --> 00:25:13.408
anxiety continues to grow
as physical distribution companies falter.

00:25:14.284 --> 00:25:17.954
Jingukjeong Liquor operates
over 1,200 dealerships nationwide…

00:25:18.038 --> 00:25:21.624
We'll wire the rent money over
by the end of the day.

00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:24.252
Yes, all right.

00:25:24.836 --> 00:25:26.212
Take care now.

00:25:31.926 --> 00:25:34.179
How are we going to
find that money for rent?

00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:37.766
Where are you going?

00:25:38.683 --> 00:25:39.893
Well…

00:25:39.976 --> 00:25:42.479
I'm just going across the street
to Jemulpo Liquor Wholesale

00:25:42.562 --> 00:25:45.106
to collect the unpaid bill
for their group dinner last week.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.441
I'll have them clear that tab.

00:25:46.524 --> 00:25:48.026
That's not all.

00:25:48.109 --> 00:25:51.029
They're also a month behind
on their staff employees' lunch payments.

00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:52.614
Who cares if the owner is an alum?

00:25:52.697 --> 00:25:54.282
Who cares if you're like brothers?

00:25:54.866 --> 00:25:57.285
You'd better clear that tab today
for a month's worth of lunches

00:25:57.369 --> 00:25:58.870
and last week's group dinner.

00:25:58.953 --> 00:26:00.372
How could I collect all--

00:26:00.455 --> 00:26:04.084
Don't even think about coming home
until that tab is completely cleared.

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:06.544
Also, on your way and back,

00:26:06.628 --> 00:26:07.754
pass these out.

00:26:07.837 --> 00:26:09.881
I even passed these out
at the pool hall last week.

00:26:09.964 --> 00:26:11.549
Where else am I supposed to pass them out?

00:26:11.633 --> 00:26:12.675
Go.

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:13.927
What's gotten into you?

00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:17.639
Darn it.

00:26:18.848 --> 00:26:20.892
You're constantly threatening
to kick me out--

00:26:20.975 --> 00:26:22.185
- You got this!
- You got this.

00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:25.522
"Grandpa, you got this!"

00:26:25.605 --> 00:26:27.315
- Grandpa, you got this!
- You got this!

00:26:34.489 --> 00:26:35.490
Go.

00:26:36.074 --> 00:26:37.325
Here you go.

00:26:37.409 --> 00:26:38.910
Be careful. It's hot.

00:26:40.537 --> 00:26:41.663
Coming.

00:26:42.372 --> 00:26:44.124
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:51.464
We finally have some customers today.

00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:53.049
Where in the world is that man?

00:26:57.345 --> 00:27:00.223
Hello, this is Ullala Chicken.

00:27:00.306 --> 00:27:01.641
Are they calling for a delivery?

00:27:04.352 --> 00:27:05.937
I'll take your order.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.564
I'm calling from
the Incheon Police Station.

00:27:07.647 --> 00:27:09.107
Is Mr. Hong Chun-seop there?

00:27:10.358 --> 00:27:12.152
That's my husband.

00:27:12.235 --> 00:27:13.236
What's this about?

00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:15.238
I assume you're familiar
with Jemulpo Liquor Wholesale?

00:27:15.321 --> 00:27:17.323
It went bankrupt as of yesterday,

00:27:17.407 --> 00:27:19.325
and the owner took his own life.

00:27:20.243 --> 00:27:23.580
We are currently checking in
on the business owners

00:27:23.663 --> 00:27:25.081
who provided services on credit.

00:27:25.165 --> 00:27:28.585
We're trying to prevent
any unfortunate cascading incidents.

00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:41.806
FUNERAL HALL

00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:49.147
Do you know how many times I paged you?

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.065
Why didn't you call me back?

00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:53.485
Gosh, lower your voice.

00:27:53.568 --> 00:27:55.904
I sent you to collect money,
not mope around at a funeral.

00:27:55.987 --> 00:27:58.239
How could I ask for the money right now?

00:27:58.823 --> 00:28:01.326
We were classmates once,
and we were like brothers.

00:28:02.494 --> 00:28:04.204
I should at least send him off properly.

00:28:04.871 --> 00:28:05.872
Oh, right.

00:28:06.372 --> 00:28:08.958
If you have any cash on you,
could you give it to me?

00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:11.711
I wasn't able to give
condolence money earlier.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.342
Come on, just give me a little.

00:28:19.052 --> 00:28:20.637
Grandpa.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.115
I thought something terrible
had happened to you.

00:28:42.951 --> 00:28:45.286
Don't tell the kids
because they'll just get upset.

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:50.083
Tell Grandpa to just worry about himself.

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:53.378
Grandpa, she says to worry about yourself.

00:28:54.796 --> 00:28:55.964
All right.

00:28:56.047 --> 00:28:56.881
Bom.

00:28:56.965 --> 00:28:58.675
You can't tell the aunties either, okay?

00:28:58.758 --> 00:28:59.968
Okay.

00:29:00.051 --> 00:29:03.137
And tell Grandma to stop scolding me.

00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:05.974
Grandpa says to stop scolding him.

00:29:06.057 --> 00:29:08.560
Tell him to stop giving me reason to.

00:29:08.643 --> 00:29:12.021
She says to stop giving her reason to.

00:29:14.732 --> 00:29:17.068
Oh, my back.

00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:19.445
{\an8}MOYUN HOSPITAL

00:29:20.363 --> 00:29:25.577
But still, Grandma and Grandpa
have become closer.

00:29:26.077 --> 00:29:29.455
Sometimes when we eat,
she passes him the side dishes…

00:29:31.749 --> 00:29:33.126
like this.

00:29:34.878 --> 00:29:36.754
You must've been worried.

00:29:36.838 --> 00:29:39.132
They said it was a secret,

00:29:39.215 --> 00:29:41.801
but I thought you should know.

00:29:42.844 --> 00:29:46.139
You told me about Mommy, remember?

00:29:48.391 --> 00:29:49.434
Thank you.

00:29:51.019 --> 00:29:51.936
But Bom,

00:29:52.812 --> 00:29:55.231
I'll hold onto this
because it's dangerous.

00:29:55.315 --> 00:29:56.482
Okay.

00:30:04.115 --> 00:30:05.366
This one's for Mommy,

00:30:06.326 --> 00:30:07.952
and another for Mommy.

00:30:20.298 --> 00:30:22.967
{\an8}HANMIN HEIRESS KANG NORA
ENGAGED TO PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO

00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:26.346
{\an8}"CAN THERE BE TRUE LOVE
WHEN MONEY AND POWER MEET?"

00:30:36.648 --> 00:30:39.359
I assume this engagement announcement
was all your doing, ma'am?

00:30:40.234 --> 00:30:41.069
Did you see it?

00:30:41.152 --> 00:30:42.487
The photos came out nice, right?

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.656
I put a lot of thought into the selection.

00:30:44.739 --> 00:30:45.865
Didn't you agree

00:30:45.949 --> 00:30:48.326
to discuss everything with me
before moving ahead?

00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:52.163
Ju-ran, just go along with me this once.

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:54.749
If I left it up to you
with your already busy schedule,

00:30:54.832 --> 00:30:56.125
it would've taken forever and ever.

00:30:56.209 --> 00:30:58.586
When exactly would I see Nora
in a wedding dress?

00:30:59.128 --> 00:31:01.339
Weddings are my specialty.

00:31:01.422 --> 00:31:03.967
I'm an expert with three under my belt.

00:31:05.802 --> 00:31:06.886
Would you dare to say

00:31:07.387 --> 00:31:09.973
those exact words
in front of the chairman?

00:31:10.056 --> 00:31:12.767
You're always so quick
to threaten me with the chairman.

00:31:13.351 --> 00:31:15.478
It's getting old.
Change up your repertoire.

00:31:16.604 --> 00:31:17.605
What a joke.

00:31:22.026 --> 00:31:24.195
{\an8}HANMIN HEIRESS KANG NORA
ENGAGED TO PRESIDENT SHIN JUNG-WOO

00:31:26.823 --> 00:31:28.616
What does this mean for their family tree?

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.411
The president would become
the chairman's second son-in-law

00:31:31.494 --> 00:31:33.496
and Executive Director Oh's
younger brother-in-law.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.707
As for Big Al, he'd be…

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:36.624
the uncle?

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:40.545
Before all that,
he'd be Ms. Kang's husband.

00:31:40.628 --> 00:31:43.381
No wonder they've had
dinner together so often lately.

00:31:44.007 --> 00:31:47.468
But shouldn't they set up
their own dates and meet up?

00:31:47.552 --> 00:31:48.845
Why do they have you do it?

00:31:50.346 --> 00:31:51.472
You're right.

00:31:52.348 --> 00:31:53.975
Let's stay focused on the task at hand.

00:31:54.976 --> 00:31:57.270
We will make another call
at exactly 9 p.m. tonight.

00:31:58.312 --> 00:31:59.313
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes?

00:31:59.397 --> 00:32:02.358
- You made some nice gimbap rolls.
- Thank you.

00:32:02.442 --> 00:32:03.901
Have some,

00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:05.528
ma'am.

00:32:07.864 --> 00:32:08.698
Sure.

00:32:11.242 --> 00:32:13.828
Ms. Go, you can finish that first

00:32:13.911 --> 00:32:15.621
and move on to the next container.

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:23.880
Have you considered our proposal?

00:32:27.675 --> 00:32:31.095
Well, you see,
I'd be taking a huge risk here.

00:32:31.179 --> 00:32:35.016
{\an8}Shin Jung-woo, the young executive,
is to marry into Hanmin.

00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:38.686
His fiancée is Kang Nora,
the only daughter of Chairman Kang.

00:32:39.604 --> 00:32:42.356
They need to issue
a correction for that article.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.858
"The only daughter"?

00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:46.611
Our chairman had one son
and two daughters,

00:32:46.694 --> 00:32:48.404
and I'm his eldest son-in-law, all right?

00:32:49.655 --> 00:32:51.824
I wondered if I'd chosen
the wrong person for the job.

00:32:51.908 --> 00:32:54.577
Come on now. There's no need for all that.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.204
You definitely chose the right person.

00:32:56.913 --> 00:32:57.747
Just a second.

00:32:58.998 --> 00:32:59.916
Ten billion won.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.085
Ten billion.

00:33:03.336 --> 00:33:04.879
Let's go for it. Let's do it.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.547
But this time,

00:33:06.631 --> 00:33:08.466
I want this deal made face-to-face.

00:33:13.387 --> 00:33:14.263
All right.

00:33:15.223 --> 00:33:16.808
The deal will take place tomorrow night.

00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:20.144
I'll be in touch
with the exact time and place.

00:33:23.397 --> 00:33:24.565
What now?

00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:25.942
What do we do?

00:33:31.948 --> 00:33:32.907
Good choice.

00:33:34.158 --> 00:33:36.119
It's just one day.

00:33:36.202 --> 00:33:38.579
I'll borrow it just for one day
and return it.

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:41.249
Let's just go for it, damn it.

00:33:41.874 --> 00:33:44.127
Ten billion won.

00:33:45.002 --> 00:33:47.338
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES
MAGANG BRANCH

00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:48.297
{\an8}BRANCH MANAGER KIM MUN-HO

00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:49.423
{\an8}Sir.

00:33:49.507 --> 00:33:52.260
We can't cover such a large sum
without prior notice.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.054
We don't even keep
ten billion won in the vault.

00:33:55.638 --> 00:33:56.681
Gosh.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.391
Hey.

00:33:59.225 --> 00:34:01.519
Do you think I only came
to the Magang Branch?

00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:03.688
All the other branches
came through without excuses.

00:34:05.022 --> 00:34:07.191
You're surprisingly unambitious,
aren't you?

00:34:07.775 --> 00:34:09.944
Do you want to stay
a branch manager forever?

00:34:10.444 --> 00:34:12.363
What do you think will happen
once I become the chairman?

00:34:12.446 --> 00:34:14.574
The first thing I'll do
is an organizational reshuffle.

00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:16.325
Goodness.

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:18.411
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

00:34:20.204 --> 00:34:21.372
This coffee tastes great.

00:34:21.455 --> 00:34:22.498
Go ahead and load it up.

00:34:48.232 --> 00:34:49.233
Here he comes.

00:34:52.778 --> 00:34:53.779
He came by himself.

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:01.162
Let's get started.

00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:07.585
Jeez, this place looks haunted.

00:35:08.794 --> 00:35:10.463
Why meet here, of all places?

00:35:11.505 --> 00:35:13.090
My goodness.

00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:33.945
Here's to striking gold
Striking gold

00:35:34.612 --> 00:35:37.990
This place is probably empty,
day and night.

00:35:38.074 --> 00:35:40.159
Why did they have to meet at night?

00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:43.579
There we go.

00:35:48.209 --> 00:35:49.627
Yes, I've arrived.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.796
Where have you arrived exactly?

00:35:52.755 --> 00:35:54.715
- Chairman?
- Where are you?

00:35:55.299 --> 00:35:57.426
I told you to keep a low profile

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.346
because there are
sharp eyes watching everywhere!

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.056
Also,

00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:04.725
Albert has been coming home late recently.

00:36:05.393 --> 00:36:06.352
Yes, right.

00:36:06.936 --> 00:36:09.146
I've come to drop by a funeral, sir.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.816
I'll pick up Albert and be home soon.

00:36:11.899 --> 00:36:13.484
Unbelievable.

00:36:15.653 --> 00:36:16.988
He gives me a headache.

00:36:19.448 --> 00:36:20.992
Aside from Assemblyman Song,

00:36:21.075 --> 00:36:23.911
has anyone else called
about not getting their interest payments?

00:36:23.995 --> 00:36:25.079
Not yet, sir.

00:36:26.163 --> 00:36:26.998
All right.

00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:32.962
I casually asked
as I sent them New Year's gifts,

00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:34.839
and a few of them
were under the impression

00:36:34.922 --> 00:36:37.591
that our financial situation
was to blame for the delays.

00:36:37.675 --> 00:36:39.802
It appears that was
Executive Director Oh's excuse.

00:36:41.637 --> 00:36:43.389
Oh Deok-gyu…

00:36:43.889 --> 00:36:49.061
He's been such a reliable deliveryman
for 20 years without a single issue.

00:36:49.812 --> 00:36:50.855
Then again,

00:36:50.938 --> 00:36:54.692
the mere sight of money fuels greed.

00:36:54.775 --> 00:36:56.152
{\an8}LUCKY APPLES

00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:05.578
Jeez, what was that?

00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:14.462
Hey, I've arrived
and entered the building.

00:37:15.338 --> 00:37:16.797
I think I'm at the right place.

00:37:16.881 --> 00:37:18.549
Why didn't you answer your phone?

00:37:19.133 --> 00:37:21.552
If you shared this with anyone else…

00:37:21.635 --> 00:37:24.764
No, it's not like that.
I just got a call from home.

00:37:25.348 --> 00:37:27.892
But where are you exactly?

00:37:30.436 --> 00:37:31.604
Hello?

00:37:33.481 --> 00:37:34.899
Anyone here?

00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:39.779
Oh, my eyes.

00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:45.993
Hey, you don't want to hurt me.

00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:53.084
All disguised, I see.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.217
Everything has been confirmed.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.135
You can check the gift
we've prepared for you.

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:04.261
All right.

00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:05.805
Be gentle, okay?

00:38:09.892 --> 00:38:10.810
Must you hold me like this?

00:38:31.247 --> 00:38:32.248
Let go of me.

00:38:39.255 --> 00:38:40.131
My goodness.

00:38:40.214 --> 00:38:41.674
So this is ten billion won, huh?

00:38:45.678 --> 00:38:47.346
It's so crisp.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.935
Good work, everyone.

00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:54.437
Thanks.

00:39:04.697 --> 00:39:06.699
Be careful now.

00:39:08.075 --> 00:39:09.076
There you go.

00:39:10.536 --> 00:39:13.581
You're awfully weak for supposed crooks.

00:39:14.707 --> 00:39:16.333
I mean, thank you for your efforts.

00:39:19.753 --> 00:39:21.172
Make sure they don't rip.

00:39:22.465 --> 00:39:23.466
There you go.

00:39:26.927 --> 00:39:28.387
Hold on a second.

00:39:28.471 --> 00:39:29.889
My arms have gone numb.

00:40:38.165 --> 00:40:39.583
I'll pocket just the five billion

00:40:40.084 --> 00:40:41.335
and return the principal

00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:44.380
to the Magang Branch immediately.

00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:56.559
Man, it's heavy.

00:40:59.436 --> 00:41:00.688
To make money,

00:41:01.981 --> 00:41:03.774
you've got to be smart

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.818
and diligent.

00:41:06.402 --> 00:41:07.611
That's…

00:41:13.784 --> 00:41:15.661
Wait, why are these…

00:41:28.424 --> 00:41:29.508
Why is this…

00:41:46.817 --> 00:41:50.613
You bastards!

00:41:53.324 --> 00:41:55.326
Damn it.

00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:03.292
Where is all this money
coming from anyway?

00:42:04.376 --> 00:42:06.462
He must've figured it out by now, right?

00:42:07.296 --> 00:42:08.255
Could he have reported it?

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.258
My dad wouldn't report it.

00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:13.761
I'm sure he'll try to
clean up the mess though.

00:42:13.844 --> 00:42:14.803
Are you worried?

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:18.891
I knew he wouldn't recognize me,

00:42:18.974 --> 00:42:21.268
but seeing that he didn't
even with me right in front of him,

00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:23.103
upsets me.

00:42:24.563 --> 00:42:26.273
So you were upset.

00:42:26.815 --> 00:42:28.817
We need to kick him out. Leave, Big Al.

00:42:29.735 --> 00:42:32.988
I'm just sharing my feelings and emotions
with the team.

00:42:34.156 --> 00:42:36.158
From this point on,
I have the biggest part to play.

00:42:36.241 --> 00:42:37.201
You're right.

00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:39.453
It's all up to you now, Big Al.

00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:46.710
Now, we're entering the third phase.

00:42:49.254 --> 00:42:51.507
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:43:01.475 --> 00:43:03.352
Did you need to tell me something?

00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:07.981
Well, you see, yesterday…

00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:10.901
I experienced something strange.

00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:15.698
I heard scammers are reaching out
to senior executives

00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:20.494
in the financial sector
to pull off major scams.

00:43:22.663 --> 00:43:23.997
And well,

00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:26.542
you're still new to how things work
in Korea nowadays.

00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:28.836
That's why.

00:43:28.919 --> 00:43:30.754
I was just worried about you, that's all.

00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:35.718
Only a select few know my personal line.

00:43:35.801 --> 00:43:37.678
Right, me too.

00:43:39.346 --> 00:43:40.889
Should I ask him for some money?

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.599
No.

00:43:42.683 --> 00:43:44.518
Who would lend me ten billion won?

00:43:46.812 --> 00:43:47.855
Hey, President Shin.

00:43:49.064 --> 00:43:50.482
Do you know someone named "K"?

00:43:51.817 --> 00:43:52.818
"K"?

00:43:56.363 --> 00:43:58.365
I ought to treat you today.

00:43:59.199 --> 00:44:02.327
This place might not look like much,
but it's quite good.

00:44:02.411 --> 00:44:04.163
It's an excellent restaurant
by my standards.

00:44:07.207 --> 00:44:08.041
It's delicious.

00:44:08.125 --> 00:44:09.168
Gosh.

00:44:10.002 --> 00:44:11.503
You're even so down-to-earth.

00:44:14.882 --> 00:44:18.135
Well, why the sudden lunch call?

00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:20.512
You wouldn't ask to meet without a reason.

00:44:21.972 --> 00:44:23.557
Is it regarding…

00:44:24.266 --> 00:44:25.225
the Hong we know?

00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:30.689
Have you heard of someone who goes by "K"?

00:44:30.773 --> 00:44:31.607
"K"?

00:44:32.649 --> 00:44:33.734
As in the letter K?

00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:37.070
When we met for dinner
with Executive Director Oh,

00:44:37.863 --> 00:44:40.449
you mentioned an issue
regarding the exchange of old banknotes.

00:44:41.283 --> 00:44:43.827
You said scammers were contacting
people in the financial sector

00:44:43.911 --> 00:44:46.497
under the guise of old banknote exchanges…

00:44:52.002 --> 00:44:54.087
- Here you go.
- Pardon me.

00:44:58.967 --> 00:45:00.469
Let me hear the reason.

00:45:01.094 --> 00:45:02.763
Why are you asking me about that?

00:45:04.181 --> 00:45:06.767
That Nam Dong-gi
also mentioned this before.

00:45:07.559 --> 00:45:10.437
Ever since the failed probe
into Hanmin's slush fund,

00:45:11.021 --> 00:45:14.483
Keum-bo's standing within the FSS
has diminished, hasn't it?

00:45:15.526 --> 00:45:17.528
Well, I guess we could say that.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.532
If the FSS is waiting for tips,

00:45:21.615 --> 00:45:25.577
could she be reinstated after she catches
this financial criminal named "K"?

00:45:25.661 --> 00:45:28.247
I'll gladly assist in crafting
such a pretext for her return.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.414
I see.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.626
So it was because of Hong, after all.

00:45:32.709 --> 00:45:35.337
You just want her gone
as soon as possible.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.881
It's only a matter of time
before Hanmin falls.

00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:40.425
The tree will soon die on its own,

00:45:40.509 --> 00:45:43.262
so there's no need for her
to try knocking it down by herself.

00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:47.140
Please try to persuade her.

00:46:00.445 --> 00:46:04.449
When you've grown up with someone
and stayed close for a long time,

00:46:04.533 --> 00:46:06.118
you're prone to misreading them.

00:46:07.911 --> 00:46:09.830
My little brother was like that to me.

00:46:09.913 --> 00:46:11.915
I thought I knew him so well.

00:46:13.208 --> 00:46:15.210
Even when we were all grown up,

00:46:16.211 --> 00:46:19.715
I still saw him as a child
and was busy getting angry at him.

00:46:21.258 --> 00:46:23.302
I thought he'd always listen to me.

00:46:25.596 --> 00:46:27.889
{\an8}9 YEARS AGO, 1988

00:46:27.973 --> 00:46:28.890
{\an8}Damn it!

00:46:31.226 --> 00:46:32.394
Hey.

00:46:32.477 --> 00:46:36.064
Why did you get tangled up with Hanmin
and make this mess?

00:46:36.148 --> 00:46:37.524
Just walk away.

00:46:37.608 --> 00:46:39.192
No, just quit your job.

00:46:39.276 --> 00:46:40.402
You punk!

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.074
You should've kept your mouth shut
for your brother's sake.

00:46:51.747 --> 00:46:53.457
To the advancement of Korea

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.751
and the successful closing
of the Olympic Games!

00:46:55.834 --> 00:46:57.169
Cheers!

00:46:57.252 --> 00:46:59.171
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:46:59.254 --> 00:47:01.423
- Great work.
- Thank you. You too.

00:47:05.385 --> 00:47:07.137
Sir, let me pour you a drink.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:10.349
The police announced the results
of the Hanmin accounting fraud case,

00:47:10.432 --> 00:47:12.809
stating that an employee of Hanmin,
identified as Mr. Kim,

00:47:12.893 --> 00:47:14.853
had deliberately manipulated the accounts.

00:47:14.936 --> 00:47:18.857
It was carried out in collusion
with Mr. Yun, an external accountant,

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.651
in order to conceal his embezzlement.

00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:24.571
Mr. Yun, the accountant
who was being investigated by the police,

00:47:24.655 --> 00:47:26.865
committed suicide
by jumping from his apartment building

00:47:26.948 --> 00:47:27.991
around 3 p.m. today.

00:47:28.575 --> 00:47:29.910
Following the report of the incident,

00:47:29.993 --> 00:47:33.205
the police collected
Mr. Yun's notes and personal effects…

00:47:34.581 --> 00:47:37.084
The last person my brother called

00:47:38.585 --> 00:47:39.753
was me.

00:47:41.004 --> 00:47:42.464
When he did,

00:47:42.547 --> 00:47:43.757
I hounded him,

00:47:44.299 --> 00:47:45.342
scolded him,

00:47:46.677 --> 00:47:48.387
and told him he was naive.

00:47:49.346 --> 00:47:50.931
I yelled and cursed him out.

00:47:52.766 --> 00:47:55.769
A part of me was worried about him,
but the truth is,

00:47:56.269 --> 00:47:57.771
I was worried it could hurt me.

00:47:59.189 --> 00:48:00.691
I was more worried about myself.

00:48:04.444 --> 00:48:06.279
It became a lasting regret.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.248
You must have…

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.875
similar regret.

00:48:21.753 --> 00:48:22.629
Yes.

00:48:23.338 --> 00:48:24.339
I do.

00:48:26.842 --> 00:48:27.759
You could be…

00:48:29.177 --> 00:48:33.181
seeing Hong Keum-bo
the way you did nine years ago.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.018
Let's just wait and see.

00:48:42.149 --> 00:48:44.818
You should eat up
before the soup gets cold.

00:49:09.926 --> 00:49:12.012
I'm working up the courage
to go up to the 12th floor.

00:49:14.347 --> 00:49:15.724
Are you still upset?

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:17.726
A little.

00:49:18.685 --> 00:49:21.772
Reality is definitely different
from what I anticipated.

00:49:24.316 --> 00:49:26.401
I guess since Mr. Oh Deok-gyu is family,

00:49:27.944 --> 00:49:29.988
I hoped he would be different
from my grandfather.

00:49:32.699 --> 00:49:34.493
Although it wasn't family,

00:49:35.327 --> 00:49:38.121
I was once deeply disappointed
by someone I trusted and relied on.

00:49:39.915 --> 00:49:43.084
Even when everyone was hounding me
with the same old line,

00:49:44.294 --> 00:49:45.962
I had hoped he'd be different.

00:49:46.546 --> 00:49:47.589
But he was just the same?

00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:52.052
What about now?

00:49:53.428 --> 00:49:54.554
Do you regret it?

00:49:55.806 --> 00:49:56.640
I don't.

00:49:58.016 --> 00:49:59.893
That's why I'm working extra hard now,

00:50:00.477 --> 00:50:03.104
so my future self doesn't regret it.

00:50:05.649 --> 00:50:06.608
Your future self?

00:50:47.649 --> 00:50:48.900
What are you doing, Dad?

00:50:48.984 --> 00:50:49.985
It's time to go home.

00:50:52.112 --> 00:50:54.072
Grandpa's been checking attendance lately.

00:50:55.699 --> 00:50:57.325
Looks like I'll lose points again.

00:50:58.952 --> 00:50:59.995
What is it?

00:51:03.832 --> 00:51:06.418
Dad, you have to be honest with me.

00:51:07.377 --> 00:51:08.628
We're family.

00:51:14.593 --> 00:51:15.719
Oh gosh.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.142
The Magang Branch Manager
is calling for you, sir.

00:51:26.855 --> 00:51:28.023
Damn it.

00:51:41.494 --> 00:51:42.829
Dad.

00:51:44.456 --> 00:51:45.498
Dad!

00:51:48.627 --> 00:51:50.045
You have to tell me what's going on.

00:52:00.597 --> 00:52:02.390
I should come clean…

00:52:03.683 --> 00:52:05.060
to the chairman, right?

00:52:07.938 --> 00:52:10.357
You just need to return the money
without him knowing.

00:52:11.816 --> 00:52:12.651
Dad.

00:52:13.735 --> 00:52:14.736
There's only one way out of this.

00:52:15.362 --> 00:52:16.529
What is it?

00:52:16.613 --> 00:52:17.572
Do you have money?

00:52:17.656 --> 00:52:19.532
You know I don't.

00:52:21.242 --> 00:52:22.452
But you have stocks.

00:52:23.495 --> 00:52:24.329
The company stocks.

00:52:24.412 --> 00:52:26.706
If I sell those,
what about my shares of the company?

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.917
If I become the successor, the chairman,

00:52:29.876 --> 00:52:30.919
it won't be an issue.

00:52:32.963 --> 00:52:34.673
Isn't that the future you want?

00:52:36.508 --> 00:52:37.342
It is.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.098
Let's put out the immediate fire first.

00:52:47.143 --> 00:52:48.228
All right.

00:52:59.239 --> 00:53:00.740
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES HTS

00:53:04.995 --> 00:53:06.788
By the way, who will own those stocks?

00:53:06.871 --> 00:53:08.164
Yeouido Pirates will.

00:53:08.957 --> 00:53:11.292
We officially registered
as an investment firm yesterday.

00:53:11.376 --> 00:53:13.003
Big Al was the captain
of the online community,

00:53:13.086 --> 00:53:15.463
but the CEO of the investment firm
is Ms. Hong Keum-bo.

00:53:15.547 --> 00:53:16.506
We're all one team now.

00:53:16.589 --> 00:53:18.091
Isn't the name a bit obvious?

00:53:18.174 --> 00:53:19.300
Yes, and intentionally so.

00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:23.930
I can only keep watch
until the president returns at noon.

00:53:24.014 --> 00:53:25.223
I'm going to place the buy order,

00:53:25.306 --> 00:53:27.100
and just come back
to check when it's time.

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.521
STOCK BUY ORDER
CONFIRM

00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:46.244
Now, we're entering the third phase.

00:53:46.327 --> 00:53:47.620
{\an8}OH DEOK-GYU 9%

00:53:47.704 --> 00:53:49.664
{\an8}Gradually sell through program trading,

00:53:50.457 --> 00:53:53.251
so we can absorb it all
at the agreed time.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.300
I'm the head of Trading.

00:54:01.342 --> 00:54:02.302
I'll sell it off carefully…

00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:04.679
just a bit at a time,

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:06.806
under the radar.

00:54:07.932 --> 00:54:09.059
My son…

00:54:09.142 --> 00:54:10.477
You're all grown up now.

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.478
Thank you.

00:54:14.147 --> 00:54:16.357
When did the stock price drop this much?

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.651
Damn it, my money.

00:54:19.986 --> 00:54:21.696
My precious money…

00:54:22.781 --> 00:54:24.365
I'm about to lose it.

00:54:27.869 --> 00:54:29.996
Where is the buyer's IP traced to?

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.414
I used an IP proxy,

00:54:31.498 --> 00:54:33.291
so it'll show up as the 12th floor.

00:54:34.334 --> 00:54:38.588
Based on my simulations,
we should be able to buy up about 99%.

00:54:52.644 --> 00:54:59.567
{\an8}OH DEOK-GYU'S SHARES,
YEOUIDO PIRATES' SHARES

00:54:59.651 --> 00:55:02.779
{\an8}OH DEOK-GYU'S SHARES,
YEOUIDO PIRATES' SHARES

00:55:02.862 --> 00:55:04.489
{\an8}TRANSACTION COMPLETE

00:55:05.698 --> 00:55:07.534
- It's done. We got it.
- We did it!

00:55:08.576 --> 00:55:11.830
We really did it!

00:55:13.456 --> 00:55:14.624
{\an8}3 DAYS LATER

00:55:14.707 --> 00:55:15.583
{\an8}My apologies, sir.

00:55:16.126 --> 00:55:17.961
{\an8}There was a bit of a delay
with the briefing.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.588
The interest payments
for the 1997 fiscal year

00:55:20.672 --> 00:55:24.342
owed to the 12 assembly members
have all been completed.

00:55:24.926 --> 00:55:25.802
Good.

00:55:26.469 --> 00:55:27.512
Well done.

00:55:28.847 --> 00:55:30.306
Going forward…

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.224
Yes?

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.231
- Get home early.
- Yes, sir.

00:55:38.314 --> 00:55:40.775
These chances to sit down together
for a family dinner

00:55:40.859 --> 00:55:42.360
won't last forever.

00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.903
Yes, sir.

00:55:44.445 --> 00:55:45.446
I'll keep that in mind.

00:55:47.615 --> 00:55:48.533
All right.

00:55:59.002 --> 00:56:01.379
Should I look into
why it took over a week?

00:56:01.462 --> 00:56:02.505
No need.

00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:03.965
Leave it.

00:56:04.048 --> 00:56:06.467
Let's not stir up trouble.

00:56:08.094 --> 00:56:11.306
Let's just focus on
figuring out the best ways

00:56:11.389 --> 00:56:15.310
to use the slush funds entrusted to us
by the assembly members.

00:56:31.618 --> 00:56:33.203
Executive Director Oh Deok-gyu.

00:56:34.746 --> 00:56:37.373
He definitely had some money troubles.

00:56:54.766 --> 00:56:55.975
But you have stocks.

00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:58.186
The company stocks.

00:56:58.269 --> 00:57:00.271
If I sell those,
what about my shares of the company?

00:57:00.355 --> 00:57:02.357
If I become the successor, the chairman,

00:57:03.524 --> 00:57:04.609
it won't be an issue.

00:57:17.163 --> 00:57:18.248
Mr. Cha.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.500
This is Song Ju-ran.

00:57:21.125 --> 00:57:22.252
I need something checked.

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:25.838
Can you check on something for me?

00:57:38.726 --> 00:57:42.230
As you requested, I checked on
Executive Director Oh's company shares.

00:57:42.313 --> 00:57:44.232
That took longer than expected.

00:57:44.315 --> 00:57:46.609
Yes, I wanted to make sure
it wasn't some sort of error.

00:57:47.402 --> 00:57:48.820
I verified it at least five times.

00:57:50.238 --> 00:57:51.281
Executive Director Oh…

00:57:52.865 --> 00:57:54.534
has in his possession

00:57:55.118 --> 00:57:56.578
one share of Hanmin stock.

00:57:59.747 --> 00:58:00.582
One share?

00:58:01.708 --> 00:58:02.584
Yes.

00:58:04.419 --> 00:58:08.673
Why did he sell off all his shares?

00:58:11.175 --> 00:58:12.385
Are you asking me?

00:58:14.095 --> 00:58:14.929
No, ma'am.

00:58:17.265 --> 00:58:19.642
I'll report this to the chairman myself.

00:58:21.769 --> 00:58:23.813
You must not tell anyone about this

00:58:25.106 --> 00:58:26.983
until the chairman orders otherwise.

00:58:27.066 --> 00:58:28.192
Yes, of course.

00:58:28.276 --> 00:58:30.069
I have that much sense.

00:58:45.209 --> 00:58:48.171
I must keep my mouth shut.

00:58:52.634 --> 00:58:54.594
Executive Director Oh is out,
that's for sure.

00:58:56.054 --> 00:58:58.514
I'd better cancel the order
for his New Year's gift.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.526
Why aren't you going in?

00:59:13.446 --> 00:59:15.490
The chairman asked you
to refrain from visiting the offices.

00:59:15.573 --> 00:59:16.908
Did you forget already?

00:59:16.991 --> 00:59:19.827
He and I had a private chat after that.

00:59:19.911 --> 00:59:22.997
I'm here to have lunch with him and Nora
together as a family.

00:59:23.081 --> 00:59:24.207
Can you step aside?

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.887
She's not the type to back down so easily.

00:59:39.097 --> 00:59:40.306
What's going on?

00:59:41.224 --> 00:59:42.433
Don't just stand there. Open the door.

00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:46.562
Chairman.

00:59:47.146 --> 00:59:48.022
Enjoy.

00:59:49.565 --> 00:59:50.858
Let's see.

00:59:50.942 --> 00:59:53.653
I know we eat breakfast together
every morning,

00:59:54.237 --> 00:59:56.614
but it can get so crowded at home.

00:59:56.698 --> 01:00:00.243
It's nice to have lunch
with just the three of us.

01:00:00.326 --> 01:00:01.160
Don't you agree?

01:00:02.537 --> 01:00:03.579
Let's see here.

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.125
Eat up.

01:00:10.962 --> 01:00:12.380
It's not bad.

01:00:12.463 --> 01:00:14.549
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:22.348
LET'S GATHER OUR GOLD
AND UNITE IN PURPOSE FOR OUR ECONOMY

01:00:22.432 --> 01:00:26.686
"The Gold Collection Campaign to Overcome
the IMF Foreign Exchange Crisis."

01:00:26.769 --> 01:00:29.647
I'm reporting live from the scene.
Standing here, you can feel…

01:00:29.731 --> 01:00:31.149
Ridiculous.

01:00:32.442 --> 01:00:33.943
There's an old saying

01:00:34.819 --> 01:00:38.573
that even a king
can't save his country from poverty.

01:00:39.657 --> 01:00:40.950
Just how could the people

01:00:41.784 --> 01:00:44.078
save the country from poverty?

01:00:44.871 --> 01:00:47.665
My goodness, what a naive idea.

01:00:47.749 --> 01:00:48.916
Absolutely.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.295
A great task like that
should be led by someone great like you,

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:54.839
- don't you agree?
- My goodness.

01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:01.053
{\an8}COLLECTION POINT:
DONGYANG DEPARTMENT STORE

01:01:01.137 --> 01:01:03.848
GOLD COLLECTION CAMPAIGN

01:01:11.689 --> 01:01:13.107
GOLD COLLECTION CAMPAIGN

01:01:23.117 --> 01:01:25.787
{\an8}SAVE THE ECONOMY WITH UNUSED GOLD
MAGANG DISTRICT OFFICE

01:01:28.372 --> 01:01:29.832
I see you brought your whole family.

01:01:29.916 --> 01:01:31.292
What brings you here today?

01:01:31.375 --> 01:01:35.213
Well, we're just trying to do our part
to save the country.

01:01:35.296 --> 01:01:37.089
Yes, there are many people here today.

01:01:37.173 --> 01:01:39.592
I think it's heartwarming
to see all these people gathered.

01:01:39.675 --> 01:01:40.718
Absolutely.

01:01:42.887 --> 01:01:44.305
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:01:45.056 --> 01:01:46.516
I brought my kids' first birthday rings.

01:01:49.685 --> 01:01:51.813
I guess I wrapped it too tightly.

01:01:57.819 --> 01:01:59.862
And we have another touching moment here.

01:01:59.946 --> 01:02:01.697
A little girl has come all this way

01:02:01.781 --> 01:02:05.576
to willingly give up
her first birthday ring.

01:02:06.118 --> 01:02:08.996
How does it feel
to take part in this meaningful event?

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.081
It's nice.

01:02:10.164 --> 01:02:12.124
Can I ask what made you want to come?

01:02:12.208 --> 01:02:16.170
Because we need to collect gold
to save our country.

01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:18.214
How amazing. Thank you.

01:02:18.297 --> 01:02:20.633
Thank you so much for taking part
in this meaningful event.

01:02:20.716 --> 01:02:22.635
Thank you. Take care.

01:02:23.678 --> 01:02:24.762
You want to interview me?

01:02:24.846 --> 01:02:26.305
Are you okay with it being broadcast live?

01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:28.599
- Yes, of course.
- Sure, I'd love to interview you.

01:02:29.517 --> 01:02:30.560
Hello.

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:32.520
I'm Hong Chun-seop,

01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:35.648
and I'm the owner of Ullala Chicken,
the best fried chicken in Jemulpo Market.

01:02:36.566 --> 01:02:38.776
I brought the first birthday rings

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.363
of my two beloved daughters,
Keum-bo and Jang-mi.

01:02:43.823 --> 01:02:45.783
Oh dear, what a voracious eater you are.

01:02:45.867 --> 01:02:48.160
Slow down, or you'll get indigestion.

01:02:48.744 --> 01:02:49.912
Here.

01:02:50.955 --> 01:02:52.957
What is it? Do you know him?

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.000
Yes.

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:55.334
No.

01:02:55.835 --> 01:02:58.379
He reminds me of the owner
of a fried chicken place I know.

01:02:58.462 --> 01:03:00.006
Fried chicken?

01:03:01.424 --> 01:03:02.800
- Goodness.
- How cute.

01:03:02.884 --> 01:03:04.510
Soon-jung, I love you!

01:03:06.345 --> 01:03:07.263
That fool.

01:03:07.346 --> 01:03:09.515
How did he even find those rings?

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:11.058
Gosh, he's such a headache.

01:03:11.142 --> 01:03:12.768
Oh, my head…

01:03:13.352 --> 01:03:14.812
Miss Soon-jung?

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:26.908
Being an executive,
any change in his shareholdings

01:03:27.617 --> 01:03:29.327
must be disclosed within five days.

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:30.828
Yes, that's correct.

01:03:30.912 --> 01:03:34.540
Failure to comply
becomes grounds for dismissal.

01:03:35.124 --> 01:03:38.669
He's obligated to disclose it,
even if he sells just 1%.

01:03:38.753 --> 01:03:39.962
Did he not know?

01:03:41.297 --> 01:03:43.466
Or did he need it urgently?

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:45.217
Did you say grounds for dismissal?

01:03:50.264 --> 01:03:52.600
Do I have any reason
to try to save Oh Deok-gyu?

01:03:53.392 --> 01:03:54.352
No.

01:04:02.693 --> 01:04:04.904
Check on all the domestic
slush fund accounts today,

01:04:06.322 --> 01:04:07.573
including the OW's.

01:04:10.159 --> 01:04:11.285
The 5% rule.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:14.163
The shareholding disclosure system
has been in effect since 1992,

01:04:14.246 --> 01:04:16.499
when the Securities and Exchange Act
was revised.

01:04:16.582 --> 01:04:19.335
Then it's just a matter of time
before they find out

01:04:19.418 --> 01:04:23.839
that Oh Deok-gyu sold his 9%
and that Yeouido Pirates snatched it up.

01:04:24.423 --> 01:04:25.841
He'll probably try to smooth it over

01:04:25.925 --> 01:04:28.719
through Nam Dong-gi at the FSS
for the time being,

01:04:28.803 --> 01:04:29.887
although it'd only be a temporary fix.

01:04:29.971 --> 01:04:30.888
Does Big Al know this?

01:04:31.722 --> 01:04:32.640
I explained it to him.

01:04:34.016 --> 01:04:36.644
Also, can't you be a little nicer to him?

01:04:36.727 --> 01:04:39.105
Someone needs to stay on guard.

01:04:40.439 --> 01:04:41.440
I must say though,

01:04:41.524 --> 01:04:45.277
he probably won't do us any harm
because of his crush on Hong Jang-mi.

01:04:45.778 --> 01:04:47.113
During our meetings,

01:04:47.196 --> 01:04:49.198
he's either stealing glances
or staring at you.

01:04:51.033 --> 01:04:52.785
Do you have no shame?

01:04:52.868 --> 01:04:54.662
He may have
that free American spirit in him,

01:04:54.745 --> 01:04:56.372
but he's still ten years younger.

01:04:56.455 --> 01:04:58.958
Ten years are enough
to shift rivers and mountains.

01:04:59.041 --> 01:04:59.875
Above all else,

01:04:59.959 --> 01:05:02.795
he's the nephew of Ms. Kang,
who used to live in that small room.

01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:06.007
She's not "Ms. Kang" to me.

01:05:10.052 --> 01:05:11.470
I call Jang-mi

01:05:11.554 --> 01:05:13.764
Ms. Hong now.

01:05:14.932 --> 01:05:17.476
So in Room 301,

01:05:18.144 --> 01:05:20.229
I was actually the youngest,
excluding Bom.

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:22.064
Right.

01:05:22.148 --> 01:05:25.860
I saw Ms. Hong's father on a TV show
about the gold collection campaign.

01:05:26.736 --> 01:05:28.237
I've met him once.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.619
And Bom…

01:05:37.329 --> 01:05:39.874
is staying with Ms. Hong's parents.

01:05:46.255 --> 01:05:47.089
Mi-sook.

01:05:56.557 --> 01:05:57.558
Yes?

01:05:57.641 --> 01:05:59.185
Hello? Ms. Hong!

01:05:59.268 --> 01:06:00.853
Mi-sook woke up!

01:06:10.529 --> 01:06:11.947
Mi-sook.

01:06:14.408 --> 01:06:15.326
I'm sorry.

01:06:16.911 --> 01:06:19.622
Eun-joo told me about
everything that's happened.

01:06:20.915 --> 01:06:22.416
I told you.

01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:25.294
Mi-sook and I were close.

01:06:26.337 --> 01:06:27.379
We shared a room.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.472
Don't worry about Bom.

01:06:36.555 --> 01:06:38.099
She's doing fine.

01:06:38.182 --> 01:06:39.725
She's in Incheon with my parents,

01:06:39.809 --> 01:06:41.644
and I couldn't bring her
because it's too late.

01:06:58.536 --> 01:07:00.287
You can call her big sis.

01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:01.914
Everyone knows she's old.

01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:09.130
Well, we know.

01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:18.305
What?

01:07:18.973 --> 01:07:19.932
Hong Jang-mi?

01:07:20.015 --> 01:07:22.476
The slush fund hidden under her name

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:24.478
has all been withdrawn.

01:07:25.646 --> 01:07:28.816
Are you saying
she went in person to withdraw it?

01:07:29.358 --> 01:07:30.484
Yes.

01:07:30.568 --> 01:07:33.779
The branch manager said
she had an authorization letter

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.115
and that he even spoke to you.

01:07:39.618 --> 01:07:41.203
Hong Jang-mi…

01:08:37.593 --> 01:08:39.428
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:08:40.095 --> 01:08:42.264
{\an8}If we just push out Shin Jung-woo,

01:08:42.348 --> 01:08:44.808
{\an8}we could all maintain peace.

01:08:45.851 --> 01:08:48.604
{\an8}We'll need to reallocate the slush fund.

01:08:48.687 --> 01:08:50.856
{\an8}If the chairman finds out
the OW's slush fund is gone…

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.734
{\an8}We can just retrieve the money
that was stolen.

01:08:53.817 --> 01:08:56.028
{\an8}You guys are secretly planning something,
aren't you?

01:08:56.111 --> 01:08:57.112
{\an8}Oh my god!

01:08:57.196 --> 01:08:58.822
{\an8}What is all that money about?

01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:01.075
{\an8}Hong Keum-bo.

01:09:03.285 --> 01:09:04.203
{\an8}It's a burglar!

01:09:04.912 --> 01:09:06.163
{\an8}We've got a burglar!

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:13.295
