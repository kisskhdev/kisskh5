The Ceremony finally ended without a hitch.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.980
You've worked hard these days, Deputy Director Xiao.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.450
Let's enjoy

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.680
tonight's Grand Festival.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.860
Not yet.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.890
The Grand Festival is the main event.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.580
You're here early.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.730
For tonight's Grand Festival,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.490
is everything in place?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.930
Look.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.170
Am I going to be your groom,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.700
or your household servant?

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.050
The last time I entered the palace

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.450
was twenty years ago.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.770
What's your plan?

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.540
Just get me into the palace,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.260
and keep me out of sight.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.300
I'll handle

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.450
everything else.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.490
Don't worry.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.140
I give you my word:

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.330
this time,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.820
I'll avenge the Prince of Duan.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.860
You trust him that much?

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.490
It's already past Shen Hour.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.100
Go rest a bit.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.300
We'll be busy again soon.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.420
Just as I thought.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.020
So you're here too, Mr. Xiao.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.170
You already knew the Celestial Lord was him.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.380
Why hide it?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.300
Because what he did

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.930
is what I wanted to do too.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.330
Come with me.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.540
You shouldn't be here.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.420
Why?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.330
Because I wasn't supposed to find

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.610
you were in on it with the Celestial Lord,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.730
or discover you were behind the palace lantern case,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.410
or use an investigation

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.650
to bring you to justice?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.050
You think you're clever, huh?

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.890
Fine.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.300
Then tell me

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.770
how you discovered I was behind it.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.650
At first, I thought

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.930
the killer hid near the lantern,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.860
and cut the cord when no one watched.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.380
But I missed one thing.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.580
The room was lit up everywhere.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.170
There was nowhere to hide.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.260
And around Lang Maochun,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.610
there was only him alone.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.330
If it wasn't him,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.420
then only you could have cut it,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.170
as you were closest to him.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.730
I...

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.330
I didn't do it.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.650
I didn't do it.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.490
Not me!

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.050
Your Ladyship is decisive and bold.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.300
Like father, like daughter!

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.770
But she's not like you.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.020
She didn't let Lang Maochun truly die.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.930
The one that was burned

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.610
was a corpse to begin with.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.580
I bet you hid a prepared body

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.700
under the oilcloth-covered workbench.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.410
Using the flames

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.740
and thick smoke as cover,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.380
Lang Maochun moved it out fast...

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.260
making it look like

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.770
he'd been pierced by bamboo ribs.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.970
The build

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.500
of that body,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.500
and those bamboo wounds

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.020
were convincing enough.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.060
But you couldn't control one surprise.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.530
The paste under the dragon's eyes

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.090
is this one.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.410
Lang Maochun's right fingers

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.970
were smeared with flammable oil.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.060
In the fire,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.970
they should've been badly burned.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.140
Yet that corpse's fingers weren't.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.970
I had Physician Zhao examine it.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.380
That body

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.820
had been dead for days

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.530
before it was burned.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.620
Your casework has improved.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.620
I made one mistake.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.060
Next

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.210
is how you helped Lang Maochun flee.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.820
You must have had someone

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.500
pour out the tung oil in advance,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.380
allowing him to hide inside the barrel.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.890
What's in that barrel?

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.650
Tung oil!

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.330
Hurry!

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.740
Move!

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.530
And right then,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.620
the night-soil collector you planted showed up.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.530
Who is it?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.020
Stop the cart!

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.820

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.330

No.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.850

Understood!

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.700
You chased after him,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.290
not to catch the killer,

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.770
but to escort Lang Maochun out of the palace.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.740
Sharp as a needle.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.060
Good reasoning.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.270
But I don't have time

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.450
to chat with you here.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.140
In two hours,

the Grand Festival begins.

Uncle Luo and I still have a lot to do.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.140
Come back with me to see His Majesty.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.740
I go to the palace

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.620
to see His Majesty, of course.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.850
You know what I mean.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.290
you won't make it out that gate.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.140
With our skills,

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.700

Last time, if not for him

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.500
playing generous at our expense,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.180
we would have had our revenge already!

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.580
You know me.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.530
And I know you.

You've always shown me mercy.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.090
You must come alone.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.770
If you only mean to stop me,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.620
and won't walk with me,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.820
then I'll find someone else to walk with.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.450
And if I insist on stopping you?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.620
Then I can only

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.290
step over you!

A blood-feud like this

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.820
is removed!

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.500
Tie him up.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.450
Move!

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.100
Do you regret it?

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.570

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.570
Who are you from the County Princess's manor?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.170
Do you have a palace-issued pass?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.140
Even Her Ladyship's token won't get me through?

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.750
Security is tight today.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.410
Without a palace-issued pass,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.260
you cannot enter.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.940
So I can't enter,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.410
and let Her Ladyship go in herself

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.460
with the gifts for Consort Shu?

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.530
You don't need to worry about that.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.860
The palace eunuchs will handle it.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.570
This face of mine

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.920
is worth less than a pass?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.050
Palace rules are palace rules.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.170
This brat doesn't know better.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.140
Your Ladyship, please forgive him.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.100
This way, please!

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.380
We haven't searched the cart.

[Xingqing Palace]

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:57.930
Move it away.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.500
Boss,

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.650
what's this?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.380
Put it down!

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.410
We need to check it!

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.170
This is my gift

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.380
for Consort Shu.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.890
Let Her Highness open it herself.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.170
Understood.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.530
Your Ladyship,

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.050
if you need anything,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.170
just give the word.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.570
You guys, go check over there.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.340
Understood!

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.930
I know something will happen tonight.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.460
Inform me once you learn anything.

I can help too.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.500
Then help check over there.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.340
Boss,

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.690
Mr. Xiao said

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:03.610
the killer might

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.020
strike again tonight.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.890
I've been on edge all day.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.480
Look, my hands are shaking.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.460
It's cold.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.410
You're dressed too lightly.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.460
Of course your hands are shaking.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.850
I'm on duty.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.890
You're making me embarrassed.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.690
Why be embarrassed?

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.290
If you freeze,

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:29.530
you can't even wield your sword.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.050
Boss,

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.380
you're really kind.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.410
Thank you.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.810
Tonight,

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.980
I can't keep watch with you.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.380
With you beside His Majesty and Consort Shu,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.500
I'll feel more at ease.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.930
He's in charge of the gifts for His Majesty

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.810
and Consort Shu.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.220
Treat him as you would treat me.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.690
Understood!

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.860
Enjoy the night.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.860
The Protector-General has sent troops

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.220
to station outside Chunming Gate.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.810
We're waiting for your order, Master.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.170
Has the evening drum sounded?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.260
It's the start of You Hour.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.140
Wait a little longer.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.810
Pass it on. Keep strict watch.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.650
Understood!

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.570

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.690
How is it?

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.050
No sign of anything.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.500
Go check over there.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.460
What time is it?

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.690
The second ke of You Hour.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.500
Master,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:31.980
His Majesty will never summon you

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.980
for tonight's Grand Festival.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.650
You may go now.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.650
Master,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.410
we really can't wait any longer.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.500
The Imperial Guards have doubled inside the palace.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.530
Consort Shu will be in danger

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.050
at the Grand Festival.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.410
Move now,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.220
or it'll be too late!

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.140
We siblings

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.410
have served His Majesty

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.690
with all our hearts for decades.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.990
As long as His Majesty remembers

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.380
the bond we once had,

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.770
I won't take it too far.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.620
Tonight,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.050
if I lead troops into the palace,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.220
whether to purge the traitors

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.410
or to save Consort Shu,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.340
in His Majesty's eyes,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.340
it would be treason.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.690
So...

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.650
let's wait a little longer.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.500
A guest is here.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.020
Chen Luo has entered the palace with Her Ladyship.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.690
Everything is in place.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.500
And the Right Chancellor

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.620
is about to boil over.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.340
Everything is ready.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.050
And the time has come.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.980
Let's enter the palace.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.650
Understood!

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.160
[Xingqing Palace]

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.740
Stop right there!

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.860
Deputy Director Xiao.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.380
Consort Shu is about to dance!

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.020
Mr. Xiao?

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.090
Why are you here so late?

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.090
Have you seen Chen Luo?

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.180
Chen Luo?

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.370
He's the Celestial Lord.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.500
He should be in the palace right now.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.500
Why are the fireworks lit at this time?

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.530
They must have made a mistake.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.770
"Phoenix Dances Across the Nine Heavens.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.500
Venus Shines in Tandem."

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.500
What's that supposed to mean?

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.130
Your Majesty,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.420
it was supposed to be

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.420
"Dragon Roams the Four Seas."

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.220
How could it...

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.900
Why are you still standing there?

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.290
Go check it now!

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.700
Go, now!

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.530
Understood.

"Phoenix Dances Across the Nine Heavens."

In the whole sky,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.220
only one phoenix reigns.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.530
Mr. Xiao?

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.050
They're using

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.470
Grand Festival fireworks

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.660
to brand Consort Shu as one

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.900
who'd upend the realm.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.940
They're using His Majesty's hand

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.130
to have her executed.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.420
Whoever set up those fireworks deserves death.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.260
I'll go check it.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.500
It's Her Ladyship.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.020
Her Ladyship prepared the fireworks.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.180
And there was someone with her.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.260
I thought he was just a servant.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.500
It's all my fault.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.610
I let my guard down.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.420
Her Ladyship?

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.180
Why would she do this?

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.610
She wants Consort Shu dead?

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.180
Let's go!

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.460
So that's it.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.570
At tonight's Grand Festival,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.290
the Cui clan faces a great disaster.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.050
How is it in the palace?

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.600
His Majesty is furious.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.770
He may order Consort Shu executed.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.220
Report!

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.660
No idea how the news got out,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.660
but a squad of Imperial Guards

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.980
is heading this way!

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.500
You can put Consort Shu on a pedestal,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.940
but forget about bringing her down.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.220
Trying to use this

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.420
to brand her a traitor

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.050
and wipe out my clan?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.330
Wrong move!

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.220
His Majesty is blind.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.370
He won't even give me a chance to explain,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.610
and already wants me wiped out!

00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.610
Fine...

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.500
since you drive me to rebel,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.660
I have no choice!

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.660
I'll give you what you want.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.610
I'll oblige you.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.500
Kill!

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.610
Kill!

[Chunming Gate]

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.940
Cui Minzhong!

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.500
You dare raise troops

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.530
at the palace gates!

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.250
Today,

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.780
for His Majesty,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.730
I'll wipe out you rebels!

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.900
Who do you think you are?

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.040
You framed me first,

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.360
then claim you're quelling rebels.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.230
You're the real villain here.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.350
I may not be a general,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.770
but I'll still fight

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.980
for this loyal heart of mine!

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.410
Kill!

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.820
Kill!

Understood!

It's done.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:11.870
Open the gate!

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.350
His Majesty has an edict:

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.980
One more step,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.460
and you walk to your death!

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.220
This is...

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.590
Her Ladyship didn't kill Consort Shu?

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.980
Your Majesty, look!

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.460
"Phoenix Blesses a Thousand Generations.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.110
Dragon Soars to the Highest Heaven!"

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.740
A dragon and a phoenix in harmony.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.460
May Great Tang

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.140
prosper for endless generations!

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.100
[Li Qiang, Crown Prince]

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.420
So that's it...

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.830
So that's it.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.220
This whole puzzle

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.630
was to force me to raise troops.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.870
What a fine scheme.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.420
Xie Binglin.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:07.790
Where are you?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.660
Master!

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.660
Turn back while you can.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.140
There may still be a way out!

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.980
Trying to make me surrender?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.630
You think you're worthy?

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.460
I have no way back now.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:36.660
Kill them!

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:37.590
Fire!

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.070
Kill!

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.270
I want to see His Majesty...

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.500
I want to see Consort Shu!

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.900
Today,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.220
even if I die,

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.630
I won't die at the hands

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.830
of you ants!

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:19.700
The palace has been unsettled of late.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:21.390
And that nursery rhyme

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.390
going around in the capital bears

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.830
sinister intent.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.940
I saw enemies in every shadow.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.940
I nearly took it out on you.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.180
Please,

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.790
don't blame me.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.980
I understand Your Majesty's heart.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.310
How could I blame Your Majesty?

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.900
Your Majesty.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.270
The Right Chancellor led troops and forced the gate.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.630
He awaits your sentence outside.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:52.870
Let him in.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.310
Your Majesty.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.390
Cui Minzhong colluded with rebel forces

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.500
and charged the palace gate.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:06.700
He committed treason,

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:08.070
seeking to overthrow the realm.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:08.900
Now,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.270
the rebel has been seized.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.220
And his accomplices have all been captured.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:15.700
Let go of me!

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.110
Your Majesty,

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.390
this humble minister can finally

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.110
see your face again...

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.740
Cui Minzhong,

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.790
you've grown bold, huh?

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.070
Your Majesty,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.830
I'm wronged.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.030
Look at you.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.790
The evidence is solid.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.180
And you still want to argue?

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.980
I obeyed your command,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.550
copied scriptures at home to repent,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.140
and never dared cross the line.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.700
But someone

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.180
wouldn't let me go.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.980
They wanted me dead!

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.900
I'm not afraid to die.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.460
I'm afraid someone used a nursery rhyme

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.670
to spread rumors,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.420
using Consort Shu

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.110
to sow discord.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.460
They wanted

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.980
Your Majesty to suspect

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.630
this loyal minister!

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.940
I only doubted you,

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.270
and you wanted to kill me?

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.700
Cui Minzhong,

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.140
so loyal, aren't you?

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.740
My blade cut down

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.520
what blocked my road

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.180
to see Your Majesty.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.740
It severed

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.180
your misunderstanding of me.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.900
It's true I brought troops into the palace.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.420
But only this way

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.420
could I

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.030
make Your Majesty see my sincere heart!

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.690
This minister

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.180
was forced into it.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.310
I had no choice.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.460
The one who set this up

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.900
truly means harm to Great Tang.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.980
They deserve death!

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.210
You raised the troops.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:13.500
And you got yourself

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.940
covered in blood.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:16.390
And you still

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.030
want to pin this crime

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.550
on someone who doesn't exist?

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.390
At first,

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:24.500
I couldn't understand

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.590
how someone could be so vicious,

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.180
hate this minister

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.420
to such a degree.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.270
But today...

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.030
I finally understand.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.460
The one behind it

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.550
has a name.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.790
She is...

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.310
Li Peiyi!

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:00.390
Cui Minzhong,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.660
was tonight's Grand Festival

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.270
to your liking?

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.460
Your Majesty.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:07.980
You saw it.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.500
It was her.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.810
That cursed lone star

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.460
is dissatisfied with Your Majesty's punishment of me,

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.030
and wants me dead!

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.350
She not only drove a wedge between us,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.660
she also used my love for Consort Shu

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.210
to make me think

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.590
Your Majesty meant to kill her!

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.740
Don't smear her!

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.420
Your Majesty.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.870
The culprit behind the palace murders

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:35.900
has been identified.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.390
We're just waiting to catch him red-handed.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.110
It has nothing to do with Her Ladyship.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.590
Silence!

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.630
You and Li Peiyi

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.070
are in league.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.500
You had a hand

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.010
in framing me!

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.550
How dare you vouch for her?

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.900
You've always had a silver tongue.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.070
Now the evidence is ironclad.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.270
So I'm curious

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.500
how you will twist the truth.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:04.970
This woman

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.070
has plotted against me at every turn.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.460
Your Majesty,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.590
the recent murders in the palace,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.140
and that nursery rhyme

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.460
spreading through the capital

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.310
must be all her doing!

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.040
If I hadn't gone this far,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.210
how could I see Your Majesty again,

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.270
and see my little sister again?

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:29.740
Little sister...

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:31.550
Consort Shu...

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.740
you know me!

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.700
When have I

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.180
ever been disloyal

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.700
to Your Majesty or to Tang?

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.830
My beloved,

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:49.790
in your opinion,

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:51.350
what should we do?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.460
Cui Minzhong

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.980
has committed treason.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.140
This is a minister's greatest crime.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.110
As the sister of a traitor,

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.310
I'm willing to accept the punishment with him,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.350

Cui Minzhong

was just a street thug.

How did he reach the rank of Right Chancellor,

and keep His Majesty's favor for over ten years?

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.910
and there'll always be another.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.750
Prince of Duan's death

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.540
doesn't count against her?

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.750
It was my failure.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:57.710
One lapse in a meticulous plan.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.060
I didn't foresee

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.230
that Her Ladyship

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.100
still valued Consort Shu's motherly care.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.500
She must have

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.540
tampered with the fireworks.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.460
It wasn't just about the fireworks.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.660
We all underestimated Li Peiyi.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.790
She'd been using us from the start.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.940
Go clean up what you should.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:17.980
Understood.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.460
You...

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.270
You betrayed Prince of Duan,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.230
and now you set me up too.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.390
You're unworthy of being his daughter!

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.980
Your insults

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.270
are as ridiculous

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.840
as your grand speeches.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.750
From the very moment

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:30.830
my mother bore me,

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.660
I was Prince of Duan's daughter.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.540
Whatever kind of person I am,

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.310
that's what the Prince of Duan's daughter is.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.080
You don't get to judge.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.430
Today,

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.190
I'll clean out the traitor for Prince of Duan!
