[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.009
[Episode 15]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.660
How could this happen?

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.000
He went straight to bed after he came back

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.729
and has been asleep ever since.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.470
He hasn't eaten anything.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.130
Is it still because of the Yan people
entering the city?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.960
News from the frontier says

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.120
that since Zhaluowahan,
the Emperor of Yan,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.150
agreed to send an envoy delegation
for Dan's birthday celebration,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.510
it has been half a month.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.040
They still haven't reached an agreement.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.630
I can't enter the court,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.400
so I don't know the details.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.830
Is it the Empress Dowager who opposes it,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.430
or Prince Duan?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.530
Both of them.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.390
It was expected that the Empress Dowager
would oppose it.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.360
After all, if the peace talks succeed
and there's no war,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.160
Prince Duan's troops
won't be tied up at the border

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.320
and could instead be used against her.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.090
But we didn't expect

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.470
that Prince Duan, perhaps fearing
that the army would be hard to control

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.840
if it returned to the capital,
would also be against it.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.100
We still haven't figured out a solution.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.600
These people
claim to care about the nation,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.710
but who cares about Dan's life and safety?

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.310
His health is fragile already,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.040
and he suffers from headaches.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.520
Indeed.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.140
These ministers
treat him like a fool every day,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.400
and he has to deal with each of them
while pretending to be one.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.000
I can hide in the Cold Palace,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.710
but where can he hide?

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.590
This is the secret letter
Dan brought back.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.390
Take a look.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.550
It was after reading this letter

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.610
that his headache flared up again.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.280
[Emperor of Yan is hospitable.
I couldn't refuse his hospitality]

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.329
Emperor of Yan is hospitable.
I couldn't refuse his hospitality...

[I'm afraid I'll have to stay here for
a few days and will be late. Wang Zhao]

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.410
Wang Zhao
was detained by the Emperor of Yan?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.320
Mr. Bei,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.530
I've been in the Cold Palace
for 2 months now.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.360
I don't need to pay respects
to the Empress Dowager,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.020
and I've been cut off
from Prince Duan's spying.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.640
It's like taking an extremely long leave.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.650
But I can't keep hiding like a coward,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.010
leaving him alone to deal with them.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.220
You want to leave the Cold Palace?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.480
That's right.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.470
But didn't Dan
tell you to wait a little longer

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.000
until he finds a reason
for your restoration?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.160
I have to think...

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.590
what reason I could use.

please help me get justice, Your Majesty!

What's going on?

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.560
Why are you crying
so early in the morning?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.450
Your Majesty, you have no idea,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.460
but Concubine Yu

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.950

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.310
She's been locked in the Cold Palace.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.440
How could she still cause you trouble?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.640
I thought

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.460
she would behave from then on,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.530
but this morning she was shouting

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.820
and claiming

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.630
that I'm the real culprit

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.830
and she's the victim.

Are you the real culprit?

I'm not.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
What are you waiting for? Chase her!

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:11.750
Let's go!

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.150
Hurry!

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200
Stop right there!

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.440
Don't run!

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.680
Yu Wanyin!

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.040
Open the door!

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.070
Open the door!

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.120
Haven't you eaten?

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.340
Give me the axe!

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:44.700
Move aside!

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.960
His Majesty is here!

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.040
Take her away.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:10.750
Confine her.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.960
Your Majesty, let me explain!

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.020
It's not like that!

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.560
Yu Wan...

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:15.960
Your Majesty!

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.030
Your Majesty, I was wrong!

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.830
Your Majesty!

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.870
Your Majesty, please don't!

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.320
Your Majesty!

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.720
CEO Dan...

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.600
Your Majesty!

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.360
Boss Dan!

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.380
I led Consort Shu here.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.560
It was just an act.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.690
If you do this,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.000
Prince Duan
will know I didn't fall out of favor.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.120
Then all our previous performances

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.110
would have been for nothing.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.670
If I don't punish her severely this time,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.510
next time someone else
will be chasing you with an axe.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.320
I'm not that unpopular.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.610
I said I would find a proper reason

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.720
to bring you out of the Cold Palace.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.420
Why did you act on your own?

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.240
I came in time this time.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.130
What if I'd been later?

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.390
Weren't the secret guards there?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.960
I was wrong.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.750
Alright?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.720
I know you want to protect me,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.460
but I don't want your protection.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.020
Because...

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.240
I want to stand by your side

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.800

[Kunyu Palace]

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.890
Your Highness.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.840
Consort Xie.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.870
I've brought an imperial physician
to see you.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.120
Ms. Tonghao, how thoughtful of you.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.390
Perhaps it was something
I ate for breakfast.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.270
Or maybe Consort Shu's powder

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.930
had too strong a scent.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.550
But I'm fine now.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.790
In that case,

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.750
you need the imperial physician
to check on you more.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.840
It will also put Her Majesty at ease.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:25.910
Ling,

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.070
serve tea to Ms. Tonghao.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.240
Yes.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.510
No need.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.360
Once the imperial physician
has finished the examination,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.890
I need to go back and report.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.720
I deserve death!

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.800
I was so clumsy.
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.310
Physician Xiao, what's the diagnosis?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.300
Consort Xie
doesn't have a stomach problem,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.210
nor is she sensitive to smells.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.430
It's just that

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.800
she didn't sleep well.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.730
Physician Xiao
said her pillow was too high,

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.480
which compressed the blood vessels
in her neck

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.080
and caused her dizziness and vomiting.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.870
Physician Xiao?

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.450
Who is this Physician Xiao?

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.960
Is he reliable?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.430
Our familiar Physician Zhang

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.270
happened to be out of the palace,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.400
so I appointed a new junior physician.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.030
His position is not yet secure,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.720
so he couldn't have been bribed.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.750
Therefore, he has no reason to lie.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.440
Another false hope.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.150
I thought

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.480
the Emperor
was giving me a little grandson.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.540
He's still so useless.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.510
Back then, His Majesty

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.640
was traumatized
by that assassin beauty from Yan State.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.080
Perhaps

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.330
since then,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.630
it has been

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.420
difficult for him
to perform in the bedroom.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.240
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so difficult
to have a little Crown Prince.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.700
Difficult for him
to perform in the bedroom?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.000
That's just an act.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.550
He knew he was just a puppet.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.870
If he had disobeyed,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.150
there would have been a younger,
more obedient prince replacing him,

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.720
and then he would have been useless.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.150
You mean...

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.510
back then His Majesty was just pretending

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.040
he had no interest in women?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.550
Whether he was pretending or not,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.720
wasn't he still at my disposal?

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.630
But Your Majesty,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.260
you already had the little Crown Prince.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.030
Why

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.930
did you still want more?

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.280
You've been with me for so long,

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.630
yet you're still so brainless.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.510
If it weren't for Xiahou Bo
keeping a covetous eye on him,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.550
how could Xiahou Dan

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.670
have taken my words so seriously?

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.720
Remember,

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.860
never let your piece

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.590
become the only

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.840
irreplaceable one.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.730
Thank you for the guidance, Your Majesty.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.620
That Physician Zhang—

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.270
quickly call him back

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.730
to examine Consort Xie properly.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:10.640
I don't trust

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.430
strangers.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.780
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.839
I will arrange it right away.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.970
Consort Xie.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.960
Physician Xiao.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.530
Thank you for your help

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.500
earlier today.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.480
Consort Xie,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.460
the fetus has just formed,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.920
and your pulse is not easy to detect.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.880
I can only help you conceal it

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.590
temporarily.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.200
So it's true.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.510
Although I haven't been
in the Imperial Medical Bureau long,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.470
I know a little about the risks

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.760
of being pregnant in the harem.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.790
I understand your situation,
Your Highness.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.740
Consort Xie, what are you doing?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.540
Please get up.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.730
This...

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.720
Physician Xiao,

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.480
this child

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.860
cannot be kept.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.750
Why?

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.440
Even if the Empress Dowager dislikes it,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.080
you still have His Majesty.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.750
It's precisely because of His Majesty,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.750
I cannot be pregnant

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.480
if I want to survive.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.680
I dare to beg you,

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.390
Physician Xiao, please save me.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:12.960
What?

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.480
She vomited?

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.440
Yes.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.680
The whole palace is talking about it.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.070
Have they found the cause of her vomiting?

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.720
There are all kinds of rumors.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.680
I'm just worried

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:22.920
that Dan's food

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.490
might have been poisoned.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:27.810
Damn.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.800
Then this bowl of mine...

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.370
Forget what I said.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.770
CEO Dan.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.620
CEO Dan.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.510
Come.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.760
Come here.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.130
Xie Yong'er vomited.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.830
Do you know what that means in a drama?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.590
What?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.170
She's pregnant.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.240
She's pregnant?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.400
She...

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.170
Heaven knows,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.490
I never touched her!

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.510
I've been sleeping on the floor
in the study for 2 months.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.880
My whole body hurts!

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.710
Why are you laughing?

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.550
Someone knows perfectly well

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.150
whether I touched her or not.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.410
I was wondering

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.780
why recently every time she sees me,

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.960
she pounces on me like a hungry tiger.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.780
It turns out she wants to find a father

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.320
for her child.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.970
Be careful.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.160
If you hadn't reminded me,
I would have forgotten.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.420
In the original story,

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.480
Xie Yong'er bravely became pregnant

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.310
despite pressure from the Empress Dowager

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.710
and all the other powers.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.650
By the way,

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.400
the child wasn't yours.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.790
This Xiahou Bo...

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.170
I didn't expect him

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.640
to be so...

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.380
-bold.
-Reckless!

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.800
-I really overestimated him!
-I really underestimated him!

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.030
After all, in the original story,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.490
you, the Emperor,
were surrounded by women.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.350
Even if someone accidentally
became pregnant,

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.550
she could cover it up.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.750
But our CEO Dan

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.140
always keeps himself pure

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.540
and never lets anyone

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.310
touch him.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.510
I don't like her.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.710
I never misjudge people.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.060
You are the true gentleman,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.400
a breath of fresh air

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.170
in this bloodthirsty palace.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.420
Whether I'm a gentleman or not

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.330
depends on who I am with.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:03.980
Want some?

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.210
Your Highness,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.880
earlier you ordered us to block the envoys
from entering the city.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.010
Why are you changing your position now

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.550
and supporting the Emperor?

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.200
Yes.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.980
Didn't you say that if the talks succeed,

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.270
the border would be secure

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.960
and the Empress Dowager would use
the opportunity to reclaim military power

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.550
and weaken our side?

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.880
Your Highness, please reconsider.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.480
The ancients said,

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.550
"Plan before you act,

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.580
and know when to stop to gain."

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.750
But they also said,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.160
"A gentleman acts

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.770
according to the situation."

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.400
The Emperor of Yan came under
the pretext of birthday celebration,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.270
with the intention of negotiating.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.750
People only know the Emperor of Yan
to be weak,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.000
trying to survive

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.270
through peace talks.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.920
They don't know

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.700
that while the mantis stalks the cicada,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.960
the oriole is waiting behind.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.450
His Majesty
recently received a secret letter.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.830
Emperor of Yan is hospitable.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.830
I couldn't refuse his hospitality.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.550
I'm afraid I'll have to stay here
for a few days

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.000
and will be late.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.590
Wang Zhao.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.550
This letter

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.670
was written by Concubine Yu.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.290
So who is this Wang Zhao?

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.960
Wang Zhao

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:32.400
is the secret envoy sent by His Majesty.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.870
Could it be

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.430
that these people from Yan

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.190
were invited by the Emperor?

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.270
You're very clever, Mr. Cao.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.070
Our puppet Emperor

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.250
has finally started to resist,

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.510
wanting to challenge the Empress Dowager.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.720
Based on
just one letter from Concubine Yu,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.450
are you going to believe it all?

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.520
Of course not.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.770
Huixiao.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.930
I'm here.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.740
Tell everyone

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.110
about what you discovered

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.110
outside the city.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:02.850
Yes.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.780
I spied on the envoy delegation 30 li

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.980
from the city at night

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.240
and recognized
2 familiar faces in their group.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.300
They were Prince Tu'er's trusted men

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.540
during the war with Yan State.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:15.960
That's strange.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.440
Tu'er has always been
at odds with the Emperor of Yan.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.980
Why would he send his men for peace talks?

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.920
So this envoy delegation

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.200
is a fake.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:42.220
[Capital of Xia]

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.640
As the saying goes,
don't strike someone with a smiling face.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.580
They've traveled so far.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.640
Whether peace talks are possible or not,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.220
turning them away rudely at our gates

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.480
is not how Great Xia treats guests.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.280
That's right.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.830
If word gets out,

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.630
it would be embarrassing.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.200
Yesterday you said
this would disappoint the soldiers.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.590
Why today do you say
it will encourage them?

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.000
No principles.
You are unfit to be a minister.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.800
Your Majesty,

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.640
the Yan people are cunning and
treacherous. We must be cautious.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.170
At most,
we can let them camp outside the city.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.720
They came to congratulate His Majesty

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.540
on his birthday,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.700
yet you make malicious assumptions.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.940
Your Majesty,
you must not listen to such slander!

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.680
I

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.890
am willing to die for my position!

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.050
I too am willing to die for my position!

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.290
I too am willing to die for my position!

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.350
As if you're the only ones willing to die
for your position.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.720
I

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.570
am also willing to die for my position!

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.310
I too am willing to die for my position!

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.650
What are you doing?

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.160
All the civil and military officials
made valid points.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.680
I

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.150
find it difficult to decide.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.770
Brother, what do you think?

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.640
[Peace and Prosperity]

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.720
The Yan State sent envoys to negotiate.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.310
At this auspicious moment,

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.650
we should end the suffering of war

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.750
and celebrate peace.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:20.580
Let it be done!

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.650
[Peace and Prosperity]

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.270
They say the Yan people
have 3 heads and 6 arms,

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.200
but they seem quite ordinary to me.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.870
They do look different from us.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.130
Their eyes are sunken.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.640
Those are the envoys from Yan State?

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640
They are so strong.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.170
Make way!

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.200
Everyone, make way!

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.920
Make way!

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.640
I told you so.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.160
Move aside!

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.290
They really do look different from us.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.640
Look at their beards.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.360
I heard it was Prince Duan

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.960
who suggested His Majesty
welcome the delegation into the city.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.090
You're all useless!

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.840
With so many of you,
you couldn't stop one delegation

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.400
and actually let them
march into the palace with impunity?

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.730
And now I'm expected

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.830
to dress up and entertain them
with food and drink!

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.920
Empress Dowager, please calm your anger!

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.590
Prince Duan suddenly changed his attitude.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.070
We...

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.670
We didn't expect that.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.200
And this time, His Majesty

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.800
abandoned his usual habit
of procrastination

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.830
and approved it right in court.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.630
Your Majesty,

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.440
the guards at the city gate

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.330
are Prince Duan's men.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.600
Almost simultaneously,

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.720
the gate opened

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.110
and the envoy delegation was welcomed in.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.350
If you say His Majesty and Prince Duan
didn't plan this together,

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.810
I simply don't believe it.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.070
You mean...

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.860
Prince Duan

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.200
has joined forces with the Emperor?

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.710
Impossible.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.240
That's absolutely impossible.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.240
Impossible!

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.150
Their resentment runs too deep.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.830
It has reached the point of life or death.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.310
Your Majesty,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.960
I believe

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.050
instead of blindly guessing their motives,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.500
it's better to nip the outcome in the bud.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.240
As the saying goes,
it's better to remove the fire

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.000
from under the pot
than just to pour water on it.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.900
Mr. Mu is right.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.640
These two little brats

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.360
are using all their tricks
to play games with me.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.070
They want peace talks, don't they?

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.840
Fine.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.950
I'll make the peace talks
end in complete disaster!

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.450
Your Highness,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.550
Consort Xie sent a message,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:48.440
saying it's urgent.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.900
Consort Yu has just left the Cold Palace,

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.220
and she's already getting restless.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.710
Women's minds are really troublesome.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.640
The maid who delivered the letter said

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.830
it's about the child.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:11.480
The child?

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.950
Didn't everyone already know about her

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.340
vomiting in the Empress Dowager's chamber?

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.050
This pregnancy can't be hidden anymore.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.720
But it gives us another bargaining chip.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.450
Let the Empress Dowager
and Emperor fight it out.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.880
What's the rush?

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:34.640
[Bo, The Emperor and I were never
intimate. This child cannot be kept.]

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.200
The Emperor and I were never intimate.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.720
[Please help me find a way
to have an abortion. Yong'er]

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.180
This child cannot be kept.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.510
Please help me find a way
to have an abortion.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.510
This Xie Yong'er!

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.150
She kept something this big from me!

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.570
Your Highness, it's me.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:49.630
What is it?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.380
Has the letter to His Highness

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:58.590
been sent?

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.010
Yes, it has.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.400
Physician Xiao is here.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.840
Greetings, Consort Xie.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.590
Physician Xiao,

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.610
didn't you already refuse me yesterday?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.440
Are you here today

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.640
just to mock me?

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.650
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.790
Every step in the Imperial Medical Bureau,
from writing the prescription,

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.640
preparing the medicine, to decocting it,
is carefully recorded.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.770
Each stage is monitored and reviewed.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.440
Abortion medicine
is extremely sensitive in the harem.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.570
Even if I wanted to help,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.370
I simply couldn't.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.520
Physician Xiao,
you made yourself clear yesterday.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.830
Why bother

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.120
repeating yourself?

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.450
Do you truly not want this child,
Your Highness?

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.920
What woman doesn't long to be a mother,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.460
to safely deliver
and raise a healthy child?

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.690
But as someone in the harem...

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.880
I can't even control my own fate,

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.920
let alone a child's.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.570
If he comes into this world

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.930
without being blessed,

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.640
only to become

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.000
a tool in others' power struggles,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.790
to be used,

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.510
bullied, oppressed, and persecuted,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.680
I would rather

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.920
he never existed at all.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.520
Since you have made up your mind,

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.200
I...

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.480
will do my best.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.830
I've prepared two prescriptions overnight.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.470
One for calming nerves and aiding sleep,

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.470
and one for improving circulation.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.200
Looking at each prescription individually,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.860
there's nothing suspicious.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.750
And they're both suitable for

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.410
the condition
I diagnosed you with previously.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:43.270
However, if taken together,

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.000
their effects will conflict

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.600
and become quite similar
to an abortifacient.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440
It's just that...

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.470
What?

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.520
I feel guilty.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:06.350
Although I've repeatedly
adjusted this medicine

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.200
to make it as gentle as possible,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.770
it's still not a conventional method.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.120
It's impossible to avoid

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.720
the physical harm caused by miscarriage.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.220
That's enough.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.270
Physician Xiao,
you're risking yourself to help me.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.270
I'll never forget

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:27.750
your great kindness.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.250
I only hope that one day,

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:30.200
I

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.500
might be of service to you.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:38.900
Your Highness, you don't need to say that.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.540
Your Highness, please rise.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.030
This medicine
must be taken for 3 consecutive days

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.890
to take effect.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.510
During this time,
you must not drink alcohol

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.110
or take any other medicines.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.070
When walking or lying down,

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.870
you must move gently and slowly.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.860
Please follow these instructions
carefully, Your Highness.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.090
It needs three days?

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.659
Can it work any faster?

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.440
Medicines that work immediately
are extremely dangerous.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.300
Your Highness,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.980
you mustn't try them.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.760
Zhang San's Diary.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.710
Dan,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.700
you haven't been to

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.880
the Imperial Study for half a month.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.960
The whole palace is buzzing with gossip,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.190
saying you not only dislike studying,

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.330
but also try every means

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.280
to humiliate your classmates.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.930
What's the reason for this?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.730
If this continues,

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.000
even I won't be able
to back you up anymore.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.820
Who was really humiliating them?

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.670
You should know that better than I do.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.810
Then tell me,

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.990
and I'll stand up for you.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.190
Who else could it be?

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.390
I treat you like my own child!

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:01.630
[To Father]

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.240
Who wrote this?

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.620
Did you write this?

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.150
How dare you write a letter secretly

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.080
to your father
with false accusations against me!

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.280
You disappointed me completely.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.670
Has all my love and care for you

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.470
all these years

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:23.840
been

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:26.840
for nothing?

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.240
Father is the Emperor!

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.510
The Emperor?

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:41.990
He's the Emperor, right?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.690
Go and ask.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.700
In our court and harem,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.750
which Emperor

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.960
has ever really been in charge?

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.920
Child,

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.110
wake up.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.480
I

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.590
won't hide it from you.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.110
In my entire life,

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.490
I've hated many people.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.320
The one I hate most

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.400
is your father.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.560
But...

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.410
he's about to die.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:26.510
You...

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.600
What did you do to him?

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.840
Look.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.350
This little face.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.540
When you're angry,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.400
you look just like your father.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.290
Dan,

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.150
listen to me.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:51.640
If you

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:55.590
don't want to stand with me,

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.340
there are other princes.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.190
No.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.380
I mean other crown princes!

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.210
Mother!

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.270
Mother!

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.240
I was wrong!

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.130
I've been unfilial!

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.800
I've failed your kindness.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.660
I beg you for mercy

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.880
and spare my life!

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.420
Alright.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.400
If you know you're wrong,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:37.280
just don't do it again.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.320
But Dan,

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.510
let me remind you,

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.630
don't try

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.860
to go against me.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.110
You haven't even seen

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.630
the love I have for you yet.
