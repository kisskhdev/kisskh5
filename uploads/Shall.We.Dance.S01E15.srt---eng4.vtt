00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.899
Your Majesty, the fake

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.979
(Shangguan Qing)
Yanbo Parlor is nearly finished.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.539
Famed court performers and folk artists

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.899
from across the realm
have all taken residence there.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.739
We await only
Your Majesty's honoured visit.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.699
Excellent.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.899
That is truly joyous news.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.299
All my ministers
shall attend my Yanbo Parlor

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.900
and partake in the festivities.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.580
Shangguan Qing, how dare you.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.299
Do you not realise this court

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.380
is where state affairs are deliberated?

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.699
And yet you bring

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.779
such entertainers into court.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.939
This is outrageous!

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.299
Minister He,
do not fault Shangguan Qing.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.899
This was my doing.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.699
I...

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.379
also wished my ministers to see

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.739
where the treasury silver

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.579
has been spent.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.980
I want you all to relax a little

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.860
and judge whether it was worth it.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.180
Shangguan Qing.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.580
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.500
Rise.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.300
Splendid!

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.900
General Xiang Gu
returns victorious to court.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.100
(General Xiang Gu)
Xiang Gu, at your service.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.620
Welcome back, General Xiang.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.940
Perfect timing.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.139
I've arranged a new dance today.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.900
Come and enjoy it with us.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.980
Your Majesty,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.419
General Xiang

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.499
has campaigned
in the Southern Seas for years

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.939
and commands great prestige.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.379
Now that unrest stirs at the frontier,

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.259
it would be fitting
to have him lead the expedition

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.820
to subdue the barbarians.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.379
(So the force)

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.380
(blocking my contact
with the foreign powers...)

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.540
(was them all along?)

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.099
Minister He,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.939
General Xiang is advanced in years.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.099
He has just returned,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.140
and has yet
to enjoy time with his family.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.899
How can you still urge His Majesty

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.779
to send him back to war?

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.899
In my view,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.259
Your Majesty should instead
grant him further honours and rank,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.579
so that he may

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.540
remain in the capital
and enjoy family life.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.339
Minister Sun, that is mistaken.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.819
Soldiers at the frontier
exist to serve the realm.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.420
Even death
on the battlefield is no cause for fear.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.379
Your Majesty,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.299
I am willing to lead the campaign

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.699
and pacify the frontier.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.699
Good.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.699
Great Qian

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.699
needs loyal generals like you

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.380
true pillars of the realm.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.980
General Xiang,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.060
you haven't returned home in ten years.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.180
Do you not wish to go back?

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.019
Director Jia

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.140
and Minister Sun are
behaving rather strangely.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.779
No need to increase military spending,

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.580
and yet frontier forces
would still be reinforced.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.939
But the two of you

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.300
seem oddly reluctant.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.780
Could it be

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.700
you have other thoughts?

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.139
We wouldn't dare.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.659
Minister He, you misunderstood.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.779
I am only concerned

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.180
for General Xiang's health.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.740
Your Majesty,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.459
as the old saying goes,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.299
a gentleman settles his household
before serving his cause.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.339
General Xiang's granddaughter
has now come of age

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.859
and awaits marriage.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.859
And Your Majesty happens

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.820
to lack an empress.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.460
Minister He is right.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.660
But with the frontier unsettled,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.419
I have no mind to take a wife.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.619
Your Majesty,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.099
you have governed
in your own right for over half a year,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.699
yet the harem remains empty.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.980
That is a grave matter
for the royal bloodline.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.179
If Your Majesty is
unwilling to appoint an empress,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.099
then perhaps you could
announce the identity

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.419
of the woman you once mentioned.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.219
The Ministry of Rites can
make the arrangements.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.540
Elevating her as a consort
would not be improper.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.979
This again.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.259
I've already said

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.220
the time isn't right.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.220
Besides...

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.140
a woman such as her

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.540
could only ever be my empress.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.099
Your Majesty,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.939
what could be the reason?

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.179
Rumours are already
spreading among the people.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.099
You must consider
the dignity of the royal family.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.259
What rumours?

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.219
Well...

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.460
It's...

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.899
They involve
Your Majesty and a eunuch.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.379
The words are too disgraceful.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.939
I cannot bring myself to say them.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.859
I beg Your Majesty to take consorts
and appoint an empress,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.220
so that Great Qian's lineage
may continue.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.019
Minister He,

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.260
please rise.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.859
We beg Your Majesty to
take consorts and appoint an Empress,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.180
for the continuation
of Great Qian's royal bloodline.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.459
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.339
For the sake of succession.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.019
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.980
For the sake of succession.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.659
I can't hear you.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.180
Louder.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.979
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.900
For the sake of succession.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.180
Louder.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.139
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.860
For the sake of succession.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.019
Louder.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.459
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.140
For the sake of succession.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.979
Louder still.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.539
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.340
For the sake of succession.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.339
Louder. I said louder.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.779
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.420
For the sake of succession.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.659
Louder.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.339
Your Majesty, reconsider.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.220
For the sake of succession.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.380
Enough.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.820
I've had my fill of dancing today.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.739
If this matter is raised again,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.940
I'll have all of you dance with me.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.419
My marriage

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.820
is mine to decide.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.060
No one is to interfere.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.420
Court dismissed.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.059
Your Majesty was rather impulsive

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.300
in court today.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.620
If they keep pressing me,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.860
I'll deal with them the same way.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.300
They say serving
an emperor is like serving a tiger.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.339
But with our young emperor,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.180
it's like serving a dance partner.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.739
They say a tiger's tail
must never be touched.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.820
But our young emperor's tail

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.099
is

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.220
love.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.059
Aunt, please don't tease me.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.340
I think you did the right thing.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.939
The Chu bloodline has
always been passionate.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.420
We value love as much as the realm.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.820
Let's discuss serious matters.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.300
Serious matters?

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.299
Duan Muzhi.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.139
Yes.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.059
Have the men
sent to investigate Sun Gong

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.660
reported back?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.939
Your Highness,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.339
nothing suspicious has been found

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.980
about his background.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.820
You and Uncle have
shared a loving marriage for years.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.660
What is sincere and what is false

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.820
can't possibly

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.020
escape your perceptive eyes.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.700
Speaking of perceptiveness,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.459
I fear

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.460
I'm no match for you, Your Majesty.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.619
Ever since I learned dancing from you,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.459
I haven't been
able to stop for a moment.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.419
Had I known,

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.739
I should have joined

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.580
His Majesty in dancing at court.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.340
Serious matters.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.500
Serious matters.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.300
Alright.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.659
As for General Xiang,

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.179
he is a man of the battlefield, but his loyalty
to the royal family is unquestionable.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.180
He was trusted by my brother.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.659
When the Zhen clan was
condemned for treason,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.699
he carried out the decree

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.660
without hesitation.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.339
He led the troops

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.540
to execute them.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.540
I know you wish to investigate
the Xiao family case.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.260
So do I.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.020
But now is not the time.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.499
Our priority is to use Xiang Gu

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.860
to check Jia Yi's armed ambitions.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.620
And prevent
the capital's calamity from years ago.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.100
General Xiang,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.820
take a look.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.300
Every year,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.939
Jia Yi finds high-sounding excuses

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.299
to divert military funds.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.100
This year, he even urged His Majesty
to build a replica Yanbo Parlor,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.179
and recruited famed
performers into the palace.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.260
If enemies were to strike one day,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.380
what would become of us then?

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.260
That cursed Sun Gong

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.099
has likely taken Jia Yi's favors,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.660
and turned a blind eye.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.820
However,

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.220
with the Grand Princess
overseeing things,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.099
Sun Gong appears clean-handed,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.620
with nothing suspicious for now.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.580
But there is one matter.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.219
Doesn't it strike you

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.660
that the eunuch
serving His Majesty called Xiao Man

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.780
looks rather familiar?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.260
He resembles someone from the past.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.580
A mere eunuch.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.140
I barely noticed him.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.780
Who does he resemble?

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.260
Xiao Congrong.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.660
General Xiang,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.700
your returned at the right time.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.299
We should act at once,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.259
and join the court
in curbing the eunuchs' power

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.940
to stop Jia Yi's excesses.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.220
Curb my power?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.979
You think to obstruct
our dealings with foreign powers

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.140
and our plan
to overthrow the Chu regime?

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.740
Wishful thinking.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.259
We must move faster

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.780
and finish this soon.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.779
Uncle.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.659
Brother.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.419
If all our actions

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.259
only clear Father and Mother's names,

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.299
what then?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.860
Must we drag so many others into this?

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.860
Many veteran officials were involved.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.539
Are you certain His Majesty can shake

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.859
their hold over the court

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.340
and clear your name?

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.340
Sister,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.739
do not speak of

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.700
clearing names again.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.899
Such things mean nothing to the dead.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.380
Brother,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.539
if we follow Uncle's plan,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.779
countless innocent people will die.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.060
Zhen Mujun!

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.819
Your father and mother

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.419
gave their lives
in service to Great Qian.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.220
And what did they receive in return?

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.619
Because of that tyrant's suspicion,

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.419
one hundred and eight lives
of the Xiao family

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.300
were all cut down.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.619
Tell me,

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.980
if the case were overturned,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.659
would my brother and his wife,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.699
your parents,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.380
and your family come back to life?

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.699
Why should that tyrant
decide who lives or dies,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.420
and when he regrets it,

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.900
he can simply brush it aside?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.260
I will never accept such an outcome.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.620
And neither should you.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.660
Xiao Man,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.780
my heart aches.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.819
As though there is a wound

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.540
that never stops festering.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.620
I've endured
this pain for twenty years,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.220
twenty long years.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.980
I can bear it no longer.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.860
Clearing names

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.060
won't bring the dead back.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.140
What I want

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.980
is the old emperor's
bloodline and his throne.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.700
I want him to pay
for the lives he murdered!
