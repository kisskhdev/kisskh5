00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.259
Your Majesty.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.180
Why did you end up
sleeping on the floor?

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.859
Get up now.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.140
You will catch a chill.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.860
Xiao Man.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.699
You may return for now.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.860
I will change by myself today.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.700
I will leave.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.780
(So it was a dream.)

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.259
Your Majesty.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.660
Your Highness.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.699
Regarding the pacification of the Southern Sea,
our army has won a decisive victory.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.380
It can now be said that...

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Your Majesty.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.179
I wonder
what Your Majesty thinks of this.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.459
Why would I have such a strange dream?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.300
Your Majesty.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.140
Your Majesty.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.420
Your Majesty.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.859
Ah?

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.980
Ah...

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.219
With the Grand Princess
handling it this way,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.259
I find it inappropriate.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.179
Enough.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.460
I am tired today as well.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.100
That will be all.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.379
Thank you, Aunt.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.500
Then...

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.740
I will go play cuju.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.859
If there is nothing else,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.100
you may all disperse.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.859
Xiao Man.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.619
Let us go.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.620
Yes.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.340
We respectfully see Your Majesty off.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.900
What are you doing?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.899
Your Majesty.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.579
That was the cup I was just using.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.819
I know.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.260
I do not mind.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.540
But you mind me?

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.259
I do not mind you.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.539
You mind me.
Xiao Man, you have changed.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.459
I have not.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.620
Then take a sip.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.980
Which way are you turning it?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.980
Drink.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.220
All right, then.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.139
That is more like it.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.580
Listen, Xiao Man.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.699
Between brothers,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.980
we should never look down on each other.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.219
Your Majesty.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.620
Have you finished reading the memorials?

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.780
Not yet.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.059
Then let us continue.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.180
All right.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.980
(Why do I keep staring at him?)

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.900
Well...

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.060
Xiao Man.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.340
How about today

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.900
you take the memorials back
and review them yourself?

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.540
I want to rest for a while.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.420
All right.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.420
I will leave.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.419
(What is wrong with me?)

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.420
(Why does everything feel strange?)

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.340
(Why is that?)

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.540
Your Majesty.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.100
I am coming in.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.260
Come in.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.920
I am Duanmu Zhi, heir to the Duke of Ying,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.299
formerly a sixth-rank commander
of the Eastern City Garrison,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.280
(Duanmu Zhi)
now a fourth-rank blade-bearing guard

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.859
at Your Majesty's side.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.859
I pay my respects

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.779
to Your Majesty.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.299
All right.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.059
Keep it simple.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.259
Keep it simple when you speak
to me from now on.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.059
Yes.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.819
Recently,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.819
I have investigated
the movements of court officials.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.220
Please have a look, Your Majesty.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.260
Not bad.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.859
You are quite capable.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.939
What else?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.960
I have also verified

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.680
the background of Your Majesty's
newly appointed scribe eunuch, Xiao Man,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.019
over the past ten years.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.260
Please review it, Your Majesty.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.700
Who told you to investigate him?

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.219
Why are you not saying anything?

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.819
Ever since Xiao Man entered the palace,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.860
it feels like Your Majesty treats him
far better than you treat me.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.739
How could you compare yourself to him?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.480
Xiao Man is my closest friend
since childhood.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.240
I have been waiting
for him to return to the palace.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.300
I...

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.460
All right.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.980
I am just a minor official.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.700
He is your dear friend.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.980
Then is that still the case now?

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.619
Shall we dance together again tomorrow?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.780
Woof.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.060
When Xiao Man left back then,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.460
he was as clear and pure as water.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.300
Now that he has returned,
he is like an iceberg,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.139
with fire hidden deep within.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.540
Impossible to fathom.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.460
Whenever I try to draw closer to him,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.300
I am afraid of getting hurt.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.699
I truly cannot imagine

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.700
how he lived through those ten years.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.379
Why has Your Majesty come here?

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.500
Xiao Man.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.660
I want you to accompany me for a walk.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.580
Your Majesty.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.339
It is already a quarter past midnight.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.220
You still have morning court tomorrow.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.300
You are finding fault with me again.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.300
The night is deep and the dew is heavy.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.059
Xiao Man is only concerned
for Your Majesty's health.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.819
After all,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.259
the Emperor's well-being
is a matter of the state.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.940
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.300
I want you to stay with me.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.699
This is the palace hall

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.460
where my mother and I once hid together.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.120
My mother was originally
the daughter of a wealthy border family.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.780
When she was sixteen,
turmoil broke out along the frontier.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.580
She was saved by General Xiao Congrong.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.060
Later, she was brought back to the palace
and became a palace maid.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.420
When she was eighteen,
she was favored by the Emperor

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.620
and she secretly gave birth to me.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.939
If I had been discovered back then,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.300
I would not have survived.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.340
She took me with her,
hiding from place to place.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.820
It was Eunuch Li and the palace eunuchs
and maids who saved me.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.100
I beg you.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.699
Please do not kill my son.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.780
He is my only family left in this world.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.820
Do not blame me.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.020
I was only carrying out
the Consort's orders.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.140
He is also His Majesty's only bloodline.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.980
I beg you, Eunuch Li.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.740
Make sure the child does not cry.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.579
You mother and son will hide here.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.380
I will bring you food.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.259
I will report to the Consort

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.380
that the child has
already been dealt with.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.620
As for whether he survives,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.020
that will depend
on the young prince's fate.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.339
The eunuchs and maids

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.100
all silently chose not to report it.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.860
They even secretly brought us food.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.660
And so,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.500
my mother and I lived
in an abandoned palace

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.260
for six years.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.780
Later, the Emperor fell gravely ill.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.020
Eunuch Li risked his life
to let him know I existed.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.420
You may come out now.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.179
I have already reported to His Majesty

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.100
the existence of the young prince.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.100
His Majesty wishes to see him.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.060
You mother and son

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.020
may finally step into the light again.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.980
When my origins
were revealed to the world,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.500
my mother sensed that her end was near.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.660
My child,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.420
this is as far as I can walk with you.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.980
The road ahead,

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.620
you must walk it on your own.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.100
Remember this.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.660
One must bear
responsibility in this life.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.540
And remain true to one's own heart.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.180
I

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.420
will always be watching over you.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.380
I

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.220
will love you forever.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.620
Thank you, Mother.

00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:52.195
♪I wanted to ask you
the meaning of forever♪

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.720
