00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.079
Division Commander, we're just waiting for your order.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.000
We'll launch a full-scale attack immediately.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.200
And wipe out that guy named Wei.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.519
Don't be so rash.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.200
He dared to hijack our munitions.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.599
He's so carried away with himself.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:43.319
How can we just give him a warning?

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:46.439
Although Commander Wei's strength is not worth mentioning,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.000
his existence must have its reason.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.480
He is a pawn that Chen uses to check me.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.439
If Division Commander Chen finds out

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.799
that I'm attacking Commander Wei with full force,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.760
won't he send reinforcements?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.400
Report!

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:02.879
Telegram received.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.439
Commander Wei's youngest uncle has died.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.680
He died at quite a convenient time.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.039
My condolences.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.120
It's very kind of you, Commander Liao.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.879
Please.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.800
I heard Commander Liao plans to send troops against me.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.039
No fighting during planting or harvesting.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.439
No fighting during festivals or holidays.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.039
No fighting in the crop fields.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.680
No fighting during weddings or funerals.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.879
Sending troops now would be unethical.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.400
Rest assured.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.800
We all understand the Four No-Fight Rules.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.800
Our Division Commander won't take advantage of misfortune.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.879
Once the old gentleman is buried,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.159
look,

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.199
should I continue to send troops,

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.759
or will you return my things to me?

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.919
Commander Liao,

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.840
there might be a misunderstanding here.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.120
I fell into that Division Commander Chen's trap.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960
That Colonel under me, Fan Pengju,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.960
used my banner

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.240
to hijack your munitions.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.199
In the end, he handed it all over to Division Commander Chen.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.240
He even became a Brigade Commander over there.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.080
You see,

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.479
this was clearly planned, a conspiracy.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.759
They were in cahoots long ago.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.120
I also received news.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.199
I heard that fat son of yours

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.400
is now in Division Commander Chen's hands.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.919
I wouldn't joke about such things.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.080
It is absolutely true.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:48.479
Always causing me trouble.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.919
If Commander Liao wants to send troops,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.560
I am willing to lend you a hand.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.639
That fellow Chen

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.360
made me offend you for no reason.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.960
I lost a regiment,

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.280
and took the blame for such a big mess.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.240
This anger,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.520
I cannot swallow it.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.479
Then wait for my military order.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.800
So we're allied with Commander Liao now?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.360
So we're going to ally with Commander Wei?

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.079
I don't need his few weak soldiers.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.199
Telling me to wait for his military order...

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.360
Is he treating me as an ally,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.680
or treating me like his foot soldier?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.279
Your Old man knows you're here,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.480
and sent troops to attack Division Commander Chen to save you.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.759
How many men did he send?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.439
Is it the entire army?

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.800
I don't know that yet.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:50.279
If it's not the entire army,

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.879
then it's not necessarily to save me.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:56.199
He and Division Commander Chen have always been at odds.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.000
When your Old man sends troops,

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.040
Division Commander Chen will send me

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.560
to launch a surprise attack on his base.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.240
You'll come with me then.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:09.920
Where are we going?

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.399
I'll take a detour to intercept Commander Liao,

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.439
and return you to him.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.319
That way, we can avoid a battle.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.720
Let them fight.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:19.480
I want to see

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:21.720
if he's really coming to save me.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.800
You know many people die in a battle.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.920
If I return you,

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.360
your father won't have a reason to send troops.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.079
You're even more naive than I am.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.319
If Division Commander Chen didn't want to fight,

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.439
he would have sent me back himself.

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:46.000
Would he need you to worry about it here?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.360
You...

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.879
aren't you worried about your Old man at all?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.120
I still have that much confidence in him.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.160
He's good at fighting.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.120
Reporting, Division Commander.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.120
Commander Wei says...

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.600
just when his youngest uncle was about to be buried,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.000
they found the feng shui of the ancestral grave had changed.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.160
They have to relocate the grave.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.519
So he won't be coming here to meet up.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.839
He said he will lead his troops

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.959
to support us on the battlefield.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.240
Continue reconnaissance.

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:28.079
Support, my ass.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.399
He clearly just wants a free ride.

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.279
I never counted on him anyway.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.600
I'm deploying the whole army.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.600
The plan is to finish off Chen's forces first,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.839
then swallow up Wei's forces directly.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.879
It doesn't matter if he comes or not.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.759
Move out.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.879
Yes, sir.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.360
How is it?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.079
Nothing, nothing.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:45.680
There's not a single person.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.120
Did you look clearly?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.360
How about you?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.959
None.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.279
Let's go.

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:51.720
Big Brother.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.160
Not even a ghost's shadow.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.879
Come in, quick.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.000
It's very safe.

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.560
They've turned out in full force.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.600
Gone to fight for their lives.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.279
And he said his Old man didn't care about him.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.439
Hurry up.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:07.279
This is too abnormal. Don't go in yet.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.399
It's fine.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.959
We completed the mission without wasting a single soldier.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.160
Division Commander, are we really going to fight?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.439
He betrayed me so easily.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.040
We must do what is necessary.

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:19.920
Teach him a lesson.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.560
Alright.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.759
Who's there?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.120
Scarface.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.920
Prepare to counterattack.

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:52.959
What?

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.480
Prepare to counterattack.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.560
I can't hear you.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.079
I told you not to come in.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.519
Now we're trapped like dogs.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.240
Shut your jinxed mouth.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.680
It definitely wasn't Commander Liao.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:08.160
No matter who is ambushing me...

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.160
Xuanjizi.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.519
Prepare to counterattack.

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:12.720
Prepare to counterattack.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.680
Brigade Commander Fan.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.160
It's me.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.600
Misunderstanding.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.240
Don't shoot.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:23.759
Is that Commander Wei?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.959
That's right.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.040
I thought you were Commander Liao.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.279
You're here to fight Commander Liao?

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:33.439
Yes.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.600
Aren't you allied with Commander Liao?

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.960
That was me and Division Commander Chen...

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.480
...putting out false information.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:43.000
Division Commander Chen is my real ally.

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:45.120
The two of us are partners.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.799
Darn it.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.840
Stop the attack.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:22.080
Division Commander, there might be an ambush.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:27.639
Division Commander Chen, you old turtle.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.519
Still hiding?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.559
This battle is a guaranteed victory.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.960
No need to trouble our Division Commander Chen.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.759
Who the hell are you?

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:45.320
My surname is Huo.

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:47.279
I am Division Commander Chen's Staff Officer.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.600
Once we defeat Commander Liao,

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.759
this will be the battle that makes my name.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.480
A mere Staff Officer.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.120
Such big talk.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.559
Whether the talk is big or not,

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.519
try me and you'll find out.

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:09.600
Hoist him up.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:14.039
Yes, Young Master.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.960
Don't panic.

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:20.120
Shout.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.360
Shout.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.600
Who told you to shout 'Ouch'?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.000
Told you to shout for your Old man to come save you.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.120
Old man, come save me!

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.960
Save me!

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:37.600
Why don't we take a gamble?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.120
I cannot gamble with my soldiers' lives.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:41.360
Even if there is an ambush,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.559
give me one company,

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:44.080
and I'll pile up bodies to get in.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.720
All forces, fall back one li.

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:46.480
Set up camp.

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:48.480
That son of a bitch.

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:50.639
Using my son as bait.

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:52.080
It's simply despicable.

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:53.960
Retreat.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.399
Yes, sir.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.879
Commander Liao is a coward too.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.759
He's giving up on you just like that.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.559
You guys should negotiate, just go through the motions.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.159
At least tell him not to hit me.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.919
It hurts so much.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.960
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm just afraid of pain!

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:25.639
Brother Fan took my munitions

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.200
and went to join Division Commander Chen.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.639
Your betrayal

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.480
was to make Commander Liao believe

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.399
that the alliance between Division Commander Chen and me

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:33.759
was at a crucial breaking point.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.519
So, you actually deserve credit.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.120
I was thinking,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.279
if Brother Fan had been loyal to me back then,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.360
and refused to steal the munitions,

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.720
I really wouldn't have known what to do.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.360
I also took to heart

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.080
Commander Wei's teachings.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.159
Once you put on the uniform,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.639
there is no more brotherhood.

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:55.679
I know.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.240
This time Division Commander Chen sent you

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.799
to raid Commander Liao's base.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:01.000
I was afraid Commander Liao might have a backup plan.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.200
That is why

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.679
I specifically called my brothers

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.519
to come and lend you a hand.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:08.879
Thank you, Commander Wei.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.240
You and I are brothers, brothers for life.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.360
No need to be polite.

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:14.000
Commander Wei, when

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.960
you couldn't distinguish friend from foe,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.200
you rashly opened fire.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.639
Wasn't that a bit too reckless?

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.000
Xuanjizi.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.200
You have the nerve to stand up and lecture me?

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.600
You are the one who disappointed me the most.

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:29.519
Commander Wei, as a general,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.159
if you want to win people's hearts,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.320
you need to show some real skill.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.720
Rebels are rebels.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.039
And you think you're justified?

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:39.399
Alright, alright.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.799
Everyone stop arguing.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.519
We are allies again now.

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:44.879
My rank is the same as Division Commander Chen's.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:47.480
Now Brother Fan must follow my command.

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:49.600
I presume Commander Liao and Division Commander Chen

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600
have already engaged in battle.

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:52.200
I now order

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.159
Brigade Commander Fan,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.159
lead your troops,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.440
march at double speed,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.519
and reinforce Division Commander Chen.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.159
You just retreated like that?

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.399
Division Commander

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.960
That Commander Liao

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.399
he is a cunning old fox.

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:22.679
We used his son as bait

00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:23.639
but he didn't fall for it.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.039
You tie a child up on the battlefield

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:32.840
isn't he just our bargaining chip?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.000
He can be our hostage

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.720
but you can't let a child

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.639
go block the muzzle.

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:39.159
Yes, sir.

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:49.720
At that time, Liao's army

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.039
didn't enter the ambush circle.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.679
And my reinforcements hadn't arrived.

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:54.720
If we had acted rashly,

00:13:55.159 --> 00:13:57.519
I fear it would have been a senseless sacrifice.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.639
Exactly.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.919
Then what if Liao's army attacks now?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.360
Don't worry, Division Commander.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.759
If one plan fails, we have another.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.039
What did you call us here for?

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.080
I haven't even fed my chickens at home.

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:15.360
We aren't soldiers.

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:17.840
Why call us to the battlefield?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.600
That's right.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.000
There won't be bullets flying, right?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.159
Stop talking, move faster.

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:23.519
What is going on here?

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.320
Hurry up.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.519
To resist Liao's army, we're reinforcing fortifications.

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:31.399
First a little child,

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:33.200
now common folk.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:34.519
Staff Officer Huo

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.360
you really have opened my eyes.

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:38.840
I know

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.960
this doesn't fit Division Commander Chen's usual style.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.559
But what if Commander Liao doesn't care?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.840
What do we do then?

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:47.840
Then that's perfect.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.759
Using their lives

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.679
will add to Commander Liao's crimes.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:56.600
If Division Commander Chen has a better way,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.279
your subordinate will certainly obey.

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:02.320
Staff Officer Huo

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:04.799
thank you for your trouble.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:09.440
This guy named Huo

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.960
is simply unfit to be a soldier.

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:13.840
Division Commander

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.320
Sacrifice on the battlefield is inevitable.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.080
You can't bear to sacrifice soldiers,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.679
you can't bear to sacrifice civilians.

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:22.600
Then are you willing to sacrifice the Young Master?

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:25.519
If we can't find a breakthrough, we wait.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.200
Wait for the opponent to make a mistake first.

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:28.279
Report!

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:31.360
Wei's vanguard is one kilometer behind us.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.360
The allied forces have arrived.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.360
Report!

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.559
Wei's army has stopped marching.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:37.399
At our army's

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:39.320
return route, they are building fortifications.

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:41.799
Something's wrong.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:44.039
They've sandwiched us in the middle.

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:49.759
I never expected him to help anyway.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.320
I didn't expect him to turn the tables on me.

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:55.000
I was careless.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.519
Commander Liao

00:15:58.559 --> 00:15:59.840
Commander Liao

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.480
Commander Liao

00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:06.559
I've arrived so late,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.600
yet you've made no progress at all.

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:10.360
I thought you were so formidable.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.519
It's simply too disappointing.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.960
I fell for your trap, I admit it.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.360
Would you do me the honor of speaking at the front?

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:20.639
Still talking tough.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.720
Let's see what tricks you're playing.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.759
Brigade Commander Fan

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.720
I always think of you when there's something good.

00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:35.240
Come on, let's go together.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.879
Father and son soldiers in battle,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.600
brothers by blood in a fight.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:43.799
Scarface

00:16:58.679 --> 00:16:59.519
Commander Liao

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.919
The situation is already very clear.

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:04.639
As the saying goes, a wise man submits to circumstances.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:07.080
You shouldn't fight a lone battle,

00:17:07.399 --> 00:17:08.840
stubbornly holding out here.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.680
Although we belong to different camps,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.440
we agreed beforehand never to harm the innocent.

00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:14.960
This has also been the tacit understanding

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.319
between our three armies all along.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.759
Commander Chen's army exploits the weak, violating our principles.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.000
I hope you won't associate with his kind.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.279
The weak?

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.000
What does that mean?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.759
Why don't I understand?

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:28.839
Division Commander Chen used our Young Master as bait

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.400
and used civilians as human shields.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.799
If that weren't the case,

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:33.799
how could he be a match for us?

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:37.839
Acting like this

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.039
is worse than bandits.

00:17:40.839 --> 00:17:41.640
Commander Wei,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.400
I'll give you two choices.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.960
Either join forces with me,

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:47.640
or go convince Division Commander Chen.

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.480
After releasing my son and evacuating the civilians,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.440
however you want to fight,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.000
I, Liao, will fight you to the end.

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:52.799
I agree.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.359
What do you mean you agree?

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.400
No matter which one you choose,

00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:58.519
you can't harm the innocent.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.400
In war,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.519
to win,

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:04.079
using some stratagems is quite normal.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.200
Not all stratagems in the art of war

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.920
are gentlemanly tactics.

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:11.319
It seems your Chen and Wei armies

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:12.759
really are two of a kind,

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.240
sharing the same vile ambitions.

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:16.799
Commander Liao,

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.519
if you can't win the battle,

00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:21.440
don't stand there sourly talking nonsense.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.519
I...

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:32.000
have a suggestion.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.039
Let's all sit down,

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:36.440
have some hotpot,

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:37.559
play some mahjong,

00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:38.960
and get together

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:41.200
to talk this out clearly. How about it?

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:42.960
Like hell we will!

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:45.200
We finally have a bit of an advantage.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.400
Whose side are you on right now?

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:49.759
I stand on the side of justice.

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:51.119
Fighting wars, you know,

00:18:51.319 --> 00:18:52.359
wastes money and hurts the people.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.640
If we can avoid it, we should.

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:56.799
Avoid it my ass!

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.160
What we need right now

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.680
is the momentum to pursue victory.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.240
And here you are deflating morale.

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:03.880
Watch out or I'll charge you with shaking military morale.

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:08.680
Do you really think I'm your soldier?

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:10.640
You need to get this straight.

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:13.319
I looked down on you back then,

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.240
that's why I left.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.119
You disobeyed military orders and defected in battle!

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:17.559
I...

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:18.240
Don't move!

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.359
Put them down!

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:25.079
Wei,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.319
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:29.720
I disobeyed military orders?

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.359
My brothers,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.880
are you going to disobey my military orders too?

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.039
Let me tell you,

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:39.039
we two are sworn brothers.

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:40.640
Commander Liao's son

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:42.799
is also my sworn brother.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.680
His old man

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.720
is our old man too.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.519
Old man,

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:51.160
please trust me.

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.240
Fine.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.440
I'll take this gamble.

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:05.880
Big Brother, please.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.920
Commanders, please.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.079
Aren't we here to talk business?

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:26.799
Why come to such a seedy place?

00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:32.920
Welcome, gentlemen! Welcome, welcome!

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.039
Boss Wei, you haven't been here in a long time.

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:39.000
Are you opening that bottle of yours today?

00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:39.839
You've got the wrong person.

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:41.079
I've never even been here.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.079
Girls!

00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:45.359
Hello, gentlemen.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.839
My name is Straw Mushroom.

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:48.400
My name is Bamboo Mushroom.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.680
My name is Shiitake.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.680
My name is Termite Mushroom.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.519
Commander Liao, pick one.

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:56.240
No, no.

00:20:57.079 --> 00:20:57.920
Division Commander Chen.

00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:03.799
Commander Wei.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.200
It seems they aren't satisfied.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.720
Bring in the next batch.

00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:15.240
Have fun, gentlemen.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.680
Hurry up now.

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:19.200
Here, here, here.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.480
Come on, brother, have a drink.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.559
For you, for you.

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:27.000
Treating us to wine and women at a time like this?

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.160
It's inappropriate.

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:30.000
Indeed.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.720
We are at war with each other.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.119
Pulling these stunts...

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.480
...is simply treating it like a joke.

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:38.079
Holding girls...

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.720
...is surely better than holding guns while talking.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.000
Exactly.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.839
Brigade Commander Fan.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:44.960
What gives you the right to arrange things for the Division Commanders?

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.519
Have you forgotten your own status?

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:50.000
Fine.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.599
Today I'll speak with the status of a "half".

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.960
To say a few words.

00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:00.960
Right now, it's...

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.119
...you two plus my half...

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.000
...attacking this one together.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.119
This one...

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.359
...is just meat on the chopping block.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.799
At the mercy of others.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240
But today...

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:17.240
...I've recognized this one as my Old man.

00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:21.119
According to ethics, according to custom...

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:22.440
According to anything...

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.799
...how can a son go and beat up his Old man?

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.359
Then you can withdraw.

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:28.000
It won't make much difference anyway.

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:30.240
After I withdraw...

00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:31.599
...I plan to attack you.

00:22:34.839 --> 00:22:35.720
Why?

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:37.480
In a fight...

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.599
...there must be fairness.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.400
Two against one...

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.200
...is just bullying.

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:48.119
How about this, Division Commander Chen...

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.359
...you and Commander Liao fight it out.

00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:52.920
My half...

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.240
...will fight against you.

00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:58.480
I won't be afraid of you either.

00:22:58.839 --> 00:22:59.519
We...

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:01.640
...won't interfere with each other.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.759
Then what the hell are we fighting for?

00:23:04.599 --> 00:23:06.119
These soldiers...

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:09.000
...are all raised by ourselves.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:12.759
Who would be willing to let...

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:15.319
...their own soldiers die for nothing?

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.240
I mainly want...

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.200
...to use the minimum loss...

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:20.640
...to let the three Division Commanders...

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.200
...turn hostility into friendship.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.240
Dogs are raised to guard doors, soldiers are raised to fight wars.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.759
Once a soldier, one must be prepared to sacrifice.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.839
If they die on the battlefield...

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:33.200
...that's just their tough luck.

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:40.160
Tell me,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.319
how can we reduce losses

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:44.759
and still determine a winner?

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.440
Like eating noodles with one chopstick.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.680
A duel.

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:51.599
So cool.

00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:52.400
Rise up! Rise up!

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.440
I believe in you.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.400
Come on! Win this and I'll reward you.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.079
You do your best too.

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:58.240
Actually,

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:01.880
it's just Commander Liao wanting his son,

00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:05.359
and Division Commander Chen using Commander Liao's son

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:06.839
to trade for some territory.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.039
That's all there is to it.

00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:13.119
Do you take me for a decoration?

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:15.720
You're in cahoots with Division Commander Chen.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.519
If he gets it, you're set.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.279
Actually, everyone

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.680
has their own agenda.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.359
Why send

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:28.960
thousands of soldiers to their deaths?

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.759
If you're men,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.079
you should settle it yourselves.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.799
That's easy for you to say.

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:38.160
Our Division Commander Chen is a scholar.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.039
You're clearly just bullying him.

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:52.880
I'll do it.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.559
I can't stand watching this either.

00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:58.359
Liao Guanguan.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.519
Come on.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:01.599
Let the two of us have a go.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.119
Is this the idea you gave the Old man?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.640
Old man,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.599
I believe in your strength.

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:14.400
For the sake of your son,

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:15.720
my brother,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.119
I'll definitely back you up.

00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:22.079
I now announce

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.799
the ultimate showdown:

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:26.440
Pole wrestling.

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:28.279
Get ready to start.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.000
If Liao's side wins,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.640
the Chen-Wei side

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.200
will unconditionally return Young Master Liao.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.039
If the Chen-Wei side wins,

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:38.799
Liao's side will give up three towns

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:40.559
in exchange for Young Master Liao.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.359
Crossing the line or leaving the carpet is a loss.

00:25:48.599 --> 00:25:49.480
Hands on.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.759
Ready.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.039
Begin!

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.519
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.920
Come on, Commander Liao!

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.599
Come on, Commander Wei!

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.079
Division Commander Chen, are we just watching them fight?

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.079
Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.799
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.079
Commander Liao wins.

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:47.039
Good, good.

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:50.440
According to our agreement,

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.319
the Chen and Wei side must unconditionally

00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:54.599
return Young Master Liao.

00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:59.279
It seems I never agreed from the start

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.400
to this absurd proposal of yours.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.279
Division Commander Chen,

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.319
if word of this gets out,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.359
it will be a joke.

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:13.559
Several commanders brawling in a brothel.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.759
Who is the joke?

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:17.960
Men!

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:18.799
Get out of the way!

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.920
Fan Pengju, you defected on the battlefield.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.359
You'll be court-martialed.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.519
Do you see my gun?

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:35.880
Back off.

00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:37.640
Move.

00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:38.480
Move.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.720
Division Commander Chen,

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.319
my request is actually very simple.

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:44.880
Just release the little brother.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.880
One pull and I'll put a hole right through you.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.720
You wouldn't dare.

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:53.119
See if I dare.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.640
Walk me out.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:58.839
Make way.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.279
Move.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:00.039
Make way.

00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:04.000
Go.

00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:08.519
Don't move.

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:09.160
Put it down.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.839
Put down the guns.

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:11.079
Let my Commander go.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.079
Why go through all this?

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.200
We fought, we drank.

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:19.880
You reneged first.

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:21.920
Commander.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.039
Commander, we brought him.

00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:27.200
Tell them to let him go.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.160
Let him go.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.000
You release him first.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.039
Release him.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.920
Commander, let's release them together.

00:28:37.319 --> 00:28:38.200
Commander.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.920
Your soldiers

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:41.640
aren't listening to you anymore.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.279
You...

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:45.039
I told you to release him!

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.000
I...

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.000
I said release him!

00:28:52.119 --> 00:28:53.240
Come over here, quick!

00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:54.759
You...

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.680
Young Master Liao.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.440
Come back, quick. We're here to save you.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.160
Come over here.

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:00.759
Hurry up.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:07.240
You kid, really...

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:07.880
You...

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.440
Thank you, Commander.

00:29:10.759 --> 00:29:13.000
I still need to trouble you to escort us a bit, Commander.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.319
Tell them

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.160
not to follow us.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.359
Put them down.

00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:25.240
Go, go, go, hurry.

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:26.000
Put them down.

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:34.440
Is this settled now?

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.559
It is.

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:38.200
Brigade Commander Fan,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.799
you never intended

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.839
to submit to me wholeheartedly from the start.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.839
I am a simple man.

00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:47.279
Everything must be about honor.

00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:49.960
I've fought Division Commander Chen for so many years.

00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:51.759
I wouldn't say we're kindred spirits,

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:54.599
but I understand your usual style.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.000
That Staff Officer of yours...

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.400
I don't like him.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.400
What a coincidence.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.200
I don't like him either.

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:08.880
Thank you, Commander.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.240
Please.
