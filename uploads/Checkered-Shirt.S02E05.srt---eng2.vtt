00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.593
Ah... my head.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.484
Even the dreams are chaotic.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.030
Wait a minute.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.949
Ah...

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:37.579
What should we have for lunch?

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.503
Assistant Manager Park.

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:47.630
Is your external schedule finished already?

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.715
Pardon?

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.967
Han-gyul told me.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.804
I saw you leaving hurriedly this morning for an external schedule, Assistant Manager Park.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.142
We finished the meeting well amongst ourselves.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.103
Yes.

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:03.980
May I leave now?

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.816
Our team leader really hates tardiness.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:07.484
Just because of one person...

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.570
I also don't want the atmosphere to get messy.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.033
Don't get me wrong.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.451
I just...

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.328
handled it for business reasons.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.498
Han-gyul.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.707
Did you happen to... last night...

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.876
In a public setting, my private life...

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.466
I'd prefer you didn't ask about it.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.969
And since we have a lot of work,

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:37.430
let's try to be on time, shall we?

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.353
Yes.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.986
Oh, yes, Team Leader.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.116
Ah... Department Head Kang?

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.369
Yes, understood.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.247
Assistant Manager Park?

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.947
Do you know Department Head Kang?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.408
No, it's my first time seeing him.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.661
Since this project involves dispatch...

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:45.707
Well, you'll know when you meet him.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.458
Don't let it get to you.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.919
He's just that kind of person.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.171
If you just play along a bit,

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.547
it will be over soon.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.593
Judging by what the team leader said today,

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.511
it doesn't seem like he came for anything serious.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:04.100
Just send him off nicely without getting angry, okay?

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.751
I've seen the proposal, but...

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.253
Well.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:35.423
Isn't it too textbook?

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.843
It lacks a sense of the field.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.012
If I don't say this,

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:44.057
it would just look like a student assignment.

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.728
Uh, we prepared three options.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.813
Are you unsatisfied with all of them?

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.567
Could you please explain more specifically?

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.276
If we go through them one by one here, we'll be here all night.

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.904
Maybe if we were having a drink, it might be different.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:02.158
Then we could have a more honest conversation.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:06.204
Maybe we could understand each other.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:11.000
Uh... that's a bit difficult today, Department Head.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.710
If you send it in writing,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.963
we will try to reflect it.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.673
Mr. Han-gyul.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.175
Are you uncomfortable with me?

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.889
Or are you uncomfortable with places like bars?

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.645
Looking all pretty like that...

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.605
Do you like men or something?

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.023
Is it like that?

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:43.825
Oh my, why so sensitive?

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.535
I just wanted to lighten the mood...

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.246
and give you feedback over a drink.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.624
Assistant Manager Park.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.669
Isn't it your job to cater to the client?

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.337
You people from outsourcing agencies...

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:58.965
Your job is to pour drinks for the client.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.884
Why are you acting so noble? Huh?

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.304
Department Head Kang.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.682
Aren't you an employee of a public institution?

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.226
I am aware that demanding entertainment is illegal.

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.729
Ah, this jerk...

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.272
What?

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.065
Look at the way he talks...

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.401
It's not the way I talk, it's...

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.615
a principle.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.952
Who do you think you are trying to teach me?

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.913
Where did you get those bad manners?

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:34.042
Don't you know I hold your company's livelihood in my hands?

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.463
I apologize, Department Head.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:39.964
I apologize!

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.515
Are you crazy?

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:02.153
Haa...

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.409
Talk to me.

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.787
I have nothing to say.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.413
Why can't you say anything?

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:14.165
You were so confident in front of me!

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.541
If I speak...

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:19.670
it will just cause unnecessary trouble.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.299
Rumors will spread, my image will get worse...

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.177
I'm sick of that.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.766
So what if there are rumors?

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:36.604
You just have to say it's not true.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.946
You say that so easily because you don't care about what others think, right?

00:06:45.613 --> 00:06:48.074
I'm not like that.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.202
It's more beneficial for me to hide my true self.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.497
Now that you know...

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:58.793
If you just bottle it up like that...

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.796
are you okay inside?

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:12.265
What does it matter if I get hurt.

00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:16.811
I can just leave again.

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:19.814
To wherever.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.068
Is disappearing that easy for you?

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.073
Cutting people off like that...

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:37.915
Is it as easy as breathing for you?

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:42.879
If I'm tired of people and sick of relationships...

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.256
it's better to just disappear.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.800
I don't think that's wrong.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:54.599
That's my way of enduring.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.314
So, was it that easy for you back then too?

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.284
Don't go.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:29.008
Don't go, Han-gyul.
