00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.180
Here.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.500
Use this instead.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.270
What's this?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.200
Wear it...

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.470
so you remember who you belong to.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.570
I think about that sometimes.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.010
Honestly, it's been on my
mind more than I expected.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120
Natsume-san.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.510
You startled me.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.360
Those earrings really do look good on you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.300
"Cosmetic Playlover" Season 2
(Episode 5)

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.870
Thank you.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.750
Thanks.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.040
Hoshina's customer service skills

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.390
have really stabilized lately.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.230
He's become a reliable part of the team.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.550
That being said,

00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.540
he's only been here for a month.

00:01:57.996 --> 00:01:59.836
We still shouldn't get
too ahead of ourselves.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880
Right.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.190
I want everyone to keep
an eye on him as he grows.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.180
We look forward to seeing you again.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.870
Welcome.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.150
Welcome.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.250
Oh, excuse me.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:18.103
I have an appointment.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.440
We've been expecting you,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.650
Ms. Okada.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.890
I'll leave it to you, then.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.850
Of course, right this way.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.140
Okay.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.660
Ave you had any trouble using the eyeshadow
you bought last time, or any concerns?

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.300
Thanks to all your tips,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.040
it's been very easy to use.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.160
I'm glad to hear that.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.960
I was thinking of trying
out some blush today too.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.390
Certainly.

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:45.973
I'll pick out a few options for you.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.320
Great.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.610
Please wait just a moment.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.570
Hoshina-kun...

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.380
recently he's quick to grasp what
customers want and handles them very well.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.720
He's good at reading the room, too.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.300
He's always been quite observant.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.490
Pardon me.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.900
I think this color palette
would suit you perfectly.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.340
What do you think?

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.740
Oh, you're right.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.350
It looks completely different
once you actually put it on.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.140
- Yes, it really complements your skin tone.
- By the way, Hoshina is improving so fast.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.270
I wonder why...

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.950
It looks lovely.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.080
Thank you so much.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.400
Thanks.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.690
We hope to see you again.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.020
Definitely, I'll be back.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.390
Thank you.

00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:01.537
Riku!

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.150
Oh!

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.030
Welcome.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.150
You're really here!

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.090
We're here to do some
serious shopping today!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760
Thank you, guys.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.930
Welcome.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.200
Are they your friends?

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.950
Yes, from university.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.170
Oh, are you Mamiya-san by any chance?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.180
Yes, that's me.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.360
Riku talks about you all the time.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.140
He's been working so
hard on his makeup skills.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.949
He says practicing on us
doesn't make him nervous,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.179
so he keeps asking us
to introduce him to friends.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.506
I've lost track of how
many people we've brought.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.580
Hey, stop it already.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.700
It's fine. It's good that
you're working hard.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.880
Anyway, I pre-ordered a makeup set online.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.940
Yes, thank you.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.700
Right this way, then.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.090
Thanks! See you later.

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:49.565
Thanks! Keep it up!

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:51.396
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.730
Thank you for coming.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.480
Hoshina, so you've been
practicing on your own time.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:02.980
Um...

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.670
Yes.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.460
Ever since I started
taking over your clients,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.730
I've been practicing on
weekends and weeknights.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.110
If you'd told me sooner,

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.330
I could have adjusted
your training schedule.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.570
No...

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.900
How do I put this?

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.309
In the past, no matter
how hard I practiced,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.590
I never saw any results.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.570
I felt so useless.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.340
I'd think, "All that work for nothing?"

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.760
That's why I wanted to do it secretly...

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:31.810
Yes.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.690
Mamiya-san, you've done so much for me.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.650
I felt like I needed to work even harder.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.960
And when you said I was a reliable asset,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.320
it made me so happy.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.530
What you said...

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.260
about the meaning of "being trusted."

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.540
I'm finally starting to understand it.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.030
I'm enjoying work so much more now.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.990
I see.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.500
- That's great.
- Yes.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.260
- I'll get back to work now.
- Okay.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.476
Natsume-kun, you're really something.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.476
Hoshina-kun is like a
completely different person.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.580
No, it's all thanks to his own hard work.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.500
And the customers' cooperation.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.580
That's certainly part of it.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.980
But I think it's mostly
because the Yurakucho store

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.100
already has a foundation
for training male BAs.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.870
Plus the trust you've
built with your clients.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.450
Asking you was definitely the right call.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.300
Thank you.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.500
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.200
Thank you.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.366
(Sahashi Toma: I have
something to tell you. Call me.)

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.390
What is it?

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.610
Hello, Natsume-san.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.190
Good work today.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.326
You said you had something
to tell me. What's up?

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.720
She's getting married.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.630
Married? Who?

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.140
Risako.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.620
The Muse is getting married?!

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.570
It's still top secret, so keep it down.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.020
Sorry.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.420
But that's wonderful news.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.790
Tell her congratulations for me.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.759
So, they're planning a bridal shoot

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.720
for magazines and media announcements.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.780
Romy is contracted for the hair and makeup,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.240
and she specifically requested me.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360
Again?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.380
That's a huge project.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.050
But... don't you have a lot on your plate
already? Are you sure you can handle it?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.320
Don't overwork yourself.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.340
I know.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.790
And here's the main point.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.180
Yeah?

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.380
Risako...

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.330
she requested you join
the project team, too.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.650
What?!

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.720
I'm home.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920
Welcome back.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.720
Hey, what was that call all about?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800
Why me?

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.029
During that makeup event,

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.800
I happened to mention you to Risako.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.620
She seems to have remembered.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080
And then...

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.400
she saw our poster online

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.930
and insisted on having you.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.100
But I...

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.809
I've never done anything
like a magazine project.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.710
The PR department will be with us,
so it'll be fine.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.270
Besides,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.030
as long as I'm with you, Mamiya-san...

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.680
I know I can give it my all.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.190
Huh?

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:41.890
Everyone, thank you for coming today.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.129
I'm Nakai from the Elly
editorial department.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.130
Nice to meet you.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.940
This is our art director, Mr. Yamamoto.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.750
Hello.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.530
I'm Yamamoto.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.970
Nice to meet you all.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.540
And this is...

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.999
I'm Risako Yumihara's manager,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.870
Yoshioka from Skylight Agency.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.710
I look forward to working with you.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.500
Nice to meet you.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.610
- This is our stylist, Ms. Yano.
- I'm Yano. Nice to meet you.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.360
Nice to meet you.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.650
Hello, everyone.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:24.490
I'm Asano from HINAKI WEDDING's
planning department. Nice to meet you.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.490
Nice to meet you.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.280
I'm Nishikawa from Crescent Jewelry.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.970
Nice to meet you.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.690
I'm Kishimoto from ROMY
FEERIQUE's PR department.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.810
I'm Mamiya. Nice to meet you all.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.530
The two of us will be
handling things for now.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.650
Sahashi, who's in charge of the makeup,

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.749
is unfortunately fully
booked at the moment.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.850
He'll join the team
once the plan is finalized.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.560
Is Mamiya-san also from the PR department?

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.870
Oh, no. I usually work at the counter.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.970
So, you're a BA?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.720
Wait, are you the guy from
that men's makeup poster?

00:10:04.436 --> 00:10:05.436
Oh.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.870
Yes...

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.779
Having someone with modeling experience

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.360
is very reassuring.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.320
Oh...?

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.440
Nice to meet you.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.590
Nice to meet you.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.360
Well then, let's get started.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.330
Oh, the meeting minutes.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.550
Let me handle that.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.080
It's not like I have
much else to contribute.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.370
I'll leave it to you, then.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.080
Please look at the first
page of the proposal.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.150
The theme this time is "The Real Me."

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.350
We've prepared five different concepts.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.980
The Real Me...

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.190
We want to focus on Ms.
Yumihara's more private side.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.300
The goal is to show a side of
her no one has seen before.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.479
This draft is based on her
pre-shoot questionnaire, right?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480
Exactly.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.630
It's wonderful.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.256
Every single one is beautiful.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.310
Excuse me.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.030
This pink...

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.169
it's a bit too soft and feminine.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.810
It feels a bit off from
Risako Yumihara's image.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.210
I see. We'll adjust that.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.230
Please do.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.280
As for the pink...

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.580
Reconsider.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.579
What about this white one?

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:14.309
- That's a classic. It should work.
- But in terms of style...

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.609
This season's theme is "Modern x Juicy."

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.880
It'd be great if the
styling could highlight that.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.100
Modern, no problem.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.340
Feminine style.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.670
Needs adjustment.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.109
Even a feminine style can work well

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.376
if we put some effort
into the coordination.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.290
But that depends on the direction.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.040
Feminine style is okay?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.039
When I think of Ms. Yumihara's image,

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.740
it's more cool and elegant, right?

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.130
Cool?

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.260
Elegant?

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.850
That feels a bit too conservative.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.610
I'd like to add a bit of an edge.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.170
Cool.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.920
Elegant is too conservative.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.510
Add some edge.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.866
What if we went bold and gave
the kimono a Western twist?

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.090
Exotic style?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.630
Exotic?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.430
I'm sorry.

00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:02.600
Our company doesn't really do that style.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.480
Cancel exotic.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.050
In that case, the image would be...

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.120
By the way,

00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:09.880
how do you plan to style the accessories?

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.160
Accessories...

00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:13.839
We could use more delicate tones
for the accessories...

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.389
I don't think that's the right direction.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.160
Excuse me.

00:12:16.161 --> 00:12:19.169
Um... we're still hoping for
a bit more of a fresh feel overall.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.680
- Uh... tones... fresh feel...
- So, like brown...

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.540
Maybe something like green...

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.890
But our new sashes this
season are quite colorful.

00:12:24.915 --> 00:12:28.265
It's just... we'd still like to keep
some of the classic elements.

00:12:28.382 --> 00:12:36.382
[the clamor of too many
opinions being shared at once]

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.530
No, no, no...!

00:12:40.853 --> 00:12:43.453
This definitely isn't the kind of
work a manager should be doing.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.430
Was the meeting really that bad?

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.810
It wasn't just bad.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.620
I felt completely out of my element.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.689
I'm clearly under-experienced.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.980
Why on earth did the Muse pick me?

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.350
Well...

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.940
I called Risako today to ask about that.

00:12:59.619 --> 00:13:02.190
Since it's a team made up
of so many different brands,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.000
she thought it'd be easier for
me if I had someone I knew there.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.150
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.210
No.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.119
You shouldn't say "no."

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.676
You should say "everything's the matter."

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.650
If you're the point of contact, Mamiya-san,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.950
it definitely makes things easier for me.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.210
And if you really didn't want to
do it, you could've just said no.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.220
No, it's not that...

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.290
I thought I should try new things.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.350
But once I actually got there,

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.990
the lineup was so
intense it intimidated me.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.490
It'll be fine.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.800
You're not alone, Mamiya-san.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.550
Just think of it as helping me out.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.760
Helping you...

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040
Yeah.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.630
You're right.

00:13:46.603 --> 00:13:48.443
There's no point in moping around.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.700
Alright.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.070
Since I've taken this on,

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.910
I'll make sure everything is
perfect before I hand it over to you.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.310
Leave it to me.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.780
Okay~

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.900
I have a business trip to Osaka next week.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.480
Again?

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.790
That's rough.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.030
I'm used to it.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:31.070
You don't need to tell him to
"take it easy" or "get some rest."

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.010
When he's worn out, he'll come
to me for comfort on his own.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.790
But if...

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.400
this becomes a
long-distance relationship...

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.240
What's wrong?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.270
Let's just go to sleep.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.110
Okay.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.190
Mamiya-san,

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.160
I'm so sorry.

00:15:15.161 --> 00:15:17.500
I'm tied up with another
project and can't make it today.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.980
Huh?

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.540
Mamiya-san,

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.150
I'm counting on you.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.410
I'm on my own for todays meeting?!

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.875
Ms. Yumihara made an appearance today.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.510
Thanks to you, we've
had an excellent meeting.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.410
Thank you very much.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.620
Thank you all.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.476
I feel like this is going
to be a wonderful project.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.530
I'm looking forward to the shoot.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.570
Regarding the next meeting,

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.090
I'll notify you by email. I look
forward to working with you.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.550
Nice to meet you.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.450
Good work today.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.220
- I'll go get the car. Wait for me here.
- Okay.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.020
- Good work.
- Good work.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.880
Mamiya-san.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.880
Yes, how can I help you?

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.480
About this shoot,

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.410
do you think we could use this eyeshadow?

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.440
Excuse me.

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:16.370
Could I see the product number?

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.790
- Sure.
- Thank you.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.940
ROMY FEERIQUE, Shimmering Orange...

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.180
Pardon me.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.340
I'm very sorry,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.530
but this item has been discontinued.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.906
If you're looking for
something currently available,

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.100
shade #5 from the ROMY FEERIQUE
"Fruit" series is the closest match.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.570
If you want a dewy, pearlescent look,
you could go with #3...

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.820
Oh.

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:51.177
Oops.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.010
I accidentally slipped into
my customer service voice.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:56.070
That's amazing.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.716
Knowing which items are discontinued

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.940
and suggesting alternatives...

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.660
You were able to answer right away.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.880
Do you have all of them memorized?

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.370
Yes, for the most part.

00:17:06.513 --> 00:17:08.293
As expected of an active BA.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.780
I'm so glad I suggested
your name, Mamiya-san.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.450
No, it's just one of the few
ways I can actually be of help.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.990
Here you go.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.510
Thank you.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.040
I'll finish up quickly

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.650
and go home with him.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.510
This is for the location shoot.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.350
Ms. Yumihara

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.060
wants to use shade #5
from the Fruit series...

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.440
That eyeshadow.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.970
It looks like she's been
using it for a long time.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.880
And it's a really old product number.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.780
So, these are the final five concepts.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.040
Oh, this one is...

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.130
A classic bridal makeup style.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.530
But we also want to bring out a cool edge
to match Ms. Yumihara's image.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.280
And this one has more of an Oriental feel.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.130
Can I start on the makeup designs?

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800
Yes.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.560
It'd be great if you could have them ready
by next weekend's meeting.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400
Okay.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.010
Thanks.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.410
With the image so clear,
it'll be easy to design.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.550
I see.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.890
That's good.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.650
Will you be there for
the shoot, Mamiya-san?

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.170
Yeah, officially.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.459
If you're going to be there,

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.830
I'll have to show off a bit.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.880
You should work hard even if I'm not there.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.670
I know, I know.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.030
I'm so relieved.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.510
I was worried at first,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.140
but I've successfully handed
everything off to Toma.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.469
It looks like things will
go smoothly from here.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.610
Please wait a moment.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.460
Manager.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.880
- A call from the PR department.
- Okay.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.230
Hello, this is Mamiya.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.150
Yes.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.370
I'm glad we've finally reached a milestone.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.200
Wait...

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.070
Starting from scratch?!

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.450
I see...

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.750
I understand...

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.400
Hey, Mamiya.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.020
What's with that look on your face?

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.680
Heh.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.580
Redo everything?

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.419
I'm so sorry.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.090
Especially when you're already so busy...

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.600
This isn't something you
should be apologizing for.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:14.580
I understand the situation.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.310
It would be a huge help if you
could get the new plan to me ASAP.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.420
Okay.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.120
I have to go to a meeting now.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.950
I'll send you the schedule later.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.880
- Please do.
- Yeah.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.060
In this project,

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.060
the most important element is the dress.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.160
The role of the makeup is

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.750
to harmonize with the project's worldview

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.660
and enhance its beauty.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.510
Therefore,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.859
we've decided to start with the dress

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.720
and re-evaluate the entire styling.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.500
We didn't expect the same dress
to be used in a TV drama first.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.036
If she wears it after that,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.160
it'll put her at a disadvantage.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.640
The concept and location haven't changed.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.750
Time is limited,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.980
but let's do our best.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.420
Mr. Yamamoto...

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.920
Until the styling is finalized,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.080
Toma can't even start his work.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.306
I want to hand things off
to him as soon as possible.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.330
Ms. Asano,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.040
are there any suitable dresses?

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.589
Um... the person in
charge is searching urgently.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.170
I'm very sorry...

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.630
- Please keep looking.
- I can't exactly rush them here.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.430
This is so frustrating.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.330
Yes.

00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:34.850
It's shade #5 from the Fruit series.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.740
Oh, you have it in stock?

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.739
I'm actually in the neighborhood.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.020
Can I stop by?

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.290
Thank you so much.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.670
Alright, I'll see you soon.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:46.770
Talk to you later.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.530
Whew.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.070
As expected of the Ginza store.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.030
I'm glad they had it.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.730
Oh! Mamiya-kun.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:58.570
Nanjo-san.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.470
What's up?

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.720
What brings you to our store?

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.889
I'm here for Risako Yumihara's project.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.130
I wanted to check the stock
for a limited edition color.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.640
You're as serious as ever.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.150
Sahashi-kun is helping out at the Shibuya
store. Want me to take a look for you?

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.700
Here, take this.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.090
Thank you.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.320
No problem.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:27.870
Alright.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.090
And this too.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.369
Sorry, thank you.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.370
Here you go.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.280
Thanks.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.880
But seriously,

00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:40.534
Sahashi-kun is really pushing himself.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.770
Taking on a project
during such a busy time,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.340
plus all the assignments Emma's giving him.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.960
Assignments?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.620
Yeah.

00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:50.869
After the store closes,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.370
he gets the staff or
the manager to help him

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.389
film videos to send to Emma.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.870
He's really dedicated to his studies.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.760
I saw the reply, but I can't accept this.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.850
Doesn't this stray from the Romy style?

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.210
If we do this, the
impression will be too weak.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.680
Wow...

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.600
He's actually arguing with Emma.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.430
He's working harder than anyone expected.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.820
He's starting to look
more like you, Mamiya-kun.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.140
No.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.250
That's just who he is.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.990
He never wavers.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080
Sorry about that.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.920
If Sahashi-kun goes to Paris,

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.530
won't you guys be long-distance?

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:45.310
Since I'm the one who
mentioned him to Emma,

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:47.460
I feel a bit responsible.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.630
Don't be.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.530
We were just given the option.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.630
He's the one who has to make the decision.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240
I see.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.800
Exactly.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.330
Toma is the one who will
decide for himself if he'll go to Paris.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And that's exactly why

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.980
I want to support him.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.260
What do you think of the result?

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.850
It looks really good.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.670
Thank you.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.990
For his sake,

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.030
I'm going to see this
wedding project through

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.970
and hand it off to Toma properly.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.349
(Next Episode)
Being happy, being apart...

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.420
Don't say things like that.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.810
What do you like about him?

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.840
Everything.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.410
As a Romy BA,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.370
I'll give him my heartfelt blessings.
