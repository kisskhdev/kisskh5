00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:10.584
Where is Li Peiyi?

00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:13.625
Tell me. I can give you the antidote.

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:18.785
What are you saying?

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:27.265
You think I'll lean in close

00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:30.185
and give you a chance to kill me?

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:33.505
Inspector Du, try whatever you want.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:34.865
I see right through it.

00:02:41.985 --> 00:02:44.985
I know your blade is poisoned.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:48.265
But I added one more herb.

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:52.825
Now, it's already reached your eyes.

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.905
If you don't take the antidote in time,

00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:59.025
you and I will walk the road

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:01.825
to the underworld together!

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.865
I stopped Peiyi

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.185
from reopening that old case 15 years ago,

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:19.025
not because I don't want to.

00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:21.585
It's because you hid too well.

00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:24.145
If we don't find who's behind this,

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.865
she'll never be safe.

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:30.705
Let me see

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:34.545
which old acquaintance this is.

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:37.865
Old man?

00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:40.025
Old man, wake up!

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:42.345
Where's the antidote?

00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:45.025
Where is it?

00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:47.785
Old man? Where's the antidote?

00:04:50.265 --> 00:04:51.385
Where is it?

00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:55.145
Don't scare me.

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:57.905
Don't fall asleep.

00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:02.025
Don't scare me. Old man?

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:09.185
Don't leave me…

00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:14.945
Don't leave me…

00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:18.145
Don't leave me…

00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:20.385
Don't leave me…

00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:22.825
Why?

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:39.625
Why…

00:05:40.505 --> 00:05:41.865
the one still alive…

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:45.105
is…

00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:47.985
me?

00:05:51.385 --> 00:05:52.225
Peiyi?

00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:55.825
Peiyi?

00:05:58.265 --> 00:05:59.425
Peiyi?

00:06:34.905 --> 00:06:35.985
Old man…

00:07:35.225 --> 00:07:36.265
It was you.

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:40.545
You remember now?

00:07:42.345 --> 00:07:43.225
Yes.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:45.825
Good.

00:07:47.025 --> 00:07:48.545
Fifteen years ago…

00:07:50.305 --> 00:07:53.505
behind the rockery… you saw it all?

00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:56.545
No.

00:07:58.225 --> 00:08:00.145
Don't think I won't kill you!

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:02.745
You can kill me…

00:08:04.865 --> 00:08:05.865
but I didn't lie to you.

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:10.985
I also wish I'd seen it.

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:26.705
My lord. It's time.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:28.625
Clean this place up.

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:30.065
Understood.

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:37.385
What about after that?

00:08:38.904 --> 00:08:40.784
How did you get me out alone?

00:08:41.664 --> 00:08:42.745
Who took me into the palace?

00:08:43.784 --> 00:08:45.185
I carried you on my back

00:08:46.665 --> 00:08:48.465
and climbed the wall
out of the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:21.865
Huaijin!

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:24.865
Huaijin. Huaijin.

00:09:25.385 --> 00:09:27.145
Huaijin. What's wrong?

00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:33.905
Give her to me.

00:09:33.985 --> 00:09:35.505
Hurry! Hurry!

00:09:48.105 --> 00:09:48.985
Let's enter the palace.

00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:54.425
After that, I passed out.

00:09:55.265 --> 00:09:56.665
But I truly cannot recall

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:00.305
what happened after that.

00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:05.145
Peiyi!

00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:13.305
You can't forget.

00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:16.505
How can you forget?

00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:18.585
I'm sorry.

00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:23.785
Mr. Xiao,

00:10:24.865 --> 00:10:27.345
think again… Think again.

00:10:28.385 --> 00:10:30.625
Did the man who killed my father
say anything?

00:10:31.345 --> 00:10:32.745
What did he sound like?

00:10:33.385 --> 00:10:35.305
Was he tall or short? Fat or thin?

00:10:36.465 --> 00:10:39.425
Any birthmark? Any scars?

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:40.545
You never forget a face.

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:41.785
There's no way you don't remember!

00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:47.945
I'm sorry.

00:10:48.825 --> 00:10:51.225
What I saw and remember

00:10:52.025 --> 00:10:53.465
isn't any more than you do.

00:10:54.065 --> 00:10:56.385
Peiyi, I'm sorry.

00:10:58.105 --> 00:10:59.385
Don't say sorry…

00:11:01.105 --> 00:11:02.145
Don't say sorry…

00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:07.705
Think again. Tell me something else.

00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:10.345
Anything you can remember.

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:13.265
Anything. I'm begging you!

00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:43.585
Please, leave me alone.

00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:53.705
Old man…

00:12:56.305 --> 00:12:57.265
Look…

00:12:59.785 --> 00:13:01.585
I'm a cursed lone star.

00:13:03.105 --> 00:13:04.465
I couldn't find the killer.

00:13:06.705 --> 00:13:07.745
And I got you killed.

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:44.545
Your Ladyship.

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:49.425
Should we send Inspector Du's body
back to Western Capital?

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:53.145
He didn't like the capital.

00:13:53.745 --> 00:13:55.465
He'd hate being worshiped too.

00:13:56.505 --> 00:13:57.945
He lived free and easy.

00:13:58.025 --> 00:14:00.985
He used to swing a spear and drink.

00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:03.305
Then it was chess and pitch-pot.

00:14:04.505 --> 00:14:06.265
Find a high place with a view.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.025
Bury him facing the capital.

00:14:08.905 --> 00:14:10.985
So he can see how I'll avenge him.

00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:13.745
Understood.

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:54.905
I know you didn't like the capital.

00:14:57.545 --> 00:14:58.865
It's quiet here.

00:15:04.185 --> 00:15:05.425
No more of me bothering you.

00:15:14.985 --> 00:15:16.225
I'm going back for revenge.

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:19.465
The trail is cold, so what?

00:15:20.705 --> 00:15:22.745
I've got time and patience.

00:15:25.145 --> 00:15:26.665
If you still have a conscience,

00:15:28.145 --> 00:15:29.385
watch over me, will you?

00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:08.865
Father.

00:17:10.424 --> 00:17:11.944
Go home and see your mother.

00:17:12.545 --> 00:17:15.184
I have something to tell Her Ladyship.

00:17:17.265 --> 00:17:18.464
Mr. Xiao, please leave.

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:20.865
Don't worry.

00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:25.184
In rank, in skill, and in words,

00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:27.905
I won't humiliate Her Ladyship.

00:17:30.025 --> 00:17:30.865
Your Ladyship, please.

00:17:46.345 --> 00:17:47.905
You've always kept quiet

00:17:47.985 --> 00:17:50.385
about that tragedy
at the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:17:50.465 --> 00:17:52.945
And you don't want Deputy Director Xiao
to be deeply involved with me.

00:17:53.745 --> 00:17:54.585
But I know

00:17:55.185 --> 00:17:57.105
you were not the killer.

00:17:57.185 --> 00:18:00.585
So you'd better tell me something
I don't know yet.

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:02.785
Otherwise, there's no deal
left to talk about.

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:08.465
I'm not trying to make you agree

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:09.785
to any conditions.

00:18:09.865 --> 00:18:13.025
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:18:13.745 --> 00:18:17.585
As for the rest,
Your Ladyship, you decide.

00:18:18.345 --> 00:18:19.385
That night,

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.665
I heard something happened
at the Prince of Duan's manor,

00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:23.785
so I summoned the Crown Prince's guards.

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:26.945
But it wasn't the Prince of Duan
going mad and hurting someone.

00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:28.265
It was said

00:18:28.345 --> 00:18:30.425
when he campaigned in Jianning,

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:32.825
his Jianning Iron Army

00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:35.825
left their post
and slipped into Western Capital

00:18:35.905 --> 00:18:37.665
on Lantern Festival night.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:41.185
So you thought my father

00:18:41.265 --> 00:18:42.905
going mad and hurting people
wasn't enough,

00:18:42.985 --> 00:18:45.225
and you had to pin treason on him too?

00:18:46.905 --> 00:18:49.025
I know the Prince of Duan
was always loyal.

00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:52.065
He came back
to the capital early that year

00:18:52.145 --> 00:18:54.425
to return his command tally.

00:18:54.505 --> 00:18:55.985
But that night,

00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:57.545
more than a dozen Jianning Iron Army men

00:18:57.625 --> 00:18:59.505
did enter the capital without orders.

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:02.665
This matter couldn't be faked.

00:19:04.825 --> 00:19:07.745
Do you think someone plotting rebellion

00:19:07.825 --> 00:19:10.385
would make lanterns with his daughter

00:19:11.345 --> 00:19:12.825
and watch the moon
with his wife on the very night?

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.585
If I didn't find it suspicious,

00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:18.305
why would I go
to the Prince of Duan's manor that night?

00:19:18.905 --> 00:19:20.145
But when you arrived…

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:22.145
The tragedy had already happened.

00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:25.825
The Prince of Duan's manor
was surrounded by the Imperial Guards.

00:19:25.905 --> 00:19:27.505
No one could come or go.

00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:29.745
I knew it was serious.

00:19:29.825 --> 00:19:31.905
The Crown Prince's guards

00:19:31.985 --> 00:19:32.865
must not be seen.

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:36.305
So I had them split up
and leave by another route.

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:38.985
I meant to go to the manor
to check the situation.

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:40.665
However,

00:19:40.745 --> 00:19:43.625
I ran into Huaijin and you.

00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.265
So, you sent me into the palace?

00:19:48.905 --> 00:19:51.065
No. It wasn't me.

00:19:55.265 --> 00:19:57.265
- Let's enter the palace.
- Right now?

00:19:57.345 --> 00:19:58.505
That's too risky.

00:19:58.585 --> 00:20:01.625
If the Imperial Guards stop us,
what do we do?

00:20:03.065 --> 00:20:05.425
If not the palace,
where else can I take her?

00:20:05.505 --> 00:20:08.745
After that, how will
you explain to His Majesty?

00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:11.825
No matter what, you shouldn't have
shown up here tonight

00:20:11.905 --> 00:20:14.865
and, even less, saved her.

00:20:14.945 --> 00:20:15.825
Take her back to my manor first,

00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:19.025
or find somewhere to settle her for now.

00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:22.625
Sir, no one knows what's happening
inside Prince of Duan's manor,

00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:26.425
nor how His Majesty will rule on this.

00:20:26.505 --> 00:20:28.585
If you get tied to this,

00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:30.665
it'll ruin the Xiao family

00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:31.985
and the Crown Prince too…

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.425
Then what?

00:20:34.185 --> 00:20:35.505
Leave her here?

00:20:35.585 --> 00:20:37.185
Will she even live to wake up?

00:20:39.065 --> 00:20:40.425
Everyone has their fate.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.945
Young Master got her out.

00:20:42.025 --> 00:20:43.945
That's already a slim chance.

00:20:44.025 --> 00:20:47.585
What comes next isn't for you to decide.

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:54.465
Sir, look.

00:21:07.465 --> 00:21:08.945
This is the only way.

00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:14.785
I know. I shouldn't drag you
into this, Inspector Du.

00:21:15.905 --> 00:21:20.105
But she is the only child
of the Prince of Duan and his consort.

00:21:20.185 --> 00:21:23.305
Only by sending her into the palace
could we keep her safe.

00:21:24.025 --> 00:21:27.145
But the one who takes her in can't be me.

00:21:30.865 --> 00:21:33.465
Her Ladyship is fated for a hard road.

00:21:34.065 --> 00:21:37.585
If you're willing, escort her partway.

00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:38.665
If you're not…

00:21:38.745 --> 00:21:40.065
Then what?

00:21:41.105 --> 00:21:42.905
Leave her here to die?

00:21:44.465 --> 00:21:45.625
Well, leave her here.

00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:47.625
Me?

00:21:48.145 --> 00:21:49.665
I don't have much virtue.

00:21:49.745 --> 00:21:51.745
Benevolence, righteousness,
rites, wisdom, faith…

00:21:51.825 --> 00:21:53.505
I can live without any of it.

00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:55.425
Mr. Du, you can't just watch her die!

00:22:00.265 --> 00:22:01.785
Hypocritical scholar.

00:22:04.785 --> 00:22:05.905
Well said, Mr. Du.

00:22:08.345 --> 00:22:10.025
I can take her into the palace.

00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:12.345
But after tonight,

00:22:12.985 --> 00:22:15.505
you and I are strangers.

00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:18.905
This child's life
was saved by you and your son.

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:24.985
However, from now on,
you may never hear her thank-you.

00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:28.625
I'm deeply ashamed. I'm not worthy.

00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:32.545
Mr. Du, I'll leave her to you.

00:22:34.385 --> 00:22:35.225
Keeping her alive

00:22:35.985 --> 00:22:38.665
shouldn't be hard. Come.

00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:43.585
Won't you ask why I came tonight?

00:22:44.665 --> 00:22:46.465
I've seen all kinds of people.

00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:48.705
I've never misjudged one.

00:22:49.865 --> 00:22:51.385
Mr. Du, you're a man of honor!

00:22:52.505 --> 00:22:54.225
Inspector Du reported to His Majesty

00:22:54.305 --> 00:22:58.545
that he had found you in a corner
of the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:22:58.625 --> 00:23:01.305
He suggested
you had fainted from the shock

00:23:01.385 --> 00:23:02.545
of the sudden chaos in the manor.

00:23:03.225 --> 00:23:06.465
His Majesty and the entire court

00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:07.865
were waiting for you to wake up,

00:23:08.905 --> 00:23:11.745
each harboring their own intentions,
waiting to hear from you

00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:13.425
what happened that night

00:23:13.505 --> 00:23:15.265
at the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:23:16.665 --> 00:23:18.185
But I didn't remember anything.

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:23.145
I only remembered Father
making lanterns with me before bed.

00:23:23.745 --> 00:23:25.585
I woke up an orphan.

00:23:28.105 --> 00:23:30.145
Even that alone

00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:33.145
was enough to get you killed.

00:23:34.025 --> 00:23:36.425
Inspector Du and I were always on guard.

00:23:36.945 --> 00:23:39.865
Your fall into Moonlit Pond
was no accident.

00:23:39.945 --> 00:23:42.745
But the scariest part

00:23:43.305 --> 00:23:45.065
wasn't that they dared to hurt you.

00:23:46.385 --> 00:23:47.985
It was that

00:23:49.065 --> 00:23:51.905
they did it on purpose right in front
of you and Deputy Director Xiao.

00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:53.945
They knew you'd saved me.

00:23:54.025 --> 00:23:56.945
I was not sure, and I couldn't prove it.

00:23:58.025 --> 00:23:59.545
Whether they knew or not,

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:03.385
to me, that was a warning.

00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:05.505
They were warning you

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:10.225
not to get involved with me and never
dig into the Prince of Duan's case.

00:24:10.945 --> 00:24:13.745
All I could hope was you'd never remember.

00:24:14.425 --> 00:24:16.905
At least then, you'd be safe.

00:24:17.545 --> 00:24:21.025
And Huaijin and I would be safe too.

00:24:21.945 --> 00:24:23.425
I just never expected

00:24:24.705 --> 00:24:26.065
you'd remember anyway.

00:24:28.065 --> 00:24:29.625
I dragged down your family

00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:31.985
and got my master killed.

00:24:33.625 --> 00:24:35.345
I can't change the past.

00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:38.785
From now on, I will sever all ties

00:24:38.865 --> 00:24:40.825
with your family and Deputy Director Xiao.

00:24:43.065 --> 00:24:44.505
I came to you

00:24:44.585 --> 00:24:46.505
not to protect my family.

00:24:47.105 --> 00:24:50.905
Huaijin is gentle, kind-hearted,

00:24:50.985 --> 00:24:52.545
but as stubborn as you.

00:24:52.625 --> 00:24:54.745
He's made up his mind to investigate.

00:24:55.345 --> 00:24:59.225
Even if you cut ties with him,
he'll keep digging.

00:25:01.145 --> 00:25:02.825
Let fate take its course

00:25:04.145 --> 00:25:05.825
for my family.

00:25:07.145 --> 00:25:09.065
But all this started because of me.

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:10.785
I can't do nothing.

00:25:11.785 --> 00:25:13.705
Then please trust him.

00:25:13.785 --> 00:25:15.825
Huaijin never meant to hide it.

00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:19.905
Back then, he was only a teenager.

00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:22.425
These past 15 years,

00:25:23.065 --> 00:25:25.865
he's tried desperately
to forget that night

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:28.385
and hoped you would too.

00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:30.665
Because he knows the pain

00:25:30.745 --> 00:25:32.905
of waking from nightmares
night after night.

00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:37.225
But upon learning
your resolve to uncover the truth,

00:25:37.305 --> 00:25:38.825
he forced himself

00:25:38.905 --> 00:25:41.545
to relive that night, over and over.

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:44.225
He'd throw himself back

00:25:44.305 --> 00:25:46.545
into that nightmare repeatedly,

00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:49.265
if only to remember the smallest detail.

00:25:51.305 --> 00:25:53.905
I admit I had my own motives.

00:25:54.985 --> 00:25:57.585
For my family, for the Crown Prince,

00:25:57.665 --> 00:26:01.185
for the situation at court,
I might hold things back.

00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:03.345
But Huaijin never did.

00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:05.865
From start to finish,

00:26:06.745 --> 00:26:08.385
he only wanted to keep you safe,

00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:10.665
just as he did that night.

00:26:55.065 --> 00:26:56.905
You bought this sachet
for your sweetheart, right?

00:26:57.625 --> 00:26:59.945
What sweetheart? Stop talking nonsense.

00:27:01.505 --> 00:27:03.465
She's been tailing us all day.

00:27:20.745 --> 00:27:22.385
JIN NIANG

00:27:22.985 --> 00:27:24.265
You're really heartless.

00:27:25.225 --> 00:27:26.145
Hey…

00:27:26.665 --> 00:27:27.545
Peiyi.

00:27:31.865 --> 00:27:33.145
Pardon my rudeness.

00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:35.505
I'm the one being rude,

00:27:35.585 --> 00:27:37.545
calling you by name like that.

00:27:40.585 --> 00:27:44.825
Your master used to call you "that girl"

00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:46.545
all the time,

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:48.825
in a tone that was half annoyed,

00:27:48.905 --> 00:27:50.265
half proud,

00:27:50.345 --> 00:27:52.785
like you were his own daughter.

00:27:54.425 --> 00:27:56.785
Old man never said a kind word about me?

00:27:57.825 --> 00:28:01.225
He was a good man,
just with a sharp tongue.

00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:03.905
So I picked up his bad habits.

00:28:07.425 --> 00:28:09.265
When I first met him,

00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:11.665
he was a general's son,

00:28:11.745 --> 00:28:13.825
and I was just a merchant's daughter.

00:28:14.825 --> 00:28:16.985
He always looked after me,

00:28:17.825 --> 00:28:19.025
and I…

00:28:20.545 --> 00:28:21.505
I had feelings for him too.

00:28:22.105 --> 00:28:23.265
But later,

00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:25.065
his father was convicted.

00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:28.505
As a traitor's son, he entered the palace

00:28:29.025 --> 00:28:30.665
and joined
the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:28:32.905 --> 00:28:35.345
Your Ladyship, you should know

00:28:36.025 --> 00:28:39.225
women like me have to survive somehow.

00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:41.425
That's enough.

00:28:42.145 --> 00:28:44.985
I understand. I was out of line.

00:28:47.705 --> 00:28:52.065
Truth is, after he entered the palace,
we never lost touch.

00:28:52.705 --> 00:28:54.745
He still took care of me.

00:28:55.985 --> 00:28:57.185
But…

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:02.105
But I knew

00:29:03.425 --> 00:29:05.225
we could never be.

00:29:07.185 --> 00:29:08.225
He told me

00:29:09.065 --> 00:29:11.065
he wasn't alone anymore.

00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:12.665
Now there was someone

00:29:13.305 --> 00:29:16.625
he was wholly devoted to protecting.

00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:24.345
He was barely able

00:29:25.345 --> 00:29:26.745
to save himself,

00:29:27.545 --> 00:29:29.145
yet still tried to shield others.

00:29:36.945 --> 00:29:38.145
This sachet

00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:41.145
was his gift to you.

00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:44.625
Now that he's gone,

00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:47.305
I'm giving it back.

00:29:48.065 --> 00:29:49.345
Keep it as a memory.

00:29:51.985 --> 00:29:52.865
No, you keep it.

00:29:53.505 --> 00:29:55.025
It's all he left you.

00:29:55.105 --> 00:29:58.585
But my skills, my nasty temper,

00:29:59.225 --> 00:30:02.505
and this sharp mouth of mine
all came from him.

00:30:17.945 --> 00:30:21.385
If you're avenging him, count me in, okay?

00:30:23.345 --> 00:30:24.425
Don't get involved.

00:30:26.145 --> 00:30:27.905
You may look down on me,

00:30:28.465 --> 00:30:31.265
but people like me have our own channels.

00:30:33.265 --> 00:30:35.665
You don't know me,
but you know the old man, don't you?

00:30:36.265 --> 00:30:37.345
I'm the same as him.

00:30:37.425 --> 00:30:39.185
If I looked down on you,

00:30:39.265 --> 00:30:41.265
I wouldn't waste one more word.

00:30:42.025 --> 00:30:43.465
This is truly dangerous.

00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:48.305
If you need anything later,
this sachet will be your pass to see me.

00:30:49.385 --> 00:30:51.985
I heard someone is asking
about sudden eye trouble.

00:30:52.825 --> 00:30:53.905
Is it you

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:56.265
who are hunting Mr. Du's killer?

00:31:02.025 --> 00:31:05.025
Don't worry. You haven't been exposed.

00:31:05.105 --> 00:31:08.705
I pieced it together
after I knew Mr. Du's death.

00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:13.465
My ways of getting news
aren't exactly clean,

00:31:14.145 --> 00:31:15.705
but they can still be useful.

00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:19.665
Then I'll leave it to you.

00:31:20.665 --> 00:31:22.465
Please, stay safe.

00:31:22.545 --> 00:31:23.825
You must take greater care.

00:31:23.905 --> 00:31:27.305
He worried about you the most.

00:31:35.585 --> 00:31:36.745
I failed.

00:31:37.745 --> 00:31:41.265
Du Zhixing showed up out of nowhere
and let Li Peiyi get away.

00:31:41.945 --> 00:31:43.585
But since Du Zhixing is dead,

00:31:43.665 --> 00:31:46.065
it will be hard for Li Peiyi to trace us.

00:31:49.025 --> 00:31:50.225
What's wrong with your eye?

00:31:50.985 --> 00:31:52.625
It was hurt by Du Zhixing.

00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:54.625
I haven't treated it yet.

00:31:56.985 --> 00:31:58.785
If it can't be cured,

00:31:59.665 --> 00:32:01.305
won't it be easy to track you down?

00:32:03.305 --> 00:32:04.505
I'll do everything I can to treat it!

00:32:04.585 --> 00:32:07.105
Until it's cured,
I won't show my face again!

00:32:10.385 --> 00:32:14.265
Before you disappear,
make sure everything is settled.

00:32:14.905 --> 00:32:16.505
No more mistakes.

00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:22.985
Before Li Peiyi
returned to the Western Capital,

00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:23.985
she met someone.

00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:27.705
You couldn't find out who?

00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:33.025
No. But… besides us,

00:32:33.665 --> 00:32:34.665
someone else is watching her.

00:32:36.385 --> 00:32:37.705
I'll look into it.

00:32:45.425 --> 00:32:46.425
Tell me,

00:32:47.345 --> 00:32:48.545
if you die,

00:32:49.865 --> 00:32:52.345
Li Peiyi will have no way
to trace us, right?

00:32:54.865 --> 00:32:57.585
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:32:59.585 --> 00:33:00.625
Boss.

00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:06.345
What are you doing?

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.385
Stacking grapes?

00:33:09.105 --> 00:33:10.905
Yeah. Look.

00:33:11.705 --> 00:33:14.185
This second grape can barely stay on.

00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:17.105
But the moment I add a third,
the whole thing collapses.

00:33:17.985 --> 00:33:19.185
Sounds like me, doesn't it?

00:33:22.545 --> 00:33:24.785
Boss, just put the third one on.

00:33:31.105 --> 00:33:32.545
Now even the second won't hold.

00:33:35.665 --> 00:33:36.985
What case has dragged on this long?

00:33:37.905 --> 00:33:40.385
Boss, you won't believe it.

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.225
The plants by Penglai Pool

00:33:42.305 --> 00:33:44.145
have been dying lately
with the season change.

00:33:44.225 --> 00:33:47.025
Even the magnolias His Majesty
gave Brilliant Lady Dou have lost a few.

00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.465
But she insists someone sabotaged them,

00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:52.425
using dead magnolias to curse her.

00:33:52.505 --> 00:33:53.505
She demanded I get to the bottom of it.

00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:57.225
I worked day and night for three days,

00:33:57.305 --> 00:33:59.585
and no one went near those plants.

00:33:59.665 --> 00:34:01.505
Then I asked the chief gardener
at the Bureau of Gardens.

00:34:01.585 --> 00:34:04.585
She said this season,
plants dying is normal.

00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:08.025
I was about to close the case, but then…

00:34:12.185 --> 00:34:15.385
But then a magnolia
fell over right in front of me.

00:34:16.105 --> 00:34:18.025
The soil around the tree
was clearly disturbed.

00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:21.905
I've had men guarding
near Penglai Pool. It can't be.

00:34:24.465 --> 00:34:25.705
What are you doing?

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.385
Helping you fix your problems.

00:34:34.304 --> 00:34:38.065
Boss, help me fix mine too.

00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:40.065
This is really creepy.

00:34:40.705 --> 00:34:42.824
What if one day I die too?

00:34:42.905 --> 00:34:44.225
You'll still have to solve cases yourself.

00:34:44.824 --> 00:34:45.824
Boss!

00:34:47.905 --> 00:34:49.784
Can you stop saying that?

00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:51.665
It's been a month.

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:54.824
If Inspector Du knew
you were like this every day,

00:34:54.905 --> 00:34:56.145
he'd crawl out and curse you out.

00:34:57.705 --> 00:34:58.825
I'd love that.

00:35:00.545 --> 00:35:03.705
Boss, I really don't know what to do.

00:35:04.745 --> 00:35:07.145
I can't say what happened before.

00:35:07.225 --> 00:35:08.785
But these three days, me and the guards

00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:09.985
have been watching day and night.

00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:13.065
And that tree still toppled straight over!

00:35:15.105 --> 00:35:17.505
Brilliant Lady Dou is arrogant.

00:35:17.585 --> 00:35:18.825
If someone set her up,

00:35:18.905 --> 00:35:20.745
that's not exactly shocking.

00:35:21.345 --> 00:35:24.705
But His Majesty gave her nine magnolias,
meant to last long.

00:35:25.385 --> 00:35:28.865
This past month, four have already died.

00:35:28.945 --> 00:35:32.065
Now, only five are left.

00:35:32.145 --> 00:35:34.305
What's wrong with five? Isn't five good?

00:35:34.385 --> 00:35:37.105
Five reads the same as none.

00:35:37.185 --> 00:35:38.505
Brilliant Lady Dou is furious.

00:35:38.585 --> 00:35:39.865
She insists we drag that person out.

00:35:40.865 --> 00:35:41.985
And if we can't find them?

00:35:42.065 --> 00:35:43.985
If we can't,

00:35:45.225 --> 00:35:46.865
then I'm done for too.

00:35:46.945 --> 00:35:49.585
Then our bureau is done for.

00:35:52.145 --> 00:35:53.065
Where's your county princess?

00:35:53.145 --> 00:35:54.465
Have her come out and see me!

00:35:54.545 --> 00:35:55.505
My lady,

00:35:56.225 --> 00:35:57.545
Her Ladyship is resting.

00:35:58.145 --> 00:35:59.305
At a time like this?

00:35:59.385 --> 00:36:01.865
Something this big happened,
and she can still rest?

00:36:01.945 --> 00:36:03.105
Peiyi?

00:36:03.185 --> 00:36:05.145
Li Peiyi? Get out here!

00:36:06.905 --> 00:36:09.145
- What are you doing?
- She came for you. Where are you going?

00:36:09.225 --> 00:36:10.225
None of your business.

00:36:11.465 --> 00:36:13.345
Fine, I won't meddle.

00:36:14.625 --> 00:36:16.105
We were partners,
and now you're selling me out?

00:36:16.185 --> 00:36:18.105
We were partners,
and now you're ditching me?

00:36:21.465 --> 00:36:23.985
My lady, you're here.

00:36:24.065 --> 00:36:26.665
Peiyi, I know what you're like.

00:36:26.745 --> 00:36:28.185
No one in the capital

00:36:28.265 --> 00:36:30.345
can make you do anything.

00:36:30.425 --> 00:36:31.785
So…

00:36:33.785 --> 00:36:35.945
My lady, what are you trying to do?

00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:39.745
Today I'll show you exactly what I'm like.

00:36:41.825 --> 00:36:43.785
Are you trying to see

00:36:43.865 --> 00:36:45.425
how long I can camp here?

00:36:46.025 --> 00:36:48.585
Are you thinking,
"Fine, I'll just walk away?"

00:36:49.385 --> 00:36:50.985
Back when I made a mistake,

00:36:51.065 --> 00:36:53.865
His Majesty swore never to see me again.

00:36:54.585 --> 00:36:57.785
I was just a helpless woman,
with no family backing

00:36:57.865 --> 00:36:59.505
and no special talents.

00:36:59.585 --> 00:37:01.185
I had only one thing left,

00:37:02.665 --> 00:37:06.185
persistence.
Even the hardest heart can be moved.

00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:08.825
His Majesty isn't made of stone.

00:37:09.465 --> 00:37:12.145
And I can tell you aren't either.

00:37:13.265 --> 00:37:14.625
No worries.

00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:16.465
I can wait.

00:37:17.065 --> 00:37:19.985
In all of Xingqing Palace,
only you can find who harmed me.

00:37:20.065 --> 00:37:21.505
If you won't help me,

00:37:21.585 --> 00:37:23.265
I'll ask help from His Majesty.

00:37:23.865 --> 00:37:25.825
Someone dares stir up trouble
in the inner palace?

00:37:25.905 --> 00:37:27.705
I'll fight them to the end!

00:37:29.745 --> 00:37:31.545
You're using Consort Shu to threaten me?

00:37:32.505 --> 00:37:34.985
Peiyi, what are you saying?

00:37:35.065 --> 00:37:38.545
From start to finish,
when did I ever mention Consort Shu?

00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:42.745
If I don't help you investigate,
you'll take it to His Majesty.

00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:45.065
If someone's cursing in the inner palace,

00:37:45.145 --> 00:37:46.745
the blame will naturally fall
on Consort Shu.

00:37:46.825 --> 00:37:48.105
How could it?

00:37:48.185 --> 00:37:51.305
Everyone knows the one His Majesty
favors most is Consort Shu.

00:37:54.025 --> 00:37:56.025
I've seen how you are.

00:37:56.705 --> 00:37:58.025
Fine. I'll take the case.

00:38:00.025 --> 00:38:00.985
That easy?

00:38:02.305 --> 00:38:04.865
Then I'll wait for your news.

00:38:11.025 --> 00:38:13.425
Anything wrong on Consort Shu's side?

00:38:14.985 --> 00:38:16.225
The Right Chancellor messed up.

00:38:16.745 --> 00:38:19.265
No idea what it was,
but it made His Majesty furious.

00:38:19.345 --> 00:38:21.785
Lately, His Majesty
hasn't visited Consort Shu at all.

00:38:23.465 --> 00:38:26.025
Even Brilliant Lady Dou dares use her.

00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:27.345
It can't be small.

00:38:27.945 --> 00:38:28.785
Then what do we do?

00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:33.665
Tomorrow, take men to fertilize
the plants by Penglai Pool.

00:38:33.745 --> 00:38:35.345
Don't miss an inch of soil.

00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:37.425
If anyone asks,

00:38:37.505 --> 00:38:40.305
tell them you'll do whatever it takes
to save Brilliant Lady Dou's magnolias.

00:38:41.345 --> 00:38:42.865
I meant the Right Chancellor.

00:38:42.945 --> 00:38:44.225
Want me to go sniff around?

00:38:44.825 --> 00:38:46.505
You can even dig into court matters?

00:38:46.585 --> 00:38:48.345
What's so hard about that?

00:38:48.425 --> 00:38:51.585
Unless it's something only His Majesty
and the Right Chancellor know.

00:38:51.665 --> 00:38:54.225
As long as a third person knows,
I can find out.

00:38:55.345 --> 00:38:57.065
Everyone knows you're my man.

00:38:57.145 --> 00:38:59.505
And I was raised by Consort Shu. So…

00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:00.545
So…

00:39:01.145 --> 00:39:03.305
It's not me prying into court secrets.

00:39:03.385 --> 00:39:04.465
It's Consort Shu.

00:39:05.065 --> 00:39:07.065
I was wrong, Your Ladyship.

00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:09.105
I'll have people fertilize right away.

00:39:15.785 --> 00:39:17.425
All of you, eyes open.

00:39:17.505 --> 00:39:19.225
Don't miss a single flower or tree.

00:39:19.305 --> 00:39:20.385
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:39:41.065 --> 00:39:44.545
Boss, you don't have
to camp here every day.

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:46.225
That person hasn't shown up lately.

00:39:46.825 --> 00:39:48.185
They probably know you're on it

00:39:48.265 --> 00:39:50.865
- and don't dare make a move.
- Sweet talker.

00:39:52.505 --> 00:39:53.665
Because your grapes are sweet.

00:39:55.865 --> 00:39:58.065
One more gross line,
and you will solve it yourself.

00:39:58.905 --> 00:39:59.825
Okay. I'll stop.

00:40:00.625 --> 00:40:02.905
I just don't want you waiting here.

00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:05.585
Before, when Brilliant Lady Dou
had you investigate,

00:40:05.665 --> 00:40:06.905
they still kept doing it.

00:40:07.745 --> 00:40:10.465
So either they were sure
they wouldn't get caught

00:40:11.065 --> 00:40:13.785
or they had to come, no matter what.

00:40:14.425 --> 00:40:17.785
After all this tight guarding,
they should be itching to act.

00:40:18.385 --> 00:40:19.625
So they'll come tonight?

00:40:19.705 --> 00:40:22.585
Not sure, but we can try our luck.

00:40:24.025 --> 00:40:25.065
Ma Xiaoran,

00:40:26.025 --> 00:40:27.985
have everyone look around.
See anything unusual.

00:40:28.585 --> 00:40:29.625
Understood.

00:40:31.865 --> 00:40:33.585
Your Ladyship, right here.

00:40:35.585 --> 00:40:37.145
This is insane.

00:40:37.225 --> 00:40:38.745
No way.

00:40:38.825 --> 00:40:40.585
We've been guarding nearby.

00:40:40.665 --> 00:40:41.705
There's only one path here.

00:40:41.785 --> 00:40:42.785
How is this possible?

00:40:43.465 --> 00:40:45.785
Once we catch them, we'll ask and know.

00:40:49.265 --> 00:40:50.345
Don't go in.

00:40:55.985 --> 00:40:58.905
These are… footprints!

00:40:59.505 --> 00:41:00.625
Where'd they come from?

00:41:00.705 --> 00:41:03.025
From someone

00:41:03.105 --> 00:41:05.505
slipping in under your nose,
leaving tracks behind.

00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:11.865
We caught them!

00:41:12.665 --> 00:41:13.825
Where are they?

00:41:13.905 --> 00:41:15.025
You'll see in a second.

00:41:17.145 --> 00:41:17.985
CHENXIANG PAVILION

00:41:18.065 --> 00:41:20.825
It's cold. Warm your feet, everyone.

00:41:24.945 --> 00:41:25.905
Go on, warm up!

00:41:41.145 --> 00:41:44.345
- What?
- Secretary Pan, so it was you.

00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:46.385
Hold him down!

00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:48.745
What's going on?

00:41:48.825 --> 00:41:51.305
The flowerbeds
were just heavily fertilized.

00:41:51.385 --> 00:41:53.385
The fertilizer was mixed
with actinolite and alum clay.

00:41:53.465 --> 00:41:56.505
Anyone who dug in the beds
would get them on their soles.

00:41:56.585 --> 00:41:58.185
Heat those two together,

00:41:58.265 --> 00:41:59.545
and they'll pop like fireworks.

00:41:59.625 --> 00:42:01.505
But the beds were all fertilized.

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:02.665
I patrolled here all night.

00:42:03.265 --> 00:42:04.105
I stepped on it by accident.

00:42:04.185 --> 00:42:05.225
That's normal!

00:42:05.305 --> 00:42:06.625
Fair point.

00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:09.185
Soles alone prove nothing.

00:42:09.865 --> 00:42:12.225
But if you dug, you used your hands.

00:42:14.345 --> 00:42:15.425
A little heat will tell.

00:42:19.585 --> 00:42:20.705
Heat them.

00:42:26.345 --> 00:42:28.385
It was me!

00:42:32.985 --> 00:42:34.185
It was me…

00:42:36.865 --> 00:42:37.985
Talk.

00:42:38.985 --> 00:42:39.945
What are these?

00:42:43.105 --> 00:42:45.265
If you won't say, then I will.

00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:47.865
This is no common fruit.

00:42:47.945 --> 00:42:48.945
They're ginseng seeds.

00:42:49.705 --> 00:42:51.345
The Imperial Medical Office
supplies them only to His Majesty.

00:42:51.425 --> 00:42:54.585
Few in the entire palace
have access to such medicine.

00:42:54.665 --> 00:42:55.745
Where did you obtain them?

00:42:56.345 --> 00:42:57.225
I…

00:42:58.945 --> 00:42:59.825
I dug them up under the tree.

00:42:59.905 --> 00:43:02.945
Why were ginseng seeds
buried under a magnolia tree?

00:43:05.465 --> 00:43:07.865
What's the charge
for stealing royal property?

00:43:07.945 --> 00:43:09.065
High treason.

00:43:09.145 --> 00:43:11.185
- And the sentence?
- Strangling.

00:43:11.265 --> 00:43:13.545
Steal something valuable
or serious enough,

00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:15.505
and your clan gets dragged in.

00:43:17.185 --> 00:43:19.385
- How many clans?
- At least three.

00:43:19.465 --> 00:43:21.745
If it's worse, nine.
