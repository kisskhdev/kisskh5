00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.520
The deceased was hacked to death.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.960
The body has begun to decompose.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.400
The time of death was over five days ago.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.760
The murder weapon was a common knife.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.480
There is nothing special about it.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.480
Five days.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.640
That was before Miaoling's coffin was lifted.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080
This case is becoming more intriguing.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.680
The deceased's body is missing...

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.280
...yet an extra male corpse has appeared.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.840
My Lord.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200
The identity of the male corpse has been confirmed.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.920
It is Zhu Zi, the helper at Anyefang Coffin Shop.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.680
I see.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.920
In that case...

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.600
...it explains the strange movements in the coffin.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.680
Zhu Zi must have discovered a dark secret.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.680
So the killer silenced him.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.240
To cover it up...

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.440
...they hid him inside the coffin.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.320
But Zhu Zi wasn't dead when stuffed inside.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.600
When he woke up and tried to push open the lid...

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.560
...he found it being held down tight.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.320
He eventually succumbed to his injuries inside.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.080
Help!

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.320
Help!

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.960
Help!

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.160
Brother Dongqiu!

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.880
Help!

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.360
What's going on?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.960
Don't ask me, I don't know!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.440
Hold it down tight!

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.000
Let's pretend we know nothing.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.720
Let's go.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.000
So...

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.920
The deaths of Wu Tuan, his wife, and Zhu Zi...

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.280
...are all connected to that Paper effigy.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.800
Who swapped Miaoling's body for the Paper effigy...

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.600
...is the key to this case.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.560
It was Zhao Di.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.520
No.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.320
Zhao Di was eager to bury Miaoling quickly...

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.560
...to avoid any complications.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.600
Why?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.520
Follow me.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.040
Why the rush? Wait for me!

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.560
Luckily, Shentu Baiqi, you are The Greatest Detective of the Uncanny...

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.720
...and not a criminal.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.120
Otherwise, with your skills...

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.600
...if you wanted to commit a crime...

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960
...for this Vice Minister to catch you...

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.920
...would be no easy task.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.280
Careful.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.760
That is highly poisonous.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.200
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.080
Everything in my room is lethal.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.160
But don't worry.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.280
You won't die while I'm here.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200
If I do die...

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.160
...I'll haunt you as a ghost.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.280
Is that so?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.360
Then smell this.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.480
This is...

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.960
the scent from Miaoling's room.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.040
Precisely.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.440
This incense is called Fatal Fragrance.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.200
It comes from the Western Regions and is extremely rare.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.480
Although not highly toxic,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.960
if mixed into incense and inhaled over a long period,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.200
it causes depression at best,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.120
and at worst,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.000
it can be fatal.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.320
In that case,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.720
it was Zhao Di who killed his wife, Miaoling.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.000
Exactly.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.480
The Sun family is wealthy.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.680
Zhao Di, the live-in son-in-law,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.920
used this very incense

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.320
to kill Miaoling without anyone knowing.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.200
To the outside world,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.240
he claimed Miaoling was frail

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.120
and died of illness.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.680
He planned that after burying Miaoling,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.640
he would seize the Sun family fortune.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.160
All of this

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.360
should have been seamless.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.240
But someone was secretly watching,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120
stole the body,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.240
and replaced it with a paper effigy for the burial.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.960
So this person likely knows

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.240
the truth about Miaoling's death.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.000
I fear they intend

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.160
to avenge her.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.720
Now that we know his objective,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.200
there is a way to make him show his hand.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.560
Hmm?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.680
Is there something on my face?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.480
Why are you staring at me?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.320
It's giving me the creeps.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.920
Well,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.600
naturally, I need to borrow

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.360
the Vice Minister's skilled hands.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.800
My Lord,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.400
will this really help find my daughter's body?

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.440
Now that Zhao Di is missing,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.720
as long as we can find him,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.960
the cause of Miaoling's death

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240
will come to light.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.520
What?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.480
What do you mean by that, My Lord?

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.120
Could it be

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.880
that my daughter did not die of illness?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.520
No...

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.760
Master, My Lord,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.840
the pallbearers have arrived.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.360
Understood.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.160
Go on.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520
My condolences, Master.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.000
Everyone,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.040
my son-in-law

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.320
has met an unfortunate and violent end.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.920
The burial is tomorrow.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.720
I know you are all reliable workers.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.480
I entrust the funeral procession to you tomorrow.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.120
It is our blessing to be looked after by you, Master.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.320
You can rest assured about everything.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.040
Right, Brother Dongqiu?

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.640
Yes.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.080
This isn't exactly a deposit,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.360
just a small token from this old man.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.200
I hope you will take great care.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.080
Thank you, Master.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.720
Thank you, Master.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.760
Thank you, Master.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:05.960
Well?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.120
Your method really worked.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.920
Last night,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.920
staying up all night wasn't in vain.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.080
Follow him.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.280
Don't worry.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.480
It's already arranged.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.640
Lady Xiaomu...

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:21.840
You...

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.440
Mu Guiyi is one of my people.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.120
You agreed to this.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.040
Why would he come here?
