00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.000
Don’t worry, Rose. I’ll make sure he’ll be in good hands.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.240
From now on, I’ll take care of you, Rose.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.759
Where do you think you’re taking her?

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:35.720
And where are you taking her?

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960
I’m taking her home.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600
Are you sure this is the way to her home?

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.640
Before the accident, Uncle Thip called me.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.759
He told me about Mr.Wasupol proposing for your marriage with his son.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.479
But Uncle turned him down.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.000
Just tell her that you’re her fiance.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.600
Will she believe me though?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.560
She will if I tell her so.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.880
I think someone doesn’t want you to marry into our family.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.720
The one who’d be losing most benefits from our marriage is that rascal Din.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.240
Why is that?

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.240
Come on. We haven’t got any evidence. Let’s not accuse her like that.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:28.079
This is just our guess though. But Saen Rak farm owns the least acres of land.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.560
If they want to expand their business, they’d need some of the lands on your Chomchan farm.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.560
But I don’t think Din is that kind of person.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.720
Oh, Rose. Time can change people.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.240
Remember when she told me yesterday that Uncle Thip has asked her to look after you?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.440
That’s because she knew Uncle Thip is still in a coma, so she could just say anything.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.760
Besides, if anything happens to Uncle Thip, all his lands and properties will go to you.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.480
That’s why she wants to have you under her care.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.960
I’ll be careful then.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.160
Wasu and I will take care of you as best as we can.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.640
And I’m going to keep that promise I’ve made to your father.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.440
About the marriage, you can feel free to do as you please.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.960
I truly understand how you feel.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.680
Thank you for understanding, Uncle.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.160
You’re welcome.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.840
After we finish eating, why don’t you show her around our farm?

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.360
Sure, Dad.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.560
We grow two types of grapes here.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.560
One for making wine, and the other for eating them fresh.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.240
Help me! Help! Please help!

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.120
The worker on our farm. She’s lost her marbles, so we have to make sure she won’t get out and disturb anyone.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.360
Let’s go this way to see the vineyard.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.960
Our wines are made from the grapes we grow on our farm.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.240
Please trim out this part a bit. Thank you.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.320
Last year, our wine also won an award from France.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.159
Let’s have a look over there too.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.600
This is a wine tasting room.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.280
Customers will come here to try our wine before they’d buy it.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.000
So many wines you have here.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.360
Yes.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.480
This one is Cabernet Sauvignon from the year 2020.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.360
We made them the authentic French way. Do you know how?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.480
How?

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.600
We had them fermented in oak vats for 18 months.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.760
I’ve named this one ‘Rose Reserved’.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.640
I’ve named it after you.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.400
I want you to be the first one to try it.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.960
Fah, pour me two glasses.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.600
Thank you but…I don’t like drinking wine.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.040
Are you allergic to it?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.120
Yes, I’m allergic to alcohol. Just a sip can make my heart beat faster and feel dizzy.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.320
But our wine isn’t that strong though. Surely, just a sip would be fine.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.000
Please. I really want you to be the first one to try it.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.640
Just a tiny sip. You’ll be fine.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.040
But…

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040
Please don’t turn me down.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.080
Come. Cheers.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.520
Go on, try it.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.240
[Farm worker]: Mr. Wasu! Mr. Wasu!

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.000
What’s wrong?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.120
There’s a fire at the back of our farm–near the forest line between our farm and Miss Din’s farm.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.000
Is it serious?

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.400
Maybe you should go check it out.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.520
I’ll be right back then.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.400
Yes.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.960
Stop here.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.000
How did it happen?

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.680
The fire came from the other side of the forest.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.600
Luckily, we could put it out in time.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.200
Did those bastards do it?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.280
Not sure yet. By the time we came, we couldn’t see anyone but the fire.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.560
But the weather is quite dry these days. It might have caused the fire.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.560
[Farm worker]: Everything is done as you ordered, Miss Din.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.360
Did Wasu come to see it by himself?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.600
Yes, Miss.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.720
Fah, where’s Rose?

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.000
She already left.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.559
She left?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.920
Moddang!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.280
Miss Rose! Miss Din told me to come pick you up. Please get in the car.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.160
Are you hurt anywhere, Miss Rose?

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.720
No, I’m fine.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:32.560
We’re lucky Miss Din has asked someone from Saen Rak farm to keep watch over you.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.680
Someone from Saen Rak farm?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.920
Actually, he’s not a worker on the farm.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.240
But rather an undercover cop Miss Din has asked to keep watch over you.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.480
Din sent an undercover cop to follow me?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.960
Yes, when he saw that you had been gone for too long, he decided to report it to Miss Din.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.840
So, Miss Din told me to come pick you up. She said you’d come out soon.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.360
Does this mean Din is behind the fire at Wasu’s farm, Moddang?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.600
What fire? I have no idea. I just know Miss Din is so worried about you.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.200
There must be something going on. That’s why she sent the police to keep watch over me.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.800
But Wasu and his dad just told me that I can’t trust Din.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.720
Who should I trust then?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.880
Miss Din, of course. She’s pretty so she must be a good person.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.960
Moddang, you can’t just judge people by how they look.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.440
That Din I used to know might not be the same anymore.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.840
I can’t trust anyone right now.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.880
If you’re curious, why don’t you just ask her then?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.360
You can decide after hearing her answer. This way, you’ll also find out what else she knows.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.240
Where are you going, Miss Rose? Don’t you want me to drop you off?

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.640
Din, I was just about to go see you.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.400
I heard you went to Wasu’s place.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.760
Did you send someone to keep watch over me?

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.480
I’m sorry. I didn’t tell you because I thought it might’ve made you feel uncomfortable.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.560
Also, you’re a girl. Living alone on the farm is quite dangerous.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.040
If you’re not going to move to my farm, at least let me send someone to look after you.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.960
Thank you.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.080
But aren’t you going to ask why Mr. Wasupol wanted to talk to me?

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.520
I know you’ll tell me if you want to.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:56.960
He said my dad has promised him that I will marry Wasu.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:04.120
He also said that I can’t trust you. And that I should stay away from you.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.440
But then you also told me that Dad has asked you to look after me.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.840
Who should I trust then?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.120
Watinwanich or Mahattanakorn?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.000
You or Wasu?

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.680
I don’t know. It’s up to you.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.120
Aren’t you going to tell me to trust Watinwanich?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.200
It’s your choice to decide whom you’ll trust. I can’t decide it for you.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.000
You’re all grown up now. You can decide for yourself.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.480
What if I chose Mahattanakorn?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.280
What would you say?

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.880
Then, I’d respect your decision.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.600
But haven’t you promised my dad that you’ll take care of me?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.960
Even if you choose Mahattanakorn, I’ll find a way to protect you in my own way.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.920
Aren’t you going to tell me that Mattanakorn are bad people?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:17.440
And that I should be careful about them just like how Wasu told me to be careful about you.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.640
I want you to decide for yourself, from what you see and how you feel.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.960
I have one last question then.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.400
Are you hiding something from me?

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.200
Does it have anything to do with Mr. Wasupol? Why are you so worried…

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.720
that you sent an undercover cop to keep watch over me?

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.280
Mr. Wasupol is involved in human trafficking.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.120
He wants the land on your farm to use as a route for smuggling people across the border.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.280
He kept pushing about your marriage with his son.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.880
But your dad found out and turned him down.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.040
He was looking into this matter…

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.360
when the accident happened.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.880
I can’t say anything much since I don’t have evidence.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.240
[Din]: Mr. Wasupol is involved in human trafficking.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.440
He wants the land on your farm to use as a route for smuggling people across the border.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.320
[A girl’s shouting]: Help me! Help! Let me go! Help!

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.520
The worker on our farm. She’s lost her marbles, so we have to make sure she won’t get out and disturb anyone.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.600
Let’s go this way to see the vineyard.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.600
About my offer to have you under my care, I want you to make up your mind as soon as you can.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.920
Oh.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.360
Wow, if it’s this much then why don’t you just bring it to Miss Rose yourself?

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.040
Why keep it a secret?

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.640
I’m afraid it’d make her feel awkward.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.840
It wouldn’t make me feel awkward.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.240
I’ll go put these things in the house then.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160
I’m just…dropping by to give you some stuff. I’d get going then.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.160
You’re going somewhere?

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.280
I’m going to visit Uncle Thip.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.200
That’s good. I’m about to go see him too. I’m coming with you then.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.560
You might want to buckle up?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:29.120
Dad, it’s me–Rose. Din is also here.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.160
Uncle Thip, it’s me–Din.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.480
Since when I was little, I’ve always trusted you in every decision you’ve made.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.680
I know you’ll always choose the best for me.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:03.280
Today, I’m going to trust you and let her do what you’ve asked her to do.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.480
What do you mean, Rose?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.120
I want to be under your care.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.200
I chose Watinwanich.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.760
Are you okay, Din?

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.920
Why did you choose to trust me?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.120
Because of what you said, what I saw, and memories I have about you.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.280
I want to get on a boat.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.800
You can’t.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.320
Uncle said we should never get you on a boat.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.960
I don’t see why. The water is really shallow. Come with me, Rose.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.680
I said no.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.440
I’m not going then.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.720
Uncle said you can.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.280
That’s not true.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.640
Uncle said we should never let her get on a boat.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.840
Don’t listen to her. Come with me. Uncle wouldn't mind it.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.560
You can’t!

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.080
I’ve promised Uncle that I’ll look after Rose, and won’t let her do something that might put her in danger.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.280
Don’t be a coward.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.320
I said you can’t!

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.640
I was the one who told her never to get Rose on a boat.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.800
She can barely swim.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.000
Thank you so much, Din.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.600
You’re welcome.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.760
Since when we were little, Dad has always trusted you to look after me.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:20.480
Also, that expression in your eyes when you try to protect me still looks the same as back then.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.480
Thank you.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.880
It’s almost lunchtime now, do you want to eat anything?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.720
I’m not hungry yet. Can you take me back to the farm?

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.360
Sure.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.600
[Saen Rak farm]

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.120
Why are you taking me to your farm?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.480
Let’s eat.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.120
I’m not hungry.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.440
But it’s time to eat. You should always have your meal on time.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.080
I can go back and eat at my place.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.640
Right now, there isn’t anyone there to prepare the food for you. Just eat here.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.280
I already told Aunt Chan to prepare it for you.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.920
Hm? When did you tell her?

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.720
After we finish eating, I’ll take you back to your farm. Come on then.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.200
This way.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.560
Thank you.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.680
It’s been a long time, Miss Rose. You’re a lady now. And a really beautiful one too.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.920
You knew me when I was a kid?

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.520
Of course, I’ve been working here for over 20 years now.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.360
When you two were still kids, you often came here to play with Miss Din.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.800
I’m sorry I can’t remember you at all. I must have been very little back then.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.840
Oh, it’s all right.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.480
When Miss Din called and told me you’d be coming, I was so excited and cooked all these for you.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.280
They’re all my favourites.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520
Miss Din told me so.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.160
Hope you’ll enjoy the food then.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.080
Thank you.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.760
Hmm, your cooking is amazing, Aunt Chan.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.080
I really miss Thai food with this kind of taste.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.760
I’m glad you like it, Miss. Please enjoy your food then.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.960
Eat some vegetables too. Don’t just eat the meat.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.720
Do you know you sound like a discipline teacher just now?

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.920
Me?

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.880
Yes.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.120
Hello?

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.600
Right now? Okay, I’ll be right there.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.240
Rose, please wait here. I have to go to the office first.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.400
Eat first, then you can go to work.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.960
I’m not hungry.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:35.600
But it’s time to eat. You should always have your meal on time.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.640
If you’re going to get back at me like that, I’m afraid I’ll have to eat then.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.800
Good.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.280
Aunt Chan.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:46.920
Yes?

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.320
Can you please bring me a plate?

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.640
Yes, Miss.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.400
As a vegetable farm owner, you should also eat lots of them.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.920
Fine.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.520
Where’s Rose?

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.560
She’s not here.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.840
Liar. She must be here.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.560
- Rose!
- You can’t go in, Mr. Wasu!

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.040
- Get off me.
- Mr. Wasu.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.040
Rose!

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.240
You can’t go in, Mr. Wasu!

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.080
- Rose!
- You can’t go in there!

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.600
- Mr. Wasu!
- Rose!

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.120
Get off me. Rose! Rose!

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.440
You can’t come in here! Don’t!

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.320
Move! Rose!

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.760
You can’t go up there!

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.240
Get off me. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.400
- Rose!
- You can’t go up there.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.600
I said fuck off!

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.000
Miss Din took her to visit her dad at the hospital.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.800
That brat again?

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.920
After hearing what I told her yesterday, she still wants to go with that rascal Din?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.040
This means she doesn’t believe us at all.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.160
Or that brat has probably filled her head with some lies.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.240
It seems Rose isn’t as naive as I thought.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.280
I don’t think we can use a gentle approach on her.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.720
The police have been keeping their eyes on us lately.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.440
That side also keeps rushing us to change the smuggling route.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.200
The land by the river on Chomchan farm is our only way out.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.120
Do you understand what I mean?

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.720
Yes.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.080
Let’s just say I’ll try to make Rose mine as soon as possible.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.120
Don’t mess up again.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.360
Or else you’ll get us all in deep shit.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.200
Yes, Dad.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.240
Please come in, Miss Rose.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.600
How many people live here? Why is it so quiet?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.320
Only Miss Din lives here.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.560
After her father passed away,

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:51.280
Miss Din had to take over his business, and has been looking after this farm alone since when she was still in college.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.120
She takes care of everything alone?

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:01.960
Yes. But fortunately, your father–Mr. Thip–was also there to give her advice on many things.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.840
She was having a really hard time back then.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.680
But she stayed strong and finally went through it.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.560
That’s why she seems quiet and reserved, unlike when she was a kid.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.440
Who’s this girl in the photo?

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.360
Oh, that’s Miss Din’s cousin.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:50.000
Mr. Kasidit’s younger brother’s daughter. The one on the left next to Miss Din is Miss Nam.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.360
The one on the right is Miss Din. And Miss Fai.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.640
They all look so cute.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.240
Yes, so adorable indeed.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.400
I’m sure you’ll meet them soon.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.920
Have you been waiting long?

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:14.960
Miss Din.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.040
Not at all. I’m secretly pressing for information about your family.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.720
Did you get any then?

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.400
I’m not familiar with some of them, so I was asking her who is who.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.720
Miss Din, let me excuse myself then.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.480
These three are my younger sisters.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.720
They come here once in a while.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.440
They are all good-looking.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.240
Does this gene only run in your family?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.120
You’re so lucky.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.400
To have so many cousins.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.280
Unlike me. It makes me feel lonely sometimes.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.120
You still have me, Rose.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.520
Do you want to go back now? I’ll give you a ride.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.760
Yes.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.480
Let’s go.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.360
Miss Rose! Miss!

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.840
What is it, Moddang?

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.040
Mr. Wasu and his men just came here.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.600
I told him you weren’t home but he didn’t believe me.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.880
He even went into the house to look for you.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.640
I tried to stop him but he never listened.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.440
Wasu dared trespassing into my house?

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.960
Din, what should I do?

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.600
That’s right, what should we do?

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.600
What if he came here again? There are only us girls here.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.800
Come stay with me at Saen Rak farm.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.400
You want me to move there?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.400
We have to deal with the situation at hand first.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.080
I’ll think of a way to deal with the rest.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.360
But what if I moved there and caused you and your people troubles?

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.040
My people and I will protect you.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.000
Have you finished packing?

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.200
Yes. I didn’t bring much from the US anyway.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.640
I plan to buy whatever I might need here.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.520
Your farm and mine are only a second away. If you forget anything, we can always come back and get it later.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.360
I told Moddang that too.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.120
But she’s packing like she’s going to live there for good.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:43.200
I love it here so much, because these roses were planted by my mum.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.120
Your mum must surely love roses.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.480
Yes, that’s why my parents named their daughter “Rose”.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.080
My dad said that roses are not only pretty,

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.280
but they also have thorns to protect themselves.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.040
He really picked the perfect name for you.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.760
What abou you? Why did your parents name you “Din”?

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.280
I was born preterm.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.719
So they named me Din to ward off the bad luck.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.600
My real name, Kasama, also means earth.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.400
Because they want me to grow up to be strong and steady like the earth.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.960
Your parents also picked a perfect name for you.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.239
You’ve surely grown up to be a strong girl.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.320
And even looked after me since when I was young.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.320
Din.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.400
Can I come back here to tend to my mum’s roses sometimes?

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.320
Dad isn’t here now.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:56.320
I want to make sure these roses that represent my parent’s love are well taken care of.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.800
Of course.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.960
I’ll take you here every day.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.800
Thank you.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.480
Let me go, Mr. Wasu!

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.160
Then fucking tell me where Rose is!

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.040
I don’t know!

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.440
Where has that brat taken her to?

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.800
I really don’t know!

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.520
It’s your home, how can you not know?

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.160
Miss Rose! Please help me!

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.000
Moddang.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.520
Where are you taking her?

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.920
It’s none of your business.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.840
What fucking right do you have to take her away from me? She’s my fiance-to-be.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.280
- Back off!
- Move!

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.840
Miss Rose!

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:43.040
Come with me! If you keep being stubborn, I’m not going to be nice to you then.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.000
Let me go! It hurts.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Let her go!

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.920
A sissy like you…

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.640
can’t even shoot a limping dog.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.800
You think you can shoot me? You’re just a sissy like your fucking dad!

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.000
Fuck, Din!

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.320
Did you just try to shoot me?

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.560
Stay away from her, or you’ll get to eat my bullet next time.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.680
You, mark my words. Those who want to be my enemies will never die in peace!

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.400
Are you okay, Rose? Are you hurt anywhere?

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.760
You’re safe now.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.000
Do you usually carry a gun with you all the time?

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:28.160
Not really. It’s just that we’ve been on bad terms with Nubanun farm lately.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.440
So, I have to carry it with me just in case…

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.480
I might need it to protect myself and the people I love.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.880
I mean those people on our farms and everyone under my care.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:52.960
Yes.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.800
You’ve changed a lot.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.400
Maybe because I don’t want my late parents to worry about me.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.520
Then don’t get yourself hurt like this again.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.360
I don’t want to keep fixing the wound for you.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.280
My dad also said that to me.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.680
Din, why have you never told me you were bullied?

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.760
I don’t want to worry you.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.480
It’s my fault that I’m weak. I can’t fight them, so I get bullied.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.320
Din, it’s true that I’ve always taught you to be nice to others.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.600
But that doesn’t mean you always have to give in and let them hurt you.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.440
But Wasu is much bigger than me. I’m just a girl, I can’t fight him.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.200
You don’t always need to use your physical strength to fight with someone.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.720
If you’re smaller and can’t fight his strength, then use your wits and your brain to fight with him instead.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.320
Yes.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:20.440
When I’m no longer around to protect you, I want to be sure that you can protect yourself.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.080
Because I can’t look after you forever.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.000
Yes, I’m not going to let Wasu bully me again.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.360
I want you to grow up happily and be able to take care of yourself.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:39.640
I want my little Kasama to become strong and able to protect herself, and never let anyone bully her.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.720
But don’t forget to always protect those who are bullied too.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.760
Does it still hurt?

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.840
Just a little.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.520
It’ll heal in a few days.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.520
I’m so sorry for being the cause you got hurt.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.000
No, it was because of Wasu.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.440
You don’t have to try to make me feel less guilty.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.960
I’m not saying it to make you feel less guilty.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.320
But the one who is wrong here is Wasu.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:31.400
Thank you. But it still worries me how Wasu has threatened us like that.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.920
Rose, please rest assured you’ll be safe here.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.960
I already told my people to never let Wasu and his men ever step foot into our farm.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.440
But I’m worried about you.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.880
You’re…worried about me?

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.200
Can you promise me that you’ll be careful?

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.440
Don’t go anywhere alone, and never let your guards down.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.120
Yes, I promise I’ll be more careful.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:26.840
[Saen Rak farm]

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.800
Aunt Chan has already prepared a room for you.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.120
It’s over here.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.840
As for Moddang, your room is at the back right next to Aunt Chan’s room.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.800
Yes, Miss. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.000
Thank you, Din.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.240
I usually live here alone. Aunt Chan will often come in to help with the chores.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.400
Please make yourself comfortable. Think of it as your own home.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.880
If you need anything, you can tell Aunt Chan.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.840
Please feel free to let me know. You can always call for me, Miss Rose.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.680
Thank you, Aunt Chan.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.040
You’re welcome.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.520
I’ll go put my things in the room then.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.800
I’ll take you there.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.760
Thank you.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.000
Do you want to take a look around my farm?

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.760
Sure.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.920
Let’s put your bag in the room first, and I’ll show you around.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.080
Okay.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.400
These vegetables look so yummy.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.360
If you want any of them, feel free to take them back.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.560
Vegetables here are fresh and chemical-free.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.280
So fresh indeed. That’s a big fat caterpillar there.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.960
I don’t see any.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.600
- Where’s it?
- There.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.240
My vegetables are really fresh and clean.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.360
I believe you.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.200
How do you manage to look after a farm this big?

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.120
You’re amazing. I don’t think I’d be able to do it.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.640
Well, it’s not that hard.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.920
You only need a good management plan to run the farm. That’d help make our work a lot easier.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.960
You have to take care of many things on the farm, and you still have to look after me too.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.120
That’s not a problem at all.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:13.160
But I only need you to do one thing for me.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.440
What is it?

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:21.520
I want you to have your meal on time. Three meals a day. And eat some vegetables too.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.200
I’m not a kid anymore…

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.960
to get fussy whenever I have to eat my food or vegetables.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:34.760
So, does that mean you’re not going to cry if I make you eat vegetables?

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.240
Yes!

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.240
You’re quite serious about eating, aren’t you?

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.360
Does this mean you always have your meal on time?

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.760
Well, I do forget to eat sometimes, especially when I’m busy with work.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.760
You still can’t do it yourself. And you want to make me do it?

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.200
I don’t want your dad to think that I’m not taking good care of you.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:07.640
Now I’m wondering if I’ve made the right decision to be under your care.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.600
You’re so strict even about eating.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.840
I’m only strict with you though.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.480
Be careful!

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.000
Are you all right?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.360
I’m fine. Thank you.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.880
If you no longer want to be under my care,

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.160
you can always change your mind anytime.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.680
I don’t want to make you feel like you have no choice but to stay with me.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.520
I want to tell you that too.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:04.320
If one day you ever get tired of looking after me, you don’t have to worry about breaking your promise with my dad.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.240
You can always call it off and tell me honestly.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.680
I’m sure I won’t be the one who calls it off.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.360
Since that day when I’ve given your dad my words, I knew what I’ll have to go through.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.600
I’ll stop caring for you only when you tell me so.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.080
That girl’s got the nerve to do that to you?

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.240
Yes, Dad. And now Rose has moved in to stay with her.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.160
All because of that bastard. She has ruined our plan.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.080
How dared her, insulting me in front of Rose like that.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.280
Things won’t be easy for us from now on.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.440
Miss Din.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.280
Are you excited because a friend is sleeping over?

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.240
What is it, Din?

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.880
Before you came, this room was left empty for a while.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:51.080
So, I brought you a reed diffuser to make the air less stuffy.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.520
Do you want to come in first? I’m still not used to the place so I’m not sleepy yet.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.040
I’ll put it here then.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.880
Is there anything else you need?

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.680
No.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:40.160
If you ever need anything, you can always let me know.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.720
Excuse me.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.160
I saw you sneezing earlier so I brought you an air purifier from my room.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.120
I’ll put it in your room.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.360
Thank you.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:12.640
I’m afraid you might get cold, so I brought you more blankets.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.360
I’ve also prepared some snacks for you in the fridge. In case you’re hungry at night.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.040
I don’t know if you prefer your pillow soft or firm.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.640
I brought you a bolster in case you might want something to hug while you sleep.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.840
If you’re going to worry this much, why don’t you come and sleep here then?

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.760
Are you sure?

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.320
I’m kidding.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.560
Or do you want Moddang to come and stay with you?

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.360
It’s okay.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.680
Well, let me know if you need anything. I’ll have someone get it for you.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.640
I’ve bothered you a lot already.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.200
Don’t say that. It’s not a bother at all.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:17.360
Once this is all over, I promise to return you all the favours for everything you’ve done for me and my dad.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.200
I’m helping you not because I want anything in return.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.960
I know you’re not that kind of person.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.480
But I really want to do something for you too.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.240
If you really want to return me the favour,

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.200
just take good care of yourself.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:46.400
I want nothing but for you to be safe.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.360
I’ll go back to my room then. Please get some rest.

00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.640
Din.

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.000
Thank you for always protecting me.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.880
[Rose]: But I’m worried about you.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.080
Can you promise me that you’ll be careful?

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:38.520
Don’t go anywhere alone. And never let your guards down.

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.920
- That’s a big fat caterpillar there.
- Where is it?

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:11.880
There.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.080
[Din]: Be careful!

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.960
Do we have a guest today? Why is there so much food?

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.760
Oh, they’re all for you, Miss.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.280
Huh?

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.800
Miss Din doesn’t know what kind of breakfast you prefer.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.880
So, she told me to prepare an international course for you.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.160
She just wants to please you, Miss.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.680
Please have a seat.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.640
Where’s Din?

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.880
She already left for work.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.720
She wants you to have a good rest. That’s why she didn’t wake you up.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:50.320
She was up so early this morning though. I suspect she didn’t have much sleep.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.840
She’s probably excited to have you here with her.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.480
Usually, she lives here alone.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.800
But deep down, I think she’s quite lonely.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.800
She must be so happy to have you here.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:11.160
Last night, I saw her keep pacing back and forth in front of your room and not going to bed even when it was late.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.080
I see.

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.440
Is she working on the farm? I’ll make some desserts for her.

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.840
Oh no, Miss. She’s gone to Chiang Mai to see her client.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.480
Din is in Chaing Mai?

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.800
Mr. Wasu, Din has already gone to Chiang Mai.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.080
Tell our men to proceed with the plan.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.680
Yes, sir.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.480
Thank you very much. Please don’t forget to consider what we’ve discussed earlier.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.080
About sending your vegetables to my shop.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.800
That’d be our pleasure.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.400
I’ll have to excuse myself then.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.080
Yes.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.960
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Until next time.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.880
Yes.

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.320
The negotiation went well this time. We’ve settled the deal faster than expected.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.640
Do you want to go to the hotel now? I already booked a room for you.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.120
It’s not that late. I think we should go back to the farm.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.080
I’m sorry, Kaew.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.880
Don’t worry, Miss.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.760
Usually, you’d stay for a night and go back home the next morning.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.520
But this time you want to hurry home because you worry about Miss Rose, don’t you?

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.360
I truly understand why though.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.840
Mr. Thipakorn is still in a coma.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.520
And we still don’t know what those guys on Nubanun farm are up to.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.640
By the way, have you got anything on what I’ve asked you to look into?

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:12.880
Not yet, Miss. That family is incredibly powerful indeed.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:18.080
If their workers on the farm ever do anything wrong, they can always sneak across the border and take refuge there.

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.600
It’s quite tough to track them down.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.240
Then I guess we have to lure them into the trap.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.760
What are you going to do?

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.160
Let’s go home.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.360
Let me drive then.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.480
It’s okay.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.680
You already drove us here. I’ll drive this time.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.600
Let me carry the ipad for you then.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.560
Miss Din, looks like we’ve been followed by a motorcycle.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.440
It’s been tailing after us from the city center.

00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:29.160
You knew?

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.360
That’s intentional!

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.400
Miss Din!

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:17.080
♫ You’ll always have me by your side ♫

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.800
♫ In this marriage that our love will last forever♫

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:25.080
♫ I promise I’ll give you all my heart♫

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.960
♫ Remember when I said…♫

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.000
♫ That I’ll take great care of you♫

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:41.960
♫ I promise those words will always stay true♫

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.240
[Next Episode]
I’ll do anything to expose them and their illicit trade.

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.560
The police mightn’t be able to help us, but the journalists can.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:55.520
Lom, I’ll send you all the information in case you might want to look further into it.

00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.000
That’s a lot of benefits they’d gain. They’re gonna do everything to acquire her land.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.920
I’m going to make Wasu change his target.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.840
You have to marry Rose.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.840
Make them think that it’s you who owns everything, not Rose.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.560
Moddang, yesterday Din…

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.200
Miss Din what?

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.640
Please marry me.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.200
She proposed to me.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.360
♫Your touch burns a flame so bright,♫

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.720
♫Your warm embrace♫

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:54.240
♫Cools me down like ocean waves♫

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:01.560
♫A breeze so light, makes me wanna fly away♫

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:08.760
♫You keep me grounded, peaceful, and safe♫

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:15.200
♫Take my hand and just believe♫
