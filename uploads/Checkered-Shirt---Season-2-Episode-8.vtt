WEBVTT

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.798
Why did you do that?

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.843
Do what?

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.471
Why did you fight instead of me?

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.807
Who do you think you are?

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.521
Do you want to go to the holding cell again?

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.985
Are you always like this?

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.821
How did you know?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.622
Is that important?

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.343
Hangyeol.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.180
Someone's messing with my person,

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.559
what crazy guy would just stay still?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.986
It's really easy to make someone look like a fool.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.157
You have strong pride, you know.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.243
Your wounds that you didn't want to show...

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:21.581
I didn't want to just carelessly say I knew about them.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:26.961
That's all.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.845
You weren't shaken?

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.724
By the rumors?

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:45.355
Me? Why?

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.318
I waited.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.571
For you to sort things out,

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:57.617
and tell me yourself someday...

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.165
But I'm sorry.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.293
For not contacting you

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.296
and making you wait aimlessly.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:16.636
I didn't know that would become a wound too.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.912
I won't let you go anymore.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.668
Now I'll hold onto you.

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.900
I missed you.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:20.134
Hangyeol.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.514
It's snowing like crazy here in Gangwon-do.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.474
Since coming to the army,

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.559
I think I shovel snow more than I train.

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.520
How did you endure this?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.772
Ah, I told you to stop reading~

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:37.944
Ah, what a waste.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:38.987
What is?

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:42.282
That I'm reading these fun letters only now.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.325
This is funnier than stand-up comedy.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.119
See?

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.745
Who told you to move without a word?

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:49.747
And change your number too?

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.840
If this letter had arrived properly back then,

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.801
would we have not broken up?

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.678
Who knows?

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.179
Do you think waiting for a boyfriend in the army is easy?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.019
But how did you keep all these letters?

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.939
That jerk Jaeseop had them. Guess he felt guilty.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.774
I heard he visited your place a few times.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.693
But since I found out way later,

00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:21.362
I was seriously pissed off.

00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:24.657
No really, I almost became a 'soldier of concern' in the army.

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:27.744
I suffered too, you know.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.911
I wasn't even in the army,

00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:31.331
I lived alone abroad.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.042
Living alone abroad,

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.127
do you know how hard that is?

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.254
But why Japan?

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.132
You said you'd transfer to our university.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.054
I was afraid you'd come find me.

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:49.140
Afraid Hyung would come find me.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.977
That you'd throw away your pride and everything to come.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.023
Do you know the taste of Takoyaki when you eat it crying?

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.984
You're really cruel, Lee Hangyeol.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.362
So be good to me.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:04.447
If I get upset,

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:08.117
I'm going to eat Takoyaki alone.

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:11.079
I'm sorry, okay?

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.373
I'm sorry, hmm?

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:18.252
I think I'm going to really hate winter from now on.

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.087
Let's stop reading.

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:24.217
You hate winter?

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.682
Seems like you two are back together.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.603
It turned out that way.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:37.939
Why do you keep smiling?

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:39.649
It's annoying.

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:42.235
It's thanks to you, Yuchan.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:46.155
For staying by Hangyeol's side

00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:48.783
and doing what I couldn't do.

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.161
Forget it.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.748
I just did what I wanted to do.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:06:59.877
But...

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:03.339
seeing Hangyeol laugh,

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:06.759
makes me feel good.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.054
Still, thank you.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.393
If only Jaeseop hadn't caused a drunken scene that day...

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.062
Why did I even drink...

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:20.857
You should tell him to fix his drinking habits.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.233
Exactly.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.110
Hey, you're not even a party involved,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.194
talking like that, huh?

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:27.530
Is it okay to talk about others like that?

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.245
Take good care of him.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.998
Of Hangyeol.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:40.960
Yes, I promise.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:44.797
Or else I'm taking him back.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:02.940
Back then and now,

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:07.069
you still leave your clothes lying around anywhere.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.294
Huh?

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.755
Hyung, when did you get here?

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.965
Just now.

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:43.439
What were you doing just now?

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:44.690
Like a pervert.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:48.069
What pervert...

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.575
It's been a long time smelling Hyung's scent.

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:56.118
Right, a pervert.

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:07.380
Have you ever seen such a pretty pervert?

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:15.721
Did you get prettier than before?

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:24.605
What's with that all of a sudden?

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.862
This time, really without regrets,

00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:34.073
laugh a lot,

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.951
be honest,

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.621
travel anywhere together,

00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:41.455
and for a long, long time

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:43.749
stay by my side.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.470
Let's date.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.806
Park Jeongwoo.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:41.974
Hyung!

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:46.729
Sunglasses?

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.773
How is it? Cool, right?

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.232
Just bought them.

00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:51.901
Hmm... we're going to Jeju,

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.736
isn't that too flashy?

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:55.363
If you don't like it, forget it.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.490
Hyung must not want to put in effort.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.825
I didn't say I don't like it.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.872
Shall we go?

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:05.998
Yeah.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.541
I'll carry it.
