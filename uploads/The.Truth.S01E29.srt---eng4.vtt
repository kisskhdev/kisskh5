=Episode 29=

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:40.726
Enough.

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:42.286
Take a rest here.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.566
We're almost at Lei's place.

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.286
How about we grab some breakfast
and take a break?

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:49.726
Okay.

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:51.927
Easy now.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:55.767
Jing, Lei.

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:56.526
You're here.

00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:58.286
We were just talking about you two.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:07.207
Dumplings are ready.

00:03:07.327 --> 00:03:08.406
Here, eat it.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.047
How did you know we were coming?

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:17.487
I sent Ye Qian a message

00:03:17.526 --> 00:03:19.487
and told him to bring you over
for breakfast.

00:03:21.207 --> 00:03:25.367
No wonder he woke me up so early
to go running with him.

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:26.966
Try them.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.216
I made them early this morning.

00:03:30.406 --> 00:03:32.207
Here. Try cold dishes I just made.

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.047
Eat up. There's more in the pot.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:34.806
This is yours.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.246
Wait, this is too few.

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:38.286
You eat less.

00:03:38.286 --> 00:03:39.607
Or, your blood lipids will spike.

00:03:40.047 --> 00:03:40.487
Thanks.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.246
Take your time.

00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:48.167
How well you and Jing are living.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:49.966
Of course.

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:52.327
We've been together
for most of our lives.

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:54.566
Mutual support
through thick and thin, understand?

00:03:57.087 --> 00:03:58.126
Ye Qian, what's wrong?

00:03:58.726 --> 00:04:00.447
I've been watching you.

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:04.286
You're completely absorbed in cases,
yet have no personal life.

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:07.406
Gone.

00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:08.887
He got dumped.

00:04:09.286 --> 00:04:10.726
No personal life anymore.

00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:13.526
You can't follow your master's example.

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:15.767
He's a blockhead,

00:04:16.127 --> 00:04:17.887
totally fixated on cases.

00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:19.726
You're still young.

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:22.046
You need both work and a life.

00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:25.207
Lei, don't worry.

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:25.966
I'm doing fine.

00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:27.647
Alright, eat up.

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:30.327
The dumpling filling is good.

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:32.247
Of course, I made them.

Captain Leng.

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:42.406
We found Wen Yong's phone and wallet.

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:44.166
Where were they?

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.687
In the green belt at Central Park.

00:04:45.687 --> 00:04:48.286
A landscaping worker found them
while spraying pesticide.

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:49.846
Then he put them at Lost and Found.

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:51.846
Central Park?

00:04:51.846 --> 00:04:52.406
Yes.

00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:55.046
How far is it
from where Wen Yong disappeared?

00:04:55.447 --> 00:04:56.687
About one intersection away,

00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:57.528
hundreds of meters.

00:05:00.207 --> 00:05:01.447
I don't know. I just got here.

00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:02.606
I need to ask around.

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:04.447
What's going on?

00:05:15.846 --> 00:05:17.807
Where exactly did you
find the wallet and watch?

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:19.647
Right under that tree up ahead.

00:05:21.846 --> 00:05:22.846
Roughly what time?

00:05:23.207 --> 00:05:24.526
Don't remember the exact time.

00:05:24.726 --> 00:05:25.966
Found anything else?

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:26.966
No.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:35.966
Wang Tong, found something.

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:41.327
Dig.

00:05:41.647 --> 00:05:42.207
Yes.

00:05:58.286 --> 00:05:59.486
Hello, Captain Leng.

00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:01.767
No body has been found here
at Central Park so far.

00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:04.007
This spot is a blind spot for cameras.

00:06:04.007 --> 00:06:04.846
Capture nothing.

00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:06.687
I asked around.

00:06:06.687 --> 00:06:09.606
Footage from park entrances, exits,
and main paths clears weekly.

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:12.046
Even if they captured anything,
it's likely long gone.

00:06:13.726 --> 00:06:15.327
Okay, got it.

Are you doing okay overseas?

00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:54.286
I'm doing fine.

00:06:54.926 --> 00:06:55.767
Where's Dad?

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.327
I have something to ask him.

00:06:58.486 --> 00:06:59.687
It was quite a while ago.

00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:02.046
Probably when I was
in elementary school.

00:08:49.688 --> 00:08:51.448
(Demolish)

00:08:56.047 --> 00:08:58.287
How can we work then?

00:08:58.687 --> 00:08:59.966
Might as well just move out.

00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:03.006
Jiang Yue, you're back.

00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:10.366
Anyway, I took tomorrow off.

00:09:10.846 --> 00:09:12.047
Few orders lately.

00:09:12.047 --> 00:09:13.752

will go under anyway.

Watch out!

00:10:47.486 --> 00:10:49.006
Such a good factory.,

00:10:49.006 --> 00:10:51.087
why did it explode?

00:10:51.486 --> 00:10:53.087
- What a shame.
- Really.

00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.167
A factory's just gone like that.

00:10:55.167 --> 00:10:57.486
Right, why did it explode?

00:10:57.927 --> 00:11:00.606
That child was so young. Right?

00:11:00.606 --> 00:11:01.527
Exactly.

00:11:02.207 --> 00:11:03.287
So pitiful.

00:11:03.646 --> 00:11:04.407
Right.

00:11:16.486 --> 00:11:18.126
I knew that factory was a time bomb.

00:11:18.126 --> 00:11:19.207
Please restrain your grief.

00:11:19.207 --> 00:11:20.287
Look on the bright side.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.126
We're here for you.

00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:26.327
I heard the factory owner and his wife
were inside when it happened.

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:27.807
I heard they were blown apart.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:30.407
How pitiful.

00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:32.088
Their child was only
in elementary school.

00:12:29.327 --> 00:12:30.126
Jiang Yue!

00:12:31.246 --> 00:12:32.167
Jiang Yue!

00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:33.646
Jiang Yue!

00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:37.047
Jiang Yue! Where has that kid gone?

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.167
Come with me.

00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:29.527
Master.

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.126
I made some inquiries.

00:13:35.846 --> 00:13:37.927
Cheng Jianmin's business grew so big

00:13:38.447 --> 00:13:39.807
largely because

00:13:39.966 --> 00:13:42.447
he developed
the Dongfeng Cultural Plaza project.

00:13:43.006 --> 00:13:46.966
Back then, a firework factory
on that land refused to relocate.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.567
The project stalled.

00:13:49.167 --> 00:13:50.886
Then that factory exploded.

00:13:51.006 --> 00:13:52.646
The owner and his wife
died in the blast.

00:13:52.646 --> 00:13:53.567
The factory closed.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:56.248
The black powder

00:13:57.112 --> 00:13:59.726
used in the urban village arson
came from fireworks.

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:03.527
You suspect Cheng Jianmin
rigged it back then?

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:08.366
That factory's production safety permit
had just expired at that moment,

00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:10.807
so the incident was ruled
an industrial accident.

00:14:11.447 --> 00:14:13.167
But what I heard is

00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:16.606
Cheng Jianmin bribed a worker
to trigger the explosion.

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:18.726
Is this intel reliable?

00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:23.646
My dad's friend
was one of the project partners then.

00:14:24.006 --> 00:14:27.366
He heard Cheng Jianmin
bribed a factory worker

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.408
to trigger the explosion,

00:14:28.527 --> 00:14:30.606
using a cell phone
to manipulate when to drop

00:14:30.606 --> 00:14:31.927
the sodium metal into water.

00:14:32.047 --> 00:14:34.407
With all the fireworks stored there,

00:14:34.687 --> 00:14:36.486
the phone was completely incinerated,

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:39.366
and that worker had an alibi.

00:14:39.527 --> 00:14:42.246
It's very difficult to verify
with the techniques at that time.

00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:43.966
Years passed,

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:47.327
that worker killed himself, leaving
a suicide note confessing his guilt.

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:50.366
The note detailed how he did it.

00:14:50.366 --> 00:14:52.886
He didn't name who hired him,

00:14:53.006 --> 00:14:55.207
but people suspected Cheng Jianmin.

00:15:01.207 --> 00:15:05.207
It happened over 20 years ago.

00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:08.927
Even if Cheng Jianmin was involved,

00:15:10.207 --> 00:15:13.807
we can't find any solid evidence now.

00:15:16.966 --> 00:15:21.126
The accident caused the death
of the factory owner and his wife.

00:15:22.006 --> 00:15:26.687
If their family knew the role
Cheng Jianmin played in this accident,

00:15:28.087 --> 00:15:29.766
they'd have sufficient reason to kill.

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:34.726
It's been so long already.

00:15:35.527 --> 00:15:37.886
Even if someone held a grudge
against him,

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:40.527
why wait so long?

00:15:43.966 --> 00:15:46.126
Maybe they just found out,

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:51.126
or something changed their mind.

00:15:53.087 --> 00:15:53.726
Master.

00:15:54.846 --> 00:15:58.047
The killer chose to blow up
the rental house in the same way.

00:15:58.047 --> 00:16:00.486
It points to the victims' family
seeking revenge.

00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:03.207
Cheng Jianmin's death
was just the beginning.

00:16:10.712 --> 00:16:12.600
(Yu Xiao'ou Case)

00:17:07.686 --> 00:17:08.926
Hello.

00:17:09.646 --> 00:17:10.646
Why are you still alive?

00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:12.166
Why don't you just die?

00:17:13.406 --> 00:17:16.007
People like you deserve
to be struck by lightning.

00:17:16.567 --> 00:17:17.767
Watch out when it storms.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:36.007
Hello, this is the...

00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:38.206
Hello?

00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:40.967
People are so rude nowadays.

00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:42.886
Hanging up mid-sentence.

00:17:49.926 --> 00:17:50.646
How's it going?

00:17:50.646 --> 00:17:51.406
Found any?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.166
I've still got way to go.
What about you?

00:17:55.886 --> 00:17:56.606
Come on.

00:17:56.807 --> 00:17:59.247
I've been transferred for several times.

00:17:59.247 --> 00:18:00.807
Wonder if I can even reach the person.

00:18:03.807 --> 00:18:04.846
Hello.

00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:05.727
Yes, hello.

00:18:05.727 --> 00:18:06.886
Police.

00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:08.166
Are you Yang Zheng?

00:18:08.846 --> 00:18:09.567
Check it.

00:18:10.087 --> 00:18:12.886
Here are the hot social events
recently I summarized

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:16.007
based on your requirements.

00:18:16.248 --> 00:18:18.366
Considering the preparation time
the killer needs,

00:18:18.366 --> 00:18:20.727
I've ruled out those
happened in the past week.

00:18:24.846 --> 00:18:26.126
Can't rule out more?

00:18:30.967 --> 00:18:32.087
I wish.

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:35.446
Think about it. If we rule out more
and skip checking it,

00:18:35.846 --> 00:18:37.166
then those two really act,

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:38.166
whose blame is that?

00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:41.446
So many.

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:43.646
Screening them one by one
isn't practical.

00:18:44.646 --> 00:18:46.366
The team's main focus right now

00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:49.446
is on finding people connected
to the firework factory explosion.

00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:51.727
What do we do?
We still have to screen them.

00:18:52.287 --> 00:18:53.926
But I have another finding.

00:19:01.686 --> 00:19:03.287
One can change his clothing.

00:19:03.287 --> 00:19:04.807
But under normal walking conditions,

00:19:04.807 --> 00:19:06.287
stride length, walking posture,

00:19:06.287 --> 00:19:08.967
and body sway patterns
don't change easily.

00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:11.206
I think your theory is correct.

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.406
Gao Liang and his girlfriend
are the same person.

00:19:19.527 --> 00:19:22.287
The forensic unit analyzed
the gait of both suspects

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:23.832
and thinks they're the same person.

00:19:23.967 --> 00:19:27.487
This also explains why these two
have never appeared at the same time.

00:19:28.007 --> 00:19:30.287
It's inferred this person's
actual identity is male,

00:19:30.287 --> 00:19:31.567
over 180 cm tall,

00:19:31.686 --> 00:19:32.487
and relatively thin.

00:19:33.767 --> 00:19:35.287
Here's the suspect profile.

00:19:37.087 --> 00:19:38.366
Through profile comparison,

00:19:38.527 --> 00:19:39.640
Jiang Yue, the only son

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.880
of the couple killed
in the firework factory explosion,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.606
shows high similarity to the profile.

00:19:44.487 --> 00:19:45.646
Jiang Yue is out of contact.

00:19:46.007 --> 00:19:48.527
He was in fifth grade
when the explosion happened.

00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:49.247
And he was there.

00:19:49.366 --> 00:19:51.446
He survived
because of his mother's protection.

00:19:51.646 --> 00:19:54.287
Then, he was raised
by his maternal grandparents.

00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:57.047
This is Jiang Yue's ID photo.

00:19:57.926 --> 00:20:00.327
How's Jiang Yue going?

00:20:03.512 --> 00:20:04.600
His maternal grandparents

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.047
passed away one after the other
before he started university.

00:20:07.287 --> 00:20:10.047
Jiang Yue vanished
after graduating from university.

00:20:10.807 --> 00:20:14.406
It's not easy for someone
to leave no trace these days.

00:20:14.406 --> 00:20:15.967
Unless he never uses an ID card,

00:20:16.087 --> 00:20:17.767
and uses only cash.

00:20:18.366 --> 00:20:19.846
But that's unrealistic.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.727
So he's been using
someone else's identity.

00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:25.807
Stuck in a dead end again.

00:20:25.807 --> 00:20:28.686
Check Jiang Yue's contacts now.

00:20:28.807 --> 00:20:32.527
Before graduation,
Jiang Yue must have lived a normal life.

00:20:33.487 --> 00:20:34.727
There must be some clues.

00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:37.446
Let's go.

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:44.686
Open up!

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:48.807
I know you're in there.

00:20:54.487 --> 00:20:55.527
If you don't come out,

00:20:55.527 --> 00:20:56.886
I'll open this door and come in!

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:03.926
Open the door now!

00:21:05.087 --> 00:21:05.926
Do you hear me?

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:17.926
Open the door!

00:21:19.606 --> 00:21:20.926
Don't try to fool me!

00:21:31.247 --> 00:21:33.047
How dare you
install this thing on the door?

00:21:33.686 --> 00:21:36.366
If you damage my door,
I'll deduct it from your deposit!

00:21:37.886 --> 00:21:39.206
I'm here to notify you.

00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:40.527
I'm not renting this place out.

00:21:40.846 --> 00:21:42.206
Pack up and leave soon.

00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:45.446
I've paid the rent on time.

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:47.007
I don't want to rent it out anymore.

00:21:47.007 --> 00:21:48.406
No more excuses.

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.606
But we signed a contract.

00:21:50.606 --> 00:21:51.846
Forget the contract.

00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:52.606
Let me tell you.

00:21:52.606 --> 00:21:53.606
This is my house.

00:21:53.606 --> 00:21:54.406
I just don't want

00:21:54.406 --> 00:21:56.247
to rent it out anymore. So what?

00:21:56.807 --> 00:21:58.646
You can't be so unreasonable.

00:21:59.366 --> 00:22:00.926
Do I need to be reasonable with you?

00:22:01.646 --> 00:22:04.727
I only rented to you
because your innocent look fooled me.

00:22:05.126 --> 00:22:07.406
You seemed clean, fair-skinned,

00:22:07.606 --> 00:22:08.727
quiet and well-behaved,

00:22:08.807 --> 00:22:10.527
but you're actually a shameless villain!

00:22:11.767 --> 00:22:13.087
If I had seen you

00:22:13.087 --> 00:22:13.967
on the news,

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.727
I would never rent my house to you.

00:22:16.406 --> 00:22:17.487
Enough.

00:22:17.487 --> 00:22:18.846
Enough talk.

00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:19.686
In short,

00:22:19.686 --> 00:22:20.967
get out of here

00:22:21.487 --> 00:22:22.446
by tomorrow morning.

00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:25.527
Not kicking you out right now
is already showing you mercy.

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:29.406
Jinx!

00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:30.606
Bad luck to meet you!

00:22:54.327 --> 00:22:55.446
What a pile of trash!

00:22:56.967 --> 00:22:58.366
All this bad luck!

00:22:59.686 --> 00:23:00.487
Leave!

00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:01.327
Get out of here!

00:23:02.126 --> 00:23:02.967
Oh, my.

00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:05.496
I'll kick out of all the bad luck.

00:23:07.007 --> 00:23:08.327
Get away from here.

00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:10.366
Oh, my.

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:16.126
You people, move!

00:23:19.047 --> 00:23:21.126
Renting to this jinx this time,

00:23:21.126 --> 00:23:22.087
what terrible luck!

00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:23.767
I have to be more careful.

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:38.747
(Rent/Buy Property, Real Estate Agent)

00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:34.487
Hello.

00:25:35.807 --> 00:25:36.327
Hello.

00:25:38.487 --> 00:25:39.206
Mom.

00:25:40.606 --> 00:25:41.926
How dare you call back?

00:25:46.406 --> 00:25:48.126
I need money for rent.

00:25:48.606 --> 00:25:49.327
Money?

00:25:49.327 --> 00:25:50.646
How dare you even ask?

00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:52.406
You deserve it!

00:25:52.487 --> 00:25:53.886
I won't give you a single cent.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.727
After such a disgraceful act,
you still have the nerve to call?

00:25:56.727 --> 00:25:57.567
Let me tell you.

00:25:57.567 --> 00:25:59.047
You deserve to starve to death.

00:25:59.047 --> 00:25:59.926
Don't bother me again.

00:26:08.686 --> 00:26:10.287
This rent is so cheap.

00:26:10.287 --> 00:26:11.606
Wonder what kind of place it is.

00:26:12.206 --> 00:26:13.047
Must be bad quality.

00:26:13.047 --> 00:26:14.247
There must be a catch.

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:15.567
Let's go check that one.

00:26:15.567 --> 00:26:17.166
Okay, that one over there, right?

00:26:27.032 --> 00:26:32.504
(Now Renting!)

00:26:55.206 --> 00:26:56.886
Please take a look.

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:57.567
Thanks.

00:27:01.007 --> 00:27:02.406
Please take a look.

00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:03.926
Thanks.

00:27:04.606 --> 00:27:05.406
Hello.

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.487
I'd like to ask

00:27:08.087 --> 00:27:10.487
if it's really this cheap.

00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:13.567
This listing is new.

00:27:13.926 --> 00:27:15.007
The apartment is fine.

00:27:15.487 --> 00:27:17.807
But it's a bit out of the way,
not very lively.

00:27:18.527 --> 00:27:19.727
A bit far from the subway.

00:27:20.287 --> 00:27:21.446
It's fine. I'll take it.

00:27:24.686 --> 00:27:25.646
Don't rush.

00:27:26.206 --> 00:27:27.967
You're looking for a place cheap?

00:27:29.366 --> 00:27:29.967
How about this?

00:27:30.767 --> 00:27:32.087
Let me show you the place.

00:27:32.206 --> 00:27:34.487
If it doesn't suit you,
I'll find you another.

00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:35.846
Okay.

00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:37.686
Let me help.

00:27:38.327 --> 00:27:39.126
Thanks.

00:27:51.087 --> 00:27:53.646
Yue and I shared bunk beds in college.

00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:56.166
We dorm mates started
a business together junior year.

00:27:57.087 --> 00:27:58.686
We were computer science majors,

00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:00.727
so we worked on a program together.

00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:02.606
It had great potential back then.

00:28:02.606 --> 00:28:04.926
Several investors were quite interested.

00:28:06.007 --> 00:28:09.527
But we were too naive

00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:11.846
and got scammed by an alleged investor.

00:28:13.126 --> 00:28:14.126
He took our money

00:28:14.567 --> 00:28:16.287
and stole our intellectual property.

00:28:16.767 --> 00:28:18.007
Of course, we didn't accept it.

00:28:19.487 --> 00:28:23.366
But facing reality, we had to let it go.

00:28:23.967 --> 00:28:25.366
Besides, we were about to graduate.

00:28:25.686 --> 00:28:26.646
Finding housing,

00:28:26.807 --> 00:28:28.166
job hunting, studying abroad...

00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:29.287
It was overwhelming.

00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:31.846
So we didn't have the time to pursue it.

00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:34.327
Yue didn't complain much at the time.

00:28:34.886 --> 00:28:38.926
But secretly, he found a way
to get back at that guy.

00:28:40.007 --> 00:28:42.527
Jiang Yue is quite vindictive.

00:28:43.087 --> 00:28:44.126
What did he do?

00:28:46.206 --> 00:28:48.166
I'm not entirely sure.

00:28:50.406 --> 00:28:54.366
I just heard he found
some online scammers

00:28:55.087 --> 00:28:56.567
to deceive that guy.

00:28:56.967 --> 00:28:59.686
So Jiang Yue
was involved in online fraud?

00:29:00.126 --> 00:29:02.606
Well, I-I don't know about that.

00:29:03.406 --> 00:29:05.247
Did you contact after graduation?

00:29:05.487 --> 00:29:06.287
No.

00:29:06.967 --> 00:29:08.166
Before graduation,

00:29:08.287 --> 00:29:11.846
Yue gave us back all the money we lost,

00:29:12.366 --> 00:29:14.606
then he just vanished

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:15.886
without a trace.

00:29:16.727 --> 00:29:18.606
We dorm mates all worried about him.

00:29:19.366 --> 00:29:23.247
And we knew he only had
his grandparents left.

00:29:23.366 --> 00:29:24.487
His parents were gone.

00:29:26.527 --> 00:29:27.527
It was tough for him.

00:29:27.727 --> 00:29:29.166
Wonder how he's been doing.

00:29:29.287 --> 00:29:32.767
What do you know
about his parents' deaths?

00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:34.446
I heard it was an accident.

00:29:35.487 --> 00:29:36.767
Don't know more than that.

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:39.087
Yue was usually quiet,

00:29:39.686 --> 00:29:41.446
but deep down he was quite proud.

00:29:41.926 --> 00:29:43.047
About his parents,

00:29:44.406 --> 00:29:46.886
if he didn't bring it up,
we wouldn't ask, right?

00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:51.287
Officer, I do remember one thing.

00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:54.727
Yue had a small box.

00:29:55.287 --> 00:29:56.487
It was quite ornate.

00:29:56.487 --> 00:29:58.327
I don't know what was inside.

00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.606
Just that his mother left it for him.

00:30:06.926 --> 00:30:07.767
Thank you.

00:30:12.767 --> 00:30:13.646
What do you think?

00:30:14.206 --> 00:30:16.406
If Jiang Yue
was involved in online fraud,

00:30:16.807 --> 00:30:20.366
that explains all those IDs he had.

00:30:22.967 --> 00:30:24.967
This guy is resilient,

00:30:26.047 --> 00:30:26.846
determined,

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:29.527
and highly driven.

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:33.846
It's been a while
since Liu Xiaofeng was killed.

00:30:34.926 --> 00:30:36.606
Given his capability,

00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:39.767
he's very likely
already looking for the next target,

00:30:40.327 --> 00:30:41.686
or he's already on it.

00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:48.886
How's your forum investigation going
with Long?

00:30:50.967 --> 00:30:53.126
Quite a few potential targets
identified so far.

00:30:53.366 --> 00:30:56.527
But if you want me to say the one
who is most likely his next target,

00:30:56.527 --> 00:30:58.247
I truly can't do it.

00:30:58.247 --> 00:31:00.047
I really can't.

00:31:03.406 --> 00:31:05.007
Can you stop walking back and forth?

00:31:05.247 --> 00:31:05.886
Making me dizzy.

00:31:07.087 --> 00:31:08.926
I am the dizzy one.

00:31:09.606 --> 00:31:10.807
The most I can do

00:31:10.967 --> 00:31:14.166
is to narrow the range
just a tiny bit more.

00:31:14.366 --> 00:31:15.007
Just a tiny bit.

00:31:15.007 --> 00:31:17.247
Long has been overwhelmed
these past two days.

00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:19.206
He's been so focused on this

00:31:19.366 --> 00:31:20.886
and hasn't even gone home.

00:31:21.926 --> 00:31:23.767
Look at how red his eyes are,

00:31:23.886 --> 00:31:25.686
like a little rabbit.

00:31:26.727 --> 00:31:27.446
Long.

00:31:28.247 --> 00:31:32.406
Tell us. Tell us about
that narrowed range.

00:31:33.007 --> 00:31:33.886
Just say it.

00:31:34.126 --> 00:31:35.126
Okay.

00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:40.366
I sorted events by online popularity.

00:31:40.366 --> 00:31:43.606
The top ten most-viewed events.

00:31:43.606 --> 00:31:46.166
Only three
fit the suspect's selection criteria.

00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:49.400
First is the event of the female intern

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.287
sexually harassed
by a famous journalist.

00:31:52.606 --> 00:31:56.527
Second is the female grad student
who protected her best friend

00:31:56.527 --> 00:31:58.327
was killed by that friend's boyfriend.

00:31:58.327 --> 00:32:01.527
Third is a seventy-year-old elderly
abandoned by his three sons

00:32:01.527 --> 00:32:02.767
and left homeless.

00:32:03.007 --> 00:32:06.767
If the suspect selects targets
based on popularity,

00:32:06.767 --> 00:32:09.886
it's highly likely
one of these three events.

00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:11.606
How can you be sure

00:32:11.606 --> 00:32:14.646
the suspect chooses targets
by popularity?

00:32:14.967 --> 00:32:16.166
I reviewed the previous events

00:32:16.166 --> 00:32:18.767
of Zhou Lianqin, Wen Yong,
and Liu Xiaofeng.

00:32:19.087 --> 00:32:19.767
These three

00:32:19.767 --> 00:32:23.166
ranked in the top-ten social focus
during their time.

00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:25.447
Among the events that ranked
in the top-ten social focus,

00:32:25.447 --> 00:32:28.406
only two or three fit the suspect's

00:32:28.487 --> 00:32:31.247
self-proclaimed role
as a justice enforcer.

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:35.366
So I'm confident in this narrowed rage.

00:32:35.366 --> 00:32:37.727
But I couldn't narrow it down further

00:32:38.126 --> 00:32:39.646
to pinpoint his exact target.

00:32:41.206 --> 00:32:41.846
Good.

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.967
I'll report to Chief Xu.

00:32:44.007 --> 00:32:46.807
We'll immediately investigate
all parties in these three cases.

00:32:47.487 --> 00:32:48.166
Okay.

00:32:48.487 --> 00:32:49.567
Move! Hurry!

00:32:50.287 --> 00:32:51.087
Get moving!

00:33:46.727 --> 00:33:47.366
You're awake.

00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:00.206
It's you?

00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:03.126
You're not the agent.

00:34:06.686 --> 00:34:08.487
You've been hiding for days,

00:34:10.007 --> 00:34:11.766
yet your guard is still this weak.

00:34:14.206 --> 00:34:16.407
No wonder you got kicked out
like a stray.

00:34:21.087 --> 00:34:22.286
The door is behind me.

00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:25.447
Leaving is easy.

00:34:28.367 --> 00:34:31.087
Just fulfill one small request for me.

00:34:33.567 --> 00:34:34.567
What do you want?

00:34:36.806 --> 00:34:37.487
Take a guess.

00:34:38.887 --> 00:34:39.806
I don't know.

00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:40.806
Who are you?

00:34:42.887 --> 00:34:44.166
Don't rush.

00:34:45.047 --> 00:34:46.527
I haven't said anything yet.

00:34:51.726 --> 00:34:52.487
It's simple.

00:34:53.766 --> 00:34:56.606
Haven't forgotten
the Yu Xiao'ou case, have you?

00:34:59.527 --> 00:35:01.646
Tell the truth
about Yu Xiao'ou's murder,

00:35:02.887 --> 00:35:03.806
then I'll let you go.

00:35:04.927 --> 00:35:05.567
Deal?

00:35:08.567 --> 00:35:09.407
I did.

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:10.286
I said it.

00:35:10.407 --> 00:35:12.367
What I said in court was the truth.

00:35:14.766 --> 00:35:15.806
Chances are limited.

00:35:16.527 --> 00:35:17.927
Think it over.

00:35:31.606 --> 00:35:33.567
Regarding the elderly
abandoned by his children,

00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:35.246
all involved parties have been located.

00:35:35.527 --> 00:35:39.246
Community staff are temporarily
caring for the elderly.

00:35:40.126 --> 00:35:43.367
Organizations like
Women's Federation, Civil Affairs,

00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:46.447
and local police station are

00:35:46.606 --> 00:35:50.606
working together to mediate
between the elderly and her children.

00:35:51.326 --> 00:35:53.766
They're also educating them
about legal obligations,

00:35:53.766 --> 00:35:56.806
making them understand
children must support their parents.

00:35:58.206 --> 00:35:58.927
By the way,

00:35:58.927 --> 00:36:02.087
about the intern's sexual harassment
case against her supervisor,

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:03.646
the girl hired a lawyer

00:36:04.166 --> 00:36:05.606
and sued the man in court.

00:36:05.606 --> 00:36:07.326
Though the man hasn't admitted guilt,

00:36:07.527 --> 00:36:08.927
he also hired a lawyer.

00:36:09.087 --> 00:36:12.567
His workplace suspended him

00:36:12.567 --> 00:36:14.166
due to negative publicity.

00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:16.166
Both sides are proceeding legally now.

00:36:17.407 --> 00:36:19.286
Are both parties currently safe?

00:36:19.726 --> 00:36:20.286
Yes.

00:36:20.286 --> 00:36:23.606
Both insist no one resembling
Jiang Yue approached them.

00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:26.047
Zhang Wei, the murderer
in Yu Xiao'ou's case,

00:36:26.166 --> 00:36:27.487
is currently in prison.

00:36:28.007 --> 00:36:30.887
Yu Xiao'ou and Zhang Wei's families
are out of town.

00:36:30.887 --> 00:36:32.126
We've contacted them.

00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:36.087
The only one who could not be reached
is the key witness Xia Tian.

00:36:36.686 --> 00:36:39.087
So her boyfriend was the murderer?

00:36:39.927 --> 00:36:40.567
Yes.

00:36:40.567 --> 00:36:42.606
All three were grad school classmates.

00:36:42.606 --> 00:36:45.126
Zhang Wei and Xia Tian were dating.

00:36:45.126 --> 00:36:46.447
Xia Tian tried to break up.

00:36:46.447 --> 00:36:47.286
Zhang Wei disagreed.

00:36:47.286 --> 00:36:50.206
As Xia Tian's best friend,
Yu Xiao'ou stepped in to mediate.

00:36:50.206 --> 00:36:52.606
Unexpectedly, Zhang Wei
brought a weapon.

00:36:53.166 --> 00:36:56.007
In the end, Zhang Wei killed Yu Xiao'ou.

00:36:56.527 --> 00:36:58.367
I think I've heard of this case.

00:36:58.367 --> 00:37:00.088
Handled by the neighboring province,
right?

00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:02.206
Among those involved,
only Xia Tian is from Yunxi.

00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:04.487
And she has been enduring
persistent cyberbullying.

00:37:04.487 --> 00:37:05.496
After the case concluded,

00:37:05.496 --> 00:37:07.480
she suspended her schooling
and returned to Yunxi.

00:37:07.686 --> 00:37:08.487
Cyberbullying?

00:37:08.567 --> 00:37:09.206
Yes.

00:37:10.126 --> 00:37:13.487
Many believe Yu Xiao'ou
lost her life for Xia Tian.

00:37:13.487 --> 00:37:14.686
She took the knife for her.

00:37:14.806 --> 00:37:17.720
But Xia Tian denied this
in her court testimony.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.704
She claimed the murderer
had planned it for long,

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:21.326
and Yu Xiao'ou was the target.

00:37:22.087 --> 00:37:24.326
The court accepted Xia Tian's testimony,

00:37:24.326 --> 00:37:26.887
indicating there was solid evidence.

00:37:27.367 --> 00:37:29.087
Why are those people online
making a fuss?

00:37:30.527 --> 00:37:32.206
I checked this.

00:37:32.206 --> 00:37:34.126
There are nasty comments.

00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:34.967
All sorts of stuff.

00:37:34.967 --> 00:37:36.686
Most of these people
making a fuss online

00:37:36.686 --> 00:37:38.887
don't have anything serious going on.

00:37:38.887 --> 00:37:40.646
They're just venting their emotions,

00:37:40.646 --> 00:37:42.887
and don't care
what the truth of the case is.

00:37:42.967 --> 00:37:44.766
They're just making up nonsense,

00:37:44.766 --> 00:37:46.616
hitching onto the topic
and chasing the hype.

00:37:46.726 --> 00:37:47.367
Anyway, they're

00:37:47.367 --> 00:37:48.567
utilizing others' misfortunes.

00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:51.527
This case involves privacy,

00:37:52.007 --> 00:37:54.126
so many details
weren't disclosed to the public.

00:37:54.447 --> 00:37:58.407
In a way, that created a chance
for rumors to spread.

00:37:59.047 --> 00:38:02.567
If Jiang Yue believed these rumors
and felt something was fishy,

00:38:03.166 --> 00:38:04.967
and something happened to this girl,

00:38:05.567 --> 00:38:10.087
should those spreading rumors online
also bear responsibility?

00:38:10.967 --> 00:38:13.206
It is too early to say that.

00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:17.887
Right now, the most important thing
is to find her.

00:38:18.567 --> 00:38:19.407
Get moving now!

00:38:19.407 --> 00:38:20.007
Got it.

00:38:20.007 --> 00:38:21.047
