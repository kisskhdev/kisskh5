No matter what happens,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.450
I'll face it with you.

Vier...

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.600
So, we're partners now.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.840
No matter what...

Vier...

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.320
Kidnapping is illegal, you know.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.720
Go ahead and report it to the police.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440
I'll also be happy to report

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.240
that you're involved in bribery.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.120
Deal?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.920
Don't do that.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.240
We can talk this out.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.120
It's nothing serious.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.320
Khun?

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.210
Vier?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.200
What the hell is going on?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.630
That's also my question.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.200
What the fuck is this?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.440
You two...

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.440
had sex when you were in Bangkok,
didn't you?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.440
We didn't.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.080
What are you talking about?

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.010
Answer me, Vier.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.360
You didn't get tricked by him, did you?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.700
Otherwise,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.000
you wouldn't be
avoiding my eyes like this.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.320
I know

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560
that you wouldn't do such a thing.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.440
If it weren't for your company,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.720
you would never have been near him.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.320
When did I trick him?

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.680
Tell him

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.640
who was really tricking whom.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.200
Tell him.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440
Now what?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
Vier...

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.480
Should I finish him now?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360
I'll give you my shares later.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.800
So,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.840
can you forgive me now?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.570
Can you?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.600
Answer me!

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.320
Say you'll forgive me!

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.760
So tell me.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.280
Do you actually care
about what happened that night,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.880
or do you just care
that I care about him?

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.490
You threatened him
just like you did to me, Kelvin.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.960
Turns out...

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.280
you're so much worse than I expected.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.600
Khun,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.840
let's say I understand you.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.520
I won't blame you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.800
for canceling the contract.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.080
But honestly,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.440
you've hurt a lot of people.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.160
Getting a taste of your own medicine
isn't bad.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.520
I'll just see it...

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.600
as dogs fighting each other.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.560
How could you say that?

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.360
Have you forgotten about us already?

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.610
Come here.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.800
Come with me.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.720
What now?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.000
It has nothing to do with me.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Get out.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.040
What the hell?

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.450
Love turned into a trap.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.840
A friend became an enemy.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.960
And trust turned into a weapon

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.280
aimed back at me.

Hey, my grandma isn't doing so well.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.760
I've gotta go to Malaysia tonight.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.600
Anyway,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640
have you seen my passport?

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.600
Mind if I check your room?
Maybe it's here.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.560
Okay.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.480
Shit.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.120
A major controversy is unfolding today

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.480
as King Group faces serious allegations

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.970
following an anonymous leak

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.600
implicating Ken Siwawat,
the company's heir and managing director,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.760
in money laundering.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.560
Has the statement been sent out?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720
Yes, sir.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.480
We clarified that
the allegations are false

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.000
and confirmed legal action
against anyone who started them.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.920
But the company's shares
are still plunging.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.280
There's a company
buying the shares at a low price, sir.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.720
Things are getting bad.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.130
Buy them back immediately.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.760
We can't let anyone
accumulate our shares.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.560
The problem is...

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.840
the contract Mr. Ken signed, sir.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.190
It has caused the company
to run into serious cash flow issues.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.280
Please excuse me.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.880
Look what you've done.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.840
Dad,

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.640
those guys played dirty.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.680
Oh, yeah?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.560
You're the one to blame.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.240
You exposed your own weakness.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480
Moron.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.040
Dad, stay out of this.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.320
Let me handle everything myself.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.340
I won't let the company take any damage.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.160
No damage?

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.480
Look at the mess we're already in.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.240
What do you think
you can actually pull off, huh?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.720
Well...

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.840
- I...
- Just go home.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.960
Don't ever come back here
to cause more trouble!

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800

- Go.

Have you seen the latest news?

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.730
Just say what you want to say.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.080
Everything was caused
by false accusations from our competitors

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.200
who were trying to discredit us.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.600
Ms. Un,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.280
in a situation like this,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.960
I think the two of us
can only rely on the people we trust.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.000
You still have some cash reserves, right?

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.200
Before we discuss this matter,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.360
you might want to check the latest news.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.080
Half an hour ago,
King Group released a statement

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.200
denying allegations that
Ken Siwawat, heir and managing director,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.680
was involved in money laundering,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.560
labeling them as pure defamation.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.120
Yet within an hour,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.400
the company's stock fell sharply again.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.600
Most recently,
photos and videos have surfaced,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:14.830
revealing Ken Siwawat's
intimate relationships

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.920
with multiple women,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.470
even as he remains legally married.

Hey, Ms. Un.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.240
It's not true at all.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.540
- I've dealt...
- Katha,

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.320
I've given you more than enough chances.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.360
But your performance
has been deeply disappointing.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.440
Prepare yourself. The board
is going to remove you from your role.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.640
Wait, Ms. Un.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.560
Ms. Un...

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.400
Hey.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.300
Damn it!

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.920
Hi, Uncle Katha.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.120
Is something bothering you?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.200
How the hell did you get in here?

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.440
How?!

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.510
Guards, take them out.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.680
The security guards and your old team

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.680
are gone, Father.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.640
Who are you

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.880
to pull dirty tricks like this?

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.480
I own fifty percent
of the company's shares

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.480
with full support
from your board of directors.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.820
As of now,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.080
you are no longer
the largest shareholder of King Group.

[Shareholders: Kelvin, Katha, Ken]

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.000
This marks the end
of Katha Siwawat's era.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.600
So it was you all along.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.880
You tricked your brother
into signing the contract,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.240
drained the company's cash,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.110
leaked the allegations,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.720
and grabbed the shares
while they were cheap.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.280

I mean, Ken...

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.770
lacked both the capability
and the vision to lead.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.480
But this whole mess...

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.640
It's your fault, Father.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200
For choosing him,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:18.920

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.430
all decisions of King Group

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.640
will be made without your involvement.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.210
Kelvin,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.240
you...

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.840
King Group has officially announced

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.570
the dismissal of Katha Siwawat as CEO

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.160
and the appointment of Kelvin Siwawat,
his second son, as his successor.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.840
In addition,

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.450
the Financial Crime Suppression Division
reported that

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.500
Katha may be linked to
a transnational money laundering network.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.440
How are you, Lit?

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.050
I'm good.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.520
Well,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440
when will you...

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.460
stop getting involved with King Group?

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.520
Why do I have to stop?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.640
At this point,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.370
King Group

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.280
isn't about family drama anymore.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.520
To me, it's a chance
to turn the future of VPG Group around.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.580
Soon,

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.080
once Kelvin fully takes control,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.880
we'll land the big projects, too.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.760
That's how I see it.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:30.800
Okay.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.410
Wait, but...

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880
why are you here?

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.200
You said
you were going to Malaysia last night.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.800
Yeah.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.480
I couldn't find my passport,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840
so I missed the flight.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.480
What?

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.240
Go get a new one.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560
I'll book you another flight.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.880
It's okay.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.600
Can I ask you another question?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.540
You and...

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.720
Kelvin...

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.960
How far have you two gone?

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.600
I mean,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.520
are you guys already...

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.680
in love?

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700
Why would you ask me that?

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.240
Are you jealous?

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.560
Jealous, my ass.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.000
If you found out he never loved you

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.330
and he was only using you,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.840
what would you do?

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.480
Listen.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.440
First,

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.520
even if Kelvin and I
end up getting married,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.240
you'll still be my best friend.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.040
Second,

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.760
Kelvin would never do that.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.400
Don't think too much about it.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.680
Okay.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.680
So,

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.520
why did you buy so much stuff?

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.560
I bought them to celebrate with Kelvin.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.720
Honestly,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.120
I bet he'll be super happy

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.080
when he gets back
and sees I did all this.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.640
Uh...

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960
What are you trying to say?

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.000
Just say it.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.120
I don't know.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160
I forgot what I was gonna say.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.600
You seem tired.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.240
How about going to Malaysia for a break?

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.860
Don't worry about me.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.400
Okay.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.800
So,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.880
I'm leaving, then.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.640
And you...

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.720
especially today,

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.720
take good care of yourself.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.440
Bye. See you.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.920
You're acting weird, dude.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.640
[Can't wait
to celebrate with you, hurry up]

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.120
Congratulations on your appointment
as the new CEO of King Group.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.370
Thanks.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.680
You don't seem very happy.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.850
I've been dealing
with quite a lot lately.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.760
Alright, let's get straight
to the point, then.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.360
I see your potential,

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.960
and I'm confident
we can work well together.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.960
Just don't forget
to get that file for me.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.240
I know.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.880
I'll take care of it.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.360
That's it for now.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.040
You know New, too?

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.800
I don't think we're close enough

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.600
for you to show up uninvited like this

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.210
or pry into my personal life.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.000
I've backed up all the files already.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.720
What the hell do you want?

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.320
You think I'm threatening you?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.840
I just happened to notice
you were in touch with New.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.240
It felt off, so I looked into it.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.440
And that's when I found out

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.280
you got Vier's personal information
from him.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.360
You've been watching Vier all along.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.560
And once you realized he's kind,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.160
sympathetic,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.680
and driven by fairness...

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.280
Kelvin?

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.680
You got close to him

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.640
and took advantage of him.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.800
Do you want to do this with me?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.340
If I ever get everything back,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.520
half of it will be yours.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.640
You took advantage of his feelings

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.400
and manipulated him into helping you
regain control of King Group.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.240
But you didn't stop there.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.600
You even stole
the trade secrets of VPG Group.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.880
That day,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.240
I found a bug
you planted in Vier's room.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.320
I hacked into it,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.640
and I found every single file

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.440
- Yes, Dad.
- you recorded while spying on him.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.520
Mr. Mark's schedule?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.680
Don't worry.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.200
I'll take care of it.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560
I understand

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.600
that Mr. Mark
played a key role in designing this.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.400
Our goal is to reassure him

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.520
that we're the best fit
for this project.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.930
You do know New used to be
Uncle Watt's subordinate, right?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.360
He not only turned his back on us

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:43.610
but also stole both resources
and trade secrets from VPG Group

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.120
to build his own W Group.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.640
And right now, the thing he wants most
is access to Mr. Mark's schedule.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.720
The reason he wants that schedule

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.640
is to use the same strategy
to bring us down.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.200
He'll gradually lure away
our key clients.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.480
And if he succeeds,

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.240
what will VPG Group have left?

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.090
And do you know

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.840
he almost drove VPG Group
into bankruptcy?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.080
He ruined both Uncle Watt

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.360
and Vier

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.080
and left them deeply scarred.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.720
I know.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.120
Fuck...

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.120
What the fuck
are you trying to do, then?!

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:28.920
Tell me!

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.250
Not only did you exploit
Vier's love for your own gain,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.730
but you also reached out
to help that bastard destroy VPG Group!

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.960
Why the hell are you doing this?!

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.960
Vier was nothing but good to you.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.400
Why would you do this?!

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.000
This is business, Lalit.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.080
Don't act like a child...

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.290
and think love can protect everything.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.400
In the end,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.200
the weak

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.880
will be devoured.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You're just...

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.960
making excuses for yourself.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.720
Excuses?

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.040
This isn't about justifying myself.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.800
I'm doing what it takes to survive.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.800
Vier may love me,

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.520
but that is...

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.980
what makes him vulnerable.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.820
And that vulnerability

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.210
is his weakness.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.560
Do you honestly think...

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.560
power can protect love?

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.840
All it does...

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.040
is push you further away
from being human.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.080
And in the end,

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.120
you'll never know
what true love is again.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720
True love?

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.440
Only those with enough power

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.580
can afford to keep true love.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.800
End your deal with New.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.160
Go tell Vier the truth

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.680
before it's too late.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.840
No.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040
I can't.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.120
I've come too far.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920
I won't stop.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.420
And one more thing,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.000
this...

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.200
has nothing to do with my love for Vier.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.920
Fucking bullshit.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.810
You two literally share the same bed,

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:57.330
yet one of you
steals the other's information.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.800
And you're saying
that has nothing to do with it?!

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.800
Tell me.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400
Or maybe the truth is...

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.210
you never loved Vier at all.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.460
Shut your mouth!

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.480
You have no right

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.720
to stick your nose
into our relationship.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.040
Stick my nose in, huh?!

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.560
You know what?

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.480
I haven't told Vier yet

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.080
because I didn't want him to get hurt.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.920
But right now,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.110
I'm done talking to you.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.000
If you think what you've done

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.120
won't make you lose him,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.240
then let him decide for himself.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.680
I'll be the one...

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.240
who tells him the truth.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.120
[When will you be back? Still busy?]

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.140
[Not anymore, I'm about to leave]

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400
Vier...

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.600
Vier?

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600
Surprise.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.080
You seem so shocked. Why is that?

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.200
Nothing.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.440
I was worried you might be hurt.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.320
You still think

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.960
someone's after us?

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.120
So,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560
let me ask you something.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.730
If...

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.560
I were attacked,

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.080
and saving me meant you had to die,

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.640
would you save me?

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.240
I would.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.490
I'd do it.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.240
You dummy.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.680
I don't want that.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.200
If I'm safe,

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.240
you have to be safe, too.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.160
Come on.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.760
Let's sit.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.260
Give it a try.

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.420
I even cooked this myself

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.560
to celebrate
you getting King Group back.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.360
You cook, too?

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.580
Delicious.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.880
Of course it is.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.320
I used to be a chef, you know.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.920
I just...

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.240
haven't cooked much lately.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.430
Go on, eat.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.520
Vier...

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.770
Hm?

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.920
Thank you so much.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.960
I wouldn't have any of this

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.400
if it weren't for you.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.830
Why did you say that...

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.640
all of a sudden?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.080
Is something bothering you?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.160
Is it about...

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.260
your family?

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.440
Don't worry about it.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.640
Please don't blame me

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.160
or think I'm cruel.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.360
I could never blame you.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.960
This isn't your fault.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.960
It's theirs.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.960
How about this.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.320
If you don't feel okay,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.960
I'll buy a house.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.600
Let's start over together.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.120
Are you saying...

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.920
you'd buy a house with me?

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.820
I am.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.360
I've never felt this sure in my life.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.740
I want us to have a family together.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:36.930
I mean...

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.290
Let's be together forever.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.900
I promise

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.040
I will never leave you.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560
Promise?

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.280
Stay with me forever, okay?

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680
This...

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.360
is how a promise should be made.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:03.880
That's what you told me.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.620
Once everything is settled,

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.660
let's go on a trip together.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.960
Sure.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.280
Did I wake you up?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.580
Off to work this early?

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.320
Yeah.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.800
I need to hurry up
and sort out the job transfer.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.280
You really are hardworking.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.440
I made breakfast for you.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.240
Make sure you eat it.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.160
Okay,

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.560
Mr. Super Busy CEO.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.440
See you.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.560
Yes?

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.720
Mr. Vier, the furniture you ordered
has been delivered.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.120
Okay.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.960
[CEO, are you busy?]

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.800
[Can you spare some time
for your boyfriend?]

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.320
[I have something for you]

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.320
[I can tomorrow]

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.500
Mr. Kelvin,

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.560
we're ready to proceed
with signing the contract with W Group.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.320
Alright, I'll be right there.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.680
Kelvin,

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.470
before we sign the contract,

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.720
I'd like to confirm this
with you once more.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.320
Are you sure you want to
trade all of your King Group shares

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:06.170
for the right to co-develop
W Group's mobile hotel project?

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.520
From what I see,
you're at a disadvantage.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.160
The mobile hotel
is the greatest strength of W Group.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.800
It is your key resource, developed back
when you were with VPG Group.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.820
You knew exactly how to use
that advantage to build W Group.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.380
I'm just learning from you.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.410
You're being too modest.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.040
Thanks to you, Kelvin,

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.680
I secured the deal with Mark
before VPG Group could.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:37.910
From here on, we'll be working together.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.240
May our partnership
grow smoothly and profitably.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.600
Yes.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:13.570
[Vier]

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.000
My apologies.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.600
Something urgent just came up.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.760
Please excuse me for a moment.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.600
Mr. Kelvin...

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.720
Please give him a moment.

00:38:33.295 --> 00:38:34.295
Yes, Vier?

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.680
What is it? I'm busy.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.400
You finally picked up, CEO Kelvin.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.920
Who are you?

00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:43.360
Where's Vier?

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.640
You mean this little deer?

00:38:58.744 --> 00:39:00.064
Who the fuck are you?

00:39:01.771 --> 00:39:02.651
Why did you kidnap me?

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.640
Vier!

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.920
Don't worry,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.840
my deer.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.080
Kelvin,

00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:18.171
do what I say,

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.640
and I'll let him go.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.000
Vier...

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.720
Vier!

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.040
Where are you, Vier?

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.880
Aw,

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.520
this is straight out
of a romantic drama.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.920
You two are seriously in love.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.360
Let's not beat around the bush, then.

00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:36.291
Kelvin,

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.920
you have six hours.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.760
Bring me 300 million
to the north warehouse.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.420
And most importantly,

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.460
you're resigning from King Group.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.240
I don't know
what conflict there is between us.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.080
As for the money,

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.520
I can get it for you.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.360
But as for the rest,

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.360
I'm sure there's a better option.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.200
You're bargaining with me?

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.840
You think you can bargain with me?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.560
Hey.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.562
What are you gonna do?

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.560
Whoa, whoa.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.281
Hey, get closer.

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:24.520
Make sure you're in the frame.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.480
Here. Right.

00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:29.909
Five, four, three, two,

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.760
and action.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.160
Hey, harder.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.520
Yeah.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.360
Great.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.960
Like that.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.680
Stop.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.720
That's enough.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.155
I get it now.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080
Just don't hurt him.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.320
I'll get you the money.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.480
If you'd agreed sooner,

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.840
your little deer
wouldn't have gotten hurt.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.080
Bring me the money.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.170
Don't even think about
calling the police,

00:41:09.079 --> 00:41:11.279
or your little deer...

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.920
will end up as a ghost
haunting this warehouse.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.800
Don't worry.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.640
I always keep my promises.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.840
Mr. Kelvin,

00:41:32.629 --> 00:41:34.360
Mr. New asked me to check with you

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.160
whether we are still
signing the contract today.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.640
Mr. Kelvin...

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.520
What should we do?

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.040
Hey,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.360
any word from King Group yet?

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.700
Nothing, boss.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.840
What's taking him so long?

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:41.880
Boss,

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.160
could he be trying to
pull something on us?

00:42:50.432 --> 00:42:51.354
How long has it been?

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.080
Five hours.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.640
Keep an eye on him.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.838
Sure.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.520
Your boyfriend
doesn't give a damn about you,

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.760
and he's clearly not coming to save you.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:33.800
That's not true.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.080
He would never leave me.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.360
You've got it all wrong.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.800
I've got it all wrong?

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.280
You don't know shit, do you?

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:47.960
What am I supposed to know?

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.120
He never loved you.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.440
He was just using you,

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.400
you idiot.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.120
Bullshit.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.680
I'll show you something.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.840
Yes, Dad.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.920
Mr. Mark's schedule?

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.080
Don't worry.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.640
I'll take care of it.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.040
Oh,

00:44:19.395 --> 00:44:22.360
he's also been dealing
with your family's enemy.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.295
Did you know that?

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.520
That's not even all.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.800
We know a lot more.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.280
I'll let you see everything
before you die.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.920
Open your damn eyes.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.200
I call bullshit.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.840
Why are you framing him?

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360
What do you want?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.400
After all this, you still don't see it?

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.160
I've got more proof for you.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.560
This angle...

00:45:06.031 --> 00:45:09.152
It's the music box
Kelvin gave me that night.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.080
No.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.240
Let me go.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.360
No, Ken...

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.240
Leave me alone.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:13.960
No, Ken...

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.280
- Don't do it.
- Kelvin...

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.256
Kelvin...

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.920
Man, your boyfriend's
insanely good at acting.

00:45:28.006 --> 00:45:29.348
He could be an actor, honestly.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.240
I wanted to feel sorry for you,

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.640
but he fooled me too.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:39.960
Hey,

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.520
beat him up.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:44.800
Hey...

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.480
So everything he did

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.920
was just to make me let my guard down,
feel sorry for him,

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.971
and turn me against Katha and Ken?

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:11.240
He pretended to be weak,
played the victim,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.760
and tricked me into believing him

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.480
and loving him.

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.000
And in the end, he got what he wanted.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.560
What we had was never real.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.320
It was all fake.

00:46:46.366 --> 00:46:47.232
Vier,

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.480
son...

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.760
Does it hurt a lot?

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.280
Dad...

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.800
I'm sorry

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.400
I got to you so late.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.840
How long was I unconscious?

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.520
You were out for three days.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.480
But you're awake now.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.960
That's enough to put my mind at ease.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.720
And...

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.020
what about Mom?

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.380
About this...

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.640
I didn't tell your mom.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.240
I was afraid it would stress her out.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.195
You look really worn out.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.170
Is something going on at the company?

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.480
It's nothing, son.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.360
You don't have to worry.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.240
I've got it under control.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.040
[Witoon (Shareholder)]

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.560
The shareholder called.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.200
Is something wrong?

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.920
This is my fault.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.320
When you were kidnapped,

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.280
I was so worried about you

00:48:29.834 --> 00:48:31.280
that I used all the money

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.153
to get you back.

00:48:37.211 --> 00:48:39.971
At the time, I thought that

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.960
partnering with Mr. Mark

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.280
would fix everything.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.160
But...

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.200
But?

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.283
What happened?

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.600
What happened...

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600
to partnering with Mr. Mark?

00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.860
It's nothing.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.640
I'll take care of it.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.440
What you're doing

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.800
is just making me worry more.

00:49:15.411 --> 00:49:16.531
Kelvin...

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.760
isn't a good guy, son.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.440
He did call the police,

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.880
but he refused to cooperate.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.520
Do you know

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.800
what he was doing?

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.283
He was signing a contract with W Group.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.040
Then he stole every single one
of our projects.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.880
I'll let you see everything
before you die.

00:49:51.127 --> 00:49:52.600
Open your damn eyes.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.238
Yes, Dad.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.330
Mr. Mark's schedule?

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.520
Don't worry.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.084
I'll take care of it.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.640
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.880
This is...

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.520
all my fault.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.720
You silly kid.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.600
Why would you say that?

00:50:18.902 --> 00:50:20.782
Let the past

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.880
be the past.

00:50:24.901 --> 00:50:27.061
Don't let someone like that
weigh on you.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:30.370
Look.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.680
How about this?

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.195
I think...

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.705
once you're out of the hospital,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.880
you should take some time off and rest.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.800
I should...

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.800
do something for the company.

00:50:46.162 --> 00:50:47.320
Trust me.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.440
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.600
This one,

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.680
I'll handle it.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.920
Okay.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.800
Get some rest.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.080
Vier...

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.280
Here's your food, Ms. Lalyn.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.605
Please try it.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.680
It's a bit too cold.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.920
Let me warm it up for you, then.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:10.960
It's okay.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.640
Just be careful next time.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.040
I will.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.600
Looks like
you finished cooking a while ago.

00:53:29.382 --> 00:53:30.382
What were you doing?

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.160
Oh, well...

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.200
That little doggie ran into the office,

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.240
so I went after him.

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:51.570
It tastes really good.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.720
The flavors blend really well.

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.142
I love it.

00:53:55.811 --> 00:53:56.871
Thank you.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.320
By the way,

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.320
besides cooking,

00:54:00.822 --> 00:54:02.662
I can do plenty of other things too.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.160
I promise you won't regret hiring me.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.495
So what are these
"plenty of other things"

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:09.720
you're talking about?

00:54:12.011 --> 00:54:13.891
Just normal stuff.

00:54:14.115 --> 00:54:15.975
Like driving,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.240
lifting heavy things,

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.600
doing housework,

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.120
and even surviving in the wild.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.040
And most importantly,

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:26.600
I have my own unique self-defense skills.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.120
Hold on,

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.400
does surviving in the wild
count as normal stuff?

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.400
Yeah.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.640
Mm...

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.960
May I have your hands, please?

00:54:49.975 --> 00:54:52.495
Is this how you survive in the wild,

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.720
or one of your self-defense skills?

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.560
When you're tied up like this,

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:07.570
you need to arch your arms
as much as you can.

00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:11.291
Then slowly rub your hands together,

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.160
like you're washing them.

00:55:21.755 --> 00:55:22.955
That way,

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:26.140
the rope will eventually
slip off your hands.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:41.920
Wait...

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.480
Ms. Lin,

00:55:47.822 --> 00:55:49.982
your wrists are all red.

00:55:50.489 --> 00:55:51.489
Does it hurt?

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:53.440
I'm sorry.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.240
It's okay.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:59.780
That was exciting.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.000
Well,

00:56:09.715 --> 00:56:12.200
my parents taught me

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.640
to be ready for anything.

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.880
No matter what happens,

00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:20.491
I have to survive.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.020
Ms. Lin,

00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:28.851
may I ask you something?

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.210
What do you want to know?

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.800
Ever since I started working here,

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:39.000
I haven't seen
any other masters or madams around.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.720
I live alone in this house.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.760
My dad and my younger brother
live in another one.

00:56:46.271 --> 00:56:47.891
As for my mom,

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.228
she passed away a long time ago.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.040
I'm really sorry.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.440
I shouldn't have asked.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.720
It's okay.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.360
I heard you're already married, though.

00:57:07.948 --> 00:57:11.548
Is your husband not living here?

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.840
Don't mention that bastard.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:40.880
Vier,

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.600
what do you want?

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.120
Kelvin,

00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:55.731
just let me go.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.181
Please.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.440
No.

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.440
Listen to me.

00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:19.691
The problem
VPG Group is facing right now

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.080
is very serious.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.920
Now that Thada Chartered is gone,

00:58:25.708 --> 00:58:28.188
there's no solution left for you.

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.800
Your only way out...

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.200
is me.

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:39.010
All I want is for you to be with me.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.582
And I swear,

00:58:44.163 --> 00:58:47.295
I'll give half of the shares of King Group

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.960
to VPG Group.

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.680
This is the best option you have.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.120
Trust me.

00:58:56.506 --> 00:59:00.306
I'm the only one who can help you.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.760
I'm the only one.

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.880
Are you threatening me?

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.520
Saying you'll stop anyone else,
just like you stopped Khun?

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.640
I don't want to do that, Vier.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.440
Please don't make me.

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:41.960
I'm hungry.

00:59:43.141 --> 00:59:44.341
Make me something to eat.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.840
Sure.

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.280
Sure thing.

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.520
It won't take long.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.600
And if you really love me,

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.920
you should at least...

00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.680
show me some respect.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.880
Can you take these chains off me?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600
It hurts.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.680
You're trying
to run away again, aren't you?

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:28.102
I just want some freedom.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.000
I can't even go watch TV

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.530
in the living room.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.080
And also,

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.600
you should let me
see my parents sometimes

01:00:43.691 --> 01:00:45.491
so they won't worry.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920
Fine.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.840
You can go see your parents.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.160
But Chao is going with you.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080
Is that okay?

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.280
What's on my schedule tomorrow?

01:01:32.415 --> 01:01:34.575
You've got
a shareholders' meeting at ten,

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.280
a factory visit at one,

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.320
a spa session and a manicure at two,

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.880
a flight at five,

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.040
and dinner at seven.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.120
You can go get some rest now.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.160
I'll see you tomorrow at eight.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.473
Yes, Ms. Lin.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.520
What's wrong?

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.980
Not enjoying it?

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.200
Yeah.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.960
It's boring.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.320
Then...

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:37.720
What should we do?

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.120
Should we...

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.680
do it now?

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.360
I don't want to.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.400
What do you wanna do?

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.040
I wanna go shopping.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.320
We had a deal, didn't we?

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.440
I agreed to let you visit your parents,

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.040
as long as Chao tags along.

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:21.851
If you want to do
some shopping, though,

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.680
I need something in return.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
What is it?

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.960
You have to accept my love.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.760
And show me that you love me.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.120
Not tonight.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.360
I'm going to bed.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.640
The movie isn't over yet.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.640
I'm off to work now.

01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:31.451
No goodbye kiss?

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.560
Don't forget...

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.600
our deal.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.160
I won't.

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.850
But if you don't let me kiss you,

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.040
I won't let you go anywhere.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.240
Forget it.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.080
Give me some time.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.440
Sure.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.400
Hey, Chao.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.200
Come pick Vier up.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.760
I'll unchain you.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:37.980
I'm leaving.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.880
Wait, Mr. Vier.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.120
Didn't you say
you wanted to go shopping at the mall?

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.200
Where is this place?

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.880
I feel like having a drink.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.760
Keep me company, okay?

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.400
But I don't drink.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.360
Matching mugs?

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:17.840
That's cute.

01:07:22.491 --> 01:07:24.531
Is this your house?

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.480
It's nicely decorated.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.040
This is not my house.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.920
It's just an old warehouse.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320
My secret bar.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.640
I used to party here.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.760
You look like something's on your mind.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.560
Is something stressing you out?

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:51.480
I don't know.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.760
Have a drink with me.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.520
I...

01:08:06.575 --> 01:08:08.015
I can't, Mr. Vier.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.320
I need to drive.

01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:16.412
But I'm feeling down.

01:08:21.766 --> 01:08:22.196
Okay, sir.

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.040
That's enough, Mr. Vier.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.320
I'm a lightweight.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.960
I've had too much already.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.520
Have another drink.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:48.960
Mr. Vier...

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I really can't.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.120
Where are you going?

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.080
I can go wherever I want.

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.920
I thought you said...

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.680
I was the only one
who could enter this place.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.400
Did I say that?

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.360
Why did you bring another man here?

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.120
You said you'd go shopping

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.080
and see your parents.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.160
What's this?

01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:08.349
Won't answer me?

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:10.960
Fine.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.960
You can't go in there.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.720
Then go home.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.680
You seriously
don't respect my right to be alone.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.400
Following me everywhere.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.869
What a psycho.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.680
Your right to be alone?

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.920
Then what about me?

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.099
Don't I even have the right to love you?

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.640
You're just like every other man,

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.080
thinking...

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.640
that I should love only you

01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.160
and belong only to you.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.220
You're no different...

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.440
from those men who came and went.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.400
You no longer matter to me.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.320
Kelvin!

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.920
♫Countless memories♫

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.480
♫That cut you deep♫

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.640
