00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.930
While searching for clues,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.290
I unexpectedly learned

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.980
the Changs had an old steward
surnamed Jiang.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.050
Five years ago,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.540
the steward retired to his hometown

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.290
and took a boy with him.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.570
After much investigation,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.050
at Steward Jiang's grave,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.900
I found Mr. Jiang,
who resembles the late Mr. Chang,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.620
or rather,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.690
the real Chang Ning.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.940
If he's Chang Ning,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.130
who am I?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.886
I also want to know who you are

00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:09.410
and why you impersonated me.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.380
My mother died 12 years ago.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.906
You claim to be Chang Ning,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.940
but do you know Mrs. Chang's birthday?

00:02:17.043 --> 00:02:18.263
The 16th day of the 11th month.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.380
Where was Mrs. Chang from?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.250
Suzhou.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.160
What was her favorite?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.010
She liked sweets.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.660
Her favorite was

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.340
Furong Pastry

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.060
from Jiangnan Yipinju.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.850
Under the desk in the study,

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:36.081
there is a character engraved.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.500
What is it?

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.850
16 years ago,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.556
my father went to the demon sect

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.220
to help Ms. Cai Pingshu.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.783
My mother suddenly fell ill

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.463
and accidentally tipped over the stove,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.100
burning my left arm.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.250
Do you have

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.250
a scar on your arm?

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.410
What's wrong?

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.980
Too afraid to show it?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.780
Clearly, he's hiding something.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.500
I suppose everyone knows

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.570
who the real one is now.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.940
The Chang residence has been dug up.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.966
Everything was destroyed.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.570
Those with ulterior motives

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.076
can surely make up stories at will.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.900
Let me ask you.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.500
On the 3rd shelf, 4th row

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.730
of my father's study bookshelf,

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:34.913
there's also a character.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.780
What is it?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.290
A dog once bit me when I was little,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.800
leaving a scar on my calf.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.130
Do you dare roll up your pants

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.450
so everyone can see?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.820
Nonsense.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.380
There is no scar.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.530
Indeed.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.570
It's your story against mine.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.660
All of you here are respected figures.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.850
Yet you've fallen
into this trap of self-proof.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.220
If so,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.340
why not fight

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.100
with your family's Willow Sword?

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.220
This swordsmanship

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.610
can't be faked, right?

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.540
As you wish.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.850
Lord Qi,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.010
you knew my father well.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.880
You know I've been sickly
since childhood,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.610
only practicing internal cultivation

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.563
to strengthen meridians,

00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:19.896
unable to train in swordsmanship.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.860
That's why my father

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.340
kept me away from Jianghu,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.576
never letting me go out.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.210
Lord Song,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.900
if you intend to play a trick,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.370
at least take it seriously

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.610
and pick someone
skilled in martial arts.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.780
This way,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.676
you're only humiliating yourself.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.820
You...

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.290
As everyone knows,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.140
Ning has been sickly since childhood.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.020
It is understandable that Mr. Chang

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.340
did not teach him martial arts.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.010
Xiuming,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.780
you know Chang Haosheng well,

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.490
and you treated his injuries.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.610
Speak up.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.740
Who is real?

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.820
Lord Song,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.980
you found the person.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.170
I only treat injuries.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.850
I don't care who he is.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.050
- You...
- My father just passed.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.490
Instead of seeking the culprit,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.250
you found a man

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.370
resembling my father

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.050
and put on such a show.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.100
What do you want?

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.810
Who'd act with you?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.690
Enough.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.220
This is serious.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.850
Since it's hard to tell,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.490
let me test

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.850
their internal cultivation.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.380
Uncle Li,

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:22.740
that requires injecting

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.050
internal energy into meridians.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.540
Isn't that too harsh?

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.940
Yunke?

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.340
Zhao is right.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.730
Don't harm the real Ning.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.010
Uncle Li,

00:05:58.021 --> 00:05:59.500
Chang Ning's injuries are not healed.

00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:00.850
At this rate, he may die.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.220
Their true energy

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.540
was cultivated
with the Changs' techniques.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.810
Their meridians are damaged.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.883
Their lives are at risk.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.330
Yunke,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.340
let me take them back to heal.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.606
Examine them tomorrow.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.820
He's fine.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.380
He'll wake up soon.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.660
You don't care

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.340
who the real one is?

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.700
As I said,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.250
I only treat illnesses.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.900
That's Breeze, my father's favorite.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.780
Drinks in spring

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.580
last ten years.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.490
Since you know

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.850
so many family secrets,

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.290
you must be close to Chang.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.380
Tomorrow,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.410
if there's more to say,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.930
think it through first,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.780
or you two

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.290
may not end well.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.570
Zhao,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.050
why hold an empty bowl?

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.370
Craving meat?

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.780
I want wonton.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.980
Zhao,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.540
does the collarbone hurt

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.490
when pierced?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.860
Of course,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.340
why ask that?

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.930
I just went to the kitchen for food.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.810
Zhuang Shu said

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.250
that tomorrow,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.610
if no conclusion is reached,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.740
Uncle Li

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.020
will lock their collarbones,

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:11.456
crippling their martial arts,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.613
to prevent future trouble.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.610
Zhuo...

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.820
Yuzhi.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.140
Sleeping drug.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.540
Chang Ning!

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.900
Bring the crossbow.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.340
Why pull me down?

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.490
Didn't you come here

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.220
to leave with me?

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.420
Your leaving

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.100
will only prove you're a spy.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:10.690
When you're wanted,

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:11.730
how will you survive?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.420
I'm already doomed.

00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:15.478
If I can't avenge while alive,

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:16.329
death is better.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.380
Don't you know

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.420
what they will do to me?

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.780
Capture the assassin!

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.940
We are not assassins.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.010
You must be from Taichu Temple.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.300
We are from Qingque Sect.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.860
(Qiu Yuanfeng, Lord of Taichu Temple)

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.580
You must be here

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.610
to attend the memorial, right?

00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:44.569
(Wang Yuanjing)
Such a long journey

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.420
must be exhausting.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.340
Did you really get here by accident?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.780
Yes.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.010
A misunderstanding.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.060
Originally...

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.330
Chang Ning!

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:05.970
Chang Ning.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.820
Lord Qiu,

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.730
he's a fugitive from Qingque Sect.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.360
Please let me take him away.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.490
Who are you?

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.220
Why did you attack me?

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.980
You're the one who raided Chang Fort

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.300
and killed my father.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.340
An impostor's words

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.370
are not credible.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.220
I'm the killer?

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.140
Where's the evidence?

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.300
When my father escorted me out,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.300
he fought one of the assassins
for a long time.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.490
His attacks had a sandalwood fragrance,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.130
the same

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.980
as Lord Qiu carries.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.370
Nonsense.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.530
Taichu Temple is so close to Chang Fort.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.010
Yet they knew nothing

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.140
of the great commotion

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.490
in Chang Fort?

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.780
Indeed.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.980
I wasn't at the temple back then.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.530
Moreover,

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.010
Chang Fort had been hidden

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.763
in the mountains for over a decade,

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.850
cut off from the outside world.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.530
As for the fragrance,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.020
Yuanjing,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.060
please explain to everyone.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.660
Lord Qi,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.850
this incense is our special Ethereal,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.610
crafted with rosewood and Qiong flowers.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.730
It calms energy

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.570
and aids cultivation.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.490
Many practitioners

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.330
sought it.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.220
Mr. Chang's suspicion of Yuanfeng

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.820
was just youthful ignorance.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.010
What Mr. Chang?

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.610
He is clearly an unknown spy,

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.010
stirring discord.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.220
Lord Qiu, you appear clean.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.836
You only got your position

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.820
after Mr. Wu Yuanying's death,

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.060
yet you expelled
his beloved Luo Yuanrong...

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.900
Nonsense.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.956
How dare you smear me?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.370
Such a schemer

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.340
should be executed.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.780
Wait.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.210
Pingchun, Xiaofeng,

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.210
you're back.

00:13:15.386 --> 00:13:16.685
When we were about to come back,

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.123
we met Mr. Jiang at the cliff base.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.890
Mr. Jiang said

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.610
Ning is in trouble

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.046
and asked us to take him up.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.030
Mr. Jiang,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.180
Lord Qi is also here.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.330
Tell us

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.100
everything you know.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.769
He is the real Chang Ning.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.730
Fraud!

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.130
Was this from Father?

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.220
I'll distract them.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.086
You take the chance to leave.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.220
We are actually both Changs.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.730
What do you mean?

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.730
His mother is Mrs. Chang;

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.340
my mother

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.890
was just a village girl

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.410
who had a brief affair with Mr. Chang.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.180
Because of my lowly birth,

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:10.486
I was treated
as Steward Jiang's adopted son,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.660
so I felt resentful.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.010
That day at the grave, I met Lord Song

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.220
and learning of the Changs' tragedy.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.610
Then I decided to take his place.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.850
You didn't say that before.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.340
You said

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.610
you'd avenge your father.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.700
That's true.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.610
Though Mr. Chang disowned me,

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980
he was still my father.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.340
He was killed,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.530
and I must avenge him.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:32.690
Nonsense.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.490
Both of you

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.820
are still suspicious.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.370
Qi,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.130
Xiaofeng and I found

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.980
the Changs' belongings

00:14:41.363 --> 00:14:42.829
at a pawnshop near Hanhai Mountains.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.970
Following the clues,

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.306
we infiltrated the demon sect

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.700
and discovered the culprit
is the Demonic Camp.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.123
We learned that over a year ago,

00:14:50.134 --> 00:14:51.707
the demon sect had an internal conflict,

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.490
the young master Mu Qingyan was killed,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.340
and Nie Zhe

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.580
secured the leader position.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.700
Lately, they've expanded their followers

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.753
and trained death squads,

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.610
likely targeting
the Six Sects of Beichen,

00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:04.866
planning large-scale revenge.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.330
Alright.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.850
Now, the truth is clear.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.260
For safety,

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.730
both of you

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.250
should stay here.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.850
As for revenge,

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.580
after the memorial,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.780
the Six Sects

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.340
will give you an answer.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.260
Thank you, Lord Qi.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.340
Since you can't leave,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.820
Mr. Jiang, why not stay

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.490
and help with my herb fields,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.940
as a way to strengthen your health?

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.370
You've left.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:57.770
Why get involved?

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.600
I didn't know Father's plan

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.300
and almost endangered you.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.210
Sorry.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.250
Your survival

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.980
is the greatest comfort

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.300
to Mr. Chang's spirit.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.730
Is the culprit

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.130
really the Demonic Camp?

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.610
Not only them.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.490
Qiu Yuanfeng is also involved.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.420
Taichu Temple...

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.770
I'll avenge the Changs.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.540
Don't act recklessly.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.010
Neither should you.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.580
As the lord of a temple,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.130
Qiu Yuanfeng ranks in the top ten
among the elites.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.100
Targeting him is suicide.

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.016
Master will investigate thoroughly.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.300
You and Mr. Jiang

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.370
should just stay here.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.820
Zhao, don't worry.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.193
The Peng bird is injured;

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.330
I can't leave either.

00:17:07.677 --> 00:17:09.210
The Golden Peng recognizes its master.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.940
How could it obey you?

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.810
My father raised it.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.050
I heard from Mother

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.526
that Uncle Chang had a harsh childhood

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.330
with scarce food.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.730
How could he have raised a Peng bird?

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.890
Zhao.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.420
Why don't you ask

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.610
who I really am?

00:17:43.956 --> 00:17:45.929
Jiang Ning fabricated an identity
to protect you.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.700
Uncle Chang taught you his martial arts

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.810
without reservation,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.420
even risking his life to protect you.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.160
I'm sure they had their reasons.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.010
You must be someone they trust.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.060
They trust you;

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:01.820
I trust them.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.810
I don't know your real name yet,

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.530
so I'll treat you as Chang Ning.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.700
As long as you do nothing evil,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.330
I'll protect you

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.420
and keep you out of danger.

00:18:22.896 --> 00:18:24.220
Zhao, you don't need to follow me.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.376
I'm just going to Herb Hut,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.780
not to confront Qiu Yuanfeng

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:27.870
or the demon sect.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.380
This involves the demon sect.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.250
The Six Sects will surely unite,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.170
cooperating fully.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.330
Perhaps by now,

00:18:36.377 --> 00:18:37.816
they're already making arrangements,

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.810
carrying out their duty.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.290
Truly,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.140
working together

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.860
against a common enemy.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.900
How affectionate.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.250
So, it's Zhao

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.900
and Chang.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.180
The young master of Peiqiong Manor

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.940
is about to arrive.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:06.980
Zhao,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.620
don't forget your betrothal,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.140
to avoid gossip.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.290
You didn't know?

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.700
Zhao is engaged.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.490
Their families are old friends.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.090
The young master, Zhou Yuqi,

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.980
and Zhao

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.810
are childhood sweethearts,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.220
a perfect match.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.330
Zhao,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.140
why didn't you tell Chang

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.700
so he

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.180
wouldn't stay

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.420
with another man's fiancée?

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.050
Do you hear me?

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.940
I was looking for Yuzhi.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.490
His fiancée stays with another man.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.460
Yuzhi

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.810
is so broad-minded.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.090
You...

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.090
Zhao,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.130
that's nonsense.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.500
Exactly, nonsense!

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.250
Yuqi

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.290
is Zhao's fiancé.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.620
When her training ends,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.130
she'll become the young mistress
of Peiqiong Manor.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.220
I heard

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.050
Lord Zhou and your aunt
were once engaged,

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.490
but he married someone else.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.140
Won't your families have resentment?

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.050
What resentment?

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.900
My aunt arranged that marriage.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.290
Then why did your aunt

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.010
accept this marriage?

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.370
Take the medicine.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.860
What kind of person

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.500
is Zhou Yuqi?

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:42.530
A refined gentleman,

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.010
kind and warm,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.620
nice and friendly,

00:20:46.162 --> 00:20:47.281
pleasant as a spring breeze.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.330
Chang,

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.730
my Smiley!

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.090
Run, run, run!

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.610
Don't come over!

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.250
Zhao.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.420
(Zhou Yuqi, Min Xinrou, Peiqiong Manor)

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.290
Yuqi.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.330
Long time no see.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:28.610
Long time no see.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.130
Why are you here?

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.330
I collected many rare items

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.730
and came early

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.850
with Father

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.900
to give them to you.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.020
Yuqi,

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.380
where's the big kite you promised me?

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.980
Xinrou has made it for you.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.850
It's there.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.130
Han, come with me.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.020
Do you like it?

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.090
Yuqi,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.460
this is Chang Ning.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.700
Ning,

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.420
I was deeply saddened to hear

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.260
about the massacre.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:14.610
Ning,

00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:15.760
please accept my condolences.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:16.810
My father has passed,

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.242
and injustice remains unresolved.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.390
No need

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.370
for empty sympathy.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.676
My father and Mr. Chang
were old friends.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.840
I especially brought

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.810
a Warm Jade Qilin,

00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:32.409
conducive to cultivating internal power.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.420
Perfect for Ning.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.860
Then I'll thank you on his behalf.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.820
No need.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.260
What's this?

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.290
Xinrou made this hairpin

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:03.876
with mermaid tears for your mother.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.010
I heard she already had one,

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.330
so this makes a pair.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.380
You're so thoughtful.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.260
And this?

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.700
These are rare storybooks
collected by Xinrou.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.273
Many are unique copies.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.860
I was worried about that.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.720
Xinrou, thank you.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:19.930
We're family.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.980
No need for thanks.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.020
Chang Ning,

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.810
why throw a tantrum?

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.646
Are you going to listen to your aunt

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.940
and marry Zhou Yuqi?

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:41.396
What's wrong with that?

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.710
What if he's not right for you?

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.570
I can remarry.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.980
Not a big deal.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.770
Marriage is serious.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.330
Your aunt is gone.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.700
If you don't like it,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.733
you can break the betrothal.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.900
Marrying Yuqi is quite good.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.050
Peiqiong Manor is beautiful,

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.010
the town is bustling,

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.380
and the surrounding cities and towns

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.220
have everything.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.730
It's livelier than Luoying Valley.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.530
Yuqi has treated me well
since childhood.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.140
After marriage,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.220
Peiqiong Manor will be mine.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.730
Chang Ning, what are you scheming?

00:24:22.143 --> 00:24:23.869
(Determination and Force)
Look at yourself.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.330
Think it about it.

00:24:25.516 --> 00:24:26.900
Marriage is not for you to decide.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.740
Chang Ning.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.420
I'm too young to get married.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.250
Moreover, Grandfather is ill...

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.290
He is cared for by the Huangsha gang.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.380
You need not worry.

00:24:35.513 --> 00:24:37.180
(Yang Heying)
Marrying into Guangtian Sect

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.082
(Sha, Lady of Siqi Sect)
is a rare opportunity.

00:24:39.093 --> 00:24:40.860
Why are you so ungrateful?

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.700
I...

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.810
You are my daughter.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.140
You must obey me.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.570
This is settled; no more discussion.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.250
This is Lord Yang of Siqi Sect.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:21.900
What does he

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.980
want again?

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.570
Zhao.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.700
Did you just see an old woman?

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.980
What old woman?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.730
You must've been mistaken.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.330
In the dead of night,

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:38.620
what are you doing here?

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.660
(Breeze)

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:42.540
Breeze.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.140
Zhao, do you want to try it?

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.240
Your wounds aren't healed.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.900
How can you drink?

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.660
(Breeze)

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.980
(Why is one jar missing?)

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.700
(Breeze)

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.460
Father,

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.460
Mother,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.730
do you think someone

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.770
would steal wine here?

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.180
Steal wine?

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.420
Of course.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.010
Your aunt has stolen before.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.810
My aunt had such a habit?

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.700
Yes.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.180
Your aunt

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.250
loved the wine brewed by Lei.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.650
But the ingredients

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.490
were rare,

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.420
and Lei was reluctant to give more.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.140
So, she went to the wine cellar

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.980
with Wu and Yuanrong to steal some.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.020
Is the wine

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.220
Breeze?

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.950
Come on.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.980
Let's drink.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.850
- Come on.
- Cheers!

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.980
- Cheers!
- Come on.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:46.930
Cheers!

Unfortunately,

those who drank with us then

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.090
are all gone,

even Yuanrong

Strike the bell.

Zhao,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.490
why strike the bronze bell

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.490
before the memorial?

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:16.290
This is impressive.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.130
Indeed.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.040
Impressive.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.090
Yes.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.796
The bell was left by the Founder,

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.220
cast from underwater iron.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:26.720
Ordinary people can't ring it.

00:30:26.731 --> 00:30:27.713
As expected of Lord Yang.

00:30:27.724 --> 00:30:28.640
Officially, it informs

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.220
the gods from all directions.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.730
In fact, it intimidates
the martial world:

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.380
Without this skill,

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.490

Lord Song is impressive.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.900
His internal force penetrates the bell.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.250

I dare not

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.330
compare myself to Ms. Cai.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.530
But I never slack,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.700
only to uphold our reputation

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.770
and restore our prestige.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:32.980
Lord Qiu is so upright.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.452
Indeed.

00:32:34.463 --> 00:32:35.420
As expected of Lord Qiu.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.270
How upright.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.170
Yes.

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.290
Why does he speak like that?

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.700
Isn't he saying

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.666
that Qingque Sect
has shamed the Six Sects?

00:32:57.349 --> 00:32:58.769
The auspicious time of the memorial

00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:59.820
can't be delayed.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.700
They vanished.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:26.490
This is incredible.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.620
Qingque Sect is still the best.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.960
No wonder it's the top sect.

00:33:32.153 --> 00:33:33.143
Worthy of its reputation.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:34.980
Lord Qi is impressive.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.180
Your Beichen Way

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.730
softens hardness.

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:46.526
The greatest sound is almost silent.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:47.900
It has reached perfection.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.570
I respect it.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:52.730
Thank you for your praise.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.370
Everyone,

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:58.490
in times of peace,

00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.900
with the world at ease,

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.810
we honor the Founder

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.130
and pay tribute to the spirit
of Founder Beichen.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.860
We hope all martial peers

00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.820
will join our Six Sects,

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.260
uphold justice for the people,

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.010
take the safety of the common folk
as our duty,

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.960
and promote the righteous path.

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:23.010
Promote the righteous path.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.210
Promote the righteous path.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.176
You're the one
who broke into the cellar last night.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.690
Who exactly are you?

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.583
You are Cai Pingshu's niece, right?

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.130
Why are you helping
these cold-blooded beasts?

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.090
You know my aunt?

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.210
Who are you?

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.690
Why barge in here

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.900
and ruin our memorial?

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.370
Ms. Luo?

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.780
Yuanrong.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.410
Yuanrong.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.660
Why are you here?

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.820
I'm the disciple of Master Canghuan,

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.210
former lord of Taichu Temple.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.900
Why shouldn't I come?

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.180
Lord Qi,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.410
I came here because...

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.260
Yuanrong,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.986
this is the 200th anniversary
of the Founder's passing.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.340
Such a solemn and serious day.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.210
If you act rashly,

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.940
I'll have to kill you.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.100
Yuanfeng,

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:06.926
Yuanrong may be stubborn,

00:36:06.937 --> 00:36:08.226
but she doesn't deserve to die.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.140
Silence.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.780
Yuanrong,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.340
for the sake of our shared fellowship,

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.780
return with me to Taichu Temple.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.010
I won't harm you.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.660
Senior Qiu,

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.530
Ms. Luo has managed to come here.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.226
Surely, she has an urgent matter.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.210
Why do you keep stopping her?

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.300
This is within our sect.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.650
How can a junior speak now?

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.940
Yuanrong was our childhood friend.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.820
She lost her beloved.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.820
It's not easy that she survived.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.260
She's here today;

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.210
why not let her speak?

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.780
Abbess Jingyuan,

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.100
Lord Qi,

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.210
I do not intend to cause trouble
on the memorial,

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.530
but without everyone present,

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.260
I fear my immense grievance
can't be voiced.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:01.740
Please, for my late master's sake,

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.690
allow me to speak a few words.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.780
Luo Yuanrong,

00:37:07.226 --> 00:37:08.866
you've caused enough trouble
these years.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.980
Why not retreat now?

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.100
Lord Qiu,

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.860
it's reached this point.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.490
Rather than suppress it,

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.860
it's better to reveal everything

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:20.820
and clear the misunderstanding

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.570
before the Founder's spirit.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.940
It truly is a misunderstanding.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.380
As you all know,

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.740
Wu Yuanying of our sect

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.780
died over ten years ago
in a battle with the demon sect.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.490
However,

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.570
since then,

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:43.420
Yuanrong could not let go,

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.050
insisting he was still alive.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.380
For over ten years,
she's repeatedly pressured us

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.900
to infiltrate the demon sect
to rescue him,

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.130
or falsely claimed

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:53.530
I killed Yuanying,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.530
wrongly accusing me.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.850
At that time,

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.010
Master learned that the demon sect used

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:02.556
living humans to create corpse slaves.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.650
He resolved to protect the people.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.490
He called martial heroes,

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.260
split into groups,

00:38:10.613 --> 00:38:12.513
and went to the Hanhai Mountains
to fight evil.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.620
That day,

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.490
everyone battled the demon sect.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.380
Yuanying and his team

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.210
encountered Elder Kaiyang
of Nie Hengcheng.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.650
Knowing he could not win,

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.900
- he shouted for retreat.
- Retreat!

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.010
(Young Qiu Yuanfeng)

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.530
But Qiu Yuanfeng, greedy for merit,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.530
recklessly attacked.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:39.860
Kaiyang was infuriated.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.210
Yuanying, disregarding danger,

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.436
sacrificed himself to save him.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:46.740
- Run!
- Okay!

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.010
Qiu Yuanfeng abandoned Yuanying

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.340
and fled.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.820
Exactly.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:09.010
That day, Yuanying saved me.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.530
But I'm not cowardly.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.350
I only escaped

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:16.530
by Yuanying's orders.

00:39:16.903 --> 00:39:18.260
When Yuanying told you to escape,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.420
you didn't.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.490
You caused trouble,

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.090
provoked Kaiyang, and ran away?

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.220
Lord Qiu,

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.570
take responsibility
for the mess you caused.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:27.650
Running after causing havoc?

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.210
Isn't that

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.210
leaving Yuanying to die?

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.900
I'll never forget

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:36.820
the life-saving debt.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.660
But ultimately,

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.260
we were all trying to defeat the demon.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.570
How am I wrong?

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.490
Yuanying isn't dead!

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.420
Your obsession

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.980
has disrupted the sect.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.980
Yuanying is dead!

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.650
Yuanying is alive.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:02.340
You are so stubborn.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.700
Fine.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:08.900
If what you say is true,

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.260
produce convincing evidence.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.900
(Wu Xiong, Wu Gang, Taichu Temple)

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.820
Yuanying,

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.220
I'm Qi Yunke.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.660
Can you hear me?

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:45.450
Yuanying!

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:49.530
Yuanying!

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.980
These demon sect beasts

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.650
are worse than animals.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.380
Impossible.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.570
I saw him die

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.740
with my own eyes.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.900
Where did you find him?

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:30.296
You must've colluded
with the demon sect.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.700
You are right.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.380
I indeed entered the demon sect.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.420
Over a year ago,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.980
I once again clashed with Qiu Yuanfeng.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:41.650
Why didn't you save Yuanying?

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:42.780
Let go!

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:43.660
Tell me!

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:49.820
Expel her.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:51.260
Yes.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:53.610
He severely injured me.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:56.690
Mr. Chang Haosheng saved me.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.890
Yuanrong?

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:16.260
(Chang Fort)

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:33.300
(Chang Fort)

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.490
I disguised myself
as an ugly scavenger woman

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.610
and searched every dungeon and prison

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.570
along Youming Path

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.010
for a whole year.

00:46:00.996 --> 00:46:02.300
Finally, in the EightClaw Prison,

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.900
I found Yuanying.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.180
Yuanying!

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:25.610
His eyes were gouged, his tongue cut,
and ligaments severed.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.300
He was soaked in poison.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.090
For over ten years,

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:36.570
Yuanying lived

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.170
a life worse than death,

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:40.580
tormented little

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.700
by little

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.170
to this state.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.610
You knew all along?

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.130
I did not know Yuanying was alive.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.740
Even if I did,

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.130
returning would've been certain death.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.940
What could I do?

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:03.610
Many

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.490
survived the great battle.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.170
I tracked them down one by one,

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:11.260
asked carefully

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.170
and clearly.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.780
Qiu Yuanfeng,

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.610
could you really not save Yuanying?

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:19.940
You harbored resentment for him,

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.780
thinking that as long as he lived,

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.130
you'd have no chance to rise.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.820
So, you abandoned him.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.540
Everyone, don't let her fool you.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.690
Yuanying has been trapped

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.820
in the demon sect's prison for years.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.130
How could he be rescued easily

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.650
and happen to appear at the memorial?

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.650
This is the demon sect's plot

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.650
to slander me,

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:43.570
sow discord,

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.570
and divide our Six Sects.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:47.050
How evil their hearts are.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:47.890
Qiu Yuanfeng,

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.260
do you still want to twist the truth?

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.820
I only want to prevent Yuanying

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:54.860
from being used by your demon sect.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:17.010
Watch out! It's Thunderstorm!

00:48:35.041 --> 00:48:45.701
