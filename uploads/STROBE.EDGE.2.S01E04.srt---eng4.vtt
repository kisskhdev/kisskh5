00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.890
I have a feeling.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.870
Someday, in the near future,
I won't be able to hold back these feelings of mine.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.040
I like Kinoshita. You deserve to hear it from me.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.000
Directly.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.870
Toss it away if you want.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.940
Or return it to Ninako. She might appreciate that.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.270
I don't want to be just friends.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.660
I want to be Ren's girlfriend.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.870
[How to make your crush fall in love with you]

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.770
Sir, what sort of girl is your type?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.050
What inspired that question?

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.060
I just wanted to know what a guy looks for in a woman.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.580
My type, huh?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.300
I'll be clocking out.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.800
- Sure.
- See you again.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.130
Give me a sec, Ritsuko.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.440
Let's head out together.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.960
Wait, Ritsuko.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.630
Ritsuko. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.180
I love you.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.650
How aren't you discouraged yet?
I haven't exactly been nice to you.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.730
But you have.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.080
You even kept that keychain.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.080
I'm imposing on that kindness of yours, you know?

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.880
You're forcing your feelings onto me like a kid.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.010
You're not my type at all.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.550
If you've never dated a guy not your type, give me a chance.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.890
I'll overcome your preferences.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.210
Alright, that's enough.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.100
Sorry about him, Kashiwagi.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.080
Manabu, you come with me.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.840
Cheeky kid.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.560
What if Kashiwagi quits because of your pestering?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.690
She turned you down, so be a gentleman and back off, alright?

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.700
Besides, you're no match for her, Manabu.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.340
Is that any reason for me to give up?

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.660
I can't ever become someone that I'm not.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.580
That's why I have to give it my all.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.200
I have to put in ten times the effort
for whatever confidence I lack.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.010
But I don't want Ritsuko to quit either.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.040
So I'll cool it a bit.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.580
This is the first time I've seen Manabu so worked up over a girl.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.670
Really?

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.350
Let me answer your question from before.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.650
Sincere effort is guaranteed to be a straight shot to the heart.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.660
And if you're eyeing someone at school,
Sports Day is a great chance to prove yourself.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.400
Sports Day?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.670
First, we need to pick our representative for the cheer team.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.020
Each second-year class is required to send a rep
to join the third-years.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.800
Any volunteers?

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.330
I volunteer.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.470
I'll join the cheer team.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.080
My name is Kyoichi Miyoshi, a Hikarigasaki High alum.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.250
Each year, the school invites alumni like myself

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.450
to lead the cheer teams for Sports Day.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.590
- I'm excited to work with you all in team D.
- Likewise.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.580
It's our pleasure.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.380
I can't hear you.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.230
Do you really think mumbling will encourage anyone?

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.300
Let me hear you loud and clear.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.460
Louder.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.990
Give me more!

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.220
Put your whole heart into it!

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.980
Alright, now it's time to practice our routine. You all ready?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.290
[Episode 4]

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.480
How was cheer practice, Ninako?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.470
Why are you...

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.710
I had something I wanted to tell you.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.590
What is it?

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.250
Did Takumi tell you about me?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.260
Is it all true?

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.440
Did you... really use him to...

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.040
Get closer to my crush? Yes.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.620
I used him to get to Ichinose.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.100
What?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.220
But it didn't work.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.420
I tried to push my feelings onto him when I had the chance...

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.020
only for him to quickly turn me down.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.950
I wouldn't have any issue if I was the only one left heartbroken.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.800
Except, I ended up ruining the friendship
between Ichinose and Takumi as well.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.620
It's the one thing I truly regret.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.890
That's why I asked that question the other day.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.060
About whether or not you liked Ichinose.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.680
Because if that were the case,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.250
I thought your feelings would only trouble him.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.590
Just like mine did.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.720
Ninako.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.270
You don't like Ichinose anymore, do you?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.540
The guy my ex liked... I actually clicked with him quite a bit.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.560
I thought of him as my best friend.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.970
We're never going back to being best buds, I suppose.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:51.060
Can't friends be friends, even if the feeling's not mutual?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.730
No, not anymore.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.850
That's a relief.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.120
Ren's hyper-focused right now.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.910
He sure takes his job seriously.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.630
Yeah, and all for Sports Day, too.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.230
Don't let his expression fool you.
I bet he's just thinking about dinner.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.450
Ren, what's on your mind right now?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.500
I was thinking about how I wanted fried shrimp for dinner today.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.130
Holy cow, you were on the mark, Takumi.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.730
Seriously, dude? Think about something else.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.940
Shove off. My mind, my business.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.090
I can't tell if Ren and Ando get along, or not.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.000
For your information? We don't.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.290
I'm going to go wash these brushes.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.010
Did you need to wash something too?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.370
Yeah, my hands.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.600
You seem down today. Is everything okay?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.210
What, me? I'm totally fine.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:45.310
It bothers me when you're not feeling well.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.040
Says the one who's more worried about dinner tonight.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.620
You were listening?

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.810
Yeah. I got a kick out of that.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.010
Ren, you have an interesting relationship with Ando.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.010
What were you two like in middle school?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:26.410
I was sort of made into the class loner at our middle school.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.550
The only one who spoke to me despite that, was Ando.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.380
He said whoever he spoke to was his business.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.220
And honestly, that attitude of his saved me.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.520
If I had it my way, I want to tell him everything.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.770
I want him to know exactly how I feel deep inside.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.200
You're the first person I've ever spoken to about this.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.020
Impulsiveness is getting the best of me.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.410
I wouldn't have even bothered, if you weren't the one listening.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.250
I want to tell him everything.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.770
And yet... (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.010
I'm happy to hear you trust me as a good friend.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.980
See you back in the classroom.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.910
What were you two gossiping about?

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.360
Taking the initiative now that you've given me a heads up?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.630
Then you take a swing.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.710
And my leg goes here?

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.160
- Actually, swing this way.
- Like this?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.420
And then... right, you have to give a shout.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.120
- Give a shout.
- A shout?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.140
Phew, I'm beat.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.850
That was quite the workout.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.220
Yeah.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.600
Ando, you were right.
Teaching someone else helps me concentrate.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.950
Thanks for keeping me company.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:06.010
No problem. Anything for the girl I love.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:24.210
How can I surpass Ren?

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:37.180
What should I do to turn your heart in my favor?

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.000
I like Ren.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.220
That's an unshakable, undeniable fact.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.060
There's only one answer I can give him.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.870
I'm sorry.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.540
Why does it have to be Ren?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.960
I don't like Ren anymore, though.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:18.450
A while ago, I lost the keychain he gave me in our first year.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.550
So I'm taking it as a sign to finally give up.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.140
Thanks for helping me out today.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.230
Ren treasures whatever bond they share.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.760
As does Ando.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.480
I can't stand to destroy it again.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.860
Because I thought your feelings would only trouble Ichinose.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.220
Just like mine did.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.040
There's only one thing to do.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.220
I have to end it here.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.380
I have to give up on Ren, for good.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.220
Did you give Ninako any weird ideas?

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.390
I told you I wouldn't forgive you if -

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.420
I didn't give her any "weird ideas".

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.990
Besides,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.840
it's not like you'd forgive me anyway.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.720
Look. If you like Ren, just tell it to him straight, okay?

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.420
I have my own way of doing things.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:42.100
And could you please try harder with Ninako?

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.590
You're not making it any easier for me.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:47.340
You sure don't pick your methods when it comes to Ren.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.620
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.480
I need to get going soon.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.850
Of course I like you.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.310
Wait.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.750
Were you really only using me to get a shot at Ren?

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.450
That might've been the case at first.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.010
But after spending time together...

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.590
I did grow to love you.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.680
So? Do you believe me now?

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.080
You're awful, you know that?

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.040
I treasured you back then.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.600
Whatever, it's in the past now.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.260
So? What's up?

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.500
I'm going to quit working part-time at Luce next month.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.430
What?

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.500
Is it my fault?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.600
No. I was always planning on quitting around this time.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.170
I'm going to go study abroad in London next semester.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.880
I want to work as a translator after I graduate.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.180
So I've been studying desperately to attend a school overseas.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.420
Now that I have the chance, I absolutely want to go.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.590
I can't pursue a relationship with you, because I'll be leaving.

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.460
You need to give up.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.830
For real?

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.410
Bummer. I bet I was so close to having you fall for me, too.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.770
I bet you're right.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.630
That's a dirty move to pull when you're leaving so soon.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.060
I'm telling you now because I'm leaving.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.660
I want you to give the next person you love

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:51.050
the same kind of earnest attitude you showed me.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.240
That way, you can surpass any sort of expectations

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.840
the other party may have.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.420
Ritsuko... Doesn't that mean you like me?

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:45.680
Thank you for giving it your all for me.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.000
We will now teach you all the cheer routine for Sports Day.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.890
Please follow Kinoshita's lead.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.410
Kinoshita, if you please.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.630
Yes, sir.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.110
Hello there.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:26.050
When I give you all the verbal signal,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.020
please punch your fists this way.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.180
And then...

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.650
Sorry, the other way.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.880
Next, we go... left?

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.000
Sorry, this was the right way.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.410
Great. After that...

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.040
We can't hear you back here.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.940
Your instructions aren't clear either.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.240
I'm not exactly motivated to cheer with you at the helm.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.140
Pipe down.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.510
That's no way to treat someone who's doing their best.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.550
You okay?

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.840
I was turned down, for good.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.730
I see. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.210
What about you, Ninako?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.840
Are those dudes' comments still bothering you?

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:01.140
I have something that I'm wishing for with all my heart.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:06.640
But that wish is something I have to give up on.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.890
What do you think I should do?

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.480
How do people manage to move on?

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.180
You have to believe you're giving up for a better cause.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.870
At least, that's what I would do.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.100
I have to give up on Ren...

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.050
to protect whatever both Ando and Ren hold dear.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.710
That's a better cause as any.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.850
Right.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.250
That's what I have to believe.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.170
Make a strike out left on my cue.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.850
Ready, and punch!

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.790
Uh... guys?

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.840
Sorry, I think most of us were just caught off guard.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.210
We can hear you loud and clear today!

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:33.020
I need to take this seriously if I want anyone to follow suit.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.180
So who's with me? Ready, and...

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.840
Alright, let's take it from the top.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.000
Here.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.970
Great job today.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.930
Thanks.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.030
Sorry.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.040
About what?

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.940
I shouldn't have spoken up the other day.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.450
I only added to the pressure you must've been feeling.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.530
That's not true.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.310
You inspired me to get my act together.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.670
So if anything, I should be thanking you.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.750
I'm going to go get changed.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.180
Kinoshita.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.000
I feel like something's been bothering you recently.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.250
I'm fine. You heard me leading the class today.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.490
Can't I be the one to listen?

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.430
You're the one who said speaking up helps, remember?

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:36.260
I want to help you, in any way I can.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.430
I can't tell him a thing.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:46.250
Not about how I love him, nor about how I'm giving up.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.830
Thanks.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.850
I'm glad I have a great friend like you.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.490
I can't say anything to him.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.250
[Hikarigasaki High School - Sports Day]

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.500
The opening ceremony of the Hikarigasaki High Sports Day
[Team D]

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.890
will be commencing shortly.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.200
Ninako?

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.010
You don't look too good. Are you okay?

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.250
I keep getting nervous thinking about cheering later today...

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.890
Ando.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:30.220
I'm going to confess to Kinoshita after Sports Day today.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.370
[Next Episode]

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.700
Please don't give up on Ninako.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.500
I won't lose.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.120
You'll find the confidence to run without hesitating.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.100
Kinoshita, I like you.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.940
Even if you have someone else in your heart.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.660
Ando?

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.480
[Epilogue]

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.010
What were you two gossiping about?

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.090
Taking the initiative now that you've given me a heads up?

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:25.800
You said... we were still barely friends, right?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.080
Well, I'd like us to stay that way, too.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:37.580
But I don't care if it all falls apart,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.270
and I lose you for good.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.720
Because this time, I'm not backing down.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.060
I'm making my move, too.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.730
Fine.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.770
Bring it on.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.230
I'm not handing her to you.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.470
You stole the words right from my mouth.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.270
- Stupid Ren.
- Stupid Ando.
