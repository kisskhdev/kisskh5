WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.920
Where’s the bathroom?

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.040
- It’s…
- Over there.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.280
Baby.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.440
How’d you know that?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.520
You and U somehow feel very similar.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.160
How so?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.200
U looks at North the way you look at me.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.880
It’s like I finally have a family today.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.080
I love you, North.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.560
I love you, too, U.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.280
NO SALTED ROLLS BECAUSE WE
DON’T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.720
Try this.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.480
Happy to.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.440
- So good.
- Smells amazing.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.480
Can I take a few boxes home?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.520
It’s for my family.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.360
A few boxes?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.720
Do you plan to spike up
your Grandpa’s blood sugar?

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.480
It’s not for Grandpa.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.360
It’s for my boyfriend’s mother.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.640
Oh, my. Oh, my.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.560
Love is in the air and it stinks!

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.600
Alright.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.000
Take whatever you want.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.360
But ask her to vote which of these
we should put on the menu.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280
I’ll just grab a few…

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.000
All of this.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.360
See you.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.800
Bye.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.520
Bye.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.880
Thank you for this.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.320
The house is quite spacious,
just like how you requested.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.960
I am relieved you like it.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.160
We can…

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.240
Excuse me, did you have an appointment
to see the property?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.920
I’m only available to be here
for the next 20 minutes.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.280
Oh?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.360
Why did Mom suddenly
want to sell this house?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.760
That would be too bad.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.240
Maybe I should buy it.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.160
It’s full of memories.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.760
I’m not sure what you mean, sir.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.120
The owner of this house is a foreigner

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.840
who has returned to Denmark.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.080
I think there’s been a misunderstanding.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.000
Hold on.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.280
Ma’am, sir, excuse me for a minute.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.240
Look.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.200
I don’t think this house belongs
to your partner’s family.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.760
This house… it’s often rented out
to con artists to scam people.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.160
That’s not true.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.480
The house is full of my boyfriend’s stuff.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.280
ISSARA PREECHAJIT

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.880
They haven’t taken anything much
from you, I hope?

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.280
Oh!

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.240
Hey!

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.280
Hey!

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.120
Oh, you’re all here.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.680
Did something happe—

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.800
I know the truth!

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.000
North.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.680
What are you talking about?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.160
I went to that house today.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.160
The real estate agent told me everything.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.920
North.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.960
I— I can explain.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.680
Go on.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.000
I can’t wait to hear
what the hell all this was about.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.760
Well?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.160
WOMAN SCAMMED BY
HANDSOME CON MAN

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.280
You’re going to jail.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.400
Nana.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.040
Yes?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.640
Call the police.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.800
Nana, hold on.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.400
If this makes headlines,
things could blow up in our faces.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.400
I don’t care.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.200
I’m making sure he’s going to prison.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.840
You need to get a divorce right away.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.600
Right now.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.240
But it is past district offices’ working hours.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.680
Go and wait outside their building!

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.400
No.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.960
I don’t want a divorce.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.000
I love North.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.600
North, you have to believe me.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.760
I really do love you.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.640
I’m not lying.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.160
Who’d be stupid enough to believe you?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.240
You have the audacity to say that now?

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.080
Pai!

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.720
Sir, no!

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.240
Pai!

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.040
Pai, calm down!

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.320
- Sir, please let go!
- Calm down!

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.320
- Please let go.
- Pai, stop this.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.840
Calm down!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.320
Now call the police.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.840
But if we do and your family finds out,
you will be in trouble, sir.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.440
Can we pay the press to keep quiet?

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.640
I’ll check.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.600
Pai, you know…

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.600
We won’t be able to press any charges
without evidence anyway.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.760
The only way to hold him accountable
is to sue him.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.400
Nana.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.120
Yes?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.400
Get me an attorney.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.120
I don’t want anyone my family knows.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.040
Yes, sir.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.040
But this will take a while since
your family knows all the best lawyers.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.680
North.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.240
Gather evidence.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.000
Yes, Pai.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.240
I don’t know if
I’ll be able to find any, though.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.960
North.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.320
Please let me explain.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.640
Keep your excuses for the court.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.880
Pai.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.520
Let’s call it a day.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.400
I’m tired.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.720
Please. I just want to be alone.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.000
But what will we do with him?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.400
Tied him up here until the police get here?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.960
Can we at least have him locked up
at the police precinct?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.360
I’m not going anywhere, Mr. Pai.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.000
I’m staying right here with North

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.200
until we’re through with this.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.200
What right do you have to do that?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.600
I do, though, legally, too.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.440
Legally speaking,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.760
the ones who are trespassing are us, sir.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.680
Damn it!

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.400
The thief is sitting right in front of us
but we can’t do anything?

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.160
What do I have to do
for you to listen to me?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.000
There’s nothing you can do
for me to give you a second chance.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.680
Can I talk to North alone?

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.360
How can I be sure you won’t hurt him?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.320
I would never hurt North—

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.040
I don’t believe you!

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.960
Stop it, all of you!

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.720
Get out of here.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.880
Let me talk to him alone.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.960
Pai.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.120
This is a sensitive matter.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.360
I think we should
give North some room to think.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.600
What if he runs away or hurts North?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.960
How about this?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.600
There’s a camera in this teddy.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.360
Please forgive me.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.160
Excuse me.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.400
I found it!

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.400
Face scan, please.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.520
I’ve downloaded a tracking app
on this phone, sir.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.720
We will be notified wherever he goes.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.840
Can you let me talk to North now?

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.120
Don’t cave in, North.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.000
Yes, Pai.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.960
At least this is better than U getting away.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.960
I must come across like such a fool to you.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.960
I admit I used to be a con artist.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.920
But I quit, North.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.400
Because of you, I realized
I don’t want to do that anymore.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.280
I’m serious.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.560
Come on.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.480
I don’t think I can trust you anymore.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.720
Go away.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.120
I’d rather we stay out of
each other’s way from now on.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.120
I’m not going.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.160
I’ll do whatever it takes
for you to believe me.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.800
Go on and slap me if you’re so mad at me,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.400
but I’m not going anywhere.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.880
You slapped me!

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.560
Well, you told me to!

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.280
Oh, was that a lie as well?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.720
How can I even trust you again?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.520
Sit down.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.400
Sit back down!

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.360
North.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.760
I wasn’t lying—

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.040
Stay put!

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.320
Hold on, North.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.080
I thought you were letting me go?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.480
Crap!

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.520
Crap!

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.720
You’re finally awake.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120
I’m going to have breakfast.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.120
Oh?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.200
What about me?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.600
I can’t let you run away,
but then I can’t trust you if you stay.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.160
What a headache!

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.840
Should I just take you to an animal hospital
and get you a microchip?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.280
What vet would agree to do that?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.000
How about this?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.400
If you’re so afraid I’d run,
take me with you everywhere.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.560
I’m okay with that.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.280
Alright?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.920
Stay where I can see you.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.000
Don’t talk to me.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.920
Don’t bother me.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.160
Yes.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.960
I’m going to sue the hell out of him.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.560
I’ll make sure he has no place
in the world after this.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.440
Good morning, Mr. Pai, Mr. Tim.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.400
How was it?

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.120
Is everything okay?

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.080
Do we still have eye on U?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.000
Mr. U shows no sign of running away, sir.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.040
I have my eye on him at all times.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.520
As for the shooting instructor,
I’ve found you one.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680
Shooting?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.160
Yes.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.120
Your schedule is currently full,
though, Mr. Pai.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.160
What about Saturday morning?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.800
Aren’t you and Mr. Tim going to a district
office for your marriage registration?

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.160
That’s right.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.400
I’m sorry.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.160
I’m so preoccupied with this matter
with North that I forgot.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:36.880
It’s okay.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.160
I understand.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.080
We’re not in a rush anyway.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.880
Well, cancel that, then.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.600
I want to learn how to use a gun
as soon as possible.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.320
Of course, sir.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.880
All of these were given as gratuitous gifts,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.920
as evidential on our Instagram posts.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.200
I’m good to go.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.000
He’s learning how to use a gun
just because his cousin gets scammed.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.600
If he finds out he’s in the same boat,
I’m gonna be dead on the spot.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.680
Can this get any worse?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.520
Hello, Mr. Prasit.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.160
You look amazing.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.880
Hello, sir.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.520
It’s been a while, Tim.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.800
Oh, I’ve just been busy.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.280
You gotta make time to pay back
what you owe me, kid.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.600
I’m sorry.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.120
Everything okay with you?

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.840
I’m kinda in a pinch lately

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.600
and I thought maybe you can give me
just a little more time.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.960
Of course. Time, I can give you.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.400
I don’t recommend you
disappearing on me, though.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.240
You’ve been doing so well
at clearing your debt.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.560
Right.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.360
I’m definitely not going anywhere—

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I’m just tying my shoe laces, sir.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.160
Don’t worry.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.360
Not a thing to worry about, sir.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.040
My plan is coming along nicely.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.920
All I ask is that you are
a little patient with me, sir.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.920
Thank you.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.800
I thought we’re done talking?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.080
Can I go?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.120
Please.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.920
Right.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.400
I’m really sorry, sir.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.200
Bye.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.960
Pai.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.920
Oh, that…

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.880
I didn’t know
people still send hard copy invitations.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.360
Exactly what I was thinking.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.080
Who even does that anymore?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.560
Where were you today?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.800
Why is your bag so bulky?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.000
Oh, I went to the gym.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.280
How come you’re home early today?

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.800
Nana found me a lawyer.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.840
I hurried home to deal with this matter.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.320
Good job, Nana. Good job.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.520
I’m gonna go unpack in the bedroom.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.680
Stay here, Pai.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.880
I’ll go with you.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.800
You seem tense, baby.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.200
Is everything alright?

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.240
Oh…

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.720
You can be honest with me, Tim.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.160
Are you…

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.280
Mad at me?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.880
What?

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.360
You were chopping your words and then
barging in here to get away from me.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.720
Something just feels wrong.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.200
What are you mad at me about?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.480
Oh.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.760
It’s…

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.960
You’ve been very busy and tense lately.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.920
We barely had any alone time at all.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.000
You’re right.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.960
I’m sorry.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.040
Can you forgive me?

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.440
We have 40 minutes until the appointment.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.000
Alright.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.560
What am I, a dog?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.000
Thanks.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.640
Yes, Pai?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.000
Everything’s okay.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.560
U is still here.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.600
Look.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.200
Good.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.480
See me at the meeting room
in the common area in 10 minutes.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.040
I got us a lawyer.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:29.640
Yes, Pai.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.800
Baby?

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.200
Pai got us a lawyer.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.480
You’re dead meat, U.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.200
Hello.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.560
My name is Prem.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.840
I’m U’s lawyer.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.920
TWO HOURS PRIOR

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.680
YOU KNOW WHO IS BAD
(Here’s the contact of the lawyer I know.)

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.800
(I told him about you.)

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.920
(He’s going to take the job.)

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.600
(Delete this chat after you read it.)

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.200
Let’s begin.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.240
Pai, there’s this guy—

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.480
North, don’t interrupt.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.000
From what I was told,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
I think we can sue him for fraud.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.360
Does that mean we can
take legal actions right away?

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:56.440
Does that mean we can
take legal actions right away?

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:56.640
Yes.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.800
However, this will likely become a scandal.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.000
Once we gather enough evidence,
please proceed right away.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.760
Between fame and revenge,

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.600
I prefer the latter.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.120
Allow me a question, sir.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.160
You want to sue him for fraud.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.840
On what ground are you accusing him?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.480
My name is Prem.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.840
I am Mr. U’s lawyer.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.120
That’s what I was trying to tell you, Pai.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.840
He’s a con artist who coaxed
my cousin into marrying him.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.800
That should be enough to put him in jail.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.080
If it is that easy,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.720
there would be no need
for four years of law school.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.000
Hey.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.480
Your cousin was the one who proposed.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.800
My client explicitly told him that he did not come from a wealthy background,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.400
to which your cousin said he did not mind.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.320
Which means that my client had no intention of deception from the beginning.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.560
I think renting a fake house
was pretty intentional.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.120
But that is not fraud.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.520
My client did not demand
anything from doing so,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.920
except the peace of mind of his husband
and his husband’s family.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.000
It is a fraud.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.920
Because he knew that if he impressed me,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.640
he would be one step closer to
claiming Empire’s money.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.640
Is there any evidence of
Mr. U’s intention in that regard?

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.840
I’m not sure.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.360
But I don’t think there is…

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.000
Mr. North.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.520
Please refrain from answering.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.800
Wait.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.520
U took 250 million from me.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.880
That’s evidence.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:22.800
- What?
- What!

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.120
What did you say?

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.160
I wrote him a check.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.400
Mr. North.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.760
Did my client specifically ask you
to give him 250 million?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.800
Mr. North, do not say anything.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.200
Right.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.320
Mr. North, do not say anything.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.600
I will explain in his place.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.920
When he was proposed to,
my client turned Mr. North down.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.680
His reason was that
their social statuses were too different.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.720
Your cousin, then, offered this 250 million
by way of leveling their statuses

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.640
in order to convince U to marry him.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.520
North!

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.760
Can we stop?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.520
I can’t listen to this anymore.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.240
Of course we can.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.440
This is a waste of time, anyway.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.480
If you agree to settle,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440
we’ll immediately drop this matter.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:17.960
No!

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.600
I insist on pressing charges.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.760
My client finally agreed
to enter into this civil contract.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.320
He has lived with his husband ever since
with no sign of running away.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.440
Would you say that is a fraudulent action?

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.240
If we can’t sue him for fraud,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.400
we’ll sue him for divorce.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.080
Are we… done talking?

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.000
Done talking?

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.160
We haven’t even started.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.360
I think it was the right decision
to fall back for a consultation, Mr. Pai.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.520
That attorney—

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.200
I freaking hate his guts!

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.520
U dared pull this stunt because
he had connections with such a lawyer.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.360
Anyone who’s friends with that lawyer
must be a dirtbag!

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.240
Excuse me.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.560
That went down the wrong pipe.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.560
Please go on.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.920
Dirtbag, alright.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960
As for suing for divorce,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.520
the legal grounds for that include adultery, insanity, misconduct, incurable disease,

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.880
or physical disability that prevents the couple from fulfilling married life.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.880
Misconduct!

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.160
He definitely has done that.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.880
In that case, his misconduct must
already have an effect on Mr. North.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.920
Are you saying there has to be a scandal that causes our family financial loss

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.680
or defamation before we can sue him?

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.080
Yes.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.760
The easier way out would be to both agree
to file for an uncontested divorce.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.560
However, reclaiming back
the 250 million would be—

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.080
Ugh!

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.440
Just let him have it!

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.160
No.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.880
Letting him fool us and walk away free
with 250 million in his pocket?

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.840
Only in his dreams.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.400
What do you want me to do?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.760
There’s nothing we can sue him for.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.760
Mr. Juean.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.000
What does my cousin have to do
to get his money back?

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.240
Negotiate with the other party
to agree to an uncontested divorce,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.320
and have him write a contract to return
the money after the proceedings.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.520
But… I don’t think they will agree.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.360
North.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.200
We need to talk.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.480
All of you can go home.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.240
That’s it for today.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.720
North!

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.960
I’m coming!

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.840
Let’s go talk somewhere else.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.160
Did the housekeeper
forget to come in today?

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.360
Come on.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.960
Your bed is a mess. Oh, sh—

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.920
Pai, you’re not allowed
to scold me anymore.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.880
I can’t take anything else today.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.160
If you scold me, even one word,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.600
I’m going to run off and become a monk!

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.480
North, a monk has to
wake up at 4 in the morning,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.040
live without air-conditioning units,
and eat only until lunch.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.480
You can’t even stick to
an intermittent fasting program.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.480
If he wants to play this game,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480
we’ll play, too.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320
And we’ll win.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.360
Game?

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.040
What do you mean?

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.240
Convince him to get a divorce
and give you back everything.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.560
I must ask you to do three things.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.520
Do not believe a word
that comes out of his mouth.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.680
Second,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.840
do not let anyone
know about this.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.200
Third…

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.240
Do not fall in love with him again.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.280
I can do that… probably.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.920
We won’t let him have anything.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.760
I’m sorry, Pai.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.040
I didn’t think a sheet of paper
like a marriage certificate

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.280
would be such a big deal.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.640
WHAT TO KNOW
BEFORE YOU SAY “I DO”

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.560
MARITAL PROPERTY

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.120
PROPERTY ACQUIRED DURING A MARRIAGE IS SHARED EQUALLY BETWEEN PARTNERS.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.280
YOUR OWN KIND OF DIVORCE

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.000
Hello, Nana.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.320
You didn’t sleep well?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.360
You seem tired.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.960
Baby.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.080
Is there anything you want right now?

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.160
Something like watches, cars, or a condo.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.720
What would I need them for?

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.440
I already have them.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.960
Why are you asking?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.440
Are you trying to make up
for something you did?

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.960
Come on.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.960
Talk to me.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.320
What happened?

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.120
I…

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.480
I don’t want to get married anymore.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.960
If we’re legally married,
it’ll be harder to manage our assets.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.360
And it will be even harder for me
since my assets are tied to Empire’s.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.400
You’re worried because of what happened
with U and North, aren’t you?

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.280
It’s not that I don’t trust you, baby.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.560
I just need time to sort out my assets first.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.480
So that was it.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.120
You scared me for a second.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.400
I thought you were breaking up with me.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.200
You’re not mad at me?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.720
I’m not.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.200
When do I ever disagree with you?

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.880
I’m alright as long as we’re together.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.680
eally?

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.440
Come on here.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.680
Look at your face.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.560
If you’re going to stay here,
this is how we live.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.160
If you can’t live like this,
then go ahead and divorce me.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.320
I’m more than ready.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.480
I’m staying because
there is no need for me to run away.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.520
You’re not running away because
you don’t want to be sued for fraud.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.720
No.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.000
It’s because I love you.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.960
I don’t believe you!

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.280
If you stay, I’ll make sure every day
is a living hell for you.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.840
You’ll beg for divorce and for your life!

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.840
I’m so scared.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.400
I get chills down my spine.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.200
I’m gonna cry.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.600
Scared, are you?

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.440
You’re so great, huh?

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.160
Thanks, North.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.440
You threw me these pillows because
you’re worried about me,

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.160
aren’t you?

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.480
Worried? As if!

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.880
Someone’s in denial.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.400
North.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.440
North.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.480
I need to pee.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.880

What do you think you’re doing?

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.640
Get back in there.

It’s me who has to ask you that.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920
I’m not doing anything.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.120
“Playing with a dog
will get your lips licked.”

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.320
You heard of that?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.280
Who’s playing with you?

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.760
Not me.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.560
North.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.880
Stop. Stop right there.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.160
Stop.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.280
Okay.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.360
Stop it, North. Stop.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.640
Don’t be swayed.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.320
Don’t cave in.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.080
Hey!

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.520
I told you to stop!

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.600
How did you get out of there?

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.960
I sneaked out.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.120
I have to be back soon
before North finds out.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.280
You’re freaking annoying, you know that?

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.800
You got everything you wanted
and got away with it.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.480
Meanwhile, I did everything right and my
plan still went sideways because of you!

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.280
Hey.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.200
Your target is as vicious as a dog.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.160
You can’t blame me for that!

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.800
If he and I don’t get married legally,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.960
I will have done all this for nothing.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.040
Then you have to do whatever it takes for
Mr. Pai to sign that marriage certificate.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.480
And how do I do that?
Enlighten me, Mr. Amazing.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.120
There are actually a few reasons
why people get legally married.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.800
There are certain rights only
the spouse or family can exercise.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.200
We still see a decrease in tourist number
within this trimester.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.600
We have come up with campaigns and
had collaborations with different banks

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.680
to ensure more credit card privileges.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.600
Ugh.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.640
Your phone keeps ringing,
did someone die?

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.080
Excuse me.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.200
(Hello.)

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.280
(Are you
Mr. Thanin Chaiyanuwat’s family?)

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.560
Yes.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.160
Did something happen?

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.560
(Mr. Thanin was in a car accident.)

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.000
What?
What did you just say?

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.000
Please, be careful.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.680
Baby.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.800
Pai.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.240
I’m sorry.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.200
Are you in pain?

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.320
What did the doctor say?

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.560
Is it serious?

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.640
You ask more questions than the doctor.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.680
What exactly happened?

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.680
TWO HOURS PRIOR

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.520
(The main reason
people get legally married)

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.920
(is the right to decide
during medical emergencies.)

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.800
Medical emergencies…

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.320
How hard can it be?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.960
Crashing at 30 km/h
will only dent the bumper.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.760
For it to be an emergency, I gotta go at 60!

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.360
Come on!

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.960
Who the hell would do that!

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.040
Oh, shit!

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:05.680
Someone bumped into the back of my car
and I swerved off the road into a tree.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.760
But the doctor said it’s nothing serious.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.440
I thought I’d never see you again.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.360
Don’t say that.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.640
Are you in pain?

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.640
I’d love to act cool and tell you I’m not,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.720
but…

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.600
It hurts.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.760
Pai, be gentle!

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.440
Don’t you have to go back to work?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.000
I’m troubling you, aren’t I?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.760
You were in a car crash.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.800
I don’t care about anything else.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.000
It feels nice to have someone
take care of me when I’m not alright.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.200
You know…

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.840
I’ve never been more scared of anything.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.080
When I was on my way to the hospital,
I couldn’t even cry.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.320
It was reasonably scary.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.000
You’re my whole world, Tim.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.640
I don’t know how I’d live without you.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.200
I’m so glad I’m still alive.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.600
When you’re all recovered,
let’s get married at the district office.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.480
You changed your mind?

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.800
We’ve planned to do
a lot of things together,

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.040
let’s start now.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.920
How do I win a divorce case?

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.640
Popular legal grounds for divorce sustained by court include:

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.440
sexual affair from either party or bigamy,

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.400
in which case usually successfullyresult in divorce given enough evidence,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.200
such as chats, photos, videos, cohabitation, or children.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.120
Too difficult.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.880
Give me something easier.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.520
Come on in. Come on in.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.600
What are you doing?

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.680
Why are you looking into that?

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.600
I want to divorce U.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.200
What?

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.200
Divorce?

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.000
When did you even get married?

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.720
It’s a long story.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.280
I’ll tell you later.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.680
But right now, I want a divorce!

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.040
You want a divorce.
Was it like, you were drunk,

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.880
and got married in Las Vegas?

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.800
Was it like that?

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.360
Something like that.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.000
But he refuses to get a divorce.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.760
Or… You can use me.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.200
What?

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.360
Oh.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.160
Are you here to see North?

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.960
Yes.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.880
Can I wait inside?

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.400
North will probably be home late.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.040
Of course.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.760
(He told me…)

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.760
(I need to make you like me.)

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.080
(When did you do that?)

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400
(I didn’t see it.)

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.840
(How can I find time to do it?)

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.560
(Use me to fake an affair.)

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.360
You can use this as evidence to sue him.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.600
Oh, this is so scary!

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.000
What is?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.400
We’re not watching a horror film.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.960
I’m scared of the dark.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.440
The dark?

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.560
Should we change the channel?

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.280
Something like a seahorse documentary?

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.640
What do you think?

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.360
Let’s watch this.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.640
It’s fun.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.440
Hey!

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.600
What the hell are you doing?

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.480
I’m your best friend’s boyfriend!

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.640
Don’t you care about North at all?

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.960
Shhh.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.680
If we both stay quiet,
nobody has to get hurt.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.720
Get away from me!

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.960
I’m faithful to North.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.320
He’s the only man I love.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.680
Don’t worry about North.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.920
He handed you down to me.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.040
North won’t be mad at you.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.680
Stop!

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.920
That’s enough, Pure.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.560
Why are you interrupting me?

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.640
We almost got it!

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.520
Why did you have to stop me?

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.720
North, North.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.520
Get a grip, dude.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.520
You’re hurting me.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.280
Crap.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040
I’m sorry.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.280
Are you upset because you still love him?

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:56.880
No.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.280
Why don’t you work things out with
the Inside Out in your head first?

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.200
Do you even want to get a divorce?

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.720
Of course, I do.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:07.800
North.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.600
You’re not someone who
ignores his own emotions.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.240
This is probably the first time.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.120
It’s only normal that
you find it difficult to do.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.080
I want a divorce, but he doesn’t.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.320
He wants my money.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560
Really?

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:35.680
But the look on his face when I told him you gave him away was really sad.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.800
He handed you down to me.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.080
What?

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.040
What did you say?

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.080
North and I always do this

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.680
when it comes to something
we think is disposable.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.120
You don’t have to worry.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.120
North won’t be mad at you.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.640
What were you trying to do?

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.680
That’s my business.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.960
It is your business,
but it almost became mine.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.840
If you were just a little bit too late,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.680
I would have—

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.440
What?

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.600
If I was too late,

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.120
what would have happened?

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.720
What would have happened, I wonder,

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.800
if you didn’t come in…

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.720
North!

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.480
Are you really mad at me?

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.800
What the hell?

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.520
This was his idea.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.160
North!

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.200
So here you are.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.080
Stop.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.120
Don’t go.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.200
I’m the one who should be mad at you.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.240
I’m not mad.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.360
I want a divorce.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:56.920
North.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.840
Why are you doing this?

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.200
Did you really give me away?

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.920
Or were you just trying to fake evidence?

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.520
Which case do you want it to be?

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.440
The latter.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.280
The former would break my heart.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.880
Will you just stop lying to me?

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.520
I stopped trusting you a long time ago.

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.840
I haven’t been lying for a long time now.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.920
You know everything
that happened was real.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.120
North.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.160
Will you please talk to me?

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.200
I don’t know what I’m feeling.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.040
My head is a mess.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.520
I don’t even know if I still love you.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.160
Well, shall we find out?

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.360
The dishes we’ll be serving today
are the samples of the dishes

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.200
you chose for the wedding, sirs.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:55.920
Right.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.440
Allow us some time to consult.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.640
I’ll let you know through Nana
what we think.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.320
Thank you.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.920
This way, please.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.720
Baby.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.240
Is everything okay?

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.880
I was butting heads with Aunt Kia
before I came here.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.520
About what?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.080
About leaving work to take care of you.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.760
She called me irresponsible and unable
to separate work from my private life.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.880
She kept saying
I was wasting everyone’s time.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.760
I’m sorry for putting you through that.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.000
When money and profit are at stake,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.400
no one cares that I am
just a human being with feelings.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.760
I don’t want to live like this anymore.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.600
I want to step down
from my role at Empire.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.760
What?

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.720
Maybe we can start
a gated community project.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.800
You’re an architect, after all.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.480
Let’s make something of ourselves.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.360
But—

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.040
Please?

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.880
I can’t keep living like this.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.840
I just want to be with you, Tim.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.000
Listen to me, U.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.080
You gotta do what he wants deep down

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.400
without his asking.

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.680
I’ll do everything in my power for you

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.720
to fall in love with me again.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.680
Where did you get all these ideas?

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.120
I just… watch and learn.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.480
Stop it, you!

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.040
Do you remember Kuea, baby?

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.280
My name is Kuea.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.120
I’m Pai’s friend.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.360
I’m Tim.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.200
His boyfriend.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.200
What’s wrong with you?

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.000
