00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"Candy"

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
(Episode 4: Your Scent Hasn't Changed)

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:26.239
Xiao He.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.519
It's so nice to have you by my side.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:40.560
Wen Nuannuan...

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:41.959
Hold it right there.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560
Did you forget you were just mad at her?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.200
Lin Can.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.799
Don't leave me.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.879
Lin Can.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.199
Did you...

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.599
make all of this?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Of course.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
A love-filled breakfast.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.599
It sure is...

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.039
What?

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.439
Got a problem?

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:03.479
No, no, no.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.039
I'll do the cooking from now on.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:06.960
Fine.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.319
You said it yourself.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:12.919
I did.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.759
How about we eat this instead today?

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:18.439
Here.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.439
Did you sleep well last night?

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.439
I'll take the couch tonight.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.400
But last night...

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.639
things were fine.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.759
Why take the couch today?

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.360
Yesterday was yesterday.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.560
Today is today.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.360
I need to return Si Han's call.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.599
You're afraid Sister Si Han
will misunderstand, right?

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.280
Afraid she'll get jealous...

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.720
if she knows we slept together?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You really want to know?

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.479
Actually, yesterday...

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.800
When did you...

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.479
start liking Sister Si Han?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.919
You big jerk!

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800
Get away from me!

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.439
I don't want you anymore!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Understand now?

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.000
Why didn't you say so earlier?!

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:47.120
You look pretty cute when you're jealous.

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:51.480
Si Han and I...

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.480
are just good friends.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800
Nothing more.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.719
Anything else you want to ask?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800
Well...

00:05:02.117 --> 00:05:03.310
(Si Han calling)

00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:05.117
Hello?

00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:06.278
Hello?

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.879
Lin Can.

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.359
Got some good news for you.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.999
There's a countryside reality show...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.440
that wants you as its lead guest.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.519
I'm not going.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.360
Hear me out first.

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.399
This show is extremely flexible.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.439
Hardly any cameras in sight,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.560
no script restrictions.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I'm not going.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.160
Don't be stubborn.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.439
Xingyu has already pulled
all your resources.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.319
Everyone's saying you're being blacklisted.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.359
This show is by an independent team,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360
no company channels.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.896
The entertainment industry
is never short of new faces.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.480
If you keep dragging this out,

00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:36.920
the audience will forget your name.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.800
I'm not going.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720
Just a work call.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:53.839
I know.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.560
Do I look that petty to you?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.759
But I think Sister Si Han has a point.

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.720
It's a really good opportunity.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040
You want me to go too?

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:07.759
Mm-hmm.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.879
But I'm a top star.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:11.439
A countryside show...

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.959
sounds miserable.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:14.759
I don't want to go.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
But...

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:17.560
Wen Nuannuan!

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.600
I know you're home!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800
Open up!

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
It's Auntie.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
What's Auntie doing here?

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.160
She's here for money.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.920
After my parents passed away,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.360
my uncle and aunt raised me.

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:33.879
You know that.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.480
I know.

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:37.879
But they haven't treated you well.

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.119
They took your parents' compensation money,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.560
and seized your family's house.

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.399
You don't owe them anything.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480
Actually...

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.600
there's something else I haven't told you.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.600
Back then...

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:53.560
it was my aunt who stopped me...

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.199
from going to find you.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.240
Where are you going?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.680
Auntie.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.279
I've already made the food.

00:07:09.713 --> 00:07:11.920
I have something urgent
to deal with, I have to go out.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.399
Going to find that Xiao He, are you?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.576
Everyone knows about
your disgusting little affair.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
How shameless are you?

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:18.279
What,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600
still have the nerve...

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.759
to go see her?

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:21.639
Auntie,

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:22.920
she's leaving today.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160
I have to see her.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.120
That indecent creature!

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160
Good riddance.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:28.920
Let me tell you,

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.239
you're not going anywhere.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.040
Our family...

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.320
can't afford the disgrace.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.920
You being rotten is one thing,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.759
but...

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.160
I won't let you affect your cousin.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.279
Stay right here.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.576
You're not going anywhere.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.600
Auntie!

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160
Auntie!

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.560
Auntie, open the door!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.640
By the time I smashed the window...

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.120
and rushed to the hospital,

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.639
you were already gone.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920
So...

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.519
you didn't mean to abandon me.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.000
Right.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.560
There's one more thing...

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:12.959
I never told you.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.839
Actually...

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.399
it doesn't matter anymore, Nuannuan.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.720
As long as you're with
me now, that's enough.

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.439
Okay.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720
Nuannuan.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.439
Nuannuan!

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.079
Quick, quick, quick!

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:28.399
Come with Auntie!

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.040
Come with me, come on!

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:32.000
Auntie's found you a great catch!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.120
He has a house, a car,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.759
a stable job.

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:34.080
Auntie,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.039
what are you doing?

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:35.759
I'm not going!

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.000
If you don't get married,

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:39.639
how will your cousin
afford the bride price?

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:40.399
Listen to me:

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.320
Either get married,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600
or cough up the money.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:44.096
I haven't even started the job yet.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.200
Where would I get a salary?

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:46.559
No salary, huh?

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.240
Yet you can afford to
rent back your old place?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.720
Playing poor with me?

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.159
I've heard all about it.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:56.759
You're assistant to some big star.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.639
A month's pay...

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:58.960
five figures!

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.120
And the motorcycle parked in the yard...

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.000
is that the big star's ride?

00:09:06.632 --> 00:09:07.632
Don't touch that!

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.960
Fine, don't go.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.200
Just give this motorbike...

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240
to your cousin.

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:12.679
Why should I?!

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.559
On what basis would she give that to him?

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:18.240
And who do you think you are?

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:20.639
I'm her boss.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.840
So you're that big star, Lin Can?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.440
Ran into a celebrity here!

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.000
Let me get a picture!

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.336
Don't you dare take pictures!

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.639
Get back!

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:37.240
No pictures!

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.720
What's wrong with taking a picture?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.200
This is my house!

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:38.879
You can't just snap photos!

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:39.759
Get away!

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:40.759
Move!

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.319
What's the big deal about a picture?

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.759
Met a celebrity!

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:46.959
Why are you blocking my shot?

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.960
Why are you filming me?

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:50.399
Let the whole country see...

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.080
an aunt forcing her niece...

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.640
to pay for her son's bride price.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720
With my following,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.120
that should trend, right?

00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.279
Hmph!

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:00.959
Let me tell you something,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200
Nuannuan...

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.920
has been raised by us...

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.279
since she was little.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.440
Clothes to wear,

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.200
clothes to buy,

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:08.080
university...

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.440
we paid for it all!

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.879
So what's wrong...

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.375
with her helping her cousin...

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.559
with the bride price?

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.840
Huh?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360
But...

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.399
you look...

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.399
familiar.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:22.679
What?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.480
Let's talk about where her parents'
compensation money went first.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.120
You... you... you...

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.360
You!

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.840
Now I remember!

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.039
You...

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.360
you're that Xiao He from back then!

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:45.679
No wonder!

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Even back then,

00:10:47.193 --> 00:10:49.073
you two were up to that disgusting stuff.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480
And now...

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960
sure enough,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.480
you're back together.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.120
But that's fine too.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.440
You're rich now, right?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120
I guess you could say...

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:00.120
our Nuannuan is marrying up.

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.440
So Nuannuan's brother...

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:03.679
is your brother too.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:07.200
Helping your brother
with the bride price...

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:08.919
isn't too much to ask, is it?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200
Why should she pay?!

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.960
Go.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.799
What are you doing?

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.840
Who do you think you are?!

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.120
Get out!

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.120
The internet says
you're getting blacklisted.

00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:16.135
Better scram while you can!

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:17.919
Let's see how much
longer you can act tough!

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.039
Open the door!

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.519
Open the door, I said!

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.080
Come out here if you dare!

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:25.039
It's okay.

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.000
How about...

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.080
we go for a ride?

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:46.159
Eat up.

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:57.759
Feeling better?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.080
Much better.

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:02.719
It feels like the troubles...

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:03.799
are slowly fading.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.600
Don't worry about your aunt.

00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:07.919
I'll help you handle it.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:09.759
It's fine.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.720
It's my problem.

00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:11.759
I'll solve it myself.

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:13.679
Consider it...

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:15.119
rent for staying at your place.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.240
Do you...

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.080
want to go to the countryside with me?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.759
You mean...

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.399
you're taking that show?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.480
Mm-hmm.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.039
I can't stay down forever.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200
Whatever you do,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.799
I'll be with you.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440
Changed my mind.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.399
I'll go.

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:13.200
Good.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.440
I'll make the arrangements.

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.399
Finally wrapped.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I'm exhausted.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320
No more smoking.

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:26.600
I don't want to smell it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
All these years,

00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:32.241
you never changed your perfume.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.279
I knew it.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.440
My old self...

00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:36.720
still stirs something in you.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.799
Don't flatter yourself.

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:40.799
Si Han.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.639
You're by my side again.

00:13:43.559 --> 00:13:44.559
It's so good.

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:48.559
Hurry up and get in.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600
Smells amazing.

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:05.559
Si Han.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.360
It's so good...

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to have you with me.

00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:14.120
I'll always be with you.

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:26.279
Si Han.

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:29.200
Let's raise a rabbit together, okay?

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:31.799
Mm.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720
Miss Jiang,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.000
mind the setting.

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:47.559
What if I don't?

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:50.759
Si Han.

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:52.559
Let's start over.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.960
Like last night.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320
Sit properly.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.679
You clearly can't let me go.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.720
Sit properly.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.440
Lin Can can join that variety show.

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:49.279
But...

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240
I'm going too.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.080
A lady of your status, Miss Jiang,

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:56.679
there's no need.

00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:58.639
Two choices.

00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:00.039
One:

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.080
You go with me.

00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:01.960
Two:

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.559
No one goes.

00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:21.399
It's only three days.

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:23.039
Do you need to bring this much?

00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:25.679
What should I do?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.280
I can't possibly pack everything.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720
Need sunscreen.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.120
My facial repair cream has to come too.

00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:40.159
This power bank...

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.480
do we need three?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.960
Alright.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.120
There might be no signal there anyway.

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:48.919
I'll bring one for you.

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:50.919
But I'm taking my helmet.

00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:52.959
They might have some...

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.559
motorcycle shooting or something.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.039
I heard from the crew...

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.240
there's a field work segment.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.799
These high heels might...

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.799
sink into the mud.

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:11.519
And these sunglasses...

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.153
These sunglasses...

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.399
do we need three pairs?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:18.759
Then you...

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920
take them out.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.079
I need to bring my autograph pen.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.759
What if they recognize me...

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.720
and swarm me for signatures?

00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:31.400
The troubles of being a star.

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:34.960
Go.

00:17:39.404 --> 00:17:40.404
Go.

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.359
Fine.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640
Bring this.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.200
Alright.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400
Come on out.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:47.839
Nuannuan.

00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:48.886
Cover for me.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.759
What's for lunch today?

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.318
That uncle still has a flip phone.

00:18:51.319 --> 00:18:51.799
Almost home.

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:52.799
Um...

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:53.559
Uncle,

00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:54.839
do you know her?

00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:58.240
Nope.

00:18:58.319 --> 00:18:59.559
You folks from another village?

00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:01.119
Uncle,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.839
this is a big star!

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:04.039
Lin Can.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.640
What big star?

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680
Who's a big star?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.400
Never mind.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.599
Go have your lunch, uncle.

00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:11.799
Well,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.640
the sunglasses were pointless.

00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:15.815
This place probably has no internet.

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:17.000
They don't even know me.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.518
We've been here a while.

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:23.359
Haven't seen a single crew member.

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.199
Guess it's true, like Sister Si Han said.

00:19:26.759 --> 00:19:27.880
This show...

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:29.319
is extremely free-form.

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:35.759
Maybe this place isn't so bad after all.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.359
I'm starting to look
forward to the days ahead.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.640
Wait for me!

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:53.079
Jiang Wan.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
What are you doing here?

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.279
If it isn't our top star.

00:20:00.043 --> 00:20:01.043
I forgot,

00:20:01.279 --> 00:20:03.079
you're washed up now.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.680
Si Han.

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:08.079
What's going on?

00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:11.039
She's... an accident.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.640
Don't mind her.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640
Focus on the shoot.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.000
Who's an accident?

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:16.359
Explain yourself!

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960
I won't be with her.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:19.359
Let's go.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.000
Lin Can.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Don't be rash.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.735
She's here on purpose to cause trouble.

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:23.839
If you leave, she wins.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440
Exactly.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.759
Don't be so tense.

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:30.079
What,

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:31.400
scared of me now?

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:32.759
Me? Scared of you?

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920
You wish.

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:36.799
You stay right there!

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.880
Are you crazy?

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:40.078
I haven't seen you in
days, itching for a beating?

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.039
Alright, alright, alright!

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:41.759
Calm down.

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:42.359
Take it easy, easy.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.039
Si Han, look at her!

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.799
Can you two quiet down?

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:49.399
Why do you fight the moment you meet?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.640
Every single time.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.880
What kind of dump is this?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.920
Lin Can,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.240
this is all your fault!

00:20:58.359 --> 00:20:59.359
Little assistant.

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:00.759
Tell me,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.000
what are they talking about?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.559
Sorry, Teacher Jiang Wan.

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:08.799
So clumsy.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.680
I don't know what Lin Can sees in you.

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.079
Yeah.

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:13.519
I'm clumsy.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.319
Sister Si Han and Lin
Can are a better match.

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:19.000
No,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.480
that's not what I meant.

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:23.359
How can you give up so easily?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.200
If you want something, fight for it!

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:28.519
Teacher Jiang Wan...

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.599
do you like Sister Si Han?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
You can tell?

00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:37.599
The look in your eyes
when you like someone...

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:39.039
is impossible to hide.

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:41.039
Is that so?

00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:42.599
Then tell me,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.520
what kind of look does Si Han give me?

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:50.680
A murderous look.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.279
Nonsense!

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.200
Idiot.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.760
Talking to you is pointless.

00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:56.439
You don't need to say more.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:57.639
I won't stay if she's here.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.319
You have to stay.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.280
It's your last chance to make a comeback.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.039
It's fine.

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:03.680
Doesn't matter.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.880
I've already found the
most important thing.

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:08.640
But what if Nuannuan wants to stay?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.799
How are they still not done?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.119
Go listen to what they're saying.

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.359
Eavesdropping isn't nice.

00:22:24.119 --> 00:22:25.119
You...

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.400
seem smart enough,

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:28.599
but you're such a goose.

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:31.240
I'm not going.

00:22:33.153 --> 00:22:34.353
How much does Lin Can pay you?

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:35.559
I'll double it.

00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:37.079
No, no, no.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.200
Triple!

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240
Well...

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:42.680
That...

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:43.519
Jiang Wan.

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:45.079
Hands off her.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.880
Si Han...

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.159
My poor feet hurt so much...

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.559
Fine.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.000
I'll have someone drive you home.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.480
No, no, no!

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:54.759
I'm not leaving!

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.920
I won't go!

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.960
Nuannuan.

00:22:58.359 --> 00:22:59.359
Sister Si Han, go ahead.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.440
Look me in the eye and tell me:

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.720
Do you like it here?

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.920
I think it's nice.

00:23:06.119 --> 00:23:07.119
Free and easy.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.440
See?

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:12.279
Alright, alright.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.319
But I won't do tasks with her.

00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.920
Like I want to see you!

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:19.599
Lin Can.

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.559
Come quick!

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:34.799
What a cozy room.

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:38.400
Not bad.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.640
Livable.

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:47.279
Hello, girls!

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.160
Hello.

00:23:50.161 --> 00:23:51.720
I'm the owner of this homestay.

00:23:51.839 --> 00:23:53.079
Just call me Sister Ling.

00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:53.640
Here,

00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:55.559
homemade rice wine
from our mountain spring.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.240
It's delicious.

00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:57.359
Have a taste.

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:02.679
Do you have sparkling water?

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:04.559
Afraid not.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.440
This is famous mountain spring water.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.160
Many people come just for it.

00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:11.160
Thank you, Sister Ling.

00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:11.920
No trouble.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160
If you need anything,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160
just come find me.

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:14.559
Oh,

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:16.519
remember to change into slippers later.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.279
Is there a schedule?

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:20.599
You'll know soon enough.

00:24:21.839 --> 00:24:22.919
Don't worry, get some rest.

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:24.039
Thanks, Sister Ling.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.720
I'm regretting coming here.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.799
Everything else is fine,

00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:36.279
I just can't stand seeing Jiang Wan.

00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:38.720
But I think it's nice.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.400
What's nice?

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:44.359
Here,

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.519
it's just...

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:47.599
the two of us.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240
We...

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:50.319
are on our own.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.599
Girls!

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680
Dinnertime!

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920
Coming!

00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:06.119
I'll change into slippers.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.480
I'm so hungry.

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:16.359
Sister Ling,

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:17.880
can we eat first?

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:20.200
Can't we do the boat task after dinner?

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:22.319
Can't help it.

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:24.680
This is a task the crew
specifically gave me.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.240
But whoever wins the race first...

00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:29.519
gets a barbecue feast tonight!

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:31.359
Barbecue feast!

00:25:32.319 --> 00:25:32.880
Is this water...

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.119
clean?

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640
My immune system is weak.

00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:37.119
I don't want to compete.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.799
If you're scared, don't compete.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440
Just forfeit.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.880
Fine, we'll compete!

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:44.119
Who's afraid of who?

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.039
Then you'll form teams for the race.

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:49.519
Good luck!

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.760
We'll definitely beat them!

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:54.559
I believe in you.

00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:59.160
We're a team.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.279
Pick the blue one.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.119
Don't splash me!

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Pass them!

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200
I can do it!

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.759
Faster, faster!

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.279
It's okay, we can pass them!

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:21.960
One!

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:22.519
Two!

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:23.079
Go!

00:26:23.079 --> 00:26:23.279
One!

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:23.599
Two!

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.160
Pass them!

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.440
One!

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.440
Two!

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.599
Go!

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.039
We have to pass them!

00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:29.720
Pass them!

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.599
Lin Can!

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.319
You cheated!

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.640
We won!

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:45.839
Let's race back!

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.559
You're learning to cheat too?

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.040
You'll lose going back too!

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:51.279
Go!

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:52.279
Yeah!

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480
You're amazing.

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:05.559
We won!

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:07.119
We won!

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.880
Get up here!

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.880
Silly!

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200
(Easter egg)

00:27:40.222 --> 00:27:43.120
I really thought
you weren't going to come.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.680
Too bad.

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:47.039
Lin Can already left.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:51.880
Nuannuan.

00:27:52.119 --> 00:27:53.439
Lin Can has her own life to live.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.400
Being apart...

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.800
might be for the best for both of you.

00:27:58.599 --> 00:27:59.599
Shen Hao.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.160
Don't you pretend to care here.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.160
If you hadn't told my aunt,

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:04.920
we wouldn't have been torn apart.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.839
What are you looking at?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160
Not embarrassed enough?

00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:12.519
Get your butt home now!

00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:13.759
Enough.

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:14.759
Let's go.

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:15.839
Move it!

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Disgrace!

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.640
Rich people are so easy.

00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:23.399
If they say they'll
pay, they pay.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.000
Not a single bill short.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880
But you know,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.240
I gotta thank that young man.

00:28:33.218 --> 00:28:35.125
For telling me all about...

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.480
your disgusting business.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:37.599
Who?

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.960
Who told you?

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.480
None of your business.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.559
Get lost.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.960
Disgusting creature.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720
Torn apart?

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.920
Just a couple of girls playing house.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.720
When a man takes a liking to you later,

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:54.639
this "sickness" will cure itself.

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:00.599
Wen Nuannuan.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.560
If you dare contact Lin Can again,

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:04.479
I'll post your dirty little secret online.
