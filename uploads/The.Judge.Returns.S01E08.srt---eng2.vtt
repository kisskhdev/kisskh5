WEBVTT

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:35.097
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:40.602
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:43.647
I knew it.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.666
I didn't realize
my enemies were everywhere.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:08.755
What's that nonsense?

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:11.550
Enemies?

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:14.428
It's not nonsense.

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:55.719
Huh?

00:01:57.512 --> 00:01:59.514
This is why we need the law.

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:51.525
You bastards!

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:55.779
What are you doing here?
I waited forever for you to return.

00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:57.990
Did he borrow money from you, too?

00:02:58.198 --> 00:02:59.741
Who did this to my boss?

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:02.577
Not me.

00:03:02.953 --> 00:03:03.954
It's him.

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:10.294
You bastard!

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:14.715
Hey!

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:24.933
Damn it.

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:31.315
Hey.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.301
You okay?

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:00.886
I told you to wait!

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.012
Be quiet.

00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:08.352
You little bastard!

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.239
You sure you're fine?

00:04:23.116 --> 00:04:24.117
I'm fine.

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:26.787
EPISODE 8

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:28.747
Hey, I'm stuck!

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:44.679
Take Chu Yong-jin and Cheon Hak-su.

00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:46.765
They're at the Buyong Police Station
in Incheon.

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.226
I'll also send you the ledger

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:50.936
of the kickbacks between Chu and Kang.

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:52.229
Okay.

00:04:57.484 --> 00:04:58.944
KICKBACK LEDGER FOR JT

00:04:59.027 --> 00:05:00.320
All done. Let's go.

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.322
PROSECUTION SERVICE

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:07.119
KICKBACK LEDGER FOR JT

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:08.495
Right on.

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:40.777
Sorry.

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.781
Some guys came and ruined my plan.

00:05:52.038 --> 00:05:53.373
Yong-jin got away.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.251
Mr. Kang.

00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:57.669
Yeah.

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:01.465
I know the ferry terminal.
I'll take care of it immediately.

00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:02.549
No.

00:06:03.758 --> 00:06:05.969
Would you take the ferry
if you were in his shoes?

00:06:08.054 --> 00:06:09.097
Oh.

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:13.894
What should we do?

00:06:13.977 --> 00:06:16.188
It won't be easy to find him
if he hides from us.

00:06:17.063 --> 00:06:18.315
We have to cut him off.

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:19.858
Mr. Kang

00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:22.611
I really don't have a good feeling
about Judge Lee.

00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:24.946
Since the draft dodger list

00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:27.365
plans keep getting ruined

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.367
since meeting Judge Lee.

00:07:16.748 --> 00:07:18.124
Who was it?

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:22.879
They seemed to know

00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:25.507
Yong-jin and his gang.

00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:46.486
You need to make yourself useful

00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:51.199
if you want to stick around.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.830
I know you know it.

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:02.252
That I'm the only one
who can mend your scars.

00:08:14.347 --> 00:08:15.515
Let me give you a job.

00:08:33.825 --> 00:08:36.661
I really don't have a good feeling
about Judge Lee.

00:08:37.704 --> 00:08:39.372
Since the draft dodger list

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.708
our plans keep getting ruined

00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:43.585
since meeting Judge Lee.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.425
We'll find out soon enough.

00:08:55.513 --> 00:08:59.059
PROSECUTION SERVICE

00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:01.353
I printed this file from your flash drive.

00:09:02.354 --> 00:09:04.397
The guy who ordered his men to kill you

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.942
and the "JT" here are
both Mr. Kang Jeong-tae, right?

00:09:08.026 --> 00:09:09.027
I know I'm right.

00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:15.075
Gosh.

00:09:18.495 --> 00:09:19.663
Would you also charge him

00:09:21.373 --> 00:09:23.500
with attempted murder?

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:28.421
Technically, it's solicitation of murder.

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:41.267
Yes, the "JT" written here refers

00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:43.228
to Mr. Kang Jeong-tae

00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:45.313
the third-term politician
from the majority party.

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:49.025
I sent him money every month

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:51.277
and delivered loads of cash
during election seasons.

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:53.822
As soon as my investigation ended

00:09:53.905 --> 00:09:55.949
he pressured me to smuggle myself out
on a ferry.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.495
I guess he just wanted to feed me
to the sharks.

00:10:11.756 --> 00:10:13.591
Gosh, that's refreshing.

00:10:16.594 --> 00:10:17.595
But you know

00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:20.223
my stomach feels a bit queasy

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.016
drinking cold water on an empty stomach.

00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:24.060
What's good around here?

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:25.562
Let's grab lunch together.

00:10:25.645 --> 00:10:29.023
I'll serve it to you on a silver platter.

00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:30.608
As much as I'd love that

00:10:30.692 --> 00:10:34.028
it's only a matter of time
until Mr. Kang finds out that you're here.

00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:38.616
I have to hustle to get the arrest warrant
before that.

00:10:39.242 --> 00:10:40.785
Why don't you eat first and wait?

00:10:42.036 --> 00:10:44.539
Oh, and jeyuk bokkeum is good

00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:46.249
around here.

00:10:48.752 --> 00:10:50.628
He mentioned Mr. Kang Jeong-tae.

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:52.505
They're preparing
the arrest warrant for him soon.

00:11:04.684 --> 00:11:06.352
Mr. Woo Gyo-hun.

00:11:06.728 --> 00:11:08.897
You admitted to falsifying your address.
Is that right?

00:11:09.355 --> 00:11:10.356
Yes.

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:13.943
My daughter had depression.

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:17.947
But she had one friend
whom she could rely on

00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.700
and I committed such an act

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:22.702
so they could attend the same school.

00:11:24.412 --> 00:11:25.497
I apologize.

00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:32.337
LEE SEONG-HUN, HAN SANG-MIN

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:39.844
You refused to submit

00:11:39.928 --> 00:11:43.264
your daughter's medical report
that was requested.

00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:50.271
Because it would infringe
on patient confidentiality.

00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:52.065
We just want to ensure

00:11:52.148 --> 00:11:54.442
that she actually had depression!

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:55.527
Excuse me!

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.237
Are you telling the candidate
for the Ministry of Justice

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.446
to break the law?

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.906
Please be quiet!

00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:01.658
This is an interview for Mr. Woo!

00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:03.701
Ask questions, then! Why the hell
are you telling him to break the law?

00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:05.370
"The hell"? Who do you think you are?

00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:06.496
How long have you been a politician?

00:12:06.579 --> 00:12:08.414
What?

00:12:08.498 --> 00:12:09.582
FALSIFICATION OF THE ADDRESS
FOR HIS DAUGHTER

00:12:14.587 --> 00:12:15.880
Mr. Woo

00:12:15.964 --> 00:12:18.216
during your time
as a presidential secretary

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:20.134
you left your stocks
with your brother-in-law

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:21.719
and retrieved them, correct?

00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:24.389
In other words, this is stock parking!

00:12:26.975 --> 00:12:30.103
It's not appropriate for me to speak

00:12:30.186 --> 00:12:31.980
upon a matter in investigation.

00:12:33.398 --> 00:12:35.275
You remember

00:12:35.358 --> 00:12:37.569
talking to your friends about stocks

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:38.778
back then, don't you?

00:12:38.862 --> 00:12:40.905
I have no recollection of that.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.620
We requested your wife's history
of stock exchanges

00:12:48.204 --> 00:12:49.789
but you refused, correct?

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:54.085
I didn't think I needed to submit
personal information.

00:12:54.168 --> 00:12:56.004
Aren't you admitting to the allegations

00:12:56.087 --> 00:12:59.132
by refusing to submit the documents?

00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:01.509
Ms. Park, stop assuming things.

00:13:01.593 --> 00:13:03.469
Our people can't accept his explanations

00:13:03.553 --> 00:13:05.096
when he keeps acting dumb
about the obvious!

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:07.557
Don't attack him without proof.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.017
Does this look like a podcast to you?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.393
Please be quiet!

00:13:10.476 --> 00:13:12.353
How can he be the Minister of Justice

00:13:12.437 --> 00:13:14.564
when he can't even answer these questions?

00:13:24.324 --> 00:13:26.868
A STRONG POLITICIAN
TO MAKE NAMMYEON DISTRICT GREAT!

00:13:28.578 --> 00:13:30.288
What brings you here?

00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:33.082
I'm Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo
from the Central Prosecutors' Office.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.001
Please begin.

00:13:35.084 --> 00:13:36.085
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:37.253
What are you doing?

00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:38.880
Please back up.

00:13:38.963 --> 00:13:40.256
Please get out.

00:13:42.508 --> 00:13:43.927
Take everything here as well.

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.563
THE PROSECUTION IS ON A SEARCH AND SEIZURE
AT THE DISTRICT OFFICE

00:13:56.814 --> 00:13:58.608
I'll issue an arrest warrant
once the session is over

00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:00.068
so tell him to stick around.

00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:02.445
- Text him.
- Okay.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.198
Alright, let's go!

00:14:07.825 --> 00:14:10.495
The prosecution is on a search and seizure
at the district office.

00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:26.844
Mr. Woo, you keep beating around the bush.

00:14:26.928 --> 00:14:28.513
Kim Jin-a went after Jang Tae-sik

00:14:28.596 --> 00:14:30.556
as soon as she became a prosecutor.

00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:32.475
Please speak.

00:14:34.352 --> 00:14:37.981
I can answer any questions
about allegations against me.

00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:39.065
However

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:41.818
I don't think it's appropriate

00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:43.861
to speak about my family at this hearing.

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:45.697
Hurry, Prosecutor Kim.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.952
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:55.665
What's this?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.084
A part of the set.

00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:00.211
Do your thing with this, too.

00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:01.671
You're the only one

00:15:02.672 --> 00:15:03.673
I can trust.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.676
Lies.

00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:14.642
Bust Woo Hee-young and stop her daddy
from becoming the Minister.

00:15:15.143 --> 00:15:16.602
I'm the mastermind behind it.

00:15:17.895 --> 00:15:21.274
A no-name judge getting
the whole prosecution in action?

00:15:21.566 --> 00:15:23.317
That's also got to be a lie.

00:15:26.612 --> 00:15:28.281
Man.

00:15:37.206 --> 00:15:38.332
Mr. Baek.

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:39.834
Yes?

00:15:41.627 --> 00:15:42.920
Let's go.

00:15:43.254 --> 00:15:44.380
Where?

00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:47.008
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE'S OFFICE
SPECIAL ACTIVITIES REPORT

00:15:54.515 --> 00:15:55.558
Hello?

00:15:55.975 --> 00:15:57.769
I'm Kang Jeong-tae.

00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:02.774
I need to speak to you

00:16:03.816 --> 00:16:05.276
one on one.

00:16:09.781 --> 00:16:10.782
Yes.

00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:12.784
I'm heading to Mr. Kang's office
right now.

00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:15.703
My prosecutor instincts tell me
he wants to make a deal.

00:16:15.787 --> 00:16:17.789
I'll need to see what he's offering.

00:16:17.872 --> 00:16:19.874
Let's go together. It could be a trap.

00:16:19.957 --> 00:16:22.210
People can't mess
with the prosecutors of Korea that easily.

00:16:22.293 --> 00:16:25.671
Fieldwork is for prosecutors,
not for judges.

00:16:25.755 --> 00:16:26.798
Bye, then.

00:16:27.799 --> 00:16:29.592
Mr. Park. Mr. Park!

00:16:38.351 --> 00:16:41.104
I'M KANG JEONG-TAE.
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU, ONE ON ONE.

00:16:48.152 --> 00:16:51.405
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:09.882
Yes, Mr. Kang.

00:17:11.008 --> 00:17:12.093
Still no updates on Gyo-hun?

00:17:12.176 --> 00:17:14.345
He'll go down before midnight.

00:17:14.428 --> 00:17:15.847
Why don't we wait together?

00:17:18.474 --> 00:17:21.060
Why? Something wrong?

00:17:21.394 --> 00:17:23.938
No, sir. Where should I meet you?

00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:25.439
Come to my office.

00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:27.233
Yes, sir.

00:17:33.364 --> 00:17:34.740
PROSECUTOR PARK CHEOL-WOO
OF THE CHUNGNAM PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:38.035
Please pick up.

00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:41.914
PROSECUTOR PARK CHEOL-WOO
OF THE CHUNGNAM PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:18:21.245 --> 00:18:23.748
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG
OF THE CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.543
FACTS REGARDING STOCK PARKING ALLEGATIONS

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.006
I think we've done enough talking now.

00:18:32.089 --> 00:18:34.425
Do you have anything more to say?

00:18:34.508 --> 00:18:36.469
Come on. It's getting late.

00:18:36.552 --> 00:18:38.387
Let's call it a day now.

00:18:49.273 --> 00:18:51.192
Alright, everyone, freeze!

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.530
As of this moment,
I'm arresting everyone here

00:18:56.614 --> 00:18:59.075
for violations
of the Narcotics Control Act.

00:19:01.994 --> 00:19:03.996
- Wake up.
- You have the right to an attorney

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.998
and to make a statement.

00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:09.835
You may request a review of legality...

00:19:12.129 --> 00:19:14.215
What are you doing? How did you get in?

00:19:14.298 --> 00:19:17.009
Oh, you're Prosecutor Kim Jin-a, right?

00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:20.471
Nice to meet you.

00:19:20.554 --> 00:19:24.475
I'm Song Na-yeon,
a reporter at Daejin Daily.

00:19:27.103 --> 00:19:29.522
Judge Lee told me that I'd see you

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:31.482
if I just camped out here.

00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:34.360
Oh.

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:38.155
Let's wrap it up now.

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:42.034
CABINET MINISTER NOMINEE

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.041
What?

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:50.501
EMERGENCY ARREST OF THE DAUGHTER
OF WOO GYO-HUN, THE MINISTER NOMINEE

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.879
It's an emergency arrest!

00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:57.633
I knew it
when he kept defending his family.

00:19:57.717 --> 00:19:59.552
There's no way he can get out of this.

00:19:59.635 --> 00:20:01.595
What a nice little daughter he has, huh?

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.309
AN JI-HUN, CHIEF OF STAFF

00:20:06.392 --> 00:20:08.936
EMERGENCY ARREST OF THE DAUGHTER
OF WOO GYO-HUN, THE MINISTER NOMINEE

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.855
A RAID INTO A VIP CLUB
BUSTING SMUGGLED DRUGS

00:20:21.907 --> 00:20:23.159
Mr. President...

00:20:23.242 --> 00:20:25.119
Please!

00:20:25.202 --> 00:20:27.246
Please! Please...

00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:35.129
WOO GYO-HUN

00:20:35.212 --> 00:20:37.715
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

00:20:39.008 --> 00:20:40.760
What the hell do I do?

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:48.559
WOO GYO-HUN

00:20:55.983 --> 00:20:58.986
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

00:20:59.236 --> 00:21:01.864
Why isn't he picking up?

00:21:03.324 --> 00:21:04.450
MR. PRESIDENT PARK GWANG-TO

00:21:08.454 --> 00:21:09.580
Mr. President!

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:11.582
Please help me out.

00:21:11.665 --> 00:21:12.750
Please stop the press...

00:21:12.833 --> 00:21:14.085
Thanks for your hard work.

00:21:14.668 --> 00:21:16.879
I'm sure you'll find other ways
to serve the nation.

00:21:18.214 --> 00:21:20.424
Mr. President!

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.801
Mr. President!

00:21:23.677 --> 00:21:25.429
Oh, I found him!

00:21:25.513 --> 00:21:27.556
- Come this way!
- Over here.

00:21:28.057 --> 00:21:29.225
- It's Gyo-hun.
- Mr. Woo!

00:21:29.308 --> 00:21:30.476
Mr. Woo.

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:32.853
- What do you have to say?
- Please explain!

00:21:39.777 --> 00:21:41.278
Stop it!

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:44.407
MINISTER NOMINEE WOO GYO-HUN'S DAUGHTER
ARRESTED FOR DRUG CHARGES

00:22:15.563 --> 00:22:19.150
Woo Hee-young, the daughter
of Justice Minister nominee Woo Gyo-hun

00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:21.694
is under arrest for drug use.

00:22:22.027 --> 00:22:25.573
The prosecution arrested Ms. Woo
and her party

00:22:25.656 --> 00:22:27.908
at a VIP room of a club in Gangnam
last night.

00:22:30.077 --> 00:22:31.120
Good work.

00:22:34.874 --> 00:22:36.584
I have a question.

00:22:40.463 --> 00:22:43.382
Why did you bring Mr. Woo down?

00:22:44.216 --> 00:22:46.969
He doesn't know how to respect others.

00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:49.972
Is that the only reason?

00:22:50.347 --> 00:22:51.849
He's also incredibly arrogant.

00:22:54.101 --> 00:22:55.227
Really?

00:22:56.145 --> 00:22:57.271
I can't accept such a jerk

00:22:57.354 --> 00:22:59.732
becoming the Minister of Justice.

00:23:01.484 --> 00:23:04.028
Why? Do I need to have a better reason?

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.321
No.

00:23:07.198 --> 00:23:09.825
Getting a Justice Minister nominee shunned
from society is easy

00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:11.243
for someone like Sin-jin.

00:23:11.869 --> 00:23:13.746
But where does that power come from?

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:17.917
Oh.

00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:20.544
Do you still not want anything in return?

00:23:21.212 --> 00:23:22.463
No, not yet.

00:23:23.631 --> 00:23:24.882
Not yet?

00:23:26.509 --> 00:23:27.510
I'll wait, then.

00:23:28.761 --> 00:23:29.803
Oh.

00:23:31.639 --> 00:23:33.015
You know Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo, right?

00:23:35.017 --> 00:23:36.685
He moved to Seoul with you?

00:23:39.188 --> 00:23:40.189
Yes.

00:23:42.858 --> 00:23:44.860
You've even cracked down
on a case together.

00:23:46.654 --> 00:23:47.655
Are you two close?

00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:49.240
No, sir.

00:23:50.699 --> 00:23:52.701
We just happened to work together once.

00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:54.828
Is that so?

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:58.457
Glad to hear that.

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.335
I'm heading to Mr. Kang's office
right now.

00:24:01.418 --> 00:24:04.380
My prosecutor instincts tell me
he wants to make a deal.

00:24:04.463 --> 00:24:06.257
I'll need to see what he's offering.

00:24:07.424 --> 00:24:09.093
Prosecutor Park is in danger.

00:24:11.095 --> 00:24:15.057
DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY
KANG JEONG-TAE'S DISTRICT OFFICE

00:24:17.309 --> 00:24:18.727
Mr. Kang Jeong-tae?

00:24:36.996 --> 00:24:38.247
Mr. Kang?

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:50.050
Jeong-tae seems to have contacted
Prosecutor Park.

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:53.137
It wasn't a coincidence
that Sin-jin called me.

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:56.265
Knowing he'll be at risk
once Mayor Chu rats him out.

00:24:56.682 --> 00:24:58.267
That's just how it is in politics.

00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:03.981
What do you think Prosecutor Park will do?

00:25:05.524 --> 00:25:07.901
Team up with Jeong-tae?

00:25:10.988 --> 00:25:12.114
Or not?

00:25:34.053 --> 00:25:35.304
I really wonder

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.434
why you approached me.

00:25:56.617 --> 00:25:57.701
Actually

00:26:01.497 --> 00:26:02.873
I do want something in return.

00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:10.589
Oh, you finally want something now?

00:26:10.673 --> 00:26:13.967
There's only one way to save Mr. Park
and get through this situation.

00:26:18.097 --> 00:26:21.684
Help me take down Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

00:26:23.644 --> 00:26:24.645
What?

00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:26.814
I approached you

00:26:26.897 --> 00:26:29.358
because I wanted to take him down.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.031
It's over now.

00:26:53.924 --> 00:26:55.467
The court hereby orders
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:26:55.592 --> 00:26:58.679
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:04.685
The Defendant has one week to appeal

00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:06.562
to the court's decision
from the day of the announcement.

00:27:07.479 --> 00:27:09.064
If an appeal is not filed

00:27:10.107 --> 00:27:12.943
the decision will be carried out
as announced.

00:27:20.075 --> 00:27:21.994
Right, I remember that.

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:27.166
That was you.

00:27:33.297 --> 00:27:35.257
I figured I'd need your power on my side

00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:38.761
to get Justice Hwang.

00:27:41.388 --> 00:27:43.390
So, that was why you dragged Gyo-hun down

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:44.808
as I asked.

00:27:46.769 --> 00:27:48.353
I wanted to get on your good side.

00:27:51.148 --> 00:27:53.442
People change for a reason.

00:27:55.986 --> 00:27:58.030
Your change came
with a desire for revenge.

00:27:58.822 --> 00:27:59.948
This is embarrassing.

00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:03.786
Don't be ashamed
of your desire for revenge.

00:28:03.911 --> 00:28:04.912
It's strength.

00:28:06.163 --> 00:28:08.332
A motivation to strengthen yourself.

00:28:10.667 --> 00:28:11.668
Would you have become

00:28:11.752 --> 00:28:14.087
such a great judge
without your desire for revenge?

00:28:17.841 --> 00:28:19.259
But you know

00:28:22.596 --> 00:28:24.973
I was also one of the judges
in court that day.

00:28:27.142 --> 00:28:28.143
Did you know that?

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.857
You were the associate on his right.

00:28:36.777 --> 00:28:38.779
You must be mad at me, too, then.

00:28:42.282 --> 00:28:43.617
Judge Hwang's ruling was

00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:47.704
blatantly biased
in favor of S Construction.

00:28:49.373 --> 00:28:50.541
The associates

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.127
both on the right and the left,
wouldn't have had a say in it.

00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:08.392
I'm hungry.

00:29:25.659 --> 00:29:27.411
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

00:29:30.372 --> 00:29:32.583
I thought Mr. Kim Jin-han was

00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:35.043
your only friend, Mr. Kang.

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:36.920
But you made another one.

00:29:37.421 --> 00:29:38.714
Do we look close?

00:29:39.256 --> 00:29:42.509
Gosh, I don't know what to say about that.

00:29:44.344 --> 00:29:47.139
Mr. Kang is a good man.

00:29:47.222 --> 00:29:48.557
Please be good to him.

00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:50.726
This is my bribe.

00:29:52.311 --> 00:29:53.353
It's good stuff.

00:29:55.272 --> 00:29:56.815
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your food.

00:30:01.945 --> 00:30:03.864
I was less than ten years old

00:30:06.033 --> 00:30:08.952
when I left the orphanage
and became a literal beggar.

00:30:11.496 --> 00:30:15.083
One day, I was rummaging
through a restaurant's garbage dump

00:30:16.585 --> 00:30:19.212
when a woman covered in makeup
called me over.

00:30:25.802 --> 00:30:27.220
That was the start of it all.

00:30:29.473 --> 00:30:32.976
I started cleaning and running errands
for a high-end hostess bar

00:30:35.187 --> 00:30:36.521
in exchange for food.

00:30:39.232 --> 00:30:40.692
I made a whole lot of food

00:30:41.526 --> 00:30:43.153
to raise Sin-jin.

00:31:18.897 --> 00:31:20.023
Go ahead. Eat.

00:31:55.851 --> 00:31:57.394
Let's taste the bribe, then.

00:32:07.112 --> 00:32:08.363
You're right.

00:32:11.074 --> 00:32:12.617
Nam-yong had ties

00:32:13.577 --> 00:32:15.954
to Jang Tae-sik at S Construction
at that time.

00:32:16.747 --> 00:32:19.458
And Tae-sik is now the CEO of S Shopping.

00:32:21.418 --> 00:32:22.461
What's your plan now?

00:32:23.587 --> 00:32:25.839
Corporations prioritize profit.

00:32:26.465 --> 00:32:28.425
Whether it was right or wrong

00:32:28.925 --> 00:32:31.011
Mr. Jang just did his best at his job.

00:32:31.094 --> 00:32:32.095
However

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:34.848
Justice Hwang

00:32:36.975 --> 00:32:38.226
went against his duty

00:32:39.394 --> 00:32:41.897
to sentence my father to jail.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.572
There will be a new Chief Justice soon.

00:32:55.368 --> 00:32:57.913
Stay by my side,
and you'll see and hear a whole lot.

00:33:08.381 --> 00:33:09.382
I can do it.

00:33:09.466 --> 00:33:10.467
It's fine.

00:33:16.056 --> 00:33:18.058
When the new Chief Justice is named

00:33:19.351 --> 00:33:21.728
I'll toss Nam-yong to you.

00:33:26.858 --> 00:33:27.859
Thank you, sir.

00:33:32.989 --> 00:33:34.741
Anything else you're hiding from me?

00:33:35.992 --> 00:33:36.993
No, sir.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.625
Good, and it better stay that way.

00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:45.794
I'll keep that in mind.

00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:51.842
What are you doing?

00:33:52.217 --> 00:33:53.260
Sorry?

00:33:53.468 --> 00:33:55.178
She'll get mad
if you don't finish the food.

00:33:55.262 --> 00:33:56.346
Oh.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.349
It's like you've barely touched the food.

00:34:06.648 --> 00:34:08.108
It's so tender and tasty.

00:34:11.945 --> 00:34:14.364
DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY
KANG JEONG-TAE'S DISTRICT OFFICE

00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:23.540
Are you okay?

00:34:43.768 --> 00:34:44.811
Am I?

00:34:47.397 --> 00:34:49.232
I told you over the phone.

00:35:16.843 --> 00:35:17.844
Mr. Kang...

00:35:43.036 --> 00:35:44.162
Let's go together.

00:35:44.246 --> 00:35:45.455
It could be a trap.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.086
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG
OF THE CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:35:51.169 --> 00:35:53.797
Where were you, then? You said you'd come.

00:35:55.298 --> 00:35:56.299
I had dinner.

00:35:58.051 --> 00:36:00.178
I almost choked to death!

00:36:00.887 --> 00:36:02.973
And you were stuffing your face?

00:36:03.056 --> 00:36:06.935
I told you we should come here together.
I said it could be a trap.

00:36:07.018 --> 00:36:09.062
Why didn't you come if you thought so?

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.649
"Fieldwork is for prosecutors,
not for judges!"

00:36:13.483 --> 00:36:14.734
You really...

00:36:14.818 --> 00:36:16.569
You always have to have the last word!

00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:20.532
My neck hurts so much.

00:36:21.283 --> 00:36:22.284
Seriously...

00:36:27.664 --> 00:36:29.541
I'm so glad you're alive.

00:36:37.841 --> 00:36:40.552
You make it sound
like we're close friends or something.

00:36:40.635 --> 00:36:43.263
What? I thought we were friends.
Was I wrong?

00:36:43.346 --> 00:36:44.597
Stop it.

00:36:47.058 --> 00:36:48.560
Call the police.

00:36:50.061 --> 00:36:51.771
Just don't tell them I was here.

00:36:53.565 --> 00:36:54.566
Why not?

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.946
How would you explain why I was here?

00:37:00.488 --> 00:37:02.449
They might find out

00:37:02.532 --> 00:37:04.659
that we colluded to bring Jeong-tae down.

00:37:04.743 --> 00:37:06.036
Colluded? What do you mean?

00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:08.788
I was just doing my job
as the prosecutor on this case.

00:37:08.872 --> 00:37:11.624
I was the one who handed over Yong-jin.

00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:13.877
And the kickback ledger.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.391
Is this the police?

00:37:38.443 --> 00:37:39.694
Oh, my gosh!

00:37:39.778 --> 00:37:41.488
Hop in. I'll drive you to the junkyard.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.949
- Really?
- No, let's just walk!

00:37:45.033 --> 00:37:46.576
You can't get stuck in traffic.

00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:48.203
There's no traffic yet.

00:37:48.286 --> 00:37:49.996
- Right?
- No!

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.247
Just go to work now.

00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:53.208
A judge can't be late to work.

00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:54.626
Aren't I right, honey?

00:37:54.709 --> 00:37:57.754
You're right.
A judge shouldn't embarrass himself.

00:37:59.214 --> 00:38:00.799
People bring everything to the junk yard.

00:38:00.882 --> 00:38:02.550
Why not an old car?

00:38:02.634 --> 00:38:03.635
Should I get you a car?

00:38:03.718 --> 00:38:06.012
Forget it. You don't make that much.

00:38:06.388 --> 00:38:07.764
See you later!

00:38:07.847 --> 00:38:10.475
Boss, are you heading to work?

00:38:12.102 --> 00:38:14.854
Do you want me to get you a bicycle?

00:38:15.313 --> 00:38:16.689
Forget it.

00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:20.402
- Let's go.
- You should walk more.

00:38:38.878 --> 00:38:41.798
Give me whatever proof or witness you have
against Tae-sik.

00:38:41.881 --> 00:38:44.008
You still think you can use
proof or a witness

00:38:44.092 --> 00:38:46.010
to arrest Tae-sik?

00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:48.680
You arrested him in an emergency arrest
and let him go.

00:38:48.763 --> 00:38:50.557
Did you do that because you lacked proof?

00:38:53.143 --> 00:38:54.727
I didn't arrest Woo Hee-young

00:38:54.811 --> 00:38:56.855
just because you told me to.

00:38:57.439 --> 00:38:59.983
I was ordered to arrest her, anyway.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.819
With a trash bag or something?

00:39:02.902 --> 00:39:03.987
How did you know that?

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.156
I told you I was the mastermind behind it.

00:39:08.283 --> 00:39:10.660
A no-name judge getting
the whole prosecution in action?

00:39:10.743 --> 00:39:12.120
You expect me to believe that?

00:39:12.203 --> 00:39:14.539
Who's got your back, really?

00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:16.791
Do they also have the prosecution
in their hands?

00:39:21.713 --> 00:39:24.674
Yeah, I may have planned all of this

00:39:25.216 --> 00:39:27.927
but someone did order me to do it.

00:39:29.888 --> 00:39:30.889
Who?

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:35.018
He tampers with evidence,
removes witnesses

00:39:35.518 --> 00:39:37.729
and takes bribes to rule
in favor of people in court.

00:39:40.231 --> 00:39:43.193
They must be behind Tae-sik
being released, too, then.

00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:46.696
Tell me who it is.

00:39:48.907 --> 00:39:51.159
He's the devil of the Judiciary.

00:39:52.577 --> 00:39:54.204
You'll need to put your life on the line

00:39:55.038 --> 00:39:56.498
and get to the very bottom of it

00:39:56.873 --> 00:39:58.500
if you choose to take them on.

00:40:05.423 --> 00:40:06.424
You getting out?

00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:12.222
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

00:40:12.305 --> 00:40:14.933
used Taemyeong Construction
under his power

00:40:15.016 --> 00:40:17.810
to illegally secure
publicly-funded projects

00:40:17.894 --> 00:40:19.604
and carry out substandard work.

00:40:33.743 --> 00:40:35.578
Had I gotten Jeong-tae in my hand

00:40:35.954 --> 00:40:40.041
I would've made your life a bed of roses.

00:40:43.169 --> 00:40:44.462
Why don't you have some?

00:40:45.296 --> 00:40:46.297
You can eat it all.

00:40:50.593 --> 00:40:54.097
My dear Jeong-tae.

00:40:55.014 --> 00:40:57.350
He was going to die for nothing, anyway.

00:40:58.268 --> 00:41:00.603
Why did he have to give me
such a hard time

00:41:01.062 --> 00:41:03.690
to rake in all that money?

00:41:04.857 --> 00:41:07.527
Both with Taemyeong Construction
and the slush funds

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.071
my only crime is that I did as I was told.

00:41:11.281 --> 00:41:14.033
In the end, the dead can't speak.

00:41:14.117 --> 00:41:16.744
I'll have your back

00:41:16.828 --> 00:41:18.913
all through the investigations.

00:41:18.997 --> 00:41:20.498
Let's be a good team, alright?

00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:28.298
I hear you know him.

00:41:29.799 --> 00:41:32.302
Wow, it smells nice in here.

00:41:35.179 --> 00:41:36.723
Nice to be alive and eating, huh?

00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:39.392
Hmm?

00:41:42.437 --> 00:41:44.564
don't you dare lay a finger on him,
or else...

00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:46.107
You!

00:41:50.194 --> 00:41:51.195
Have a seat.

00:41:56.117 --> 00:41:57.118
Who the hell are you?

00:41:57.243 --> 00:41:59.245
To start, go to the prosecution
for your investigation.

00:41:59.996 --> 00:42:01.372
We've met in court.

00:42:02.915 --> 00:42:05.585
You fooled me
into thinking you were a loanshark.

00:42:05.668 --> 00:42:07.587
Defendant Chu Yong-jin.

00:42:08.963 --> 00:42:11.507
Who killed Mr. Kang Jeong-tae?

00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:13.509
- And why?
- No idea.

00:42:13.801 --> 00:42:14.886
It wasn't me.

00:42:14.969 --> 00:42:17.597
You've given him almost ten billion won.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.265
Did Jeong-tae really spend it alone?

00:42:20.767 --> 00:42:22.644
They cut Jeong-tae off

00:42:22.727 --> 00:42:24.562
after seeing you side
with the prosecution.

00:42:24.854 --> 00:42:26.230
To make sure it doesn't get to them.

00:42:26.314 --> 00:42:27.732
It's all done, then.

00:42:27.815 --> 00:42:30.818
No, my trial only begins now.

00:42:32.445 --> 00:42:34.238
The sinkhole in the Nammyeon District.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:36.658
The sinkhole was caused

00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.910
by Taemyeong Construction's poor work.

00:42:38.993 --> 00:42:41.788
And the real mastermind
behind Taemyeong is Chu Yong-jin.

00:42:42.163 --> 00:42:43.498
And Chu Yong-jin

00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:45.833
threatened the bereaved family
of a dead victim

00:42:45.917 --> 00:42:47.251
to sign a settlement.

00:42:47.835 --> 00:42:49.295
Oh, let's leave out the 100 million won
you paid.

00:42:49.379 --> 00:42:51.756
You coerced them to settle
without even paying them.

00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:52.840
Why would I admit to that?

00:42:52.924 --> 00:42:55.385
Or the press will immediately report

00:42:55.468 --> 00:42:58.221
on how you delivered slush funds
to Kang Jeong-tae

00:42:58.304 --> 00:43:00.390
and how you'll tell the prosecution

00:43:00.765 --> 00:43:03.476
about where the funds went.

00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:04.936
Then, how long would it take

00:43:05.728 --> 00:43:08.690
for them
to try to choke you to death again?

00:43:09.899 --> 00:43:11.234
I didn't do any of that.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.361
Right.

00:43:13.736 --> 00:43:16.406
But when the media says so,
that's what everyone will believe.

00:43:19.492 --> 00:43:20.493
Are you

00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:23.079
taking his side right now?

00:43:23.496 --> 00:43:25.415
The bastard whose son died
in the sinkhole?

00:43:25.498 --> 00:43:26.499
Yeah.

00:43:26.582 --> 00:43:29.669
But he's not a bastard.
He’s a grieving father!

00:43:29.752 --> 00:43:31.587
A grieving father!

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:42.640
I know.

00:43:44.058 --> 00:43:45.601
And I feel terrible about it.

00:43:46.436 --> 00:43:48.312
You think I expected such an accident?

00:43:48.396 --> 00:43:49.939
I'll give them more compensation

00:43:50.022 --> 00:43:51.983
and sincerely apologize to them.

00:43:52.066 --> 00:43:54.360
- So...
- Don't say anything.

00:43:54.444 --> 00:43:55.945
Don't apologize

00:43:56.028 --> 00:43:58.656
and don't act sad and apologetic
around people, either.

00:43:59.741 --> 00:44:01.451
Don't even look down.

00:44:01.534 --> 00:44:03.077
Show the world

00:44:03.161 --> 00:44:05.830
who you really are.

00:44:05.913 --> 00:44:06.914
Or else

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.917
you'll get strangled again.

00:44:11.753 --> 00:44:14.297
The Defendant's greed did not stop there.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.966
He ordered or allowed
substandard constructions

00:44:17.049 --> 00:44:18.843
and blatantly ignored the people's safety

00:44:18.926 --> 00:44:20.428
to make profit illegally.

00:44:20.511 --> 00:44:22.805
This is an abuse of power,
occupational breach of trust

00:44:22.889 --> 00:44:24.348
and coercion.

00:44:24.432 --> 00:44:25.975
And unfortunately

00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:29.854
this led to a death
of an innocent man in his twenties.

00:44:37.195 --> 00:44:39.739
Not only that,
but he also tried to hide his wrongs

00:44:39.822 --> 00:44:42.408
by coercing the victims to settle.

00:44:43.743 --> 00:44:45.787
The Defendant sought personal gain

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.122
at the expense of an innocent life

00:44:48.748 --> 00:44:50.374
which is unforgivable.

00:44:50.875 --> 00:44:53.544
Therefore, the prosecution requests
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

00:44:54.128 --> 00:44:55.421
to be imprisoned for ten years

00:44:56.339 --> 00:44:59.175
with a fine of five billion won.
That is all.

00:45:21.823 --> 00:45:24.116
You know who killed Assemblyman Kang,
don't you?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.326
No.

00:45:25.409 --> 00:45:26.869
The day he died

00:45:26.953 --> 00:45:29.205
you warned me, saying it could be a trap.

00:45:29.288 --> 00:45:31.040
Doesn't that mean you knew something?

00:45:31.123 --> 00:45:33.876
No, I was just trying to warn you.

00:45:35.127 --> 00:45:36.295
Liar.

00:45:36.796 --> 00:45:39.090
The prosecution did a search and seizure
of Taemyeong Construction

00:45:39.173 --> 00:45:43.177
which exposed a corrupt politician
who had no regard for people's lives.

00:45:43.636 --> 00:45:45.054
The investigation team stated

00:45:45.137 --> 00:45:47.932
that Taemyeong received
large sums of money in rebate

00:45:48.015 --> 00:45:49.892
in the process of securing public projects

00:45:49.976 --> 00:45:54.063
and that they completely ignored
safety regulations.

00:45:55.273 --> 00:45:58.109
Amidst the growing anger and sadness
in public

00:45:58.192 --> 00:46:00.152
people are still visiting the sinkhole

00:46:00.236 --> 00:46:02.321
to pay respect to the young man

00:46:02.405 --> 00:46:05.449
who died in the unfortunate incident.

00:46:05.533 --> 00:46:07.994
SAFETY FIRST

00:46:35.271 --> 00:46:37.940
BAMTOL, I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY IN HEAVEN

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:09.013
Thank you.

00:47:09.096 --> 00:47:10.389
REST IN PEACE, MR. HEO MIN-GU

00:47:10.473 --> 00:47:13.517
My son can finally rest in peace.

00:47:16.479 --> 00:47:19.148
I hope your hearts can also be at peace.

00:47:20.107 --> 00:47:21.150
I'm sure

00:47:22.568 --> 00:47:24.111
Min-gu wants that for you, too.

00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:41.003
I looked into Mayor Chu's case,
as you asked.

00:47:41.671 --> 00:47:44.799
The investigation on the slush fund
stopped at Mr. Kang Jeong-tae.

00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:48.260
Whatever big hand is behind this

00:47:48.928 --> 00:47:51.138
I guess even a third-term politician was
merely a pawn.

00:47:52.473 --> 00:47:54.433
He's the devil of the Judiciary.

00:47:55.267 --> 00:47:58.187
You'll need to put your life on the line.

00:48:01.774 --> 00:48:03.067
Judge Lee.

00:48:04.902 --> 00:48:07.321
Seems like you've already put your life
on the line.

00:48:11.826 --> 00:48:14.704
On today's agenda, we have the selection
of the next Chief Justice.

00:48:15.246 --> 00:48:16.330
Unfortunately

00:48:16.872 --> 00:48:19.750
the President one-sidedly nominated
Jeon Heung-woo

00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:21.794
which has brought chaos to the Judiciary.

00:48:21.877 --> 00:48:23.295
It's about time we get rid of him.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.424
Since this is about the Judiciary...

00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:29.844
I'd like to suggest
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

00:48:32.221 --> 00:48:33.305
What about the confirmation hearing?

00:48:33.973 --> 00:48:36.308
It went smoothly
when he was a Justice nominee.

00:48:36.392 --> 00:48:37.977
Don't make him into another Gyo-hun.

00:48:39.478 --> 00:48:40.688
I'll make sure.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.463
Sir.

00:49:22.104 --> 00:49:24.482
Chairman Jang Yong-hyeon will be
over the moon

00:49:25.107 --> 00:49:27.318
if Nam-yong becomes the Chief Justice.

00:49:28.152 --> 00:49:30.488
They've been making deals
for over 20 years, right?

00:49:30.738 --> 00:49:33.574
And CEO Jang Tae-sik as well,
since his days at S Construction.

00:49:35.117 --> 00:49:38.412
Like father, like son.
They're milking him for two generations.

00:49:39.497 --> 00:49:41.373
If Nam-yong becomes the Chief Justice

00:49:41.457 --> 00:49:43.626
you'll get to choose the Chairperson
and the Election Commissioners

00:49:43.709 --> 00:49:45.669
for the National Election Commission.

00:49:46.295 --> 00:49:47.421
As I should.

00:49:49.548 --> 00:49:52.593
Oh, is Gyo-hun still out there?

00:50:09.568 --> 00:50:10.569
Mr. Kang.

00:50:10.653 --> 00:50:12.905
Your daughter will be released
on probation.

00:50:14.115 --> 00:50:15.282
Is that what His Excellency wants?

00:50:15.366 --> 00:50:17.034
You'll be under investigation

00:50:17.118 --> 00:50:18.577
for allegations of stock parking.

00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:19.662
What?

00:50:19.745 --> 00:50:21.956
A civic group filed a complaint about it,
after all.

00:50:22.039 --> 00:50:25.000
That was just for formality!

00:50:25.084 --> 00:50:26.919
The law is all about formality.

00:50:28.212 --> 00:50:30.381
Rules created by humans
to respect the bare minimum.

00:50:36.137 --> 00:50:37.763
I have to talk to His Excellency.

00:50:37.847 --> 00:50:39.265
Don't bother.

00:50:40.099 --> 00:50:41.100
Get out of my way.

00:50:42.685 --> 00:50:44.270
What are you doing?

00:50:45.688 --> 00:50:48.524
You want me to turn your daughter
into a drug dealer?

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.234
What did you just say?

00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:54.989
How about stock price manipulation
instead of stock parking?

00:50:55.072 --> 00:50:56.323
You little...

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:12.798
Why are you doing this to me?

00:51:12.882 --> 00:51:16.510
Do you know
why your wife's drivers keep quitting?

00:51:40.868 --> 00:51:44.038
I've learned people's backgrounds
don't always reflect their characters.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.502
His Excellency has a message for you,
along with this.

00:51:52.588 --> 00:51:54.089
"Going forward, whatever it is"

00:51:54.673 --> 00:51:57.384
"there must not be a single mistake."

00:51:58.636 --> 00:51:59.637
That's right.

00:52:00.554 --> 00:52:02.431
Going forward is always the problem.

00:52:03.682 --> 00:52:05.976
So, going forward, come when I call you

00:52:07.019 --> 00:52:08.270
and leave

00:52:08.938 --> 00:52:10.231
when I tell you.

00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:15.110
Don't ask me any questions

00:52:20.199 --> 00:52:22.076
about what I order you to do.

00:52:23.827 --> 00:52:26.372
And don't make a single mistake.

00:52:31.043 --> 00:52:33.087
Then, you'll get to protect

00:52:34.004 --> 00:52:35.589
your precious little family

00:52:37.258 --> 00:52:40.219
and keep your assemblyman badge
in the next election.

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:45.933
So...

00:53:07.913 --> 00:53:09.415
Chief Justice Jeon Heung-woo.

00:53:10.207 --> 00:53:11.292
Let's take him down.

00:53:22.886 --> 00:53:25.097
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:29.643
I'D LIKE TO EXPOSE
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON HEUNG-WOO

00:53:29.727 --> 00:53:32.229
I DEMAND CHIEF JUSTICE JEON TO STEP DOWN

00:53:33.647 --> 00:53:35.399
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON'S ONE-SIDED REFORM IS
A THREAT TO THE JUDICIARY

00:53:35.482 --> 00:53:37.651
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON MUST STEP DOWN

00:53:37.735 --> 00:53:39.403
STOP PURGING PEOPLE
AND LEAVE THE SUPREME COURT

00:53:39.486 --> 00:53:41.155
DON'T STAY SILENT.
JOIN US IN TAKING DOWN CHIEF JUSTICE JEON

00:53:42.906 --> 00:53:44.450
POST

00:53:44.533 --> 00:53:45.868
YOUR JUNIOR JUDGES WON'T STAY SILENT.
THE SUPREME COURT ISN'T YOUR LAB.

00:53:45.951 --> 00:53:47.244
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON, PLEASE LEAVE.
THE SUPREME COURT ISN'T YOUR PLAYGROUND.

00:53:49.997 --> 00:53:52.333
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON HEUNG-WOO

00:53:56.837 --> 00:53:59.423
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:53:59.506 --> 00:54:01.216
It caused quite a stir.

00:54:03.761 --> 00:54:04.928
How's the press reacting?

00:54:05.137 --> 00:54:07.848
I've contacted a few news outlets
facing lawsuits.

00:54:07.931 --> 00:54:09.892
They'll publish
a wave of articles tomorrow.

00:54:10.392 --> 00:54:13.312
He should go down in about a week or so.

00:54:13.395 --> 00:54:16.190
He's tough. He grew up on the streets.

00:54:17.149 --> 00:54:19.318
He could last a month,
even while barely hanging on.

00:54:20.778 --> 00:54:23.530
Okay, I'll find another way, then.

00:54:24.156 --> 00:54:25.407
No, there's no need to hurry.

00:54:26.325 --> 00:54:28.327
Let's wear him down first
before we tear him apart.

00:54:29.036 --> 00:54:30.371
Yes, sir.

00:54:31.121 --> 00:54:33.749
Who's the next Chief Justice after him?

00:54:42.174 --> 00:54:43.926
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON,
THE JUDICIARY IS NOT YOURS.

00:54:44.009 --> 00:54:45.594
THIS WAS NOT THE REFORM WE WANTED.

00:54:45.677 --> 00:54:47.221
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON DESTROYED
JUSTICE IN THE JUDICIARY.

00:54:47.304 --> 00:54:49.014
I'D LIKE TO EXPOSE CHIEF JUSTICE JEON.

00:54:49.098 --> 00:54:50.641
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON,
PLEASE LEAVE THE SUPREME COURT.

00:54:55.687 --> 00:54:57.022
CHIEF JUSTICE JEON HEUNG-WOO

00:54:57.106 --> 00:54:58.232
Chief Justice Jeon resigns

00:54:58.315 --> 00:55:00.526
before the month is even over.

00:55:00.609 --> 00:55:02.111
HWANG NAM-YONG

00:55:02.194 --> 00:55:03.362
Who's going to replace him?

00:55:18.961 --> 00:55:21.130
HWANG NAM-YONG

00:55:21.213 --> 00:55:22.423
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

00:55:26.802 --> 00:55:28.303
Clear your schedule for tonight.

00:55:28.804 --> 00:55:30.139
We need to go somewhere.

00:55:30.389 --> 00:55:31.473
Yes, sir.

00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:43.735
Yeah, it's Judge Lee.

00:55:45.195 --> 00:55:47.197
I'm taking him to my meeting
with Nam-yong.

00:55:48.574 --> 00:55:49.741
Mr. Kang

00:55:50.659 --> 00:55:53.203
Judge Lee isn't one of us yet.

00:55:55.873 --> 00:55:57.291
That's presumptuous of you again.

00:56:02.463 --> 00:56:03.714
I know.

00:56:04.756 --> 00:56:06.467
The only one I trust around here...

00:56:10.095 --> 00:56:11.346
Do I really have to tell you?

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:13.891
Sorry, sir.

00:56:23.192 --> 00:56:24.943
Call Seong-dae, the presiding judge.

00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:27.196
He'll join us this evening.

00:56:27.613 --> 00:56:29.198
Yes, sir.

00:56:32.576 --> 00:56:34.912
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-HAN

00:56:34.995 --> 00:56:35.996
Come in.

00:56:43.045 --> 00:56:44.171
You wanted to see me?

00:56:45.005 --> 00:56:46.673
Yeah, have a seat.

00:56:49.551 --> 00:56:51.720
How's Judge Lee doing these days?

00:56:53.889 --> 00:56:54.890
Oh.

00:56:56.642 --> 00:56:58.435
He hasn't been up to much.

00:56:58.894 --> 00:57:00.354
How is he with Yi-seok?

00:57:01.063 --> 00:57:03.065
He's been called to his office
a few times.

00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:07.194
- For what?
- Sorry?

00:57:07.694 --> 00:57:09.071
Why was he summoned?

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.659
I'm not sure about that.

00:57:15.953 --> 00:57:17.120
What do you think?

00:57:17.913 --> 00:57:20.707
Does it look like Han-young is
on Yi-seok's side?

00:57:21.124 --> 00:57:22.709
No, I doubt it.

00:57:26.046 --> 00:57:27.714
But Yi-seok brought him to Seoul.

00:57:28.298 --> 00:57:30.509
And he'll soon be
the Partner of Haenal's son-in-law.

00:57:34.054 --> 00:57:35.472
Even so.

00:57:37.558 --> 00:57:39.560
Han-young is such a nobody.

00:57:45.148 --> 00:57:46.358
Watch him carefully.

00:57:49.152 --> 00:57:51.280
How much did S Shopping pay you?

00:57:51.989 --> 00:57:53.156
Three billion won.

00:57:54.783 --> 00:57:57.828
Listen to the discussion carefully
and get on it.

00:57:58.495 --> 00:57:59.538
Yes, sir.

00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:04.293
My, my!

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:07.546
Sin-jin, it's been a real minute.

00:58:09.047 --> 00:58:11.675
JUSTICE HWANG NAM-YONG

00:58:13.093 --> 00:58:14.886
MANWOL

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:16.972
I knew it was time when you called me.

00:58:17.055 --> 00:58:19.266
And when I saw the mess
on the court's intranet.

00:58:19.808 --> 00:58:22.978
What do you get
out of my becoming Chief Justice?

00:58:29.901 --> 00:58:31.528
I get the leader of the Judiciary

00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:33.905
the Chief Justice on my side.

00:58:34.656 --> 00:58:35.907
Is that right?

00:58:37.367 --> 00:58:40.537
I become the Chief Justice,
and you gain one on your side.

00:58:41.747 --> 00:58:43.248
That's a good deal for both of us.

00:58:43.957 --> 00:58:45.167
But

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.880
there's no guarantee
that I won't become the next Heung-woo.

00:58:49.963 --> 00:58:53.008
I was your associate back in the day.

00:58:53.592 --> 00:58:54.968
I won't let that happen to you.

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:58.347
I'd better trust you, huh?

00:58:59.598 --> 00:59:00.724
Of course.

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:03.435
Start by changing your car to a modest SUV

00:59:03.518 --> 00:59:05.103
and sell all your stocks.

00:59:05.187 --> 00:59:07.439
We'll make a few donations

00:59:07.522 --> 00:59:09.191
under your name as well.

00:59:10.567 --> 00:59:13.320
You live in Gangcheon Palace
in Gangnam, right?

00:59:13.862 --> 00:59:16.740
Sell that and move
into a more humble apartment unit.

00:59:17.282 --> 00:59:18.283
Seong-dae is here

00:59:18.367 --> 00:59:20.911
to help you find a unit in Gangbuk
around 100 square meters.

00:59:22.621 --> 00:59:24.414
There's so much to do.

00:59:25.457 --> 00:59:26.625
Should I do anything?

00:59:26.708 --> 00:59:28.460
The younger judges are determined

00:59:28.919 --> 00:59:31.546
to overthrow Chief Justice Jeon.

00:59:32.172 --> 00:59:33.382
Help them.

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:34.841
Okay.

00:59:35.342 --> 00:59:38.387
It'd be a shame to set
a bad example to them.

00:59:39.763 --> 00:59:41.264
Cheers.

01:00:35.485 --> 01:00:37.863
Heung-woo will step down soon.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.032
And I'll get Nam-yong to replace him.

01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:44.119
As long as you toss him to me

01:00:44.202 --> 01:00:45.495
as you promised.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.415
How much do you trust me?

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:53.170
How much

01:00:54.045 --> 01:00:55.547
do you trust me?

01:00:58.341 --> 01:00:59.551
How audacious of you.

01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:13.857
We can't bring Nam-yong to trial.

01:01:14.357 --> 01:01:16.276
But we can take his judge's robe.

01:01:16.985 --> 01:01:20.572
Ending a Chief Justice's career is tougher
than your father's experience

01:01:21.114 --> 01:01:22.616
in prison.

01:01:23.408 --> 01:01:25.160
Didn't you say

01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:28.205
you've decided to make Nam-yong
the Chief Justice?

01:01:28.288 --> 01:01:29.498
Exactly.

01:01:31.666 --> 01:01:34.377
Which one of us do you think
can act faster?

01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:37.464
I wonder.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.741
Water.

01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:09.830
Here.

01:02:11.122 --> 01:02:13.333
What's this? A love letter?

01:02:13.416 --> 01:02:14.668
Yeah, what else?

01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:22.133
Is someone looking for a job?

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:23.802
JB DAEHAN CONSTRUCTION HIRING RESULTS

01:02:23.885 --> 01:02:25.262
ALL FAILED APPLICANTS

01:02:25.345 --> 01:02:26.972
Hey, this is...

01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:30.433
The lowest score on the exam

01:02:30.892 --> 01:02:32.394
but the highest score in the interview.

01:02:33.144 --> 01:02:34.521
I'm not even surprised anymore.

01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:38.024
Who's this Hwang Tae-seong guy?

01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:41.403
The son of the judge

01:02:41.486 --> 01:02:43.780
who was on my father's case 18 years ago.

01:02:45.907 --> 01:02:47.951
What? Hey! Han-young!

01:02:57.043 --> 01:02:59.045
The trial for Chu Yong-jin is now over.

01:03:00.171 --> 01:03:02.215
Sorry for not staying on the case
all the way.

01:03:02.299 --> 01:03:06.052
No, a new indictment needs a new trial,
after all.

01:03:07.178 --> 01:03:09.598
He was exposed for using violence
against the victims.

01:03:09.681 --> 01:03:10.932
You didn't have a choice.

01:03:11.016 --> 01:03:13.226
Yes, good call.

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:14.311
And good job.

01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:15.687
I'll continue to work harder.

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:23.403
Do you

01:03:23.486 --> 01:03:26.281
still hang out often
with Sin-jin these days?

01:03:27.699 --> 01:03:29.159
And eat together?

01:03:30.243 --> 01:03:31.494
I'm just worried.

01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:34.539
He has a bad reputation.

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:41.880
Not only do we eat together

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.091
but we even drink together.

01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:47.260
What?

01:03:47.802 --> 01:03:48.887
Is that all?

01:03:51.932 --> 01:03:53.266
He said he'd get me anything

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:55.602
as long as I did as I was told.

01:03:55.894 --> 01:03:57.312
See?

01:03:57.812 --> 01:03:59.731
He's a very risky man to be around.

01:03:59.814 --> 01:04:01.691
Get you everything? How?

01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:04.527
Never hang out with him again.

01:04:07.322 --> 01:04:08.490
Why are you quiet?

01:04:09.824 --> 01:04:11.034
I already told him

01:04:11.451 --> 01:04:12.911
what I wanted.

01:04:16.081 --> 01:04:17.916
- What?
- What is it?

01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:20.919
What is it that you want from Sin-jin?

01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:25.340
Sorry.

01:04:25.423 --> 01:04:27.842
What? Why are you sorry?

01:04:28.176 --> 01:04:29.511
Tell him right now.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.721
Sorry.

01:04:34.975 --> 01:04:37.185
I noticed that you got a new car.

01:04:38.061 --> 01:04:40.730
Is that what you wanted from Sin-jin?
A new car?

01:04:41.189 --> 01:04:43.149
No, I financed the new car myself.

01:04:44.192 --> 01:04:45.860
Are you lying to us now?

01:04:46.236 --> 01:04:47.237
Hey!

01:04:50.115 --> 01:04:52.534
Maybe work on your lying skills
before you try to lie.

01:04:54.744 --> 01:04:56.830
I guess this is the end of our friendship.

01:05:13.972 --> 01:05:15.306
See you again.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.916
This is the only chance

01:05:43.543 --> 01:05:46.421
to hunt Yi-seok,
the tiger of the Judiciary.

01:05:48.715 --> 01:05:52.260
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:06:16.743 --> 01:06:19.079
Lee Seong-dae's huge debt
came around this time.

01:06:19.162 --> 01:06:21.122
No! My 400 million won!

01:06:21.206 --> 01:06:23.291
International investment frauds are
in Gangnam now.

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:26.044
How can you make money off scammers?

01:06:26.127 --> 01:06:28.004
They build trust with you
by offering low interest rates

01:06:28.088 --> 01:06:29.839
for about three months.

01:06:29.923 --> 01:06:31.591
You cast the bait yourself

01:06:31.674 --> 01:06:33.218
so hunt him yourself, too.

01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:34.677
Whether it's legal or illegal.

01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:35.762
I'll do it my way.

01:06:35.845 --> 01:06:38.014
If things go wrong later,
we won’t be able to deal with it.

01:06:38.098 --> 01:06:39.766
Will you let me in
if I put my life on the line?

01:06:39.849 --> 01:06:41.893
- What? The prosecution?
- We've been tipped off

01:06:41.976 --> 01:06:42.977
about some investment frauds around here.

01:06:43.103 --> 01:06:44.270
They just got on the elevator.

01:06:44.479 --> 01:06:45.480
Hurry!

01:06:50.068 --> 01:06:52.070
