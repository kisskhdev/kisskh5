"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 4)

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.280
You're quite skilled!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.400
Brother Yang,

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.439
Is breakfast ready?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.695
We're here to crash your meal!

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:45.719
Be right there!

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.159
Let me give you a hand.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.656
Put more salt on for me, please.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.680
I like my food salty.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.239
Aren't you here

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.359
to experience life?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
No need to help?

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.679
What right do you have to ask me that,

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.599
and why are you asking me like this?

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.280
Isn't that Yang Meng's cup?

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.039
When you visit someone's home

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.536
you don't just go touching their stuff!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.879
No wonder you "collapsed."

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.160
I did more than just use his cup.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.960
This water was poured

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.400
by Yang Meng with his own hands.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360
So sweet!

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.960
Don't listen to his nonsense.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520
Let's eat!

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.439
Here, I remember you love this.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:41.719
I just pickled it today.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.159
Thank you.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.639
Who is he?

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.759
Li Mei.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
My best sister.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080
I meant him.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.520
Xu Che.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.280
Yang Meng's best younger brother.

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.800
Best younger brother...

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.199
Then I should clarify

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.479
our relationship.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.159
Eat.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.719
Eat up!

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.039
Dig in!

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.159
Enjoy!

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280
Brother Yang!

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.816
Back when I was at school，

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.320
I kept craving this pancake you make.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.239
How much did you crave it?

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.360
I remember the first time

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.479
you cooked for me.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:29.520
It was still...

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:31.000
That was just last time, wasn't it?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.479
Anyway, the cafeteria's food

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.496
can't hold a candle to yours.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.639
Isn't that obvious?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.520
It's been so long

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.879
and you still remember.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Of course.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.080
How could I not know about you?

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.319
How well do you know?

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.639
Spill it.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.400
Don't keep serving others.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560
You eat more.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.759
If you keep serving, they'll finish it all.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.640
Eat some meat, Brother
Yang—gives you energy.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.039
Eat more vegetables.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.960
Good for digestion.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.280
Have some soup, Brother
Yang—it's good for your lungs.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.040
If you think my cooking is bad.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.880
You can say so straight up.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.959
Dear guests

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160
hello, everyone!

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.279
Welcome

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.519
to our Lanwan Village.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.079
Today

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.120
we've arranged for you to experience

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.000
the folk life of Lanwan Village.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.040
We've planned activities like beachcombing

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:55.839
farming

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360
digging for oysters.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.399
Oh, and

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.920
of course, fishing.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.360
We hope

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.199
you'll all do your best.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.240
As for your living expenses

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:06.800
you'll also need to

00:05:07.312 --> 00:05:08.632
work hard to earn money for them.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.080
We hope you'll give it your all.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.040
Yes.

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.040
And this

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.680
is our architect, Xiao Qin.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.318
She'll also join you

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.319
in the activities.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.399
Please give her a round of applause.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.879
As for today's activities

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.600
I believe you all

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.920
already have a good idea.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.398
We ask that you strictly follow

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.000
our competition rules.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.839
Each guest will be paired with

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.279
one islander.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.319
It looks like you've already grouped up.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.120
Then later, everyone

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.838
please fully experience

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:51.079
the folk life of our Lanwan Village.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.199
Now, I announce

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.680
the competition begins!

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:56.360
First up:

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.800
fishing!

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.360
The one who catches the least weight

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.079
will face punishment.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.560
Let's go!

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.879
Welcome to our fishing raft.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.078
Here, we farm a lot of

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.839
red sea bream, black sea bream,

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:10.600
and as you can see

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.600
nets full of abalone.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:12.439
Now, be careful everyone,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.758
remember to walk

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:14.680
with good balance.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.319
Don't fall in!

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:16.920
Our fishermen here.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.879
Because our village

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:20.271
If you want to relax tonight,
then listen and be a good boy.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:21.896
... to make a living from this aquaculture.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.439
And now

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:23.240
because this industry

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.279
is quite advanced and developed

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.319
that's why we upgraded

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.120
to have this kind of fishing raft.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.600
So you can come here.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.439
Today.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.040
Please do me a favor.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.239
You should prepare yourself first.

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:40.879
What preparation?

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:42.519
Let me tell you,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.839
A fishermen's life isn't easy.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Lots of bugs

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:46.600
lots of troubles.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.360
If you're really as fussy as yesterday，

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
you'll have a hard time.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720
Just you wait.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.199
Young man!

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.399
That fierce determination
of yours is really good.

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:16.879
Just like an old fisherman.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.279
Thank you, uncle.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.639
So it was just a show.

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:37.839
Brother Meng!

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:38.879
Let me help you.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.000
Xiao Meng.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.360
You need to hurry up.

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:44.240
Otherwise,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.040
Xiao Mei will be snatched by someone else.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.680
What a pity, right?

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.399
So charming!

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.879
Attracting both men and women!

00:08:00.353 --> 00:08:01.913
Worked so hard but only caught one.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.160
Figure it out yourself.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.040
What else could it be?

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:09.119
Isn't it just because you're inexperienced?

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:12.879
Just give me

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:13.879
two from your bucket.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.960
The camera won't catch it.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:16.319
Fish yourself.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.199
Just help out a newbie, will you?

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.439
Don't be so stingy.

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:36.879
Now I have less than you.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840
Keep it up!

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.559
The competition outcome is clear.

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:51.679
The losing side

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.320
will face punishment.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600
Sing a song!

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.440
This person

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:56.919
is

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:58.759
Me!

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.240
Music!

00:09:19.194 --> 00:09:23.895
[Just the most insufferable graphics
explaining what you're seeing on screen]

00:10:05.718 --> 00:10:07.478
(Smiling in the back)

00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:13.562
(Still smiling)

00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:31.583
(Gradually getting the technique down)

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:14.936
Catching so many fish，
why did we get hardly any cash?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.135
They work hard for a whole month

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.439
and earn less than you in a day.

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:20.399
What are you saying?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:21.519
Uncle!

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080
Did I bump into you?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.919
Are you okay, uncle?

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:24.679
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:25.799
Uncle,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.960
what's in your basket?

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.799
Homemade wine.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.399
Stood at the market all day today

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.200
and no one bought any.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:35.519
Want to buy some?

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:39.000
How much can this buy?

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:40.919
I'll take it all.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Are you sure?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:42.879
This is your day's

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:43.919
living expenses.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.440
I'm sure.

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:47.519
I've been selling wine for thirty years.

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:48.879
Don't need anyone's pity.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.240
If you really like it，

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960
then buy.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.399
I'll give you one bottle for free.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.399
Give... give me?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:57.399
No.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.840
Uncle, I didn't mean that.

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.519
Try it first.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:04.519
Slow down, slow down!

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.360
Finished filming today's footage.

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:08.559
I'll head back now.

00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:14.000
Putting on a show again.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.840
Uncle!

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.440
You've had a tough day too.

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:20.879
Listen to me.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120
I'll take it all.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:23.399
Take it.

00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:24.919
Stop acting, Yoki.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.440
The cameraman has left.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080
What acting?

00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:29.959
I can tell the uncle's wine is good.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.239
So many workers in the production team,
I'll buy some for them to try.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240
What's wrong?

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:35.159
Alright.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600
Be safe on your way back.

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:38.279
Thank you, thank you.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960
What are you looking at?

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.519
Never seen a man

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:43.519
who likes to drink?

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:47.840
Thanks, young man.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.600
You know, after a whole day's work

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.320
we didn't earn much.

00:13:57.632 --> 00:13:58.632
What a terrible show!

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:06.399
For me?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.200
I want it.

00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:27.240
It's quite tasty.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320
Do you remember me?

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:37.320
No.

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:39.279
I'm an idol, you're not.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.440
Why should I remember you?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480
I don't even know you.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:50.399
What?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.040
What... what are you doing?

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:01.639
Going home.

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:03.039
Why go home?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.759
To work.

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:04.519
Work.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
You think it's free?

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.400
You change faces instantly, huh?

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:11.639
Wait for me.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.120
You have good alcohol tolerance.

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:34.176
This homemade country wine

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.080
is one of Lanwan Village's

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.080
specialties.

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:39.639
Really?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.559
Then buying so much at once,

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:43.399
I must have gotten a good deal, right?

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080
Yoki...

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.800
I want to apologize to you.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.480
I doubted you all day today.

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:05.879
Doubted me?

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:07.833
Doubted me about what?

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:12.159
I doubted you

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.320
that your hardworking
attitude was all an act.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.855
Every time you smile at the mirror,

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:17.879
I think,

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:19.599
you're just putting on a show.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I'm sorry.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.240
What?

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.880
Should I cry in front of the camera then?

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:34.679
But...

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840
I can understand.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.480
From my debut till now,

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:44.200
from in front of the camera to behind it,

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.880
everyone thinks I'm putting on a show.

00:16:49.159 --> 00:16:51.799
Whatever.

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:54.600
You must not care

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:56.119
about what those people think, Yoki.

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:57.600
In my heart,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.440
I think you're a

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.960
sincere, hardworking person.

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:01.679
Really.

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:05.799
Brother,

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:07.839
Weren't you just saying

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.360
you doubted I was putting on a show?

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.440
I...

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:12.519
I...

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.920
Today I saw you

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.640
give all your living expenses

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:16.920
to that old man.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.799
So I think you're a

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:20.839
sincere person.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.519
Didn't you give some too?

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.640
I saw everything.

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.920
Don't tell me that 200 yuan

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.759
wasn't from you.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.400
Yoki,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.720
I want to ask you a question.

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:06.279
Ask.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.359
Ask it with your whole chest.

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:12.559
Back in high school...

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.960
Back in high school...

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:17.079
You liked your male deskmate...

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:18.079
So...

00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:19.599
So...

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.679
So now,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.000
do you still like boys?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.200
What are you laughing at?

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.200
What's so funny?

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:11.359
What?

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:13.359
If I say yes,

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:15.999
are you afraid I'll be interested in you?

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.559
Don't worry.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.440
I've taken Chinese medicine for years

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.759
and I'm completely cured now.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.839
Otherwise, I wouldn't have "collapsed"

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:34.480
by dating an actress.

00:19:34.559 --> 00:19:37.039
Cheating, domestic violence...

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:38.119
two-timing...

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:40.119
what else?

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:41.079
I always thought

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:42.559
that Fang Xiaotian was fake.

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:52.119
You're jealous.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.680
You're jealous, right?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.640
If it's not real, why would I be jealous?

00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:58.279
Then...

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:02.519
If it were real,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400
you'd be jealous?

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:13.559
But,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.839
you look really handsome
when you're jealous.

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:20.279
I've decided,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.400
every day from now on,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.599
I'll make you jealous.

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.039
Every day?

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:34.799
What?

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.640
Don't believe me?

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240
Alright.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.440
Yoki, where are you going?

00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:43.359
To make you believe me.

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:44.880
Alright, alright.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.039
I believe you, okay?

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:12.559
Want to get on the boat?

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.480
Get on the bed?

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:16.279
Right here?
