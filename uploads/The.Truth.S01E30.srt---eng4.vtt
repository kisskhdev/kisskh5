=Episode 30=

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.373
You're like a blind man riding a horse,

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:23.734
teetering by a pool at night.

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:26.974
Wandering around in this pitch darkness?

00:01:28.534 --> 00:01:30.454
If you actually fell down there,

00:01:31.853 --> 00:01:34.293
you might just reunite
with your dead bestie, Yu Xiao'ou.

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:37.454
Who the heck are you?

00:01:38.454 --> 00:01:39.373
What do you want?

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:42.133
Haven't I made myself clear?

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:45.174
Fine.

00:01:46.493 --> 00:01:47.694
Then I'll repeat it for you.

00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:52.174
Tell me the truth
about Yu Xiao'ou's murder.

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:54.974
I did.

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:56.454
What I said is the truth.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:58.493
Zhang Wei brought the knife there.

00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:00.054
And he killed Xiao'ou.

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:02.534
It had absolutely nothing to do with me.

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:06.974
Nothing to do with you?

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:11.134
Zhang Wei was your boyfriend.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.093
You said so yourself in the interview.

00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:20.253
You wanted to break up with Zhang Wei.

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.454
Yu Xiao'ou was just mediating
between you two.

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:27.134
She was killed by Zhang Wei
while trying to help and save you.

00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:30.533
And what did you do?

00:02:33.493 --> 00:02:34.253
No.

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:35.334
You watched her die

00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:36.854
and finished her.

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:37.454
No.

00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:38.854
And you defended the murderer.

00:02:38.854 --> 00:02:40.373
I didn't. No.

00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:43.014
I'm not like that.

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:49.973
Wait.

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:51.773
I'll talk. I'll tell you.

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:57.134
Don't try any tricks.

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:13.813
Hello?

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:15.773
Is this Xia Tian?

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:18.574
Hello?

00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:38.894
(Liu Yang)

00:03:38.894 --> 00:03:39.773
Captain Leng,

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:42.054
Xia Tian's phone
suddenly became reachable.

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:43.973
But something feels off.

00:03:44.216 --> 00:03:45.176
I'll transfer the call.

00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:06.454
Zhang Wei wasn't my boyfriend.

00:04:07.174 --> 00:04:08.693
He and Xiao'ou were the real couple.

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:11.134
Xiao'ou's family disapproved,

00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:13.693
so they used me as a cover.

00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:15.693
They made me pretend
to be Zhang Wei's girlfriend.

00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:17.414
We shared a dorm room,

00:04:17.414 --> 00:04:18.493
and we were close friends,

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:21.094
so I agreed,
thinking it wasn't a big deal.

00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:24.893
At first, it really wasn't a big deal.

00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:29.414
But later, Xiao'ou's family
started setting her up on blind dates,

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:30.360
keeping pressuring her.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.414
And Xiao'ou had no excuse to refuse.

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:34.573
So they began arguing nonstop

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:35.813
and breaking up constantly.

00:04:36.453 --> 00:04:38.214
Until Xiao'ou ran out of patience.

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:40.534
She insisted on breaking up
with Zhang Wei.

00:04:41.813 --> 00:04:44.414
That day, Zhang Wei said
he was returning some things

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:47.054
and came to our dorm building.

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:53.573
That knife was bought by Xiao'ou
during a trip they took together.

00:04:53.573 --> 00:04:56.773
(Ye Qian: What's going on?
Can we locate her?)

00:04:57.453 --> 00:04:59.094
(Si Yuanlong: Likely coercion)
I-I was in the dorm then.

00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:01.094
(Search team deployed)
But when I heard noises,

00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:02.933
I sensed something wrong and went out.

00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:05.734
H-He'd already... Xiao'ou was...

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:08.974
Xia Tian?

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:12.013
Xia Tian?

00:05:13.414 --> 00:05:14.214
Is it Jiang Yue?

00:05:15.534 --> 00:05:18.493
Jiang Yue, tell us your demands.

00:05:26.813 --> 00:05:29.013
You really are full of surprises.

00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:35.854
As a girl, you're much more capable
than those fools before you.

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:40.974
I-I'm not. I'm not.

00:05:41.253 --> 00:05:44.493
Still playing games at this point?

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:45.893
No.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:46.974
I'm not.

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:51.774
There's a small motel
called Shanhu behind your school, right?

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.693
The owner's a creep.

00:05:56.253 --> 00:05:58.534
He's installed hidden cameras
in the rooms

00:05:58.813 --> 00:06:00.253
to secretly record guests.

00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:05.013
And there are quite a few videos
of you and Zhang Wei in there.

00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:10.573
What if I sent these videos
to your parents?

00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:11.693
No. Please, no.

00:06:11.693 --> 00:06:12.414
Or your teachers?

00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:13.253
No.

00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:13.974
Maybe classmates?

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:14.854
Please don't.

00:06:16.373 --> 00:06:18.013
If those got posted online...

00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:19.453
I'm begging you.

00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:25.654
Last chance.

00:06:26.693 --> 00:06:27.573
Tell me everything.

00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:39.854
Zhang Wei
really was Xiao'ou's boyfriend.

00:06:40.774 --> 00:06:41.854
I'm not lying about that.

00:06:45.094 --> 00:06:46.013
But what about me?

00:06:46.854 --> 00:06:50.373
Pretending to be Zhang Wei's girlfriend
for so long,

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:53.294
we developed feelings for each other.

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:54.654
What was I?

00:06:57.294 --> 00:06:59.813
Xiao'ou was furious
when she found out about us.

00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:01.974
She threatened to leave Zhang Wei.

00:07:01.974 --> 00:07:04.013
Fighting, breaking up.

00:07:04.813 --> 00:07:06.453
But Zhang Wei wouldn't accept it.

00:07:07.054 --> 00:07:08.054
What about that knife?

00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:11.813
Did Zhang Wei bring it himself?

00:07:12.414 --> 00:07:14.174
Or did you talk him into bringing it?

00:07:15.774 --> 00:07:16.534
It was...

00:07:17.654 --> 00:07:18.414
It was...

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:19.453
Who was it?

00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:24.414
It was me!

00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:26.414
So what if it were me? It was me!

00:07:31.174 --> 00:07:32.414
For such a long time,

00:07:32.573 --> 00:07:34.573
Zhang Wei never intended
to break up with her.

00:07:35.013 --> 00:07:36.094
What did he take me for?

00:07:37.774 --> 00:07:40.813
I wanted him to take that knife
to scare Xiao'ou a little.

00:07:40.813 --> 00:07:42.133
I know Xiao'ou's personality.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.133
If he took the knife,

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:44.734
she would definitely break up with him.

00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:50.614
But I truly never expected

00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:54.414
that he would use that knife.

00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:58.893
I never meant for him to kill Xiao'ou.

00:07:58.893 --> 00:08:00.654
I just wanted them to break up.

00:08:00.654 --> 00:08:03.253
I didn't want him to kill Xiao'ou!

00:08:21.253 --> 00:08:22.493
You all heard that, right?

00:08:24.294 --> 00:08:25.933
For someone so shameless like this,

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:27.734
tell me,

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:33.054
wouldn't it be too unfair
to the deceased not to punish her?

00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:35.453
Jiang Yue,

00:08:36.093 --> 00:08:37.054
don't be impulsive.

00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:40.213
If you have any demands,
you can tell us, okay?

00:08:41.213 --> 00:08:41.894
Jiang Yue?

00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:00.813
Hello, Wang Tong?

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.294
Have you confirmed Xia Tian's location?

00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:04.632
We just got it.

00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:07.054
Near the Huancheng West Road
and Zhongshan Road intersection.

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:08.213
We've told the local police.

00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:09.894
Our people are heading there now.

00:09:10.213 --> 00:09:10.813
Okay.

00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:08.213
(Yunxi City Map)
Several commercial buildings are here.

00:10:08.294 --> 00:10:09.933
Over here is the Ring Park.

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:10.894
Nothing found there yet.

00:10:11.774 --> 00:10:12.774
Moving further this way,

00:10:12.774 --> 00:10:14.933
there are several
upscale residential communities.

00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:16.093
Hard for outsiders to enter.

00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:17.254
No discoveries there either.

00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.733
During the call,
distinct echoes were heard,

00:10:20.054 --> 00:10:21.453
along with an electric motor hum.

00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:24.534
So I believe
Xia Tian is likely in a basement.

00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:25.534
An air-raid shelter

00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:27.192
or inside an empty building.

00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:31.654
There are many abandoned
unfinished buildings by Ring Park.

00:10:32.134 --> 00:10:34.134
Notify the park management immediately.

00:10:34.654 --> 00:10:35.333
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:10:36.134 --> 00:10:36.774
Move out.

00:11:16.573 --> 00:11:17.213
Liu Yang.

00:11:51.374 --> 00:11:52.294
Get the power back!

00:11:58.933 --> 00:11:59.613
Liu Yang.

00:12:14.424 --> 00:12:16.696
(Fingerprint comparison
in progress. Please wait)

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.848
(Target fingerprint
matches the original one)

00:12:36.774 --> 00:12:37.294
Hello?

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.093
The results are in.

00:12:39.453 --> 00:12:40.453
It's formaldehyde.

00:12:42.853 --> 00:12:44.654
According to the technicians' analysis,

00:12:45.134 --> 00:12:46.444
the fingerprints in the basement

00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:49.496
match those found in the previous cases.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:52.174
DNA testing identified it as male.

00:12:53.014 --> 00:12:54.813
A small amount of formaldehyde
was found too.

00:12:56.534 --> 00:12:57.933
Since the prints match,

00:12:58.014 --> 00:13:03.174
why wasn't formaldehyde found
on the prints from the earlier cases?

00:13:03.894 --> 00:13:05.054
The technicians said

00:13:05.054 --> 00:13:06.933
formaldehyde evaporates quickly.

00:13:07.573 --> 00:13:09.534
After a long time,
it becomes undetectable.

00:13:09.693 --> 00:13:13.414
They were able to detect it this time
because they got there promptly.

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.213
What about the victim?

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:16.174
Still in surgery.

00:13:17.174 --> 00:13:20.693
Can we now confirm
the suspect is Jiang Yue?

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.494
He didn't deny it.

00:13:22.774 --> 00:13:25.813
But we can only know for sure
if he's Jiang Yue after we find him.

00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:26.853
Any leads?

00:13:28.213 --> 00:13:30.174
We have very few leads.

00:13:31.534 --> 00:13:35.613
If he's gone into hiding,
he'll be hard to find.

00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:40.014
Come in.

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:44.494
Ye, come on in.

00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:46.693
Jiang Yue has surfaced.

00:13:51.933 --> 00:13:53.733
This is the latest post on the forum.

00:13:54.294 --> 00:13:55.352
(Justice Comes. I Saw Their Death Throes...)
The poster published

00:13:55.352 --> 00:13:57.014
crime scene photos
from those five cases,

00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:58.973
claiming they were all his doing.

00:14:00.534 --> 00:14:04.014
He poses as a righteous avenger
under the guise of justice

00:14:04.254 --> 00:14:05.294
to stir public sentiment.

00:14:06.093 --> 00:14:08.453
He also posted confession videos
from the five individuals.

00:14:10.613 --> 00:14:14.168
The post shot
to the top of the charts instantly,

00:14:14.168 --> 00:14:15.672
with hundreds of thousands of hits.

00:14:15.973 --> 00:14:18.774
Although the forum quickly locked
and hid the post,

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:20.294
it still caused quite a stir.

00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:29.774
It was me. I poisoned those dogs.

00:14:34.613 --> 00:14:36.093
I swindled people's money.

00:14:36.654 --> 00:14:38.654
I deserve to die horribly.

00:14:39.973 --> 00:14:41.374
We've already determined

00:14:41.374 --> 00:14:43.414
that this account
belongs to an early user.

00:14:43.973 --> 00:14:46.933
Records show he hasn't logged
into the site for years.

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:49.014
He can't even remember
his own account password.

00:14:50.054 --> 00:14:55.414
And this user has no connection
to anyone involved in these five cases.

00:14:55.774 --> 00:14:58.213
So it's highly likely
Jiang Yue hacked his account.

00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:01.933
There's also a pinned comment.

00:15:03.853 --> 00:15:05.014
(Do you know who I am?)

00:15:07.294 --> 00:15:10.414
So what do you think he'll do next?

00:15:12.054 --> 00:15:13.093
We've confirmed

00:15:13.853 --> 00:15:16.453
the IP address used for the user's
last login was within the city.

00:15:17.254 --> 00:15:19.534
So it proves Jiang Yue
was in the city at that time.

00:15:21.813 --> 00:15:23.453
This guy's completely crazy.

00:15:23.813 --> 00:15:24.853
He's way too brazen.

00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:30.134
Each extra minute
he remains free poses a risk.

00:15:43.813 --> 00:15:45.813
Master, there's a place I need to check.

00:15:46.733 --> 00:15:47.733
How confident are you?

00:15:49.134 --> 00:15:50.054
Rest assured.

00:15:51.613 --> 00:15:52.414
Let's go together.

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.453
Hand these out.

00:16:24.774 --> 00:16:26.573
I wanted
to get you something nice to eat.

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:27.654
There's nothing here.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.494
Only these.

00:16:28.894 --> 00:16:29.654
Here, Qian.

00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:30.654
Thanks.

00:16:30.654 --> 00:16:31.374
Here, Master.

00:16:32.254 --> 00:16:34.134
Seriously, this place is deserted.

00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:35.774
Desert by day, worse by night.

00:16:35.774 --> 00:16:36.733
Like a ghost town.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:41.333
We've been staking this place out
for days now.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.494
Jiang Yue hasn't shown up.

00:16:42.894 --> 00:16:44.933
Could he have already fled Yunxi City?

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:47.853
We've had heavy checkpoints
and sweeps these past days.

00:16:48.933 --> 00:16:50.894
Yet there are zero leads.

00:16:52.174 --> 00:16:54.774
I believe
Jiang Yue never left Yunxi City.

00:16:55.534 --> 00:16:56.573
If he wanted to flee,

00:16:57.174 --> 00:16:59.093
he could've left Yunxi first

00:16:59.093 --> 00:17:00.414
and then posted remotely.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:03.894
But even if he's still here,

00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:06.573
those fake IDs
can keep him hidden for a while.

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:09.413
Why are we so sure he's here?

00:17:11.093 --> 00:17:13.413
Because this place
holds special meaning for Jiang Yue.

00:17:14.214 --> 00:17:18.734
That vacant lot by the mall
was the old fireworks factory site.

00:17:19.014 --> 00:17:21.254
Jiang Yue and his parents
lived here for years.

00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:24.734
To him, it's practically home.

00:17:26.093 --> 00:17:28.734
Cheng Jianmin went through
so much trouble,

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:30.853
even getting people killed
for this land,

00:17:31.454 --> 00:17:33.133
yet it's sat empty all these years?

00:17:34.534 --> 00:17:36.853
Supposedly due to feng shui issues.

00:17:37.893 --> 00:17:39.413
Feng shui my foot.

00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:41.373
Pure guilty conscience.

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:43.093
By the way,

00:17:43.173 --> 00:17:45.613
those photos and videos
in Jiang Yue's post

00:17:45.853 --> 00:17:47.573
have been verified by the forensic unit.

00:17:47.573 --> 00:17:48.333
They're authentic.

00:17:48.653 --> 00:17:50.373
From the clues provided by him,

00:17:50.454 --> 00:17:52.294
we've found Wen Yong's body.

00:17:52.534 --> 00:17:55.333
It was in that abandoned building
near the massage parlor,

00:17:55.653 --> 00:17:57.014
dumped into the foundation pit.

00:17:57.774 --> 00:17:59.254
It saved us some legwork.

00:17:59.653 --> 00:18:02.214
That guy is overconfident.

00:18:02.494 --> 00:18:04.173
He voluntarily uploaded evidence.

00:18:04.173 --> 00:18:05.454
He thinks we can't find him

00:18:05.454 --> 00:18:06.373
or touch him?

00:18:08.494 --> 00:18:10.974
Listen, this man is dangerous.

00:18:11.054 --> 00:18:12.294
Stay vigilant.

00:18:13.454 --> 00:18:14.813
Remember, safety first.

00:18:15.054 --> 00:18:15.974
No reckless moves.

00:18:16.173 --> 00:18:16.813
Am I clear?

00:18:17.254 --> 00:18:17.893
Understood.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.893
Fall back. Everyone out.

00:19:07.893 --> 00:19:08.494
- Yes.
- Move.

00:19:08.494 --> 00:19:09.333
Go.

00:19:10.093 --> 00:19:11.054
Get the fire department.

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:12.813
Where's Ye Qian?

00:20:47.853 --> 00:20:48.494
Jiang Yue.

00:20:54.014 --> 00:20:55.694
You spoke to me on the phone that day.

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:56.974
Small world.

00:20:58.694 --> 00:20:59.853
I've been waiting for you.

00:21:03.373 --> 00:21:04.454
Why are you alone?

00:21:07.853 --> 00:21:09.333
Your team will catch up soon.

00:21:10.613 --> 00:21:12.494
I suppose you have many questions.

00:21:13.734 --> 00:21:14.974
Since fate brought us together,

00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:17.613
I'll answer three.

00:21:18.573 --> 00:21:20.014
And truthfully.

00:21:20.734 --> 00:21:21.413
Deal?

00:21:26.093 --> 00:21:26.813
Jiang Yue,

00:21:27.734 --> 00:21:29.893
no one has the right to play vigilante.

00:21:30.534 --> 00:21:32.413
Not even if you were a victim.

00:21:33.173 --> 00:21:34.494
It's not too late to surrender.

00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:35.333
Three questions.

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:43.853
You didn't kill Cheng Jianmin, right?

00:21:46.173 --> 00:21:47.093
Got it in one.

00:21:52.534 --> 00:21:53.494
What do you want?

00:21:54.934 --> 00:21:56.054
Name your price.

00:22:22.534 --> 00:22:23.774
What are you doing?

00:22:25.934 --> 00:22:27.294
Who are you?

00:22:43.294 --> 00:22:48.254
You... You're Director Jiang's son?

00:22:49.573 --> 00:22:52.294
You...

00:23:17.093 --> 00:23:18.573
Did you turn on the heating

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:22.373
to throw off the time of death
and mislead the police?

00:23:23.494 --> 00:23:24.653
Not at all.

00:23:25.694 --> 00:23:28.093
I was dying for someone to find him.

00:23:29.454 --> 00:23:33.173
Cheng Jianmin was hated
by a lot for the heating issue.

00:23:34.392 --> 00:23:35.928
I tried to create more red herrings

00:23:36.663 --> 00:23:38.333
to speed up the investigation.

00:23:39.694 --> 00:23:44.214
But it turns out his own son
couldn't wait for him to die to inherit.

00:23:48.054 --> 00:23:49.173
Honestly, I regret it.

00:23:50.813 --> 00:23:52.534
I should've done it myself.

00:23:54.573 --> 00:23:57.694
I read the fireworks factory
explosion report.

00:23:58.613 --> 00:23:59.934
You were there.

00:24:00.934 --> 00:24:01.774
How'd you survive?

00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:03.813
My mom saved me.

00:24:04.974 --> 00:24:06.373
I was coming home from school.

00:24:06.774 --> 00:24:07.853
She came out to greet me.

00:24:12.294 --> 00:24:13.534
What's inside that box?

00:24:18.613 --> 00:24:20.254
That's already your fourth question.

00:24:21.974 --> 00:24:22.653
Take a guess.

00:24:24.373 --> 00:24:25.173
I think

00:24:26.653 --> 00:24:29.054
you deliberately left fingerprints
at every crime scene.

00:24:30.534 --> 00:24:32.573
Your mom
must have been important to you.

00:24:33.813 --> 00:24:37.573
I also believe her love for you
would never have changed.

00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:40.373
She wouldn't want you
to keep making mistakes like this.

00:25:05.813 --> 00:25:08.093
If the police had found
the crucial evidence back then,

00:25:09.694 --> 00:25:14.734
would my family's case
have been solved long ago?

00:25:17.534 --> 00:25:19.694
Protecting the lives
and property of the people

00:25:20.774 --> 00:25:22.734
is the duty of every police officer.

00:25:23.573 --> 00:25:24.934
But every case is different,

00:25:25.613 --> 00:25:27.413
and the difficulty
of solving them varies.

00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:28.974
Jiang Yue,

00:25:29.494 --> 00:25:30.813
please trust the police.

00:25:31.454 --> 00:25:33.054
Stop now. Don't make any more mistakes.

00:25:33.613 --> 00:25:34.214
Mistakes?

00:25:40.014 --> 00:25:40.813
Maybe.

00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:43.613
Who knows?

00:25:56.294 --> 00:25:57.454
We've been here for so long,

00:25:58.534 --> 00:26:00.413
and I haven't even
asked your name, officer.

00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:04.494
Ye Qian, City CID.

00:26:06.534 --> 00:26:07.333
Officer Ye.

00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:29.734
Officer Ye,

00:26:31.093 --> 00:26:32.373
I'll tell you another secret.

00:26:43.254 --> 00:26:45.093
Explosives are in
and around this building.

00:26:47.893 --> 00:26:49.254
All I have to do is press this.

00:26:52.974 --> 00:26:53.734
You all should go.

00:26:55.333 --> 00:26:56.254
Go far away.

00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:00.534
I was never a good person.

00:27:02.373 --> 00:27:05.613
Over these past twenty-plus years,
I've done plenty of bad, rotten things.

00:27:07.774 --> 00:27:09.454
I was never destined for a good end.

00:27:14.613 --> 00:27:16.734
I've been able to avenge my family.

00:27:18.392 --> 00:27:19.224
In this life,

00:27:21.496 --> 00:27:22.520
I have no regrets left.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.544
Put it down.

00:27:23.544 --> 00:27:24.494
Put it down!

00:27:27.413 --> 00:27:29.014
Looks like you don't want to leave.

00:29:12.093 --> 00:29:12.734
Mom!

00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:14.093
Mom!

00:29:14.214 --> 00:29:14.974
Mom!

00:29:15.573 --> 00:29:17.294
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

00:29:17.774 --> 00:29:19.534
Mom!

00:29:20.694 --> 00:29:22.254
Someone help!

00:29:22.254 --> 00:29:23.413
Help!

00:29:23.734 --> 00:29:26.774
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

00:29:26.813 --> 00:29:27.573
Mom!

00:29:27.694 --> 00:29:29.573
Help!

00:29:29.974 --> 00:29:31.694
Wake up! Mom!

00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:34.494
Help!

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:36.974
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:28.214
(Mom,)

00:30:29.893 --> 00:30:31.573
(do you see the fireworks?)

00:30:33.054 --> 00:30:35.613
(Aren't they as beautiful
as the ones from our factory?)

00:30:37.934 --> 00:30:39.613
(I've avenged you and Dad.)

00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:42.072
(Now)

00:30:43.554 --> 00:30:45.774
(it's time for me to pay the price.)

00:31:11.133 --> 00:31:11.813
Xia Tian,

00:31:12.214 --> 00:31:15.173
on the phone, you said your relationship
with Zhang Wei was fake.

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:17.133
Yu Xiao'ou
was Zhang Wei's real girlfriend.

00:31:17.454 --> 00:31:18.653
Is this information accurate?

00:31:19.494 --> 00:31:20.133
Yes.

00:31:21.534 --> 00:31:22.694
It's all true.

00:31:25.173 --> 00:31:26.054
I'm guilty.

00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:29.093
I bear responsibility
for Xiao'ou's death.

00:31:30.133 --> 00:31:32.333
I regret it every single day.

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:35.734
Now, whenever I close my eyes,
I see Xiao'ou's face.

00:31:41.093 --> 00:31:44.294
Xia Tian has admitted
to her statements made on the phone.

00:31:45.413 --> 00:31:48.813
She said everything
Jiang Yue made her say was true.

00:31:50.734 --> 00:31:52.413
As for what Xia Tian told Jiang Yue,

00:31:53.454 --> 00:31:54.893
whether true or false,

00:31:54.934 --> 00:31:56.214
it needs further investigation.

00:31:59.173 --> 00:32:02.853
The Yu Xiao'ou case belongs
to the neighboring province.

00:32:04.014 --> 00:32:06.534
We've sent them
all the relevant recordings.

00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:10.133
