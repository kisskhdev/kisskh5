{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:55.702 --> 00:00:56.953
Albert?

00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:00.165
What's he doing here?

00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:05.879
- Hello there.
- Welcome.

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:10.800
My word.

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:12.677
That's not a car you see in these parts.

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:14.971
I'm running a bit low on fuel.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:17.849
Can I get some emergency fuel
and an oil change as well?

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:21.186
We do everything here.

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:37.535
This is why

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.705
you should know your place and not act up.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.724
I'm not sure
if we have engine oil in stock.

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.644
It might take a few days.

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:03.811
Take your time.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.189
Can you just call me a cab to Seoul?

00:02:06.272 --> 00:02:07.398
A cab?

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:16.783
Hey. I'm calling from Horang.

00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:17.992
Send me a cab.

00:02:18.952 --> 00:02:19.827
Thanks.

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:22.413
Thank you.

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:27.669
What is that?

00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:30.296
There's…

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.090
There's a woman there.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:40.640
You know,

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:43.017
I've heard of people spotting

00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:46.562
a maiden ghost near that highway.

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:51.567
I'll call you when the car's ready.

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:54.696
Can you leave me your phone number?

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:58.282
What did you see out there?

00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:02.620
Jeez, that scared me.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.502
I thought he was just another deadbeat.

00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.337
Who is he really?

00:03:19.387 --> 00:03:22.098
It was that bastard in the van
who tried to kidnap me.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.474
Hey.

00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:26.102
No woman should be there alone this late.

00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:28.187
Aren't you scared at all?

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:29.981
There are still gangsters
out there, you know.

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:31.649
Don't you know how scary this world is?

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:34.318
How could I have known
that the van guy was the auto shop owner?

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.447
And Albert was supposed to be
with his family,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.282
so how was I to know I'd find him there?

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:42.785
For all we know,
Albert could be managing the slush fund.

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.746
He's Chairman Kang's grandson, after all.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.999
He's not capable of that though.

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:49.584
Capabilities don't decide how people work.

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:51.085
They just keep quiet
and do as they're told.

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:55.298
Seeing that you're taking his side,
he must've grown on you already.

00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:56.382
Don't be ridiculous!

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:02.055
What's going on here?

00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:13.983
What are you doing out here?

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.610
I was waiting for you.

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.153
Me? Why?

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:30.750
I'm about to make you an offer
you can't refuse.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.127
It's cold. Can't we go inside and talk?

00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.380
Someone might overhear us there.

00:04:35.463 --> 00:04:37.757
This has to stay between you and me only.

00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:41.094
I was originally going to do it on my own,

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:43.679
but I need your help
now that Go Bok-cheol is out.

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:46.516
Anyway, let me get to the point.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:49.685
There's some easy money at the company.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.980
What? Money?

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:54.565
Yeah.

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:56.901
I'm thinking of hiring you
as a bodyguard-assistant.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:59.112
I'll make it worth your while.

00:04:59.654 --> 00:05:02.657
I'm offering you
the chance of a lifetime right now.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:04.659
Oh gosh!

00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.202
Hong Jang-mi!

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:07.537
You'll have the RA come running.

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:11.332
You're afraid of her,
but not afraid to steal from the company?

00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:16.337
Hold on.

00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:19.132
She definitely knows about
the Outstanding Women Club's slush fund.

00:05:19.882 --> 00:05:23.010
Maybe she knows about Yehppee
and the slush fund ledger as well?

00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.307
This easy money you speak of.

00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:30.017
When and how did you find out about it?

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.396
I help Ms. Song out with
the Outstanding Women Employees' Club.

00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:35.940
It turns out that was a paid position.

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.360
I'm just seeking compensation
for the unauthorized use of my name.

00:05:39.444 --> 00:05:40.319
How much is it?

00:05:40.403 --> 00:05:42.029
Is it enough to change your life?

00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:43.698
What's with that look in her eyes?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.325
Why does it feel like
I'm being interrogated?

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.786
You know what I mean.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.289
After all, you stopped me
from going on that business trip.

00:05:52.123 --> 00:05:53.708
I haven't even checked the account yet.

00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:56.669
It could be one big one?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.337
Maybe ten million won?

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:01.007
Queen Bee.

00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:03.384
I'm telling you this
because I care about you.

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:04.427
Don't do it.

00:06:05.553 --> 00:06:08.514
Just promise me you won't, here and now.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.683
What's with the straight face?

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:11.601
Just forget it.

00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:22.695
Happy now?

00:06:28.534 --> 00:06:32.079
I can't trust Go Bok-hee,
and Albert seems suspicious.

00:06:33.122 --> 00:06:34.290
This is driving me crazy.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.251
Damn it!

00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:45.426
EPISODE 7: I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:54.185
{\an8}Good morning.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.359
{\an8}Did you have a good time
with your family last night?

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:02.860
{\an8}Of course.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:08.866
{\an8}The coffee smells great.

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:10.868
{\an8}I'll take one as well.

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:18.084
{\an8}Was that crossing the line?

00:07:18.668 --> 00:07:20.294
{\an8}You crossed way over the line.

00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:21.796
{\an8}How does a young kid like you

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.423
{\an8}think you can ask someone
clearly your senior to make you coffee?

00:07:24.924 --> 00:07:26.342
Don't you have working hands?

00:07:26.926 --> 00:07:29.262
She's not older than me. I'm…

00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:31.264
- I'm her senior.
- Big Al.

00:07:34.183 --> 00:07:36.686
You're coming
to the division head lunch, right?

00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:39.981
You'd better not exclude him
just because he's young.

00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:41.190
Bring him along.

00:07:41.274 --> 00:07:42.525
Take me out of here right now.

00:07:43.276 --> 00:07:44.735
- Oh, right now?
- Yes.

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:47.196
This way.

00:07:48.614 --> 00:07:50.533
Is that young man
really a division manager?

00:07:50.616 --> 00:07:52.285
Yes, that's right.

00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:53.494
He's the chairman's grandson.

00:07:54.996 --> 00:07:56.247
Miss!

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.541
You should've told me sooner!

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:01.961
Seriously?

00:08:33.242 --> 00:08:34.619
How is his desk so empty?

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:46.297
What are you doing over there, Ms. Hong?

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:53.804
This videotape stack fell from the desk.

00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:56.724
Gosh, Mr. Oh should tidy up a little.

00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:23.918
This is a report on
Kang Myeong-hwi's car accident.

00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:25.836
Why was this…

00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:29.507
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT FATALITY INCIDENT REPORT

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.425
6. ACTIONS TAKEN
FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:33.177
{\an8}7. NOTES: VEHICLE INSPECTION
ON DAY BEFORE ACCIDENT

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:36.847
{\an8}At Horang Auto Repair Shop?

00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:45.356
Did you see the article

00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:48.984
about the bankruptcy status
of the top 50 conglomerates?

00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:52.029
What's your outlook, President Shin?

00:09:52.113 --> 00:09:55.032
"The exchange rate is in crisis,
and domestic demand has plunged."

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.411
The media reports
are stirring market sentiment.

00:09:58.953 --> 00:09:59.829
However,

00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:03.165
since pension funds announced up to
one trillion won in market injections,

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:07.878
I believe the likelihood of Korea facing
a Southeast Asian-style crisis is low.

00:10:07.962 --> 00:10:08.879
As expected,

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:12.091
it seems our perspectives align.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.136
Both crises
and opportunities are illusions.

00:10:15.636 --> 00:10:17.096
Just keep your eye on the prize.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.348
Use anything you can,

00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:21.142
whether it's a sense of
crisis or patriotism,

00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:23.060
to sell as much as possible.

00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:24.854
- Yes, sir.
- Understood.

00:10:25.396 --> 00:10:26.355
Don't worry, sir.

00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:30.776
What should we name the fund?

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.695
You do know that Hanmin was named after

00:10:32.778 --> 00:10:35.114
the characters that make up
"Republic of Korea," right?

00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:37.533
All right then.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:39.243
Let's see here.

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:43.539
There.

00:10:44.248 --> 00:10:45.082
Look.

00:10:47.585 --> 00:10:49.336
"New Korea." That's perfect.

00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:59.597
{\an8}NEW KOREA

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.390
NEW KOREA FUND

00:11:01.474 --> 00:11:02.850

{\an8}HANMIN'S TOP-SELLING INVESTMENT FUND
NEW KOREA FUND

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:10.232
Attention, everyone.

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:13.611
We've received a new directive
from the head office.

00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:16.906
The top New Korea Fund salesperson

00:11:16.989 --> 00:11:19.950
will receive a performance bonus
at the end of the year.

00:11:20.576 --> 00:11:21.952
Here's to another productive day.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.996
All right, get ready for the chant!

00:11:25.206 --> 00:11:27.166
Let's once again survive today!

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:29.168
Let's survive as long as we can!

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:30.961
Beyond the Han River!

00:11:31.045 --> 00:11:33.130
- To the World! To the Future! Hanmin!
- To the World! To the Future! Hanmin!

00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:35.758
Let's give it our all today.

00:11:36.592 --> 00:11:38.052
TODAY'S TOP INVESTMENT PICKS:

00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:39.720
NEW KOREA FUND

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:49.980
{\an8}It's called the New Korea Fund,

00:11:50.064 --> 00:11:52.942
{\an8}and it's the top-selling investment fund
from the industry-leading Hanmin.

00:11:53.442 --> 00:11:56.487
You'll see here
that you're guaranteed a 30% return.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.490
It's a fund that prioritizes
stability alongside returns.

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:00.866
Is the annual return really 30%?

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.410
Of course. It's all guaranteed.

00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:10.167
NEW KOREA FUND
KIM MI-SOOK

00:12:16.632 --> 00:12:18.842
Breakfast is ready, everyone.

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:22.805
Look at all these expensive,
imported bananas…

00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:24.431
All of it looks expensive.

00:12:26.684 --> 00:12:28.310
I got them on a recent visit
to my relatives.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.063
Jang-mi, come and eat breakfast!

00:12:31.146 --> 00:12:32.147
Okay.

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:39.321
Mi-sook, what is all this?

00:12:40.656 --> 00:12:42.783
It's the promotion period
for the New Korea Fund,

00:12:42.866 --> 00:12:44.243
so I'm making these for the clients.

00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:49.039
I want to do well with this
so I can get a permanent spot next year.

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:56.338
Here's a pick-me-up treat for you.

00:12:56.422 --> 00:12:59.133
I am Kim Mi-sook
from Hanmin's Magang Branch.

00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:03.470
You're already starting the day
with a sales pitch.

00:13:04.096 --> 00:13:05.472
You'd better sell her one, Jang-mi.

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:10.060
Did it sound okay?

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.563
SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR NEW CLIENTS

00:13:14.732 --> 00:13:17.735
INVESTMENT KEY POINTS EXPLANATION
CHECKLIST FOR SALESPERSONS

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:21.280
Ms. Kim.

00:13:21.947 --> 00:13:24.450
Don't you think you're pushing too hard
for that performance bonus?

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:26.869
Take it easy.

00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:29.538
I'll make us look bad if you go overboard.

00:13:31.624 --> 00:13:35.169
But you know
how expensive housing is in Seoul.

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:37.463
I hope you understand that I need this.

00:13:38.464 --> 00:13:39.298
Sure.

00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:42.593
We should all work hard.

00:13:43.177 --> 00:13:44.219
Yeah, good luck.

00:13:44.303 --> 00:13:45.596
I guess we should do our best.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.646
Mi-sook.

00:13:55.939 --> 00:13:57.066
You're coming home late.

00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:59.610
I had some business to take care of
after everyone left.

00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:04.657
Do you always pack your lunch and dinner?

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:07.034
Eating out near the office is expensive,

00:14:07.868 --> 00:14:09.745
so I'm trying to save on expenses.

00:14:12.414 --> 00:14:14.875
Mi-sook, let's switch.

00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:17.961
- What?
- I bought some snacks for Bom.

00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:19.963
I bet she'll love them more
if they come from you.

00:14:20.464 --> 00:14:22.007
She's a mommy's girl, after all.

00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:41.402
It feels like I'm in high school again,

00:14:41.485 --> 00:14:43.988
lunchbox in hand
and linking arms with a close friend.

00:14:45.364 --> 00:14:48.033
I've been hoping
we could be friends for a while now.

00:14:55.165 --> 00:14:56.083

Hong Jang-mi.

00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:10.347
Try as you might,
but I won't give up on this money.

00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:12.891
I'll be fine on my own.

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:29.366
Now serving customer number 20.

00:15:46.175 --> 00:15:47.301
I'm here to withdraw.

00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:06.028
Ma'am, the account is empty.

00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:08.322
It was withdrawn by an authorized user.

00:16:09.156 --> 00:16:10.032
What?

00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:11.742
Print me the statement.

00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:13.452
Just a moment.

00:16:26.006 --> 00:16:27.382
WITHDRAWN BY AUTHORIZED USER

00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:29.676

Do you remember who it was,
like anything distinctive?

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:38.393
Well, the thing is…

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.816
Start talking
if you don't want things to escalate.

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:44.858
Right now.

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:45.943
Well…

00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:48.445
A man came by just a moment ago.

00:16:49.822 --> 00:16:50.906
A man?

00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:03.335
OUTSTANDING WOMAN AWARD NOTICE

00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:05.379
Ms. Hong.

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:06.713
Congratulations!

00:17:06.797 --> 00:17:09.091
This quarter's Outstanding Woman
is Hong Jang-mi!

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.301
Really?

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:14.555
{\an8}RECIPIENT: HONG JANG-MI,
RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION

00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:17.891
It's all thanks to us, really.

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:21.436
Your productivity is the result
of our guidance and direction.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.313
That's how you want to take credit?

00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:24.398
Treat us to dinner.

00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:27.860
You've reached Risk Management.

00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:29.611
This is Song Ju-ran.

00:17:30.195 --> 00:17:32.030
Did you check the intranet announcement?

00:17:32.114 --> 00:17:33.991
Yes, I just did.

00:17:34.074 --> 00:17:35.117
Congratulations.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.828
Can you come to my office
with a copy of your ID and bankbook?

00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:40.122
Yes, ma'am. I'll be right there.

00:17:52.718 --> 00:17:53.802
May I ask

00:17:54.303 --> 00:17:56.263
what you're doing here, Mr. Oh?

00:18:00.851 --> 00:18:02.811
As her immediate supervisor,

00:18:03.478 --> 00:18:05.522
I'm here to congratulate,
take photos, and deliver flowers.

00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:09.568
Shall we start with photos?

00:18:11.445 --> 00:18:12.279
Sure.

00:18:14.907 --> 00:18:15.824
All right.

00:18:17.159 --> 00:18:18.493
Here we go.

00:18:18.577 --> 00:18:19.494
One, two, three.

00:18:20.746 --> 00:18:22.873
That's going to be great. One more.

00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:25.459
Here we go. One, two…

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:27.169
That's so great.

00:18:27.252 --> 00:18:28.253
Okay.

00:18:33.592 --> 00:18:34.551
No.

00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:36.136
Ms. Song,

00:18:36.803 --> 00:18:37.971
you take this.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.517
Please.

00:18:58.367 --> 00:18:59.201
Another one?

00:18:59.284 --> 00:19:00.118
Smile.

00:19:09.253 --> 00:19:10.587
Should I just confront him?

00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:12.422
No, he might just deny it.

00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:15.926
Would he really have recommended me
knowing that the OW Club

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:17.302
is a money-laundering scheme?

00:19:17.803 --> 00:19:20.305
It's all thanks to your recommendation.

00:19:21.265 --> 00:19:22.182
Thank you.

00:19:22.266 --> 00:19:24.101
You can thank me with a tasty dinner.

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:26.103
I can do that.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.939
I should deliver
the happy news to the others.

00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:30.607
No, wait.

00:19:30.691 --> 00:19:32.651
We should have dinner,

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:36.697
just the two of us.

00:19:51.753 --> 00:19:53.755
My roommates told me

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:57.467
that President Shin's predecessor,
President Kang Myeong-hwi,

00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:01.388
was your maternal uncle.

00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.432
Yeah, he was.

00:20:05.517 --> 00:20:07.686
I think I read about
his traffic accident in the paper.

00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:10.939
It caused quite a stir.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.027
But he was replaced, and the company
just went back to business as usual,

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.361
as if nothing happened.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.781
It's like they swapped out a missing part.

00:20:21.116 --> 00:20:22.034
It's weird.

00:20:24.286 --> 00:20:26.455
Were you and your uncle close?

00:20:29.499 --> 00:20:30.917
It was one-sided.

00:20:34.504 --> 00:20:35.839
He loved me very much.

00:20:37.466 --> 00:20:39.926
He used to prattle on
about the company and numbers,

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.261
none of which I understood.

00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:44.181
- "Numbers"?
- Yeah.

00:20:44.973 --> 00:20:45.807
Oh, right.

00:20:46.308 --> 00:20:47.976
Was it a week before the accident?

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.269
He told me…

00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:07.829
After work, I wanted to pick up
some chicken skewers to go.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.540
And I just happened to
run into Mr. Shin out front,

00:21:10.624 --> 00:21:11.750
totally by chance.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.251
I heard this place is good.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.754
You, me, Bok-hee, Mi-sook, and Bo…

00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:19.091
There are 5 of us,
so I'll take 50 to go, ma'am!

00:21:19.174 --> 00:21:20.008
50 SKEWERS

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:21.093
Did you say 50?

00:21:21.802 --> 00:21:23.387
That's going to take some time.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.806
You should join us for a quick drink
while you wait.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.448
Shut up.

00:22:02.134 --> 00:22:05.303
What reason do you two have
to meet outside the office?

00:22:05.387 --> 00:22:07.848
I was having a one-on-one
with my immediate supervisor.

00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:09.766
Yes, that's right.

00:22:11.726 --> 00:22:13.103
Let me pour you a drink.

00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:24.990
Ms. Hong.

00:22:25.073 --> 00:22:26.783
If you hate him, just say so.

00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:28.743
What's with the foam party?

00:22:29.578 --> 00:22:31.538
It's fine. I enjoy foam.

00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:43.341
I guess you enjoy drinking.

00:22:43.425 --> 00:22:46.553
You didn't turn down a single drink
at the last company dinner either.

00:22:46.636 --> 00:22:50.182
My ex-girlfriend could hold her liquor
and enjoyed drinking.

00:22:50.265 --> 00:22:52.434
I forced myself to drink more
after I broke up with her,

00:22:52.517 --> 00:22:53.810
just to see how it felt.

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:55.395
And how did it feel?

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.648
It was nothing special.

00:23:01.484 --> 00:23:02.903
I'll stand down today.

00:23:03.862 --> 00:23:05.280
You're not the least bit helpful.

00:23:06.364 --> 00:23:08.783
- The skewers to go are ready.
- Okay.

00:23:09.826 --> 00:23:10.911
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:23:24.841 --> 00:23:26.009
Let's go before they get cold.

00:23:26.885 --> 00:23:28.553
We'll be going now.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.490
Future uncle-in-law.

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:51.034
You should be careful in Yeouido.

00:23:51.534 --> 00:23:52.410
There are too many prying eyes.

00:23:52.494 --> 00:23:56.039
Isn't it more inappropriate
to meet privately with a subordinate?

00:23:56.122 --> 00:23:57.624
I'd like it to be inappropriate,

00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:00.126
but I haven't figured out a way yet.

00:24:05.548 --> 00:24:08.843
In other words, there's nothing
remotely improper going on between us.

00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:10.595
For now, at least.

00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:16.643
How did you know about the street stall?

00:24:17.352 --> 00:24:19.354
It used to be
my ex-girlfriend's favorite spot,

00:24:19.437 --> 00:24:22.023
so I used to come often, all the time.

00:24:23.358 --> 00:24:24.234
Excuse me then.

00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:41.042
The weak currency
has pushed up prices of grains,

00:24:41.126 --> 00:24:43.545
coffee, and snack foods across the board.

00:24:43.628 --> 00:24:47.257
Gasoline prices have broken above
the 843-won-per-liter mark.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.591
"Broken above"?

00:24:51.428 --> 00:24:53.430
BREAK ABOVE: TO RISE PAST A SPECIFIC LIMIT

00:24:53.513 --> 00:24:55.140
With the dismal exchange rate--

00:24:55.223 --> 00:24:56.433
"Break above."

00:24:57.851 --> 00:24:59.227
We're back.

00:25:04.691 --> 00:25:06.443
Something smells tasty.

00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:09.571
Tonight, we'll be having
a chicken skewer party!

00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:14.200
I'm so happy, so excited!

00:25:14.284 --> 00:25:16.369
Bom, are you happy? How many do you want?

00:25:16.453 --> 00:25:18.621
You screwed me over, Hong Jang-mi.

00:25:19.164 --> 00:25:21.249
Why did she grill me like that
the other night?

00:25:22.167 --> 00:25:23.752
She must be hiding something.

00:25:23.835 --> 00:25:26.379
Then I'm going to eat 40!

00:25:26.463 --> 00:25:29.174
The liquidity shortages
among second-tier merchant banks

00:25:29.257 --> 00:25:31.051
have led to a rapid rise
in call borrowing.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.055
Merchant banks appear
to have increased call borrowing

00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:37.390
{\an8}from insurance companies
and securities firms,

00:25:37.474 --> 00:25:39.517
{\an8}following a sharp decline in funding
from bank trusts.

00:25:39.601 --> 00:25:42.771
{\an8}This merchant banking crisis
is more acute in foreign currencies.

00:25:45.023 --> 00:25:48.360
With our two-year corporate bonds maturing
in the third week of December,

00:25:48.443 --> 00:25:49.319
our funding

00:25:50.153 --> 00:25:52.155
remains tight.

00:25:52.238 --> 00:25:53.323
How much?

00:25:53.406 --> 00:25:55.450
The issuance amount
is projected at 100 billion won.

00:25:55.533 --> 00:25:58.912
That leaves a shortfall
of approximately 40 billion won.

00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:02.248
What if we raise
short-term funds in Myeongdong?

00:26:03.208 --> 00:26:06.336
We've already pulled in
about 20 billion won from there.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.173
That's quite the display
of business prowess.

00:26:10.256 --> 00:26:13.301
All these brains in here,
and not one can find a source of funds?

00:26:13.885 --> 00:26:14.803
There is a way, sir.

00:26:16.304 --> 00:26:20.934
Perhaps you could consider
freeing up your personal funds.

00:26:21.017 --> 00:26:22.102
Why would I do that?

00:26:22.185 --> 00:26:23.019
Pardon?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.354
Right.

00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:27.190
A personal capital injection
by the chairman

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:30.527
or borrowing against company real estate
will only spark rumors.

00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:34.155
There is a market
where ultra-short-term funding

00:26:34.239 --> 00:26:37.075
can be borrowed
using Hanmin's bonds as collateral.

00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:39.035
Is that so?

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:45.250
We must fill the granary
before winter comes.

00:26:46.668 --> 00:26:48.169
Borrow to the limit.

00:26:48.878 --> 00:26:50.964
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

00:26:55.468 --> 00:26:58.805
{\an8}Hanmin's two-year corporate bonds mature

00:26:59.556 --> 00:27:00.890
{\an8}in the third week of December,

00:27:01.474 --> 00:27:03.977
but there's no cash for the payouts.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.061
So,

00:27:05.645 --> 00:27:10.066
{\an8}I've suggested funding
through repurchase agreements.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:13.319
{\an8}Okay. He'll have no choice
but to accept our offer later.

00:27:16.781 --> 00:27:18.783
I'll send you
the preliminary report next week.

00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:20.201
Bye.

00:27:22.412 --> 00:27:23.663
You've reached Shin Jung-woo.

00:27:23.746 --> 00:27:24.831
Hey.

00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:26.875
It's me, Executive Director Oh Deok-gyu.

00:27:28.209 --> 00:27:30.587
How about having lunch with me today?

00:27:32.422 --> 00:27:33.798
Unfortunately, I have plans.

00:27:33.882 --> 00:27:36.926
I think you'd appreciate
meeting these people.

00:27:37.427 --> 00:27:38.887
They're from the FSS.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.014
I'm supposed to have lunch
with them today.

00:27:43.057 --> 00:27:44.184
I see.

00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:46.436
What time should I meet you?

00:27:49.314 --> 00:27:50.857
I'm about to finish this whole pot.

00:27:54.152 --> 00:27:56.154
They asked to meet at noon.
Where are they?

00:27:56.237 --> 00:27:57.864
They're busy people.

00:27:59.115 --> 00:28:00.408
And I'm not?

00:28:00.492 --> 00:28:03.745
I'm glad you finally changed your mind
after being so reluctant.

00:28:03.828 --> 00:28:06.039
Life's better when we help each other out.

00:28:06.122 --> 00:28:08.917
You only dragged me here
because you knew you weren't enough.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.043
Come on now.

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:13.129
I've seen plenty of people in Yeouido
with that mindset

00:28:13.213 --> 00:28:15.965
be swept away by the Han River current.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:18.551
Come on, the river can't sweep me away

00:28:18.635 --> 00:28:20.428
if I'm sitting in the lap of luxury.

00:28:20.512 --> 00:28:22.889
Gosh, sorry we're late.

00:28:22.972 --> 00:28:23.806
Goodness me.

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:26.893
No need to apologize.
We just got here ourselves.

00:28:28.686 --> 00:28:29.854
Hello, I'm Shin Jung-woo.

00:28:29.938 --> 00:28:31.814
I'm Director Yun Jae-beom from the FSS.

00:28:32.357 --> 00:28:35.610
I believe we met briefly
in your office last time.

00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:37.987
I was unfortunately a bit unwell that day.

00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:39.239
Are you better now?

00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:40.615
Yes, of course.

00:28:41.783 --> 00:28:44.702
Gosh, you're much taller than I remember.

00:28:45.537 --> 00:28:49.040
Jeez, it's like a meeting of the in-laws.

00:28:49.123 --> 00:28:51.835
Director Yun, you're looking at him
as if he's your son-in-law.

00:28:51.918 --> 00:28:54.003
My goodness, he might as well be.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.674
Gosh.

00:28:57.757 --> 00:28:59.843
You have such big hands,
and you're so tall.

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:00.927
And your nose… Never mind.

00:29:01.803 --> 00:29:03.555
What a handsome man you are.

00:29:03.638 --> 00:29:07.100
Any parent with a daughter
would say the same.

00:29:07.684 --> 00:29:09.519
But sir, you have two sons.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.108
Hello, I'm Nam Dong-gi.

00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:16.192
Yes, hello.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.986
Please sit.

00:29:18.069 --> 00:29:19.279
Please.

00:29:20.905 --> 00:29:23.157
Director Yun, you've become
such a lightweight now.

00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:24.284
This body of mine can't keep up.

00:29:26.119 --> 00:29:27.412
I would've shown him no mercy

00:29:27.495 --> 00:29:29.289
if I were still
at the Ministry of Finance and Economy.

00:29:30.623 --> 00:29:34.919
I've heard Hanmin
and the FSS are deeply at odds.

00:29:35.795 --> 00:29:36.671
A few months ago,

00:29:36.754 --> 00:29:39.591
there was a search and seizure
over slush fund allegations, right?

00:29:40.633 --> 00:29:41.593
Oh that?

00:29:42.093 --> 00:29:43.720
There was a bit of a misunderstanding.

00:29:43.803 --> 00:29:46.514
Wasn't that done
by one of your peers, Mr. Nam?

00:29:46.598 --> 00:29:47.974
Yes, that's right.

00:29:48.516 --> 00:29:50.810
She was demoted and transferred to Jeonju,

00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:54.063
and I doubt she'll ever be able
to return to headquarters.

00:29:54.647 --> 00:29:58.109
If only she could take this chance
to drop that "Witch of Yeouido" title

00:29:58.192 --> 00:30:00.194
and get married.

00:30:00.278 --> 00:30:02.447
Some bide their time
to sharpen their knife.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.741
She may be planning
to avenge her humiliation, no?

00:30:04.824 --> 00:30:07.577
Come on now.
Revenge isn't a one-man sport.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.163
Hong Keum-bo doesn't have
anyone in her corner,

00:30:10.246 --> 00:30:11.664
our office included.

00:30:12.123 --> 00:30:13.875
And was it ten years ago?

00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:17.462
Everyone at her accounting firm
cut ties with her after she was fired.

00:30:17.545 --> 00:30:19.756
I heard even her boyfriend dumped her.

00:30:20.423 --> 00:30:21.966
You gentlemen all get it, don't you?

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.301
What do we get exactly?

00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:25.511
I don't get it at all.

00:30:26.763 --> 00:30:28.806
Right, you might not.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.602
You will,
once you experience her firsthand.

00:30:35.271 --> 00:30:36.856
President Shin,

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.068
aren't you and Inspector Hong
university alumni?

00:30:41.611 --> 00:30:42.904
Is that so?

00:30:43.404 --> 00:30:47.575
Weren't you the one who offered her
a job at the FSS, Director Yun?

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:49.243
What? Really?

00:30:56.417 --> 00:30:59.629
Man, that's top-secret intel
that even my wife doesn't know about.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.173
You're quite impressive.

00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:04.592
Shall we arrange for a meeting?

00:31:04.676 --> 00:31:05.843
I do wonder

00:31:05.927 --> 00:31:08.304
what Hong Keum-bo's been up to
and what's been on her mind.

00:31:09.681 --> 00:31:12.600
Sounds good.
I'll be waiting for your call.

00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:37.500
Damn it.

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:39.585
I can't dig properly
because I keep getting interrupted.

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:42.046
I should've just ended him
over the skewers.

00:31:49.012 --> 00:31:52.640
I see you still visit the emergency stairs
to blow off steam at work.

00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:06.362
You hired someone for a background check?

00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:09.907
I guess dirty tricks are
what got you up that ladder.

00:32:11.826 --> 00:32:14.829
Why haven't you gotten anywhere,
while I've come this far?

00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:15.872
What?

00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:18.833
When you let Yun Jae-beom
talk you into whistleblowing,

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:20.126
your life went off the rails.

00:32:22.336 --> 00:32:24.630
You don't have a single ally
at the FSS, do you?

00:32:24.714 --> 00:32:27.675
That punk who claimed to be your peer
jumped at the chance to smear you.

00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:33.014
How exactly does my off-the-rails life
and smeared name concern you?

00:32:33.931 --> 00:32:35.058
President Shin.

00:32:35.641 --> 00:32:38.311
You appear quite intoxicated
by your rise in social status,

00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:40.188
and by all means, progress away.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.648
I'm just doing my job.

00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:44.275
So you'll cling to a sense of justice

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:46.819
that gets you
no recognition and no reward?

00:32:48.404 --> 00:32:50.615
Do you still believe in people
after all I put you through?

00:32:50.698 --> 00:32:52.366
I learned it all from you.

00:32:59.373 --> 00:33:02.168
You're staying quiet
despite having the power to kick me out

00:33:02.877 --> 00:33:04.462
because it could hurt you, no?

00:33:05.505 --> 00:33:08.299
Because you fear
the ever-wary chairman might dig into us?

00:33:08.382 --> 00:33:09.884
Do you still not get it?

00:33:11.094 --> 00:33:13.763
This is no time for make-believe.
"The Witch of Yeouido"?

00:33:15.181 --> 00:33:18.935
The end for a witch
is either exile or death.

00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:27.652
Then just sit back and watch,

00:33:28.736 --> 00:33:30.238
just like you did nine years ago.

00:33:36.744 --> 00:33:38.830
Why were you even there?

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:41.124
Why else?

00:33:41.707 --> 00:33:43.501
I went because
I was curious about Shin Jung-woo.

00:33:43.584 --> 00:33:47.380
Man, he was even better in person.

00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:49.132
He's so tall.

00:33:49.215 --> 00:33:50.216
That punk is unreal.

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:53.302
No wonder
the invincible Hong Keum-bo melted away

00:33:53.386 --> 00:33:54.846
like spring snow in early March…

00:33:54.929 --> 00:33:56.013
Director Yun!

00:33:58.474 --> 00:34:00.560
By the way,

00:34:00.643 --> 00:34:04.480
he knew that I was the one
who offered you a job at the FSS.

00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:05.565
He did?

00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:08.151
How did he know about that?

00:34:08.234 --> 00:34:09.443
Exactly.

00:34:09.527 --> 00:34:11.571
That happened a long time
after you two broke up.

00:34:12.238 --> 00:34:15.366
Anyway, I confirmed the deposit
in Hong Jang-mi's name.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:17.702
The whole 24 billion won came in.

00:34:17.785 --> 00:34:19.120
If that's just a part of it,

00:34:19.745 --> 00:34:21.581
how much do you think
the slush fund is in total?

00:34:27.753 --> 00:34:29.714
ACCOUNT TRANSACTION HISTORY

00:34:29.797 --> 00:34:32.675
That OW money must be in
Hong Jang-mi's account now,

00:34:33.301 --> 00:34:34.594
now that she's got the award.

00:34:37.805 --> 00:34:38.890
It's fine.

00:34:39.473 --> 00:34:41.934
I still have
this golden goose in the making.

00:34:44.103 --> 00:34:46.022
LONESOME: FEELING LONELY IN A DESOLATE WAY

00:34:46.105 --> 00:34:47.190
I'm back.

00:34:47.273 --> 00:34:48.608
WOMEN'S MAGAZINE

00:34:49.442 --> 00:34:50.651
Kiddo.

00:34:50.735 --> 00:34:51.777
- Yes?
- Yes?

00:34:53.946 --> 00:34:55.156
Yes, you two.

00:34:55.656 --> 00:34:58.034
Mi-sook is working late tonight,
so give Bom her bath.

00:34:58.618 --> 00:35:00.286
Okay. Let's go, Bom.

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:01.287
Okay.

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:23.559
Bom, did you go outside?

00:35:25.061 --> 00:35:26.562
No, I didn't.

00:35:29.982 --> 00:35:33.736
You must get bored being here alone
after everyone leaves for work.

00:35:35.905 --> 00:35:37.114
I feel lonesome.

00:35:38.282 --> 00:35:40.326
Do you know what that means?

00:35:40.952 --> 00:35:44.038
"Feeling lonely in a desolate way."

00:35:44.121 --> 00:35:46.290
That's what the dictionary says.

00:35:48.417 --> 00:35:50.419
You're so smart, Bom.

00:35:50.503 --> 00:35:51.337
Sit.

00:35:53.297 --> 00:35:54.173
It's Sunday tomorrow.

00:35:54.257 --> 00:35:56.676
- We should play soccer.
- Sure.

00:35:56.759 --> 00:35:57.635
Hey, Mom.

00:35:57.718 --> 00:35:58.844
Come home once in a while.

00:35:58.928 --> 00:36:01.889
You're not saving the country,
so you can afford to visit your parents.

00:36:01.973 --> 00:36:03.599
I've been a little busy.

00:36:04.809 --> 00:36:06.143
By the way,

00:36:06.644 --> 00:36:09.605
do kids easily get bruises
on their arms and legs?

00:36:09.689 --> 00:36:10.648
Keum-bo.

00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:13.025
Don't worry about other people's kids.

00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:14.735
Worry about getting married yourself!

00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:23.452
Hey.

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:25.871
You don't have a name or a home?

00:36:27.832 --> 00:36:28.749
Are you a beggar?

00:36:29.417 --> 00:36:32.920
Even a beggar would have a name.

00:36:33.504 --> 00:36:35.548
I'm holding back right now.

00:36:35.631 --> 00:36:38.467
And what happens if you don't, beggar?

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.345
Hey! You horrible brats!

00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:43.139
Go! Run!

00:36:43.222 --> 00:36:44.098
You little…

00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:48.311
What are you doing here?

00:36:52.148 --> 00:36:52.982
Are you okay?

00:37:01.282 --> 00:37:03.951
Why were those kids being mean to you?

00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:10.207
I can't tell them I live in the dorms,

00:37:11.417 --> 00:37:14.128
so I told them
my name and home were secret.

00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:15.588
Then they called me a weirdo.

00:37:17.298 --> 00:37:18.966
Do you sneak out to play every day

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:20.718
after the aunties go to work?

00:37:21.552 --> 00:37:23.554
Not every day.

00:37:24.138 --> 00:37:27.350
But everyone has secrets.

00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:28.684
You have one too.

00:37:31.896 --> 00:37:32.730
Right.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.107
Eat up.

00:37:37.777 --> 00:37:39.612
KIM MI-SOOK:
WORKING SATURDAY AFTERNOON TOO

00:37:39.695 --> 00:37:40.946
Oh my god.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.616
Mi-sook would be so upset
if she heard this.

00:37:43.699 --> 00:37:46.118
It can't be easy for Bom
to be inside all day.

00:37:46.202 --> 00:37:47.453
She's alone all day.

00:37:49.288 --> 00:37:51.374
We should give them a good scolding.

00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:53.626
- Us?
- Scold who?

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.346
Hey!

00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:07.390
I told you beggars aren't allowed
at the playground!

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:08.974
Hey now.

00:38:22.321 --> 00:38:25.157
Kiddos, do you own the playground?

00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:27.076
You should be nice to each other.

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:29.286
You can't play favorites
and bully others already.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.497
- Think of the country's future.
- Whatever.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.834
Who are you ladies to be butting in?

00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:37.420
We're Bom's aunties!

00:38:37.503 --> 00:38:38.963
So what?

00:38:39.755 --> 00:38:41.882
I guess she really has no mom.

00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:43.175
That's not true!

00:38:43.259 --> 00:38:44.552
I guess it's true then.

00:38:48.973 --> 00:38:51.600
My lady, it's time to go home now.

00:39:02.278 --> 00:39:06.824
Wait, that's the new doll
that just came out.

00:39:07.324 --> 00:39:09.285
It's the one I wanted.

00:39:10.578 --> 00:39:14.081
My dad wouldn't buy me one
because it was too expensive.

00:39:24.592 --> 00:39:25.593
Be nice.

00:39:31.265 --> 00:39:35.144
All it took was a "my lady"
to make her into some rich family's kid.

00:39:36.103 --> 00:39:37.855
Bom, did it feel good?

00:39:37.938 --> 00:39:40.357
Yeah, I felt like a princess.

00:39:40.441 --> 00:39:42.568
Of course, you're a princess.

00:39:43.861 --> 00:39:46.614
It's once again our duty
to finish these skewers today.

00:39:46.697 --> 00:39:49.867
Fifty is too much.
We still have thirty to go.

00:39:53.746 --> 00:39:56.332
You promised you wouldn't go outside.

00:39:56.415 --> 00:39:58.876
I'm sorry, Mommy.

00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:06.509
Excuse me.

00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:29.740
Bom, why aren't you sleeping?

00:40:36.705 --> 00:40:38.874
Auntie Eun-joo got you the pretty doll.

00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:40.793
Why are you playing
with these paper dolls?

00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:45.422
These have been my friends
for a long time.

00:40:46.882 --> 00:40:47.883
I see.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.476
We should build a house for your friends.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.477
A sturdy one too.

00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:04.275
This sketchbook paper
should be sturdy enough.

00:41:06.277 --> 00:41:07.278
Pink.

00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:10.072
A pink that's as pretty as you, Bom.

00:41:10.155 --> 00:41:12.866
Let's first color the walls…

00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:26.255
- Ta-da.
- Wow, how pretty.

00:41:27.298 --> 00:41:28.549
Let's draw her a necklace too.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.599
CORPORATE CARD RECEIPTS

00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:04.251
Hello?

00:42:05.377 --> 00:42:07.212
Hello, sir. Is my car ready?

00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:11.675
All right.
I'll pick it up after work today.

00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:13.969
Thank you.

00:42:18.557 --> 00:42:22.436
HORANG AUTO REPAIR SHOP

00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:50.547
Come on in.

00:42:52.091 --> 00:42:56.303
I left the keys in the car.

00:42:56.387 --> 00:42:57.262
You're all set.

00:42:59.223 --> 00:43:00.057
Here you go.

00:43:02.726 --> 00:43:03.852
Let's see here.

00:43:07.523 --> 00:43:09.400
Do you do vehicle inspections too?

00:43:09.483 --> 00:43:10.359
Here?

00:43:12.236 --> 00:43:13.362
We don't.

00:43:14.279 --> 00:43:15.280
They don't pay much.

00:43:18.742 --> 00:43:19.952
But you did one last July.

00:43:21.412 --> 00:43:22.955
Do you also do repairs yourself?

00:43:23.747 --> 00:43:25.124
The brakes were faulty.

00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:29.962
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:43:31.171 --> 00:43:32.131
Do you want some coffee?

00:43:48.272 --> 00:43:49.106
Hey!

00:43:49.189 --> 00:43:51.150
No! Don't come any closer!

00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:53.110
- What's going on?
- Stop right there!

00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:55.320
Damn it!

00:43:55.404 --> 00:43:57.489
Come on, let's just talk it out!

00:43:57.573 --> 00:43:59.158
I'm here to talk.

00:43:59.742 --> 00:44:00.617
Who are you?

00:44:00.701 --> 00:44:01.785
Who sent you?

00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:03.162
I just came on my own.

00:44:12.004 --> 00:44:14.047
What's your deal? Stop!

00:44:14.131 --> 00:44:15.299
Hold on!

00:44:17.926 --> 00:44:19.011
Damn it.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.264
I got you.

00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:31.857
Man, that hurts.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.821
Hey, get in!

00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:40.491
Get away from me!

00:44:44.203 --> 00:44:45.204
Hey! Get them!

00:45:04.473 --> 00:45:05.307
Are you okay?

00:45:06.558 --> 00:45:07.768
Did you follow me?

00:45:07.851 --> 00:45:08.685
Why?

00:45:09.895 --> 00:45:12.314
You forgot to sign something for approval,
so I had to follow you.

00:45:13.857 --> 00:45:14.900
Don't lie to me!

00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:34.127
Okay.

00:45:34.211 --> 00:45:35.629
Let's play the truth game.

00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:38.465
I have a lot of questions right now.

00:45:41.176 --> 00:45:43.845
Why was this document in your possession?

00:45:44.888 --> 00:45:47.641
And why were you
at the auto shop in question?

00:45:48.934 --> 00:45:50.060
You get to ask?

00:45:50.769 --> 00:45:51.853
Not me?

00:45:53.438 --> 00:45:56.733
- I don't know why you have this--
- Answer my question.

00:45:57.317 --> 00:46:00.612
If it weren't for me back there,
you would've been knocked out.

00:46:03.615 --> 00:46:05.158
Yes, thank you for that.

00:46:08.245 --> 00:46:09.079
Fine.

00:46:10.038 --> 00:46:12.791
I've been investigating
my uncle's accident. Satisfied?

00:46:14.084 --> 00:46:15.460
We still have our Nora.

00:46:15.544 --> 00:46:17.838
I had to be here as her mother.

00:46:18.505 --> 00:46:19.423
After all, our Nora

00:46:20.007 --> 00:46:21.967
is the chairman's only child now.

00:46:24.386 --> 00:46:26.847
You were kicked out of here ages ago.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.433
I was never kicked out.
I walked out on my own.

00:46:29.516 --> 00:46:31.184
Even after his funeral mass,

00:46:32.394 --> 00:46:34.187
not a single person mourned his death.

00:46:35.981 --> 00:46:37.733
If Nora survives

00:46:37.816 --> 00:46:40.777
the three-month probationary period

00:46:41.528 --> 00:46:44.906
and becomes a full-time employee
at Hanmin Investment & Securities,

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:48.118
then I'll let you inherit
the shares of the company

00:46:48.702 --> 00:46:50.871
that I intended to pass down
to Myeong-hwi.

00:46:51.371 --> 00:46:52.914
My goodness. Nora.

00:46:52.998 --> 00:46:54.041
But, sir.

00:46:54.124 --> 00:46:56.293
I'd known that my family
was dysfunctional at best, but…

00:47:14.019 --> 00:47:14.936
Chief.

00:47:16.104 --> 00:47:18.315
We're hoping you close the case
as soon as possible.

00:47:19.107 --> 00:47:20.317
The chairman doesn't want

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.528
any further investigation
into President Kang's accident.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.114
That's right.

00:47:27.783 --> 00:47:29.159
Please take care of it.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.547
{\an8}POLICE ID

00:47:48.428 --> 00:47:50.097
According to the police officer,

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.558
evidence proving my uncle's brakes
were intentionally tampered with

00:47:53.642 --> 00:47:55.477
had been left out of the report.

00:48:07.698 --> 00:48:09.449
For some reason, his car was taken

00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:12.119
to an unfamiliar auto shop for inspection
the day before his accident.

00:48:12.703 --> 00:48:14.121
It was the one we just escaped from,

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:16.540
Horang Auto Repair Shop.

00:48:17.207 --> 00:48:18.875
Who made that change?

00:48:20.293 --> 00:48:21.128
Was it

00:48:21.712 --> 00:48:22.546
Go Bok-hee?

00:48:23.964 --> 00:48:24.881
It wasn't Ms. Go.

00:48:28.635 --> 00:48:30.554
Wait, did Ms. Song ask you to tail me?

00:48:31.513 --> 00:48:32.389
No.

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.308
Do you suspect her?

00:48:36.685 --> 00:48:40.355
My uncle's driver at the time
claimed he just did as he was told.

00:48:40.939 --> 00:48:43.358
But he never told me who it was
and went into hiding.

00:48:47.821 --> 00:48:50.240
Why are you telling me all this?

00:48:50.323 --> 00:48:52.075
What if I tell people?

00:48:56.455 --> 00:48:57.664
Because I'm lonely.

00:48:59.666 --> 00:49:01.752
You're the first person to ask about it.

00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:07.007
You probably don't know
anything about my uncle,

00:49:09.092 --> 00:49:09.926
but I just…

00:49:13.221 --> 00:49:14.556
I just wanted to tell someone.

00:49:23.106 --> 00:49:26.276
Also, I'm the chairman's only grandson,
and you're an entry-level minion.

00:49:26.359 --> 00:49:27.944
Who do you think people will believe?

00:49:30.447 --> 00:49:31.323
I'm not worried.

00:49:34.242 --> 00:49:36.286
Look at you being all elitist.

00:49:37.788 --> 00:49:39.539
That's just how the world works.

00:49:39.623 --> 00:49:42.501
After all, I have
more real-world experience than you.

00:49:47.881 --> 00:49:50.842
I don't think there's
one sincere person in this company.

00:49:52.177 --> 00:49:53.303
There's no sincerity,

00:49:54.346 --> 00:49:55.764
just loads of secrets.

00:50:12.155 --> 00:50:12.989
Hey.

00:50:13.824 --> 00:50:15.033
A few days ago,

00:50:16.201 --> 00:50:17.369
some spoiled brat

00:50:17.452 --> 00:50:20.038
came by for an oil change
with his sports car.

00:50:21.331 --> 00:50:22.457
And today,

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.961
he said something strange to me.

00:50:26.545 --> 00:50:27.754
What did he say?

00:50:27.838 --> 00:50:29.089
He asked…

00:50:30.423 --> 00:50:31.883
if I broke someone's brakes in July.

00:50:34.803 --> 00:50:35.637
Ms. Song.

00:50:38.515 --> 00:50:40.392
He was

00:50:40.475 --> 00:50:42.769
about 180 cm tall.

00:50:42.853 --> 00:50:45.313
He was young, with a handsome face.

00:50:45.814 --> 00:50:47.357
And he had black eyes.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.608
Noted.

00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:51.528
Hello.

00:50:53.989 --> 00:50:56.324
I'll follow up
with an additional assignment soon.

Should we report
yesterday's incident to the police?

00:52:19.908 --> 00:52:21.910
No. How would I trust them?

00:52:31.419 --> 00:52:32.671
Are you giving up now?

00:52:39.886 --> 00:52:41.805
Are you free tonight?

00:52:54.234 --> 00:52:55.151

Two heads are better than one.

00:53:19.801 --> 00:53:20.927
Ms. Hong.

00:53:21.011 --> 00:53:21.970
You've got grit.

00:53:23.346 --> 00:53:24.723
Let's call it tenacity.

00:53:27.475 --> 00:53:28.476
That's the exact opposite of me.

00:53:29.561 --> 00:53:31.104
All I've ever done is give up.

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.440
When I was in film school,

00:53:34.649 --> 00:53:36.276
I was always writing screenplays,

00:53:37.068 --> 00:53:38.403
but I never finished a single one.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.115
I started out strong,

00:53:43.074 --> 00:53:45.660
but I gave up midway,
worried the ending would be lame.

00:53:47.328 --> 00:53:48.163
But now,

00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:50.665
I fear

00:53:51.708 --> 00:53:54.419
the ending to this storyline
will be even more infuriating.

00:53:56.129 --> 00:53:57.297
So I'll stop here.

00:53:59.632 --> 00:54:03.011
But you watch every videotape
through to the end credits.

00:54:05.472 --> 00:54:07.432
You should see this through too.

00:54:14.689 --> 00:54:17.484
Shall we go somewhere more private?

00:54:25.867 --> 00:54:27.160
I don't want

00:54:27.243 --> 00:54:29.412
the same ending as my uncle.

00:54:31.039 --> 00:54:33.500
They might succeed
in taking me out quietly next time.

00:54:34.084 --> 00:54:36.252
I need someone to back me up.

00:54:36.336 --> 00:54:39.005
And even better if they can save me
before that happens.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.717
You got the right person for the job.

00:54:43.343 --> 00:54:44.177
Okay.

00:54:47.305 --> 00:54:49.682
Everything I'm about to say
is purely fictional.

00:54:51.684 --> 00:54:53.061
Is there no screenplay?

00:54:55.313 --> 00:54:57.982
Neither my grandfather
nor the audit team can raid my mind.

00:55:01.611 --> 00:55:03.196
Early in the morning on July 22nd,

00:55:03.279 --> 00:55:06.116
{\an8}my uncle got into a car accident
on his way to work.

00:55:06.199 --> 00:55:07.492
Later that morning,

00:55:07.575 --> 00:55:11.204
the prosecutors seized all the files
and computers on the 12th floor

00:55:11.287 --> 00:55:12.247
where his office was.

00:55:13.998 --> 00:55:15.208
They did.

00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:17.794
If my grandfather is right
and my uncle was a traitor,

00:55:18.253 --> 00:55:19.921
my uncle would've left

00:55:20.463 --> 00:55:24.008
the whistleblower evidence in his office
before he went home the night before.

00:55:24.092 --> 00:55:25.260
You know, as a sort of promise.

00:55:26.678 --> 00:55:27.846
I know that because it was my idea.

00:55:30.265 --> 00:55:32.183
It was your idea?

00:55:38.857 --> 00:55:42.152
It was a storyline
in one of my unfinished screenplays.

00:55:43.403 --> 00:55:45.655
My uncle read it and called it awful,

00:55:45.738 --> 00:55:47.490
but he wanted to steal just that part.

00:55:48.658 --> 00:55:49.784
If the prosecutors

00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:52.620
had found something,
they would've taken action.

00:55:53.746 --> 00:55:54.622
But they didn't.

00:55:56.624 --> 00:55:59.794
It doesn't seem like
the company covered it up,

00:56:00.712 --> 00:56:01.546
either.

00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:07.177
What if President Kang's aide

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.971
delivered the whistleblower evidence
to the 12th floor,

00:56:10.555 --> 00:56:12.265
only for a third party to snatch it up?

00:56:12.348 --> 00:56:14.559
If it was someone
who could enter his office

00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:16.060
without attracting attention,

00:56:17.353 --> 00:56:18.188
then it's possible.

00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:19.814
You had such access.

00:56:21.274 --> 00:56:22.108
Me?

00:56:23.693 --> 00:56:24.652
No.

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.114
Not me, but that woman in your life.

00:56:58.937 --> 00:56:59.812
Go Bok-hee.

00:56:59.896 --> 00:57:00.772
The cart.

00:57:01.689 --> 00:57:03.942
I tried to see
if I could get something out of her,

00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:05.735
but I got nothing.

00:57:10.823 --> 00:57:11.699
Hold on a second.

00:57:13.034 --> 00:57:13.910
There's someone else.

00:57:15.411 --> 00:57:16.246
Who?

00:57:19.707 --> 00:57:21.084
I'll check and let you know.

00:57:21.167 --> 00:57:22.669
- You should go home.
- What about you?

00:57:24.212 --> 00:57:26.172
It's already past curfew at the dorms.

00:57:26.256 --> 00:57:28.466
I've already got three demerit points,
so I need to tread carefully.

00:57:29.842 --> 00:57:30.802
Then I'm staying here.

00:57:31.844 --> 00:57:33.096
Can't you just go?

00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:35.765
You won't tell me who it is,
and you want to check on your own.

00:57:35.848 --> 00:57:37.016
How can I just leave you?

00:57:39.394 --> 00:57:40.520
Fine.

00:57:40.603 --> 00:57:42.564
We'll check together at 5 a.m.

00:57:43.398 --> 00:57:44.232
Okay.

00:57:49.654 --> 00:57:51.656
{\an8}HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:57:53.825 --> 00:57:54.659
Hello.

00:57:54.742 --> 00:57:57.704
- Just another busy day ahead.
- Have a good day.

00:58:07.005 --> 00:58:08.881
Oh gosh! You scared me.

00:58:09.799 --> 00:58:11.175
You're the cleaning lady from that day.

00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:12.760
The chairman's grandson?

00:58:13.928 --> 00:58:15.138
That's right, ma'am.

00:58:15.221 --> 00:58:17.599
You remember
the chairman's grandson, right?

00:58:19.017 --> 00:58:21.978
I made a big mistake the other day.

00:58:22.061 --> 00:58:23.688
I'm terribly sorry.

00:58:24.272 --> 00:58:27.358
Why don't we chat some more in the office?

00:58:27.442 --> 00:58:28.776
I fear our young master…

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.778
I mean, the division manager
might find standing exhausting.

00:58:32.655 --> 00:58:35.783
My legs do hurt a bit.
Shall we go inside and chat some more?

00:58:36.367 --> 00:58:40.496
But I have to finish cleaning
the president's office within 30 minutes.

00:58:41.664 --> 00:58:43.708
Ms. Hong will help you with the cleaning.

00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:45.460
I'll remain seated.

00:58:45.543 --> 00:58:46.711
Right, Ms. Hong?

00:58:51.215 --> 00:58:52.216
That's right.

00:58:54.218 --> 00:58:56.596
The new president is very tidy,

00:58:56.679 --> 00:58:58.014
so there isn't much to clean.

00:58:59.098 --> 00:59:02.101
Yes, he's one tidy person.

00:59:20.328 --> 00:59:23.331
By the way,
what did you want to talk to me about?

00:59:23.414 --> 00:59:26.793
Ma'am, do you remember
what you did on July 22nd,

00:59:26.876 --> 00:59:29.462
on the day of
the late president's accident?

00:59:30.046 --> 00:59:32.507
Of course. It was a complete mess.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:35.551
The prosecutors stormed in
to seize everything in sight.

00:59:36.052 --> 00:59:38.471
You cleaned this office
that morning as well, right?

00:59:38.554 --> 00:59:40.807
Of course, I did.

00:59:46.896 --> 00:59:49.107
- Hello there.
- Hello.

00:59:49.899 --> 00:59:51.401
The president's pen…

00:59:51.984 --> 00:59:53.277
Here it is.

00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:56.280
I remember his assistant
came in early that day too.

00:59:56.906 --> 00:59:59.242
I heard the chairman had
called for an emergency meeting.

01:00:01.202 --> 01:00:02.870
- I can get that.
- Sorry.

01:00:02.954 --> 01:00:04.831
She was all over the place.

01:00:09.669 --> 01:00:13.381
The files are usually marked
with the floor they came from.

01:00:16.634 --> 01:00:17.468
That's right.

01:00:17.552 --> 01:00:20.805
She took the notebook
with the sticker on the cover.

01:00:20.888 --> 01:00:21.806
Have a good day.

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:23.224
You too.

01:00:24.892 --> 01:00:26.185
A sticker?

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.574
What's your deal?
Don't dig through my stuff!

01:00:39.657 --> 01:00:41.200
Wait, I'm not…

01:00:41.284 --> 01:00:42.535
No, hold on.

01:00:50.293 --> 01:00:51.127
What…

01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:05.683
Just another sleepless night.

01:01:15.985 --> 01:01:16.986
No way.

01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:18.196
Did she stay out?

01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:28.372
Where's that notebook?

01:01:29.373 --> 01:01:30.208
What notebook?

01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:33.085
The notebook with the sticker
you accused me of stealing.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.379
I don't know,
maybe I left it at the office?

01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:38.925
It's not at your desk. I already checked.

01:01:40.259 --> 01:01:42.220
You went through my desk?

01:01:42.303 --> 01:01:43.221
Have you lost your mind?

01:01:43.304 --> 01:01:45.306
You figured it out
after you saw that ledger

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:47.517
where the easy money was buried.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:53.564
Hey!

01:01:57.318 --> 01:01:58.194
What's your deal?

01:01:58.277 --> 01:01:59.695
Are you with the police?
The secret service?

01:01:59.779 --> 01:02:01.239
What gives you the right to do this?

01:02:01.823 --> 01:02:02.907
Stop it!

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:04.075
Oh no.

01:02:04.158 --> 01:02:05.576
We should do something.

01:02:06.035 --> 01:02:06.869
Damn it.

01:02:11.707 --> 01:02:13.125
Where's the magazine that I put here?

01:02:13.709 --> 01:02:15.795
- Magazine?
- I threw it out.

01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:17.964
- You threw it out?
- You threw it out?

01:02:18.047 --> 01:02:21.008
Yeah. It was dorm clean-out day yesterday.

01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:31.394
Great.

01:02:32.812 --> 01:02:33.729
WOMEN'S MAGAZINE

01:02:34.856 --> 01:02:35.982
AUGUST 1997, SUMMER EDITION

01:02:36.065 --> 01:02:39.193
I tossed it because
it was the August summer issue.

01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:42.238
Are you crazy?
Why would you throw that out?

01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:45.283
You hid the ledger inside a magazine?

01:02:46.242 --> 01:02:48.244
Magazines are made out of paper…

01:02:49.328 --> 01:02:51.706
And recycled paper
ends up in the incinerator!

01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:53.249
The incinerator?

01:03:14.186 --> 01:03:17.106
Sir, have you seen a notebook this big?

01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:19.567
There's a dog sticker
in the bottom-right corner.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:20.484
I'm not sure.

01:03:20.568 --> 01:03:21.819
Mister.

01:03:21.903 --> 01:03:24.488
Where's the third-floor paper waste
from yesterday's clean-out?

01:03:24.572 --> 01:03:26.908
Jeez, I burned it all up already.

01:03:28.367 --> 01:03:29.201
See? It's all gone.

01:03:30.244 --> 01:03:31.495
You should've come sooner.

01:03:41.255 --> 01:03:42.757
Where did you get that notebook from?

01:03:45.009 --> 01:03:46.260
I just…

01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:48.179
I just found it somewhere.

01:03:50.306 --> 01:03:51.891
I told you last time

01:03:51.974 --> 01:03:53.935
that there's easy money at the company.

01:03:54.018 --> 01:03:56.020
This would've never happened
if we joined forces then.

01:03:56.103 --> 01:03:57.396
You found the notebook?

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.690
You took it from the president's office.

01:03:59.774 --> 01:04:01.317
Did you take it knowing about the raid?

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.401
Who told you to?

01:04:02.485 --> 01:04:05.947
Listen, I wouldn't feel this wronged
if I'd been paid something.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:07.615
It was clearly a slush fund ledger.

01:04:07.698 --> 01:04:09.200
The president had passed away,

01:04:09.283 --> 01:04:11.577
so how could I return it not knowing
who'd sent it from the seventh floor?

01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:12.578
The seventh floor?

01:04:12.662 --> 01:04:13.913
Yes, the seventh floor.

01:04:13.996 --> 01:04:16.207
That's what the note on it said,

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.500
with no division name.

01:04:34.308 --> 01:04:35.518
Have a good day.

01:04:35.601 --> 01:04:36.560
You too.

01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:41.941
If it's the seventh floor,
it's either Trading, Research…

01:04:43.776 --> 01:04:45.194
or the Risk Management Division.

01:04:52.243 --> 01:04:54.078
What the hell is her deal?

01:05:02.253 --> 01:05:04.505
There's a dog sticker
in the bottom-right corner.

01:05:04.588 --> 01:05:06.173
I burned it up already.

01:05:06.674 --> 01:05:08.217
The president had passed away,

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.261
so how could I return it not knowing
who'd sent it from the seventh floor?

01:05:22.606 --> 01:05:23.566
Thank you.

01:05:26.152 --> 01:05:28.070
I'd like to ask
why you ran out this morning

01:05:28.154 --> 01:05:31.115
and what you're
agonizing over now, if possible.

01:05:36.579 --> 01:05:37.455
It's fine.

01:05:38.164 --> 01:05:39.707
After all, we're on the same team,

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:40.791
and we're partners.

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:42.585
I can wait.

01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:01.645
You let the slush fund ledger burn
before we even laid eyes on it?

01:06:01.729 --> 01:06:02.813
I'm sorry, sir.

01:06:02.897 --> 01:06:04.815
There's no point in postponing it.

01:06:04.899 --> 01:06:06.400
Resign and come back immediately!

01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:08.903
But at least we know now
that it came from the seventh--

01:06:18.162 --> 01:06:19.205

Hello, Yehppee. This is Hong Keum-bo.

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.060
In order to meet you in person,

01:06:41.143 --> 01:06:44.563
I've taken someone else's identity
to get a job in Hanmin.

01:06:45.064 --> 01:06:47.733
I heard that you also work
on the seventh floor.

01:06:47.817 --> 01:06:49.485
I'd like to meet you.

01:06:49.568 --> 01:06:50.861
I'll be awaiting your reply.

Hey, it's me.

01:07:52.423 --> 01:07:55.467
Can you look up a plate for me?

01:07:55.551 --> 01:07:59.096
"Seoul 1. B2727."

01:08:00.973 --> 01:08:01.807
Thanks.

Meet me at nine o'clock tonight,

01:08:36.675 --> 01:08:39.428
at the same place
you used to meet with President Kang.

01:08:56.487 --> 01:08:57.821
It's working fine.

01:08:57.905 --> 01:08:59.073
This needs your signature.

01:09:00.532 --> 01:09:03.994
No, "E" is the issue.
The "E" key isn't working.

01:09:04.578 --> 01:09:05.746
Pay attention.

01:09:06.538 --> 01:09:07.665
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:09:21.845 --> 01:09:23.931
CHA JUNG-IL, BANG JIN-MOK

01:09:36.318 --> 01:09:37.569
I'm on my way to meet Yehppee.

01:09:37.653 --> 01:09:39.029
I'll report back when I'm done.

01:09:42.241 --> 01:09:46.495
Hey, who the hell are you
to meddle in Go Bok-hee's family affairs?

01:09:47.204 --> 01:09:48.747
- Let go of me.
- Damn it.

01:09:55.254 --> 01:09:56.755
Why you little…

01:10:18.444 --> 01:10:21.655
I told you, he punched me.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.575
- Damn it.
- Get in there.

01:10:32.291 --> 01:10:33.292
Damn it.

01:11:17.086 --> 01:11:17.920
Yehppee?

01:11:21.298 --> 01:11:22.216
Over here!

01:11:25.177 --> 01:11:26.178
Yehp…

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:29.431
Wait. Wait a minute!

01:11:33.435 --> 01:11:34.269
Wait!

01:11:37.398 --> 01:11:39.149
One, two.

01:11:39.233 --> 01:11:40.192
Move!

01:11:40.275 --> 01:11:41.110
Come on.

01:11:53.122 --> 01:11:54.123
INVESTMENT TRUST PRODUCT

01:12:10.431 --> 01:12:11.765
I have no choice now.

01:12:12.266 --> 01:12:14.435
I'll just have to force an introduction.

01:12:18.647 --> 01:12:19.815
You're here early.

01:12:20.649 --> 01:12:22.401
Good morning.

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:24.445
Coffee, Mr. Bang?

01:12:24.528 --> 01:12:25.737
Thank you.

01:12:28.073 --> 01:12:30.701
By the way,
why did you run off last night?

01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:33.537
You made me run by the river
for quite some time.

01:12:34.455 --> 01:12:35.914
What are you talking about?

01:12:36.748 --> 01:12:38.167
I knew it was you.

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:40.878
Yehppee was able to keep his face hidden,

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.088
but he gave away something else.

01:12:49.219 --> 01:12:50.137
What?

01:12:50.637 --> 01:12:52.681
You already know, Yehppee.

01:12:53.474 --> 01:12:54.475
Hong Keum-bo.

01:13:50.948 --> 01:13:52.783
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:13:52.866 --> 01:13:54.493
{\an8}Who's that in the photo?

01:13:54.576 --> 01:13:55.702
{\an8}That's my eldest daughter.

01:13:58.872 --> 01:14:00.290
{\an8}Ms. Kim Mi-sook is the top salesperson.

01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:03.460
{\an8}Hong Keum-bo?
You'd better not mess up this time.

01:14:03.544 --> 01:14:06.588
{\an8}Something feels off with all of it.

01:14:06.672 --> 01:14:08.465
{\an8}You should take her back immediately.

01:14:08.549 --> 01:14:10.425
{\an8}So you knew about it going in.

01:14:10.509 --> 01:14:13.178
{\an8}Just hand over the materials,
and we'll take care of the rest.

01:14:13.262 --> 01:14:14.763
{\an8}An emergency executive meeting?

01:14:14.846 --> 01:14:17.057
{\an8}Did you call
the Ministry of Finance and Economy?

01:14:17.849 --> 01:14:19.434
{\an8}There's no issue
with the slush fund, is there?

01:14:19.518 --> 01:14:21.812
{\an8}Hey, Hong. We're in big trouble.

01:14:21.895 --> 01:14:24.064
{\an8}What are you doing here, Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

01:14:25.315 --> 01:14:30.320
