{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.520
Those kids are such a worry.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.840
This matter concerns me, after all.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.920
Don't blame yourself, Sister.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.280
I'll send someone
to find out what happened.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.600
CONSORT WEI

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.880
That's for the best.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.520
I'm just afraid that it might
tarnish Peiyi's reputation.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.640
May you be well, Your Highness.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.040
Peiyi.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.039
Come here.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.200
I rushed over upon hearing
what had happened

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.440
in the Cheng'en Palace.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.800
Cheng'en Palace was bestowed
upon Her Highness by His Majesty.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.840
It may be under renovation,
but it's her abode after all.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.200
Cheng'en Palace has seen so many accidents
since the work started.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.120
And now this happens?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.240
Why were you there?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.560
For Yushu's case?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.880
We found out that she had
been having an affair with someone

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.400
and meeting him at the Cheng'en Palace.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.960
It's a serious accusation.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.000
Do you have proof?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.600
The Palace Investigation Bureau

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.320
can't disclose
certain clues to Your Highness.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.240
I knew the Cheng'en Palace
had bad feng shui.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.360
I must implore His Majesty

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.240
to tear it down
and build a new palace over it.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.520
That's right.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.360
Lady Wang was seeing someone
in your palace

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.680
and kept close contact with you
before she passed away.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.080
I wonder why.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.040
Peiyi.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Cheng'en Palace is bestowed upon me.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.640
Naturally, I am to be suspected.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.840
If you have any questions,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.560
I will tell you everything I know.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.800
Since you don't mind it,
I will have someone look into it.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.040
Of course, I don't mind.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.720
It's just that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.520
people are spreading rumors.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.400
Like what?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.760
Just some rumors.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.640
Please, speak freely.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.640
Those senseless gossipers

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.560
say that you spent a night
with Xiao Huaijin

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.120
and that you two used Love Incense.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.000
You must be really worried about me
to ask in such detail.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.600
How dare they spread rumors
under our watch?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.160
They're courting death.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.120
Calm down, Sister.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200
I lost my judgment.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.080
I shouldn't have said that.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.920
Don't take it out on others.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.400
But our top priority right now

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.840
is to protect Peiyi's reputation.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.240
We must stop the rumors.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.720
What do you think we should do, Sister?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.240
I haven't got a clue, either.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.120
But I think you should
keep her here for a few days.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.240
At this point,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.960
she'd better lie low
to avoid negative attention.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.000
I don't know if your advice
helps avoid negative attention,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.280
but it certainly makes Peiyi look guilty
for what she didn't do.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.240
She may not be my own daughter,
but I brought her up.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.120
His Majesty has never denied her anything,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.840
even if she wanted the stars.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.520
Why would she date a man in secret?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.600
That's right.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.080
I knew something was strange.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.200
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.320
I'm just worried…

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.440
Seeing that Peiyi is alright,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.920
I can be relieved.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.520
Sister.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.120
I will take my leave now.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.200
Thank you for defending me, Your Highness.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.000
Silly girl.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.440
You can mess around any other time,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.040
but how are you going
to clean up this mess?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.720
Someone knew that we'd investigate
the Cheng'en Palace

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.760
and drugged us.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.320
Well,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.240
did anything go wrong?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.200
Of course not.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.760
His Majesty and I
don't like you investigating cases.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.240
Now that such a scandal has arisen,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.160
no one cares about the truth anymore.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.320
They'll just spread rumors
to fuel the gossip.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.680
Just let them be.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.320
Nonsense.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.920
You are the daughter of the Li family.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.680
It's not just about you.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.600
It concerns the entire royal clan.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.200
You can't get out of this with a little
sweet-talk and puppy-dog eyes.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.320
His Majesty sent you to me.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.840
It means he already knows
and wants me to handle it.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.960
If I don't handle it well,
he will come forward himself.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.400
What are your plans?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.480
I'll ask His Majesty
to marry you to Xiao Huaijin.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.800
I know you're reluctant.
But there's no other way.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.800
After the wedding,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.040
can I keep investigating cases
with Mr. Xiao?

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.560
You're still thinking about
investigating cases?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.440
I don't care about the gossip.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.680
But it bothers you and His Majesty.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.560
And I hate to see that.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.240
If a wedding can solve the problem,
I will do as you say.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.440
Once it's settled,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.120
I'll go back to investigating cases
just like before.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.039
Why not?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.480
Look at you.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.919
You can be so cold and yet so warm.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.840
I've raised you for 15 years,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.680
but I am not your mother, after all.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.040
I don't really understand you.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.040
But I know that you are kind to me.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.640
I will talk to His Majesty
about the wedding.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.320
Go ahead and do your job.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.160
Doesn't Consort Wei have a son?

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.600
Yes. Prince of Xin, Li Zheng.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.200
A year ago, he asked for permission

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.600
to renovate the Cheng'en Palace
to show filial piety.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.320
So he is allowed to enter the palace?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.760
That's right.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.440
I know you're the best.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.840
Your Ladyship. How did it go?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.360
Investigate Prince of Xin.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.920
He might have been
the one meeting Yushu in secret.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.360
I'm asking about you and Mr. Xiao.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.880
Problem solved.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.840
Consort Shu will marry us.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.240
How did that happen?

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.800
Mr. Xiao is such a decent man…

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.240
We're a perfect match.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040
So what are we doing?

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.680
Let's save Mr. Xiao.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.200
I told you to stay away from Li Peiyi.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280
But you wouldn't listen.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.600
Now you're even caught up in a scandal.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.720
You've tarnished the reputation
of the entire clan.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.840
We were investigating the case
and got set up.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.080
As a man,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.720
my top concern right now
is to defend Her Ladyship's reputation.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.480
The Xiao clan's reputation
is out of my concern.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.200
What's so special about her?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.280
Why do you have to meddle with her?

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.520
I also want to know
what's so special about her

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.280
that terrifies you so much.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.960
I'm just worried that you might
get yourself killed

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.320
and drag our entire Xiao family
down with you.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.200
I said we were set up. Do you believe me?

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.760
I said we were innocent.
Do you believe me?

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.360
Does my opinion matter?

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.440
Do the maids and eunuchs believe you?

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.760
Do the court officials believe you?

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.920
Does His Majesty believe you?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.280
Those people set you up

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.480
because such a scandal
is a deadly crime for you,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.800
even if you have done nothing wrong.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.440
It doesn't matter what you did.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.040
What matters is what His Majesty believes.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.000
Then I will explain to His Majesty.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.440
What if he doesn't believe you?

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.960
Then I'll talk to Her Ladyship.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.480
If she agrees, I will ask
His Majesty to marry her to me.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.520
If she disagrees,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.560
I will kill myself to prove her innocence.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.920
Don't you dare!

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.560
Huaijin.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.880
Why wouldn't I dare?

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.520
Y-You rebellious child!

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.040
Stop it.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.480
- You…
- I might as well kill you

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.560
lest you implicate the whole family.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.240
That's enough. Stop it.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.600
Since you see me as such an eyesore,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.560
I'll just leave.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.880
Guards.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.120
Stop him.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.960
He is not allowed to leave.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.360
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.160
Her Ladyship is here.
We couldn't stop her.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.200
She's in the main hall.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.440
So shameless.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.440
So shameless.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.520
Your Ladyship. What brings you here?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.520
The case is still unsettled.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.440
I'm getting my partner back to work.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.480
My son is still ill

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.480
and needs some time off to rest.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.760
Let me check on him.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.680
He is too ill to see you.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.800
I know medicine fairly well.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.760
Let me see what I can do for him.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.520
Your Ladyship.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.680
Do you know what is going on right now?

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.680
The gossip has spread all over the court.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.320
Shouldn't you stay away from my son?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.440
If people find out
that you came to my mansion,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.400
Your Ladyship, what will they say
about the royal family

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.960
and the Xiao family?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.040
Don't worry, Grand Tutor.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.480
Consort Shu will ask His Majesty
to marry me to Mr. Xiao.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.880
We won't have to avoid each other.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.480
And you can set your mind at rest.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.560
Your Ladyship has always acted
with absolute freedom,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.520
but… but marriage
is not to be treated lightly.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.120
Are you displeased with me
or my family background?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200
Your Ladyship, please withdraw
this false accusation.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.360
So you know how it feels to be framed.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.480
Someone set us up.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.360
Why are you so furious?

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.160
I implore Your Ladyship
to let go of Huaijin

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.600
and the Xiao family.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.040
So you are asking me for a favor.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.360
Then let's sit down and talk.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.720
What are you hiding
about the massacre 15 years ago?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.520
I will never forget the smell on Mr. Xiao.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.800
I smelled it when my family was wiped out
15 years ago.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.600
Your wife and your son both say

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.720
that she personally blended that incense.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.120
So someone from your family
was present that night.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.880
You smelled it more than ten years ago.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.440
Your Ladyship is too arbitrary.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.960
It's even a bit ridiculous.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.520
I know it's not evidence.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.320
But I know I'm right.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.600
The person knows, too.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.560
I may remember the smell wrong,

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.240
but I can't be wrong
about my fall into the water.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.720
Xiao Huaijin wasn't the only one
who saved me that day.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.120
I've been through too much as a child
to remember everything.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.520
But after meeting Mr. Xiao,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.360
my broken memories
started piecing together.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.400
I actually recalled a few things.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.280
Speaking of which,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.080
Grand Tutor Xiao, you are my savior.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.600
What are you trying to say?

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.880
I'm trying to say
that Mr. Xiao and Consort Shu

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.880
both told me stories not quite consistent

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.560
with the truth about how I was rescued.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.120
Mr. Xiao was young at that time.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.600
I don't know if he is confused
or trying to hide something.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.080
But I'm sure that you know something.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.240
You're hiding the truth
for certain purposes.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.760
I don't remember anymore.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.280
Let's say I saved you.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.200
Then you should show gratitude,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.760
instead of giving us a hard time.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.800
Compared to the indisputable fact
of my family's destruction,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.440
this story may seem alright,
but it's riddled with holes.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.080
More coincidentally,
it's also related to the Xiao family.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.800
If Your Ladyship insists on accusing us
of something we didn't do

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.480
out of your speculation,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.360
I have nothing to say.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.360
I'll have to seek justice
from His Majesty.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040
It's alright.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.880
I have plenty of time.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.680
As long as Mr. Xiao stays by my side,
I'll remember everything.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.160
You've been using Huaijin
from the beginning?

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.079
So what?

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.040
The Xiao family and I
are in the same boat.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.800
You can stay silent.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.359
But get ready to be pestered
for the rest of your life.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.280
Once I marry your son,
I will ask to live in the Xiao's Mansion.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.160
Don't even dream about running away.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.640
You…

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.080
You…

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.680
Your Ladyship doesn't have to threaten me.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.080
I said I don't remember anything.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.560
So the person who killed my family
terrifies you, too.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.720
Only a handful of people can do that
throughout the entire court.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.080
I'll look into them one by one
and find the culprit.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.200
But until I do,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.600
I'm afraid that you'll have
to accept me as your daughter-in-law.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.160
I will do everything I can to stop you
from marrying my son.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720
At worst…

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.320
At worst, I'll retire
and take Huaijin back to our hometown

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.520
rather than let him marry you.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.200
Y-You are a cursed lone star.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.960
Do you really think
these words can hurt me?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.480
If you leave right now,
don't even think about coming back!

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.160
I will wait for you to change your mind.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.280
- What's wrong?
- It's swollen.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.520
It's alright.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.840
Put some medicine.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.160
Leave before my father changes his mind.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.960
You looked truly imposing
when you barged in.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.040
You flatter me.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.200
How long have you been standing there?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920
I just came.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.600
You heard me arguing with your father?

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.600
Yes.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.840
He said he'd never let you marry me

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.200
and insulted you
by calling you a cursed lone star.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.080
What else?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.040
What else?

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.640
What else do I need to hear?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.080
Nothing.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.120
I'll take responsibility
for what happened last night.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.320
Don't take it to heart, Mr. Xiao.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.440
I know you don't care about this.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.120
But I do.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.040
I asked you to investigate the case
and got you implicated.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.240
How can I drag you into more trouble?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.960
It's not trouble.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.720
If anything, I'll be marrying up.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.400
No matter what you plan to do,

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.920
this is my promise.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.360
But I will act along
if you have other plans.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.400
Before His Majesty summons us,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.000
let's find the culprit.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.680
You've been using Huaijin
from the beginning?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.680
So what?

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.240
Inspector Du wrote back.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.600
It took him
a lot of work to look these up.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.360
This is the Yuhua Stone from Jinling.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.080
This is a unique spiral shell
along the Penglai Coast.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.040
Here is the gravel of Yangguan.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.760
This is a stalactite from Lianzhou.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.240
And

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.680
this dried leaf that breaks at touch

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.360
comes from a tree only found in Shazhou,
called Ghost Clapping Hands.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.920
These things come from all over the world.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.520
They are not particularly valuable.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.360
I don't know why Lady Wang

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.240
was crying and laughing
while checking them.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.120
Because she could
no longer fulfill her dream

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.280
of seeing the world.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.600
Have you inspected the pill
found in her sachet?

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.680
It's indeed the Breath-Stopping Pill.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.240
But the ingredients
are slightly different.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.120
Lady Wang was poisoned
when she was pregnant.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.520
Was the Breath-Stopping Pill
also from the killer?

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.120
No.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.400
The killer poisoned her pregnancy tonic.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.520
Why bother using the Breath-Stopping Pill?

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.440
Too troublesome.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.240
This Breath-Stopping Pill
was sewn on the inside of her sachet.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.680
Maybe she prepared it herself.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.440
She wanted to fake her own death
to leave the palace.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.880
Could it be

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.320
that she was seeing Prince of Xin
and got pregnant?

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.280
So she decided to fake her death
and leave with him?

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.880
Let's talk to him.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.680
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.640
I also found something.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.960
The Mortuary Hall is huge.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.280
It took me quite some time
to find this basket.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.920
Look.
Baskets made of rattan are rare to find.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.560
I looked into it. Annan's specialty.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.160
Well done. Thanks.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.160
Your Ladyship.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.720
Can I join you on this trip
outside the palace?

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.480
No.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.680
Understood.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.800
Let's go.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.240
Mr. Xiao.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.480
The three of us will make it
look like an interrogation.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.240
Prince of Xin may not speak.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.760
I'll check why the renovation stopped.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.880
Boss.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.240
What's wrong with you two?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.360
I sensed something weird.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.680
Nothing.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.880
He is right.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.320
Splitting up is more efficient.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.880
Something is wrong.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.520
The two of us
can get confessions out of anyone.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.520
The three of us always
investigate together.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.800
Why are we suddenly splitting up today?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.000
He's avoiding you?

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.760
I bet that's why.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.280
He heard about the engagement?

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.880
Yes.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.440
That makes no sense.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.880
Why is he avoiding you, then?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.640
He's shy?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.880
No, no.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.520
He didn't look shy.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.320
Instead,

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.400
he was a bit angry.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.240
He insulted you

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.360
by calling you a cursed lone star.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.240
What else?

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.200
What else?

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.920
What else do I need to hear?

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.440
You've been using Huaijin
from the beginning?

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.120
So what?

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.520
Maybe he was angry.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.840
I got it.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.080
He didn't want to investigate with us,
not because of you,

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680
but me.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.720
I'm the one who should leave.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800
He was giving me a hint.
But I didn't get it.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.520
I'll get him back now.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.520
Enough.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.840
Stop guessing.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.240
Save your brain for the investigation.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.960
Yushu was really lucky
to have a friend like you.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.120
When Yushu was here in the Music Office,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.720
we drank with Prince of Xin
and played music.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.360
What a pleasure.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.560
Now, Yushu is gone,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.040
and His Highness stopped coming.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.760
PRINCE OF XIN'S MANSION

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.560
PRINCE OF XIN, LI ZHENG

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.880
It's been so long.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.560
You're playing the ruan even better.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.200
I never know whether to believe
your words or not.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.280
When the last string is plucked,
the feeling knows no end.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.320
If the player is full of passion,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.160
it can compensate
for a less refined technique.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.160
Sure enough, it's a mockery.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.400
Interesting sachet.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.320
Show me.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.200
The little pocket is for the plectrum?

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.120
That's right.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.360
Lady Wang gave it to me.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.560
She was good at playing the ruan,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.080
so she made a sachet
that carries a plectrum.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.560
I was jealous and asked for one.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.600
I didn't know you were so close.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.080
I assume you came to ask about her.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.200
Back in the Music Office,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.800
we bonded over our passion
for playing the ruan.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.200
She was a musician at that time.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.160
We were like-minded and became friends.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.400
She was gifted.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.200
Unfortunately, she died too young.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.440
If she hadn't become Father's woman,

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.200
she could have achieved something.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.840
Is that what she thought?

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.480
I misspoke.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.720
Have you fallen for her?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.480
We held different statuses.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I admired her.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.200
Your Highness.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.560
JINGHE, PRINCE OF XIN'S CONCUBINE

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.000
Freshly made fried dough twist.
Have a bite.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.720
They're crisp and tasty.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.960
It's really refreshing
with the cane juice.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.400
Please try it.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.400
I went out to investigate a case

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.480
and bought something fancy.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.960
Want to try it?

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040
What is it?

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.280
Special color.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.640
Is it spicy?

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800
Try it.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.040
Jinghe.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.040
What happened?

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.880
Forgive me. I was so clumsy.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.800
I disturbed you and Her Ladyship.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.920
Raise your head.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.520
You look familiar.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.520
Were you a palace maid?

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.640
She used to serve my mother.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.520
My mother trusted her.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.720
A while ago,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.760
Father ordered
the dismissal of the palace maids.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.800
Mother sent her here to be my concubine.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.960
Your Highness, forgive me.
I just wanted to serve you another drink.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.160
I was too careless.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.080
You were quite agile.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.960
What a lovely tray.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.560
Jinghe.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.480
What happened?

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.720
It looks like you don't want us
to have the fried dough twists.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.640
Is that so?

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.880
What's wrong with the dough twists?

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.120
Or do you think

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.880
there is something wrong with this powder?

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.920
Forgive me, Your Ladyship.
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.680
Jinghe…

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.880
Isn't this just rose powder?

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.480
Jinghe has given herself away.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.880
A little interrogation will make her talk.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.080
She might be timid, but she dares to die.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.600
She will die if she confesses.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.440
She's not the mastermind.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.720
Pushing too hard might cause trouble.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.040
What about Prince of Xin?

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.280
Judging from his reaction,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.640
I can't tell whether he's clueless
or an excellent actor.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.320
Go to the Music Office.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.120
Lady Wang was quite arrogant
when she was here.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.040
She was not so close
to any musicians except for Ahao.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.400
Was she acquainted
with people outside the Music Office?

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120
Prince of Xin.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.600
He was a frequent visitor here.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.720
He was the only one she knew
outside the Music Office.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.680
He is humble and gentle
and never puts on airs.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.120
And he's an expert in music.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.240
We get along like friends.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.400
But still,
he was the closest to Lady Wang.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.760
Every time they met,
they could talk forever.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.520
He also enjoyed Lady Wang's ruan music.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.040
Has he come here these days?

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.760
Ahao and I were just saying

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.280
that His Highness
hasn't come for a long time.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.160
Where is Ahao?

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.480
I think she went to buy strings.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.200
She is responsible
for the purchase outside the palace.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.520
Does she need to bring a pipa?

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.760
Take some people
to Prince of Xin's Mansion.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.920
Understood.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.320
Mr. Jin.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.360
Long time no see. Please rise.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.080
You haven't visited us for quite a while.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.840
I came out to buy strings

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.200
and decided to come and play
Crossing a Thousand Mountains.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.120
I haven't listened to it

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.840
for a long time.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.280
Please.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.840
PRINCE OF XIN'S MANSION

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160
- Your Ladyship.
- Any news?

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.160
The renovation stopped
because a rumor said there were ghosts.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.560
The rumor spread exactly two months ago.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.960
A chilly midnight tune

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.120
Brings back distant memories

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.800
Once, I played in harmony with you

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.440
The melody resonated across the land

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.560
Jinghe.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.440
Bring me my ruan.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.640
Understood.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.840
Mr. Jin, you played it wrong.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.240
Yushu would be upset.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.120
Lady Wang…

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.400
Lady Wang would be upset.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.440
Ahao, don't.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.320
Yushu died because of you.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.600
Your Highness.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.679
Your Highness.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.120
Get a Medical Officer.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880
Your Ladyship.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.199
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.080
It's hard to walk at night.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.320
Be careful where you step.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.800
Don't sprain your ankle like His Highness.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.360
Understood. Rest assured, Your Ladyship.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.480
His Highness sprained his ankle.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.840
He will be fine in a few days.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.040
Please go back and complete the record.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.960
If you make a mistake…

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:55.719
Rest assured, Your Ladyship.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.800
I will definitely record
His Highness's sprain in detail,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.840
without mistakes.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.880
Yushu.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.760
I got your revenge.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.200
Ahao.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.040
I didn't realize it was him.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.200
His Highness was nice to everyone
in the Music Office.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.560
I thought he simply appreciated
Yushu's talent.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.360
But then I realized

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.280
that he never visited after Yushu
was made the Selected Lady.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.880
I finally realized how stupid I was.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.800
I heard that you two were looking
into the Cheng'en Palace

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.840
renovated by Prince of Xin.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.840
I panicked.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.520
Then I saw this sachet.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.080
He called her "Yushu".

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.800
Who gave him the right to call her that?

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.720
He spoke such high-sounding words
of admiring Yushu's talent

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.040
and showed her every courtesy.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.520
But he also made her pregnant

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.400
and got her killed.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.360
Consort Wei is here.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.480
Mr. Xiao, keep her there.
I'll be there soon.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:46.880
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.880
It's all my fault.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.280
I made His Highness suffer.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.120
Don't blame yourself.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.640
Everyone makes mistakes.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.000
I, Xiao Huaijin, Deputy Director
of the Astronomical Bureau,

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.080
pay respects to Your Highness.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.520
I've long heard that a talented astronomer

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.680
was assisting
the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.800
But right now, you're not the one
I want to see.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.200
Have you checked on Prince of Xin?

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.520
Where is that woman?

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.200
The assassin has been imprisoned.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.840
That's all?

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.640
She went after the prince
and should be executed on the spot.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.600
The law will decide what to do
with the musician.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.120
But right now,

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.400
your top priority is to decide
whether to look into it.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.120
She injured the prince.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.280
How could you let her go?

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.640
Of course not.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.200
The assassination is easy to investigate.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.200
I will definitely find out the truth
for you and Prince of Xin.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.040
But now, I have another account to settle.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.840
I'd like to demand
an explanation from you.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.240
Do you recognize this?

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.040
What are you implying?

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.040
Just say it.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.520
So you recognized it.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.400
It's just a candle.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.560
How can you tell with a glance
that it's from your Cheng'en Palace?

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.960
I bet it's due to the powder
in the candle.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.480
These are love drugs.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.840
Mr. Xiao and I fell victim that night.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.600
What do you have to say about this?

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.160
The Cheng'en Palace indeed is mine.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.920
But I haven't moved in yet.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.800
You can't hold me accountable

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.640
for the candles in the palace.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.800
If you had been more cautious,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.200
I would be helpless.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.200
Unfortunately, you were too careless.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.960
While adding powders to the wax solution,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.400
you left us some clues.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.760
You're confusing me.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.080
I don't understand.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.200
You were too impatient.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.200
The powders and wax solution
may not be linked to you.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.520
But as a high-ranking concubine,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.520
you weren't familiar with the menial job
of reshaping candles.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.600
When the candle is demolded
before it's solidified,

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.360
it captures people's fingerprints.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.080
Fingerprints are unique.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.800
To leave your fingerprints

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.080
is just like carving your name
on the candles.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.280
There were two candles in that room.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.800
Our people have already
collected all the fingerprints.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.160
It's not so difficult to look into it.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.720
Mr. Xiao is good at this. It will be fast.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.480
Since I promised to cooperate,

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.760
I won't go back on my word.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.840
Of course, you wouldn't
do this menial job in person.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.920
You would find a trustworthy person
to do it for you.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.160
My four close confidants
are right outside.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.360
Feel free to investigate.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.520
It's just 40 fingerprints.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.720
Mr. Xiao. It's nothing difficult, right?

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.720
I just need to check
one person's fingerprints.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.720
That person can enter
and leave the palace at will

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.080
without arousing suspicion.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.920
And that person

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.000
has your full trust.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.520
I did promise you

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.000
to cooperate
and tell you everything I know

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.440
if you want to investigate my people.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.000
If Your Ladyship finds Jinghe suspicious,

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.440
I won't stop your investigation.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.640
Jinghe.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.440
You've been with me for so many years.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.360
Women of Yuqing Palace
are highly responsible.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.200
Don't let me down.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.320
I prepared these candles.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.320
I await my punishment.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.880
You wanted to cover up
the scandal for Prince of Xin,

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.440
but ended up confirming it.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.040
Not only that,

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.000
but you also found me a great husband.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.560
Why should I punish you?

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.960
I must thank you instead.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.640
I…

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.920
That's right.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.880
I was worried that you'd discover
the affair between Lady Wang

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.240
and His Highness.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.000
But I was too stupid and implicated him.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.880
No.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.600
You admired Prince of Xin
and tried to protect him.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480
Without you,

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.120
his secret love affair with Lady Wang
could have been exposed long ago.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.440
His Highness is a good man.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.920
He is so kind to us.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.160
He never looked down on me
because I was a palace maid.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.000
I secretly admired him.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.000
But I knew

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.440
such admiration could't lead anywhere.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.960
Your Highness.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:35.280
I knew I shouldn't have followed him.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.160
But at that moment,
I couldn't help myself.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.960
He seemed to be in a hurry

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.920
and didn't notice
that I was following him.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.240
You recognized her?

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.120
She was the Selected Lady

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.560
appointed by His Majesty.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.240
Ruan player from the Music Office,

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.480
Wang Yushu.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.800
After that night,

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.160
I realized that His Highness
had been staying more in the palace.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.360
He would go out
almost every night to see Lady Wang.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.080
I was worried that he would be caught

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.400
and resented him for doing that.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.480
Apart from him and Lady Wang,

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.200
I had also been keeping this secret.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.680
Whenever he went out on a date,

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.920
I'd wait for him at the side door

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.120
so that I could alert them
if anyone found out.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.520
Once I heard
the door closing after midnight,

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.040
I would go back to my room.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.120
His Highness didn't know

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.640
that I was the most worried
about his secret love affair.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.720
But you did not stop him.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.240
I…

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.400
I didn't know what to say.

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.040
I didn't dare.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.760
I was worried that he would avoid me
if I talked to him about it.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.840
Then I wouldn't be able to protect him.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.760
I was more than grateful

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.400
that the first person
to know about it was me.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.920
His Highness became increasingly reckless.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.800
I was worried about him
and had to do something.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.360
So you decided to kill Lady Wang.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.680
Why not?

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.840
Could I stop His Highness from seeing her?

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.160
Or could I stop Lady Wang
from pestering His Highness?

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.840
Killing her was the simplest

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.080
and best solution.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.240
It might have been the best solution
if it were so simple.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.120
But you were a petty palace maid

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.320
who couldn't even speak with Lady Wang.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.280
How did you manage to poison
the decoction she had every day?

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.200
If you truly love someone enough

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.920
to give everything,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.880
then you are capable of anything.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.680
His Majesty was sending people away.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.560
So I begged Consort Wei

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.400
to send me out of the Yuqing Palace
to serve His Highness.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.080
I didn't think about it.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.960
Jinghe had served me for years.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.040
She was very considerate.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.760
I was sure she could take care of Zheng.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.160
And I liked her.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.640
So I made her Zheng's concubine.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.600
Although you stayed by his side,

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.080
you couldn't stop him
from meeting Lady Wang.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.640
I couldn't stop him
from meeting Lady Wang.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.960
But I found that
they weren't just meeting up.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.800
They were conspiring.
