(I once)

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.180
(had a dream,)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.540
(A dream...)

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.780
(That left me shaken to my core.)

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.940
(In it,)

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.820
(the one I had been waiting for)

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.900
(finally returned,)

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.539
(yet their gender was unclear,)

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.260
(shrouded in mystery,)

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.540
(You and I)

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.499
(have struggled too long)

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.340
(in the snares of hatred.)

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.660
(Now,)

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.580
(here in this palace hall...)

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.940
(We find our release at last.)

=Episode 1=

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.979
By imperial decree,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.260
(10 years ago, 22nd year of Chengshun Reign)
Crown Prince Chu Ying is summoned!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.020
(That year,)

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.740
(I lost my mother.)

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.220
(My father, the Emperor, a man I had never met
summoned me to the palace.)

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.740
(But all I saw)

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.620
(was a distant, blurred silhouette,)

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.340
(and beside it,)

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.660
(a woman with the eyes of a wolf.)

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.820
Greetings, Father and Mother.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.140
Your father

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.740
is asleep.

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:34.132
(Consort Sheng)

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.380
Come here.

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:42.345
(Chu Ying)

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.700
Poor little thing.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.260
Eat.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.340
I'm not hungry.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.700
Then...

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.740
Eat this.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.700
You won't eat anything.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.259
If word gets out,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.179
people will think I'm abusing you.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.300
Eat it!

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.060
Eat it!

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.580
I should take my leave.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.299
That ungrateful brat.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.059
Your Highness, the Crown Prince might've found
out the truth about his birth mother's death.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.019
If he one day

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.940
truly ascends the throne,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.300
he might...

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.740
Shut

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.980
up.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.939
Yes, Your Highness.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.099
Please calm down.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.820
I'm sorry.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.380
Issue my order.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.060
The Crown Prince is being insolent.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.140
From now on, other than me,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.140
no one is permitted to give him food.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.660
Anyone who disobeys

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.180
will be flogged to death.

00:04:20.925 --> 00:04:21.939
Mother,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.380
I'm starving.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.539
(What's that smell?)

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.780
(It smells so good.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.182
(Xiao Man)

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.140
(Chicken leg)

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.579
Where did you come from, little eunuch?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.139
How dare you

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.060
try to sneak palace property
out in the dead of night!

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.859
I...

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.419
I...

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.739
Please don't report me.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.979
I was just bringing food
to Little Flower.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.140
Food?

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.540
Give it to me.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.660
You can take it.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.460
You poor thing.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.059
To think there's someone in the palace
who starves.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Mmm...

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.620
Delicious.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.940
So,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.940
who is Little Flower?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.979
Why are you bringing her food?

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.219
Little Flower?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.179
Oh, she's my dog.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.780
I keep her here in the palace.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.819
What's wrong?

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.179
Are you choking?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.099
Which palace are you from?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.820
And what are you doing out here so late?

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.259
You

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.100
don't know who I am?

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.739
This is Little Flower.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.020
Say hello.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.979
Woof, woof.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.979
Don't be scared. It won't bite.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.059
You can come find me tomorrow.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.539
I'll bring more food for
you and Little Flower.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.059
By the way,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.499
my name is Xiao Man.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.859
What's yours?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.859
My...

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.020
My name...

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.299
I can't tell you.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.979
Alright.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.420
I'll just call you
Big Flower from now on.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.819
First you feed me dog food,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.220
now you're naming me after a dog?

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.060
Well, you won't tell me who you are.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.740
The performers from the
Imperial Music Office are rehearsing.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.179
You look so sad.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.899
Here, let me teach you how to dance.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.699
No.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.499
I don't know

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.980
how to dance.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.620
Come on, try it.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.900
Give me your hand.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.300
Just follow me.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.060
Lift it up.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.980
And down.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.220
And turn.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.979
No.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.500
Turn this way.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.860
Come.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.140
Hold my hand.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.619
Whenever I'm sad,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.179
I dance.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.179
As long as I'm dancing,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.260
all my worries just float away.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.059
See?

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.139
It doesn't matter if you're any good.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.379
What matters is being happy.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.739
I'll remember that.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.019
Being good at it doesn't matter,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.379
being happy does.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.100
Dancing makes you happy.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.379
It's too late.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.699
I have to go back.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.659
See you tomorrow,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.700
Big Flower.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.219
You have to come tomorrow, okay?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.459
I'll be waiting for you.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.300
I will. I promise.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.299
Let's dance again tomorrow.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.300
Woof!

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.500
Mm.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.940
(His Majesty has passed away!)

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.139
The late Emperor has passed,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.899
returning to the Five Elements.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.899
(By the grace of Heaven)

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.380
(and the great legacy
of the former sages,)

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.339
(I, in accordance with the final
decree of the late Emperor,)

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.339
(hereby ascend the imperial throne.)

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.659
(The coming year)

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.840
(shall be proclaimed the first year
of Hongzheng Reign.)

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.920
(A general amnesty is hereby
proclaimed throughout the land,)

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.700
(that we may make a new beginning
with the people. So decreed.)

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.836
(Sun Gong, Minister of War)

00:08:48.837 --> 00:08:51.320
(He Yi, Minister of Rites)

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.539
His Majesty is still young,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.179
and affairs of state are heavy.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.659
For the time being,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.739
I shall oversee

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.740
the court's administration for him.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.820
Wait.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.395
(Chu Wuju, Grand Princess)

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.059
How dare you storm the hall

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.899
with soldiers on His Majesty's
accession, Grand Princess!

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.179
Are you attempting a rebellion?

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.940
Consort Sheng, you've poisoned
the inner palace for so long.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.779
For years, you murdered
pregnant consorts

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.500
and many of the late Emperor's heirs.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.739
If palace attendants
hadn't shielded him,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.700
the new Emperor would
have died long ago.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.979
And now,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.340
you wish to become another Empress Wu?

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.880
Seize her!

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.379
Don't you dare!

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:11.739
Yes, Your Highness!

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.320
I am the Noble Consort personally
appointed by the late Emperor.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.500
Who dares to touch me?

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.899
I have served His Majesty

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.339
since he was seven,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.939
weathered countless storms at his side.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.060
Without me,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.660
there would be no Great Qian
as it stands today!

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.260
The late Emperor has
barely been laid to rest,

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.579
and you dare humiliate me

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.739
before the new ruler?!

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.620
If you raise your voice one more time,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.379
I will have your head

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.300
mounted on the gates

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.740
as a gift

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.580
to celebrate the new reign.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.979
Chu Wuju,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.219
you really think
you'll gain control of the court

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.940
by dragging me down?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.660
The throne belongs to that boy.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.020
When his wings are fully grown,

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.980
what happened to me today

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.836
will happen to you one day.

00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:06.299
You and your husband

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.660
will share my fate in the end.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.500
Ungrateful brat!

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.540
Do you dare sit on that throne?

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.459
The moment you do,

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.419
you'll be alone for life,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.579
walking on thin ice.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.780
Take her away.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.819
Await execution.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.060
You will die upon that throne!

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.300
You will die upon that throne!

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.300
You will die upon that throne!

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.779
You will die

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.220
upon that throne!

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.780
Young emperor,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.659
starting today,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.860
I will be overseeing
the court's administration.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.020
Well?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.420
What's wrong, young emperor?

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.820
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.659
You look so sad.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.699
Here, let me teach you how to dance.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.340
Come on, try it.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.859
See?

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.899
It doesn't matter if you're any good.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.499
What matters is being happy.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.859
I'll remember that.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.139
Being good at it doesn't matter,

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.459
being happy does.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.220
Dancing makes you happy.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.459
You got rid of the bad person, Aunt.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.580
I'm happy.
