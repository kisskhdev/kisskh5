{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:35.545
Only then

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.345
can you heal more illnesses
and save more lives.

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:42.585
So your talent and benevolence
won't be wasted.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:47.785
So, I will do my best

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:52.825
to eradicate all the obstacles for you.

00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:01.625
Song Huaiyou was the second person
Pei Yu killed for you.

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:04.345
The prescription
made him realize that it was you

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:05.905
who dissected the bodies.

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:11.105
The symptoms of inner dampness

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:13.025
only surface in the end.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:15.305
It can't be diagnosed through observation,
listening, and smelling.

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:18.985
It was you.

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:29.465
Come here.

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:33.025
Tell me.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.785
You went to the mortuary?

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:40.545
You…

00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:43.225
What did you do?

00:02:48.865 --> 00:02:51.145
Tomorrow morning,
the mortuary carriage will leave.

00:02:51.225 --> 00:02:52.105
Hop on and run away.

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:53.105
Why?

00:02:53.825 --> 00:02:56.265
Why? Unauthorized autopsy
is a capital offense.

00:02:56.345 --> 00:02:58.665
Once discovered,
both of us will be executed.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.705
I did that to save people.

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:01.665
What did I do wrong?

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.545
Besides, I was very careful.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:05.585
They won't find out.

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:08.145
I don't have time for this.

00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:11.265
To stay alive,

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.785
you have to go.

00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:22.025
But promise me
you'll try this prescription.

00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:24.345
How dare you mention the prescription?

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:25.385
Physician Song.

00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:30.705
Stay in the dispensary. Don't go anywhere.

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:32.945
Tomorrow morning, I'll pick you up.

00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:37.305
Master.

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:39.065
FOOD DELIVERY RECORD
OF IMPERIAL FOOD SERVICE

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:44.345
This is what Physician Song
had for dinner that night.

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:45.425
Lamb noodle soup.

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.585
{\an8}Dang Gui, jujube,
and donkey-hide gelatin paste.

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:51.385
When these ingredients are combined,
they can disrupt the flow of energy

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:52.985
and blood circulation.

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:55.505
Coupled with emotional agitation,

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:57.465
it could induce a stroke.

00:03:58.625 --> 00:04:02.025
After Physician Song consumed
the specially prepared food,

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:04.905
Pei Yu waited to show up
during his eye-steaming treatment.

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:07.465
He revealed his identity
and warned to ruin everyone

00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:10.745
if Physician Song tried to send you away.

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:13.265
Physician Song was overwhelmed with fury.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:16.425
The acute stroke rendered him powerless.

00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:17.985
Pei Yu dragged him to the table

00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:20.825
and submerged his face in the water,

00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:23.705
creating the false appearance

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:25.705
that he died by accident.

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:30.145
It's all my fault.

00:04:33.905 --> 00:04:35.385
It's all my fault.

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.545
Why did you kill him?

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:43.705
I said

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:48.145
I won't let anyone stand in your way.

00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:51.385
But he was my master.

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.425
Did you forget what you want to do?

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:55.345
If you don't want him to die in vain,

00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.105
take this opportunity.

00:04:57.185 --> 00:05:00.225
Put your prescription into use
and impress His Majesty.

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:04.625
You are the best physician.

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:07.865
I won't let anyone get in your way.

00:05:12.105 --> 00:05:13.065
You should go back.

00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:28.145
You will soon have a chance to shine.

00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:36.825
After he killed Master,

00:05:37.425 --> 00:05:39.585
I was determined not to see him again.

00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:42.425
But he did not stop.

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:44.545
Huang Futong was killed.

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:46.625
He did what he promised.

00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:49.225
No one stood in my way anymore.

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:52.825
But I just couldn't develop
a new prescription.

00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:55.625
I sneaked to the mortuary late at night

00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.385
when the guards were away
and cut open the body

00:05:58.465 --> 00:05:59.705
to look for the focus.

00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:04.625
But there was no progress.

00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:09.265
Until…

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:15.465
Let me out.

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:23.065
More people are getting infected.

00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:25.345
Having trouble with the new prescription?

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:28.305
You don't care about people's lives.

00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:30.625
Why care about the prescription?

00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:34.185
If you want to kill someone, just kill me.

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:35.585
You sneaked into the mortuary

00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:37.705
to check those bodies, right?

00:06:57.985 --> 00:06:59.865
Nice sunshine.

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:06.905
You got infected?

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:13.745
Is it too late?

00:07:13.825 --> 00:07:14.945
What?

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:20.065
Those bodies have been there for too long.

00:07:21.905 --> 00:07:24.225
You can't locate the focus anymore.

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:25.225
It's pointless.

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:28.545
- Pei Yu.
- No, you're Pei Yu,

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:33.305
the best physician
in the Imperial Medical Office.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.785
I'm sure you can find a cure for this.

00:07:39.865 --> 00:07:41.225
No.

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:46.345
Pei Yu.

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:49.865
Pei Yu.

00:07:56.545 --> 00:07:57.425
Hurry.

00:07:57.505 --> 00:07:59.385
No.

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:02.385
Hurry.

00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:05.505
Hurry.

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:28.265
Pei Yu.

00:08:35.945 --> 00:08:36.945
Pei Yu.

00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:02.665
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:06.985
The prejudice within
the Imperial Medical Office is to blame.

00:09:09.105 --> 00:09:10.425
Just because Ying is a woman,

00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:13.785
they disregarded her judgment
and delayed treatment,

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:15.865
causing the epidemic outbreak.

00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:19.785
I just hope that one day,
women can face a little less prejudice.

00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:24.065
You're being too pessimistic.

00:09:24.145 --> 00:09:27.065
Why settle for "less"
when we can aim for "none"?

00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:29.585
Of course, that'd be better.

00:09:30.705 --> 00:09:33.465
I just assume
there's still a long, long way to go.

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:38.185
It's alright. Your Ladyship is not alone.

00:09:38.265 --> 00:09:41.385
A lot of people will stand by you.

00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:48.625
These crimes were committed by Xia Shisan.

00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:50.905
But Ying didn't report him.

00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:53.545
Once the epidemic is over
and the palace gate opens,

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:55.785
deliver the files
to the Court of Judicial Review.

00:09:58.025 --> 00:09:59.065
Your Ladyship.

00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:02.265
Your Ladyship, bad news. It's Pei Yu.

00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:04.585
Pei Yu.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.225
Technician Pei committed suicide.

00:10:08.305 --> 00:10:09.585
Thankfully, they found out.

00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:13.105
She took poison.

00:10:25.305 --> 00:10:26.345
Here.

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:35.905
I've written my confession.

00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:39.225
Don't bother the Court of Judicial Review.

00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:41.385
I just want a quick death.

00:10:42.785 --> 00:10:43.945
Don't commit suicide.

00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:45.025
You're not the culprit.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.505
Heed His Majesty's decree!

00:10:57.345 --> 00:11:00.425
"The new prescription
from Technician Pei has managed

00:11:00.505 --> 00:11:03.505
to contain the epidemic
since it was put into use.

00:11:03.585 --> 00:11:06.425
No more patients died,

00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:08.785
and there were no new cases.

00:11:08.865 --> 00:11:12.345
Technician Pei has made
great contributions

00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:15.025
and is summoned by His Majesty."

00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:16.385
Accept the decree!

00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:34.585
I, Pei Yu, the convict,
pay respect to Your Majesty.

00:11:37.185 --> 00:11:38.025
Rise.

00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:40.585
Your prescription

00:11:41.185 --> 00:11:42.345
worked wonders.

00:11:42.865 --> 00:11:45.225
It stopped the epidemic

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:47.505
and saved hundreds
of people in the palace.

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:49.785
The credit goes to you.

00:11:49.865 --> 00:11:51.625
There is no credit.

00:11:51.705 --> 00:11:53.505
It's just my duty as a physician.

00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:57.265
Conducting an unauthorized autopsy
is a capital crime,

00:11:57.865 --> 00:12:00.905
and I sheltered the culprit
after he killed my mentor.

00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:02.545
I shall be punished.

00:12:03.065 --> 00:12:04.785
Please grant me death, Your Majesty.

00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:08.785
Your Majesty. Please think twice.

00:12:08.865 --> 00:12:11.865
Pei Yu made mistakes,
but she saved hundreds of people,

00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:13.865
offsetting her sin.
She doesn't deserve to die.

00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:17.145
I've read the case file.

00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:20.505
The murderer Xia Shisan
was cruel and extreme.

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:23.585
Pei Yu repeatedly covered up his crimes

00:12:23.665 --> 00:12:26.065
and should be punished
for knowingly breaking the law.

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:29.065
But this epidemic
killed too many people in the palace.

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:33.425
I don't want any more deaths.

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.545
Your Majesty.

00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:43.385
Technician Pei may have found a cure,

00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:46.465
but an unauthorized autopsy
is more than a capital crime.

00:12:47.265 --> 00:12:51.745
It filled the palace with terror
during the epidemic.

00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:56.585
It is an act of extreme cruelty
with devastating consequences.

00:12:57.705 --> 00:13:00.785
Minister Wei, every word you speak
is so lofty and righteous.

00:13:00.865 --> 00:13:02.945
But did you ever consider

00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:05.585
what drove Technician Pei
to such extremes?

00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:09.065
If the Imperial Medical Office
valued knowledge

00:13:09.145 --> 00:13:11.265
and ability over gender,

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:14.225
if women could diagnose, prescribe,

00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:16.225
and be respected equally
as male physicians,

00:13:16.305 --> 00:13:18.265
why would she have risked everything,

00:13:18.345 --> 00:13:20.465
even resorting to autopsies,
just to develop a cure?

00:13:23.265 --> 00:13:25.225
Your investigative skills

00:13:25.905 --> 00:13:29.625
are unmatched in the court, Your Ladyship.

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:33.465
Yet, as a woman,
you are sometimes too emotional,

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:35.345
prone to what one
might call "feminine leniency."

00:13:36.145 --> 00:13:38.305
Are you now trying

00:13:38.905 --> 00:13:41.065
to erase all her crimes

00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:43.025
with such words?

00:13:43.945 --> 00:13:45.185
Feminine leniency

00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:48.505
is still preferable
to your stuffy old-fashioned pedantry.

00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:51.545
- You…
- Her Ladyship was impartial.

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:53.545
But you accused her of being partial.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:55.945
How disappointing.

00:13:57.225 --> 00:13:59.545
Your Majesty. Her Ladyship means

00:13:59.625 --> 00:14:02.745
that had Technician Pei
been treated fairly from the start

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:05.545
and allowed to shine,
the epidemic might have ended sooner,

00:14:05.625 --> 00:14:08.265
and these tragedies
might never have occurred.

00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:12.145
She has achievements and faults.

00:14:12.225 --> 00:14:13.505
Let the law decide her fate.

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:16.105
But this matter
shouldn't be viewed as a single case.

00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:22.145
Eunuch Guo.

00:14:22.225 --> 00:14:23.905
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:26.665
Revise the Imperial Medical Office's
regulations.

00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:29.985
All who are devoted to learning,
regardless of gender,

00:14:30.065 --> 00:14:32.505
shall be evaluated
based on their capability.

00:14:32.585 --> 00:14:34.825
Female physicians shall be accepted.

00:14:36.425 --> 00:14:37.625
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:14:38.905 --> 00:14:41.265
Although Pei Yu
has been involved in multiple cases,

00:14:41.865 --> 00:14:44.865
her contributions are significant,
and her attitude remains sincere.

00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:47.305
She is hereby granted a special pardon.

00:14:47.385 --> 00:14:48.865
She shall remain in the Medical Office

00:14:48.945 --> 00:14:51.305
to carry on the unfinished work
of Physician Song,

00:14:51.905 --> 00:14:53.385
study medicine,

00:14:53.465 --> 00:14:55.825
and train new practitioners
as a means of atonement.

00:14:56.425 --> 00:14:58.705
Pei Yu. What do you think?

00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:00.825
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:15:03.905 --> 00:15:06.785
I have another favor to ask.

00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:08.665
I'm listening.

00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:12.065
Your Majesty, please allow me

00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:14.945
to send Xia Shisan's ashes back home.

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:22.225
XINGQING PALACE

00:16:06.745 --> 00:16:07.745
Ying.

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:09.465
Headmaster.

00:16:10.705 --> 00:16:12.145
I brought Pei Yu back.

00:16:15.705 --> 00:16:17.425
It was my fault.

00:16:17.505 --> 00:16:20.185
It's all over. Say no more.

00:16:20.265 --> 00:16:21.305
Alright.

00:16:21.825 --> 00:16:23.625
I'll stop. I'll stop.

00:16:24.305 --> 00:16:26.745
Stay here and set your mind at ease.

00:16:27.345 --> 00:16:29.665
The Benevolence Hall is your home.

00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:32.265
Come on. Please come in.

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:40.705
Come on.

00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:41.625
BENEVOLENCE HALL

00:16:41.705 --> 00:16:42.785
This way.

00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:48.505
Please…

00:17:06.345 --> 00:17:08.224
This is where Pei Yu lived as a child.

00:17:09.585 --> 00:17:11.105
I'd like to thank you and Mr. Xiao

00:17:11.184 --> 00:17:13.145
for pleading for me before His Majesty.

00:17:14.305 --> 00:17:15.745
This benefits not only me,

00:17:15.825 --> 00:17:18.184
but every woman who will study
at the Imperial Medical Office.

00:17:18.265 --> 00:17:20.665
Because you proved to His Majesty

00:17:20.745 --> 00:17:22.505
that women can also be great physicians

00:17:22.585 --> 00:17:23.704
and save lives.

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:26.865
You don't have to envy me anymore.

00:17:26.944 --> 00:17:28.665
You can also do whatever you want.

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:37.745
Where did she go? She should see you off.

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:39.225
It's alright.

00:17:39.305 --> 00:17:42.065
She's suffered so much. Maybe she's tired.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.625
Let her rest.

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:46.145
Yeah. Well…

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:47.385
Headmaster.

00:17:47.465 --> 00:17:49.025
Something went wrong.

00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:12.425
TO YOUR LADYSHIP

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.505
Your Ladyship.

00:18:21.745 --> 00:18:24.425
Your Ladyship.
I have gone to accompany Pei Yu.

00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:27.185
The notes I compiled over years of study

00:18:27.265 --> 00:18:29.985
are stored in my cabinet
at the Imperial Medical Office.

00:18:30.065 --> 00:18:33.625
They contain many reflections
and analyses of classical prescriptions.

00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:35.825
Please deliver them to Physician Liu,

00:18:35.905 --> 00:18:37.825
so our colleagues may refer to them.

00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:39.385
The medical texts on the desk

00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:41.305
were given to me by my master.

00:18:41.385 --> 00:18:43.065
Keep them at the Benevolence Hall.

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:44.665
Your Ladyship.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.745
Forgive me for not seeing you off

00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:49.545
or returning to the Western Capital.

00:18:50.585 --> 00:18:51.745
I'm so tired.

00:18:52.705 --> 00:18:54.985
I'm afraid I will let His Majesty down.

00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:59.425
TO YOUR LADYSHIP

00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:26.945
- It's you.
- What are you doing?

00:19:27.025 --> 00:19:28.865
Catching fireflies to read by their light?

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:30.865
Headmaster puts out
the light at the Xu hour.

00:19:30.945 --> 00:19:32.305
But I have to copy your notes.

00:19:37.305 --> 00:19:38.305
Keep it down.

00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:40.345
Don't scare the fireflies away.

00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:45.905
Wait.

00:19:47.665 --> 00:19:50.145
Be careful. Fireflies fly around.

00:19:50.225 --> 00:19:51.945
That motionless object…

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:52.905
might be a snake.

00:19:54.145 --> 00:19:56.065
Stop right there.

00:19:59.025 --> 00:20:02.305
I dare you to stop running.

00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:09.865
We've known each other so long,

00:20:09.945 --> 00:20:12.225
but you haven't told me your name.

00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:14.425
I don't have a name.

00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:15.905
Grandma said

00:20:15.985 --> 00:20:18.145
that she found me on the 13th
of the sixth month.

00:20:18.225 --> 00:20:19.745
So she named me Shisan.

00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:23.985
But she and the villagers
usually call me "wild girl".

00:20:24.985 --> 00:20:25.865
Shisan?

00:20:28.265 --> 00:20:30.185
That's not a good name.

00:20:30.265 --> 00:20:31.905
If you become a famous physician,

00:20:31.985 --> 00:20:33.505
you'll need a decent name.

00:20:36.025 --> 00:20:38.705
But I don't know any decent names.

00:20:40.665 --> 00:20:42.905
Grandma found you in the summer.

00:20:47.065 --> 00:20:50.025
Fireflies are all around tonight.

00:20:50.545 --> 00:20:53.185
Why don't we call you Xia Ying?

00:20:54.825 --> 00:20:55.905
Xia Ying.

00:20:58.785 --> 00:21:00.865
Alright. Then I'll be Xia Ying.

00:21:04.385 --> 00:21:05.585
Xia Ying.

00:21:09.385 --> 00:21:10.825
Xia Ying.

00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:33.225
Xia Ying.

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:37.625
Pei Yu.

00:22:04.265 --> 00:22:07.425
Please take care
of Pei Yu and Ying's funeral.

00:22:14.705 --> 00:22:16.145
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:22:16.745 --> 00:22:18.705
Even if you don't say it,

00:22:18.785 --> 00:22:21.265
I will take care

00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:24.105
of Ying's funeral.

00:22:25.305 --> 00:22:26.825
I have only one request.

00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:30.905
Can you replace the portrait
with one of Pei Yu and Ying?

00:22:33.225 --> 00:22:36.465
All these years,
Pei Yu had been guarding Ying.

00:22:37.225 --> 00:22:38.985
Ying finally became a physician,

00:22:40.305 --> 00:22:43.825
but she covered up his crimes

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.785
and violated the original intention
of saving people.

00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:48.305
Both of them are now dead.

00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:51.265
Let their story

00:22:52.425 --> 00:22:54.065
warn the future generations.

00:22:57.105 --> 00:22:58.985
I will do as you say,

00:22:59.705 --> 00:23:01.305
Your Ladyship.

00:23:22.665 --> 00:23:24.265
Pei Yu taught me…

00:23:25.945 --> 00:23:27.105
No.

00:23:27.185 --> 00:23:28.585
Ying taught me how to make that sachet.

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:31.865
I've seen too many people
leave the Western Capital to survive.

00:23:32.785 --> 00:23:33.865
Only Ying

00:23:34.545 --> 00:23:36.505
left the Western Capital to seek death.

00:23:37.345 --> 00:23:40.585
Her life was short but full of hardship.

00:23:40.665 --> 00:23:44.025
She brought Pei Yu home
and finally found peace.

00:23:47.585 --> 00:23:50.985
But Ying really didn't want to go back.

00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:53.705
Perhaps it is for the best.

00:24:00.945 --> 00:24:02.505
Have you ever thought about leaving?

00:24:04.665 --> 00:24:05.585
Of course.

00:24:06.185 --> 00:24:08.105
But I have to discover the truth.

00:24:08.665 --> 00:24:11.265
I just don't know if I can survive.

00:24:14.225 --> 00:24:15.745
If it's so dangerous,

00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:17.825
can you give it up?

00:24:20.985 --> 00:24:22.225
If I give it up,

00:24:22.745 --> 00:24:25.785
what's the point
of trying so hard to survive?

00:24:32.705 --> 00:24:33.865
The epidemic is over.

00:24:34.385 --> 00:24:36.145
Why are you still carrying
the herb sachet?

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:40.545
It comes in handy.

00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:42.785
We were traveling. I couldn't sleep.

00:24:42.865 --> 00:24:44.065
So I put some soothing herbs.

00:24:45.345 --> 00:24:46.545
Mindful of your well-being, huh?

00:24:48.025 --> 00:24:50.585
It's a nice formula. Want to try it?

00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:58.185
Just take mine. I just filled it up.

00:24:58.865 --> 00:24:59.865
I'll take yours.

00:25:08.305 --> 00:25:09.145
Mr. Xiao.

00:25:10.945 --> 00:25:12.905
Can you accompany me
to Ping'en County in Mingzhou?

00:25:12.985 --> 00:25:14.265
Ping'en County?

00:25:14.905 --> 00:25:17.185
I remembered someone
who suddenly left the capital.

00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:22.065
WU'S MANOR, PING'EN COUNTY, MINGZHOU

00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:34.625
Greetings, Your Ladyship, Mr. Xiao.

00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:36.705
Please take a seat.

00:25:44.385 --> 00:25:46.785
I didn't know you were coming.

00:25:47.385 --> 00:25:49.945
Master will be here in half a ke.

00:25:50.025 --> 00:25:51.025
Sorry for the wait.

00:25:51.705 --> 00:25:54.105
It's my fault that I came uninvited.

00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:55.505
Auntie, spare the formality.

00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:58.785
My uncle and my mother grew up together.

00:25:58.865 --> 00:26:00.025
He is a senior family member.

00:26:00.105 --> 00:26:01.185
I don't mind waiting.

00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:06.985
Interesting decoration.

00:26:08.945 --> 00:26:11.345
It's your uncle's preference.

00:26:12.025 --> 00:26:14.425
Uncle's business must be a huge success.

00:26:15.345 --> 00:26:16.625
You know about it?

00:26:17.545 --> 00:26:18.985
The richest man in the Western Capital

00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:21.065
- had the same preference.
- Your Ladyship.

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:23.265
That's an unlucky thing to say.

00:26:25.945 --> 00:26:27.305
Don't you have any children?

00:26:28.785 --> 00:26:32.065
Our son gets ill easily
and avoids seeing guests.

00:26:32.145 --> 00:26:33.185
Please forgive us.

00:26:36.425 --> 00:26:37.985
Master is back.

00:26:42.425 --> 00:26:43.905
Sorry for the wait, Your Ladyship.

00:26:44.505 --> 00:26:46.185
You sound so distant.

00:26:46.265 --> 00:26:48.865
Just call me Peiyi like before.

00:26:48.945 --> 00:26:52.625
But when I didn't call you
"Your Ladyship",

00:26:52.705 --> 00:26:54.225
you chased after me

00:26:54.305 --> 00:26:55.625
with your little wooden sword.

00:26:56.985 --> 00:26:58.945
I, Xiao Huaijin, pay respect to Mr. Wu.

00:26:59.545 --> 00:27:01.985
Mr. Xiao from the Astronomical Bureau.

00:27:02.065 --> 00:27:04.425
What a promising young man.

00:27:10.625 --> 00:27:12.145
You must be hungry.

00:27:12.745 --> 00:27:14.665
My love. Bring food and wine.

00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:22.105
How old is my cousin? Is he doing fine?

00:27:22.865 --> 00:27:23.865
He's six years old.

00:27:24.425 --> 00:27:26.385
He was born weak

00:27:26.985 --> 00:27:29.585
and introverted. But he's fine.

00:27:30.545 --> 00:27:31.905
Thank you for your concern.

00:27:34.865 --> 00:27:36.385
Lamb with apricot sauce.

00:27:37.105 --> 00:27:38.225
Sunflower leaf soup.

00:27:38.745 --> 00:27:40.105
Celery with vinegar.

00:27:40.185 --> 00:27:41.705
Fried asparagus. Yellow rice.

00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:43.745
All local famous dishes.

00:27:43.825 --> 00:27:46.065
This one is the best.

00:27:46.145 --> 00:27:47.665
It may be available
in the Western Capital,

00:27:47.745 --> 00:27:49.425
but it tastes far better here.

00:27:50.025 --> 00:27:53.625
The sliced raw fish is made
of freshly caught bass.

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:55.585
Fortunately, I don't eat fish.

00:27:56.625 --> 00:27:57.905
You don't eat fish?

00:27:59.065 --> 00:28:01.145
Never order sliced raw fish for me.

00:28:03.065 --> 00:28:04.305
Fresh and sweet.

00:28:05.025 --> 00:28:07.625
- Your Ladyship. Please try it.
- Wait.

00:28:07.705 --> 00:28:10.505
Mr. Wu. In my humble opinion,

00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:13.385
it seems you may not be able
to fully enjoy today's meal.

00:28:13.465 --> 00:28:14.825
Please elaborate.

00:28:15.425 --> 00:28:17.225
Today is Yisi. Yi wood belongs to fire.

00:28:17.305 --> 00:28:18.585
This is also the reason

00:28:18.665 --> 00:28:20.265
why you hold the banquet in this hall.

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:24.865
On a fire-dominated day,
one should avoid water-element foods.

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:26.905
I dare speak boldly.

00:28:26.985 --> 00:28:29.625
If I am mistaken,
I ask for your forgiveness.

00:28:30.425 --> 00:28:32.625
You are indeed as renowned as they say.

00:28:33.425 --> 00:28:34.865
Thank you for reminding me.

00:28:34.945 --> 00:28:36.065
Otherwise,

00:28:36.145 --> 00:28:38.625
indulging my appetite today

00:28:38.705 --> 00:28:41.705
might have disrupted Mr. Xu's intentions.

00:28:44.705 --> 00:28:46.105
Who is this Mr. Xu?

00:28:46.745 --> 00:28:48.545
Could he be more impressive than Mr. Xiao?

00:28:49.665 --> 00:28:51.505
Both are impressive.

00:28:51.585 --> 00:28:53.345
Mr. Xu

00:28:53.425 --> 00:28:55.185
is a hermit sage

00:28:55.265 --> 00:28:57.065
from the nearby Qingtan Town.

00:28:57.665 --> 00:28:59.385
His name is Xu Daoyin.

00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:01.105
He's been giving me a lot of advice.

00:29:01.785 --> 00:29:03.025
Ever since we came here,

00:29:03.105 --> 00:29:05.345
he's been blessing us

00:29:05.425 --> 00:29:07.745
in big and small affairs of life.

00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:11.465
I couldn't come out to greet you in time

00:29:11.545 --> 00:29:14.825
because I had to chant
during the You hour.

00:29:15.545 --> 00:29:16.985
Please forgive me.

00:29:17.585 --> 00:29:18.465
Then,

00:29:19.065 --> 00:29:20.265
will you be able to try

00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:22.185
the sliced raw fish?

00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:24.505
Her Ladyship should

00:29:24.585 --> 00:29:26.905
- avoid water…
- When tragedy hit that year,

00:29:26.985 --> 00:29:28.945
I fell into the Moonlit Pond
and almost drowned.

00:29:29.785 --> 00:29:31.625
Since then, I've never had fish again.

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:36.505
You resigned and left
the Western Capital that year.

00:29:36.585 --> 00:29:37.425
So you didn't know.

00:29:39.105 --> 00:29:40.065
No wonder.

00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:42.585
I haven't asked you

00:29:43.265 --> 00:29:45.425
why you suddenly resigned that year.

00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:47.185
No one practiced sword with me afterward.

00:29:48.785 --> 00:29:50.465
I was in poor health.

00:29:50.985 --> 00:29:52.385
Being an official in the capital

00:29:52.985 --> 00:29:54.265
was hard work, after all.

00:29:54.865 --> 00:29:56.425
So I resigned from office

00:29:56.505 --> 00:29:58.625
and came to my wife's hometown with her.

00:30:01.585 --> 00:30:02.625
Someone.

00:30:03.265 --> 00:30:05.385
Take the sliced raw fish away.

00:30:08.905 --> 00:30:11.785
Take it to Young Master.

00:30:11.865 --> 00:30:12.705
Understood.

00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:21.505
I haven't been a thoughtful host
and have ruined your mood.

00:30:22.465 --> 00:30:24.385
Here. Let me toast you two.

00:30:34.785 --> 00:30:35.705
Forgive me.

00:30:37.745 --> 00:30:38.585
This way.

00:30:45.945 --> 00:30:48.825
I know why you're here today.

00:30:49.425 --> 00:30:52.865
Your father suffered
consecutive defeats and returned

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:57.025
to the Western Capital.
He was depressed for quite a long time.

00:30:57.745 --> 00:30:59.225
When I visited him,

00:30:59.865 --> 00:31:03.105
I could sense the worry in his heart.

00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:05.745
He was the elder brother of His Majesty

00:31:06.385 --> 00:31:09.305
and a celebrated military commander
with a record of achievements.

00:31:09.385 --> 00:31:13.385
It was only natural
that he failed to bear such a heavy blow

00:31:13.465 --> 00:31:15.065
and had a breakdown.

00:31:15.745 --> 00:31:17.545
This may be hard for you to accept,

00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:20.025
but it is the truth.

00:31:22.785 --> 00:31:25.545
You were thriving
as the Crown Prince's aide,

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:29.225
but suddenly retired due to poor health
after my parents passed away.

00:31:29.905 --> 00:31:31.625
Is there a connection
between these two events?

00:31:31.705 --> 00:31:33.465
Of course not.

00:31:33.545 --> 00:31:36.665
You used to bring me new clothes
on the Lantern Festival every year.

00:31:36.745 --> 00:31:38.665
But you didn't visit that day.

00:31:38.745 --> 00:31:41.385
Did you hear something in advance?

00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:42.945
How is that possible?

00:31:43.465 --> 00:31:45.545
I went to your manor at noon that day.

00:31:46.225 --> 00:31:49.145
You changed
into the new clothes on the spot.

00:31:51.025 --> 00:31:51.905
That's it.

00:31:52.665 --> 00:31:57.465
With your testimony,
I'm more certain that I was home that day.

00:32:02.385 --> 00:32:04.225
Sorry. The corridors wind like a maze.

00:32:04.305 --> 00:32:05.705
I was lost for a moment.

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.185
Please be seated.

00:32:10.545 --> 00:32:12.825
You've traveled a long way here.

00:32:12.905 --> 00:32:14.865
Rest early after dinner.

00:32:14.945 --> 00:32:16.505
Tomorrow,

00:32:16.585 --> 00:32:18.905
I'll show you around the town.

00:32:29.905 --> 00:32:31.305
This area is prone
to dampness and mosquitoes.

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:33.265
The guest rooms
have been closed for too long.

00:32:33.345 --> 00:32:35.665
It'll require extra fumigation
to be livable tonight.

00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.145
Please wait here.

00:32:37.225 --> 00:32:38.145
Much appreciated.

00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:46.145
Did you annoy Mr. Wu?

00:32:47.345 --> 00:32:48.665
He was feeling guilty.

00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:52.625
But how did you get lost

00:32:52.705 --> 00:32:54.185
with your extraordinary memory?

00:32:54.945 --> 00:32:56.225
Don't you think

00:32:56.305 --> 00:32:58.345
that Madam Wu is somewhat odd?

00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:03.505
Take it to Young Master.

00:33:03.585 --> 00:33:04.505
Understood.

00:33:17.705 --> 00:33:18.905
It's not for Young Master.

00:33:19.505 --> 00:33:21.705
- But Master…
- It's Madam again.

00:33:21.785 --> 00:33:22.985
Let's go.

00:33:30.025 --> 00:33:31.225
Take this and go.

00:33:31.305 --> 00:33:33.185
I told you that was not for Young Master.

00:33:33.265 --> 00:33:34.705
Don't get us into trouble.

00:33:56.465 --> 00:33:59.625
A child lives alone
in that remote courtyard?

00:34:02.105 --> 00:34:04.225
Mr. Wu appears to care about his son,

00:34:04.825 --> 00:34:07.185
but Madam Wu seems rather cold.

00:34:09.385 --> 00:34:10.905
It's such a big household.

00:34:10.985 --> 00:34:13.185
Why would they withhold a child's food?

00:34:14.545 --> 00:34:15.905
I smell secrets.

00:34:15.985 --> 00:34:17.304
But maybe I'm overthinking.

00:34:18.865 --> 00:34:19.865
Any progress?

00:34:19.945 --> 00:34:21.344
I tricked him.

00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:23.304
He's probably quite annoyed right now.

00:34:23.385 --> 00:34:26.985
When different accounts
of the same event sound nearly identical,

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.585
there must be something fishy.

00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:30.465
It's alright.

00:34:30.545 --> 00:34:32.705
I have time to figure it out.

00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:38.465
I should have come much earlier.

00:34:43.865 --> 00:34:44.784
It's going to rain.

00:34:54.744 --> 00:34:57.305
GREAT VIRTUE TO EMBRACE THE WORLD

00:35:04.465 --> 00:35:08.305
WANG, SERVANT AT WU'S MANOR

00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:12.625
You lazybones. Get up.

00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:17.065
Master is still asleep?

00:35:17.145 --> 00:35:18.465
That's right.

00:35:26.785 --> 00:35:27.625
Master.

00:35:29.625 --> 00:35:30.745
Master…

00:35:38.545 --> 00:35:42.105
SECRETS OF AUSPICIOUS TIMES

00:35:45.385 --> 00:35:47.265
Madam, did you see
or hear anything last night?

00:35:48.505 --> 00:35:51.705
Madam has been living alone
in the back courtyard for years.

00:35:51.785 --> 00:35:53.065
So last night…

00:35:56.145 --> 00:35:57.345
Please wait.

00:35:57.945 --> 00:35:58.825
The authorities are coming.

00:35:58.905 --> 00:36:00.545
Your Ladyship doesn't need to go in.

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:01.745
Don't you know who I am?

00:36:01.825 --> 00:36:03.025
Y-Yes, I do.

00:36:03.105 --> 00:36:04.585
So what are you waiting for?

00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:06.545
Your Ladyship.

00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:07.585
You can't take on this case.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:10.745
The crime scene is way too shocking.

00:36:12.825 --> 00:36:14.225
Then I want to see it even more.

00:36:14.305 --> 00:36:15.425
But…

00:36:17.425 --> 00:36:19.385
Master was injured in the lower body.

00:36:25.265 --> 00:36:28.065
Mr. Wu died miserably,
injured in the lower body.

00:36:28.145 --> 00:36:29.305
It is highly improper.

00:36:30.665 --> 00:36:31.465
That's right.

00:36:31.545 --> 00:36:35.025
Why doesn't Your Ladyship
wait for Magistrate Wen to bring people?

00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:37.265
The dead care little

00:36:37.345 --> 00:36:38.585
for the barriers drawn
between men and women.

00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:52.505
Even if Your Ladyship doesn't care,
someone else does.

00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:53.745
We're not in the palace.

00:36:53.825 --> 00:36:54.745
Let's be more cautious.

00:36:54.825 --> 00:36:57.385
If word gets out, people will find out

00:36:57.465 --> 00:36:58.705
about our detour.

00:37:00.145 --> 00:37:01.465
They'll know sooner or later.

00:37:01.545 --> 00:37:03.225
They can come and kill me.

00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:05.865
Then I'll figure out who they are.

00:37:05.945 --> 00:37:09.985
I know you're upset that he died
before you could figure anything out.

00:37:10.065 --> 00:37:11.665
But we should be more cautious now.

00:37:11.745 --> 00:37:13.305
But he died last night.

00:37:13.825 --> 00:37:15.065
I have to investigate.

00:37:15.145 --> 00:37:16.185
I don't trust anyone.

00:37:17.905 --> 00:37:18.905
Then let me do it.

00:37:18.985 --> 00:37:21.545
Get blindfolded and follow me.

00:37:21.625 --> 00:37:22.665
I'll be your eyes.

00:37:25.225 --> 00:37:26.905
If you trust me.

00:37:29.865 --> 00:37:30.825
Get a blindfold.

00:37:31.425 --> 00:37:32.585
Understood.

00:37:45.105 --> 00:37:47.745
Her Ladyship will follow me
into the room, blindfolded.

00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:49.745
There is nothing improper.

00:37:49.825 --> 00:37:51.305
If we still hear criticism,

00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:53.505
then it's you people
tarnishing the reputation

00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:54.985
of the royal clan.

00:37:55.065 --> 00:37:56.545
I will uncover the truth,

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:59.625
even if it means a thousand fall,
none shall escape.

00:38:00.505 --> 00:38:01.665
Rest assured, Mr. Xiao.

00:38:01.745 --> 00:38:03.865
I dare not talk nonsense
about Her Ladyship.

00:38:03.945 --> 00:38:06.105
I don't know if you would dare.

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:08.225
But you only have one life.

00:38:13.225 --> 00:38:14.145
What a pity.

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:17.105
I didn't get to see
how you threatened him.

00:38:18.385 --> 00:38:19.545
It wasn't a threat.

00:38:19.625 --> 00:38:20.825
I was telling the truth.

00:38:23.465 --> 00:38:25.265
Your Ladyship. Please.

00:38:33.585 --> 00:38:34.425
Be careful.

00:38:47.065 --> 00:38:48.265
Heavy blood smell.

00:38:49.105 --> 00:38:50.705
You don't have to force yourself.

00:38:50.785 --> 00:38:52.985
With the door closed,
I can inspect the scene.

00:38:54.425 --> 00:38:56.345
We're alone here. Don't worry.

00:38:56.425 --> 00:38:57.705
I can manage.

00:39:01.585 --> 00:39:03.265
The censer stands at the center.

00:39:03.345 --> 00:39:04.425
You're facing the Kan position.

00:39:04.505 --> 00:39:06.185
According
to the Eight Trigrams orientation,

00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:08.705
north is Kan, south is Li,
east is Zhen, and west is Dui.

00:39:11.185 --> 00:39:12.865
As expected, the room
is meticulously arranged

00:39:12.945 --> 00:39:15.265
to attract fortune and prosperity.

00:39:15.865 --> 00:39:18.625
Doors and windows
show no signs of forced entry.

00:39:19.745 --> 00:39:22.545
In the Dui position, there is a bed
with a lamp on each side.

00:39:25.865 --> 00:39:26.985
The Zhen position has a window

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:28.785
overlooking the bamboo garden.

00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:30.625
In front of the window

00:39:30.705 --> 00:39:32.185
sits a rosewood desk,

00:39:32.265 --> 00:39:33.745
on which are placed the stationery

00:39:34.545 --> 00:39:35.665
and three books.

00:39:47.465 --> 00:39:49.185
The Kan position features a screen

00:39:49.265 --> 00:39:51.185
with cabinets on both sides.

00:39:55.545 --> 00:39:57.065
The Qian position holds a tall stand

00:39:58.265 --> 00:39:59.905
with gold ingots in a porcelain dish.

00:40:00.505 --> 00:40:03.545
This is the room's wealth corner,
likely arranged to attract prosperity.

00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:07.705
None of these appears to have been moved.

00:40:08.865 --> 00:40:10.025
Examine the body.

00:40:21.225 --> 00:40:22.425
Above the bed

00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:24.505
hangs a horizontal beam
draped with red silk.

00:40:24.585 --> 00:40:26.345
Mr. Wu's upper body
is suspended from this beam,

00:40:27.105 --> 00:40:28.185
his arms hanging down,

00:40:30.265 --> 00:40:31.305
mouth wide open.

00:40:31.385 --> 00:40:33.505
Was anything ever stuffed inside?

00:40:35.425 --> 00:40:36.385
I can't tell.

00:40:36.465 --> 00:40:38.465
This will require examination
by the coroner.

00:40:39.945 --> 00:40:40.785
Cause of death?

00:40:42.025 --> 00:40:43.025
Wound in the lower body.

00:40:43.105 --> 00:40:44.625
The clothing is soaked in blood.

00:40:45.225 --> 00:40:47.025
Blood has flowed
from the bed to the floor.

00:40:47.105 --> 00:40:48.865
The color appears normal.

00:40:49.785 --> 00:40:51.345
No visible signs of poisoning.

00:40:51.945 --> 00:40:53.425
He died from excessive bleeding.

00:40:53.505 --> 00:40:55.385
Any other wounds?

00:40:57.265 --> 00:40:58.345
No.

00:41:06.905 --> 00:41:09.145
The joint has begun to stiffen
but can still be bent.

00:41:09.225 --> 00:41:11.145
You should be able to estimate
the time of death.

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:16.065
Magistrate Wen, please wait.

00:41:16.145 --> 00:41:17.945
It's a murder case. How can I wait?

00:41:18.025 --> 00:41:18.945
Magistrate Wen.

00:41:20.465 --> 00:41:22.225
Her Ladyship is inspecting the scene.

00:41:23.465 --> 00:41:25.665
WEN YUQING, PING'EN COUNTY MAGISTRATE

00:41:25.745 --> 00:41:26.945
We're in the main hall.

00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:28.345
We never came.

00:41:29.665 --> 00:41:30.505
We never came.

00:41:36.105 --> 00:41:39.025
The time of death is estimated
to be after midnight.

00:41:50.865 --> 00:41:52.385
Both wrists show abrasions,

00:41:52.985 --> 00:41:54.665
likely caused by struggling

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.225
against rope bindings.

00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:58.265
Please examine closely.

00:41:58.345 --> 00:42:00.185
Has the blood at the wound site dried?

00:42:02.705 --> 00:42:03.825
Not yet.

00:42:05.185 --> 00:42:07.585
Thank you, Mr. Xiao. We can leave now.

00:42:16.985 --> 00:42:17.825
Your Ladyship.

00:42:19.145 --> 00:42:20.065
We've checked around.

00:42:20.145 --> 00:42:22.145
No valuables were lost.

00:42:22.745 --> 00:42:24.225
The murderer was not looking for money.

00:42:24.305 --> 00:42:25.945
Were any others injured?

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:29.945
No. Even the two guards
stationed outside the room were unharmed.

00:42:35.705 --> 00:42:36.745
Leave us.

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.305
Your Ladyship.

00:42:42.385 --> 00:42:44.585
The victim died from heavy bleeding
after being struck

00:42:44.665 --> 00:42:45.785
in the lower body

00:42:45.865 --> 00:42:47.745
with a blunt object,
likely a wooden implement

00:42:47.825 --> 00:42:49.025
with sharp edges.

00:42:49.105 --> 00:42:50.345
Not a simple club or rod.

00:42:50.425 --> 00:42:51.465
Based on the amount of blood,

00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:54.145
it appears the deceased
had taken blood-activating medication.

00:42:54.745 --> 00:42:56.105
What medication?

00:43:01.025 --> 00:43:03.745
Traces of medicinal residue
were found on the victim's clothing,

00:43:03.825 --> 00:43:05.745
but further analysis is needed.

00:43:07.065 --> 00:43:09.465
Sichuan lovage, Dang Gui,
and cinnamon bark.

00:43:10.425 --> 00:43:12.065
Was anything stuffed into the mouth?

00:43:12.145 --> 00:43:13.305
No.

00:43:13.385 --> 00:43:15.625
The open mouth was a result of agony.

00:43:16.745 --> 00:43:19.345
The victim screamed before death?

00:43:20.065 --> 00:43:22.105
Did you hear thunder last night?

00:43:23.425 --> 00:43:25.465
The big tree in the courtyard
was struck down.

00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:26.785
But I didn't hear thunder.

00:43:27.385 --> 00:43:30.105
This is strange. Everyone slept well.

00:43:30.185 --> 00:43:32.745
Those who would get up to use the restroom
didn't wake up, either.

00:43:32.825 --> 00:43:35.585
Those who snore
didn't wake up their roommates.

00:43:36.505 --> 00:43:37.785
Drugs.

00:43:37.865 --> 00:43:41.345
Someone must have drugged everyone
in the manor.

00:43:42.345 --> 00:43:44.065
Was it in the food?

00:43:44.145 --> 00:43:46.025
Or in the water.

00:43:46.625 --> 00:43:48.345
But Mr. Wu was wide awake.

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:50.745
Otherwise, he wouldn't have struggled.

00:43:50.825 --> 00:43:52.745
We ate and drank the same things.

00:43:56.585 --> 00:43:58.225
This area is prone
to dampness and mosquitoes.

00:43:58.305 --> 00:44:00.265
The guest rooms
have been closed for too long.

00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:02.665
It'll require extra fumigation
to be livable tonight.

00:44:04.665 --> 00:44:07.025
Collect samples of the mosquito repellent.

00:44:07.105 --> 00:44:09.265
One from the deceased. One from others.

00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:11.065
Understood.

00:44:16.025 --> 00:44:17.225
Here, Your Ladyship.

00:44:17.305 --> 00:44:19.225
This is from my master's room.

00:44:22.945 --> 00:44:24.985
Perilla, mugwort,

00:44:27.065 --> 00:44:28.425
sulphur, tangerine peel, cloves?

00:44:28.505 --> 00:44:32.065
That's right. Master used that formula
for his incense.

00:44:33.585 --> 00:44:36.625
This is the incense from the other rooms.

00:44:39.745 --> 00:44:40.825
Datura flower.

00:44:41.705 --> 00:44:43.105
It's a drug.

00:44:46.385 --> 00:44:48.105
That's why no one heard anything.

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:49.905
The murderer added Datura flowers

00:44:49.985 --> 00:44:51.625
to the incense

00:44:51.705 --> 00:44:53.825
and put everyone in the manor to sleep.

00:44:53.905 --> 00:44:56.865
Mr. Wu called for help,
but no one heard him.

00:44:56.945 --> 00:44:59.025
The murderer was so cruel.
