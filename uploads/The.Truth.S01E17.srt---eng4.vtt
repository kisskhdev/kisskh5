=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 17=

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.800
You actually underestimated us.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.041
Something like this is nothing for us.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.240
You think you could hide it?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.681
Be honest.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.240
You two were so close.

00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:32.520
You must know what happened to him.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
What happened?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.440
Liao Guangyong is dead.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.041
What? He's dead?

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.041
H-How did he die?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.440
Based on the evidence we have,

00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:51.641
this woman might be the murderer.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.201
She killed Mr. Liao?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.041
Mr. Liao lent you his car.

00:01:56.561 --> 00:02:00.160
So you might have a motive
to kill him too.

00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:02.001
Th-This has nothing to do with me!

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.641
Y-You should go arrest this woman!

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.481
B-But due to insufficient evidence,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.720
we can't arrest her.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.600
Officer,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.200
p-protect me!

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.160
Sit down and talk.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:10.880
Okay.

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:13.760
Actually,

00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:17.440
I had nothing to do with that car crash.

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:19.880
I...

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.440
It was Mr. Liao.

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:23.600
He drank.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.040
H-He was driving the car.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.401
I was sitting in the back seat.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.600
After hitting a person, he ran off.

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.440
He left me alone in the car.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.440
He wanted me to take the fall.

00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:37.561
I got my license five or six years ago,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.961
but I've never driven since.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600
How could I possibly drive
and hit someone?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.401
I...

00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:49.361
I was short on money at that time.

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.801
My mom was sick.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.760
My kid needed school fees.

00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:58.401
So, I...

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.760
No rush.

00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:04.241
Take your time.

00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:27.801
Dad.

00:03:30.081 --> 00:03:30.880
Dad.

00:03:56.281 --> 00:03:58.640
Looks like he might have bone damage.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.920
The bruising is severe too.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.208
Need to reduce inflammation.

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:03.001
I saw his medical history.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.241
He has a history of Alzheimer's?

00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:05.920
Yes.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.801
Let's observe him for a few hours first.

00:04:10.136 --> 00:04:11.920
Once the outpatient service opens
tomorrow,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.880
go get a CT scan.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.480
Got it.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.961
That's all.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.001
Thanks.

00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:21.801
Hello?

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:22.481
Captain Leng.

00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:23.960
Jiao, what's up?

00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:27.200
We might have found the connection
between Zhao Junxin and Jiang Yuzhen.

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:30.161
Young people have agile minds.

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:31.801
I only focused on checking surveillance,

00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:33.481
but Long came up with a good idea.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.361
Long, you explain.

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:36.200
Captain Leng, here's the thing.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.440
Most payments are now made online,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.640
with payment notifications.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.400
If she used a card,
there'd be a text alert.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.121
So,

00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:45.640
I looked for relevant pushes and texts
they received in the last six months.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.880
And I actually found something.

00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:50.601
Zhao Junxin and Jiang Yuzhen once went
to a children's playground

00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:52.760
at the same time, on the same day,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.840
literally minutes apart.

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.481
Playground? Where is it?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.320
This guy sure has an appetite.

00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:42.001
He is already stuffed
but still has room for bubble tea.

00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:44.681
But he really knows
how to keep his cool.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.320
After gaining so much dirty money,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.280
I thought he'd be splurging
and showing off like crazy.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.080
Of course, he wants to show off.

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:53.721
He hasn't had the money,

00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:55.681
but he's already started
looking at new big houses

00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:57.681
that he actually can't afford.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.601
Is he truly keeping his cool?

00:06:00.721 --> 00:06:01.880
The insurance company refuses

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.960
to pay out now
by citing the ongoing investigation,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.200
and he can't sell the watches
or jewelry,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.760
or he would start to spend.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.801
I don't need a cab. Just go.

00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:28.361
Ye, I've hit another dead end.

00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:30.280
Where do you think he hid the stuff?

00:07:30.361 --> 00:07:31.601
We've gone through his place,

00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:32.561
yet found nothing.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.280
No entries in his
or Jiang Yuzhen's accounts either.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.561
After the crime,

00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:42.161
he's stayed
within a 5-kilometer radius of his home.

00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:43.960
He hasn't gone any further.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.520
The stolen goods should be
within this area.

00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:48.760
But this area is way too big.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.361
We can't possibly search everywhere.

00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:58.280
Just follow him.

00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:51.121
So?

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.361
So you lied.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.321
The surveillance video shows it clearly.

00:08:57.201 --> 00:08:59.361
You spoke with Jiang Yuzhen.

00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:01.760
And it wasn't a short conversation.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.361
Do you know what we talked about?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.361
Aren't you worried at all?

00:09:11.441 --> 00:09:13.160
What do I have to worry about?

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.121
I committed a crime.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.361
I killed Jiang Yuzhen
and Liao Guangyong,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.321
including his mistress

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.160
and the child in her belly.

00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:27.961
Put it all on me.

00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.160
I killed them all.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.001
My child died.

00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:39.201
They

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.601
won't get away alive.

00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:46.280
Zhao Junxin.

00:09:47.081 --> 00:09:48.560
The country has laws.

00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:51.961
If you insist on this,
none of us can help you.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.800
Anything else you want to ask?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.081
If not, I'm going back.

00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.001
(So are you really at ease now?)

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.520
(Does it still hurt
when you think of your child?)

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.241
(I haven't dreamed of my child
in a long time.)

00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:15.361
(Maybe he blames me for killing
and doesn't want to see me.)

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.241
(Because you're not a loony.)

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.800
(It's not that you're unafraid.)

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.560
(You can only lie to yourself
that you did this for your child.)

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.721
(Will doing this bring your child back?)

00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:39.441
If nothing unexpected happens,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.601
this is our second-to-last time meeting.

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:45.241
Next time...

00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:46.081
Zhao Junxin,

00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:48.280
you'll keep your word, right?

00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:51.481
Don't let me finish the job
and then you...

00:10:53.081 --> 00:10:55.001
You don't need to doubt me.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.880
To be honest,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.280
I wish I were you

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.321
so that I could personally have revenge.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.880
Poisoning him is too good for him.

00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:10.481
You wouldn't want to live my life.

00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:14.680
I'm already like this anyway.

00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:16.680
I'll just take the gamble.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.441
I trust you.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.880
Let's stick to what we agreed before.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.601
Wait for my message.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.520
Don't worry.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.481
(No. My child won't come back.)

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.481
(So stop lying to yourself.)

00:14:00.081 --> 00:14:03.121
(Think carefully
about what's right and what's wrong.)

00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:06.040
(Revenge isn't a free pass
for "lynching".)

00:14:06.441 --> 00:14:08.560
(The law is the measure of justice.)

00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:31.081
(CT Interventional Suite)
Family of Leng Xingguo?

00:14:33.624 --> 00:14:34.841
The wound has been treated.

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:35.680
Nothing serious.

00:14:35.768 --> 00:14:36.481
Here's his bill.

00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:37.920
Go pay over there.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.721
Liu Yang.

00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:46.121
Did you know
Captain Leng's dad was hospitalized?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.081
I heard the hired nurse wasn't reliable.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.680
She got off work early.

00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:52.241
So, his dad fell at home.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.800
Should we go visit him?

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.121
Forget it.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.481
I don't think
Captain Leng wants us to go.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.520
If you make a big deal about it,
Captain Leng won't be happy.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.400
Also,

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.841
be careful of buttering him up
in the wrong way.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:27.662
(No-Name Diner)

00:15:27.721 --> 00:15:29.081
The soup I made for you is ready.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.400
Just a moment.

00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:37.800
Stop working.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.280
You have the soup.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.560
Just leave the rest of the work to me.

00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:44.520
No, you get muddled
when you do the accounts.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.441
I'll do it myself.

00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:46.520
It'll be done soon.

00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.601
Look, you haven't slept well lately.

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:53.680
Have some soup to nourish yourself,
and it'll help you sleep better.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.520
Please.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.880
It's almost done, you...

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.121
Having the soup matters now.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.841
That's so much.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.680
Let me do this.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.481
It's been incredibly busy.

00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:08.680
Qiming hasn't come by either.

00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:11.040
I haven't even had time
to ask about his dad.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.961
When the hired nurse left early,

00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:16.520
his dad took a fall.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.680
Qiming's been worried sick over it.

00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:22.121
At that age, a fall is serious.

00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:22.800
Yeah.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.321
What's wrong with that nurse?

00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:25.441
She is irresponsible.

00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:28.880
I'll make some good food tomorrow
for his dad.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160
Alas.

00:16:32.201 --> 00:16:33.001
Delicious.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.560
When we get old,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.241
it's tough not having our son around.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.081
I've already thought it through.

00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:45.880
After I retire,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.721
we'll find a nice nursing home.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.201
We can cook every day, watch the sea,

00:16:52.481 --> 00:16:54.040
and take good care of ourselves.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.040
Just live our lives well.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.560
Jiao.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.081
I dreamed about our son the other day.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.241
He said a lot to me.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.681
He told us to take care of ourselves.

00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:10.001
If we live well,

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.881
he will rest in peace.

00:17:16.921 --> 00:17:17.721
Indeed,

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.520
we need to take care of ourselves

00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:21.201
and live well.

00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:23.320
Setting our son at ease matters most.

00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:33.441
Hello? Ziwu.

00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:35.001
What's up?

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.441
Nothing.

00:18:37.881 --> 00:18:39.721
I didn't call about work.

00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:42.201
Go ahead.

00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:46.040
How's your dad?

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.280
Is he okay?

00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:49.001
He's fine.

00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:50.481
He is already asleep.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.921
You should rest early
if there is nothing else.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.881
Oh, Ziwu.

00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:06.481
Please clean up the crime scene reports

00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:09.320
on the Fuquan Community

00:19:09.921 --> 00:19:12.001
and the Central Hospital.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.721
Make sure nothing's missed.

00:19:15.201 --> 00:19:17.280
Okay. Good night.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.520
Hello? Mr. Li.

00:19:27.681 --> 00:19:28.320
Enough.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.800
Stop apologizing.

00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:33.481
I don't have time
to claim compensation from you.

00:19:34.001 --> 00:19:35.721
Just hurry up

00:19:35.721 --> 00:19:37.600
and find me a reliable nurse quickly.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.560
The sooner, the better. Okay?

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.520
Thank you.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.681
Good. Okay.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.161
(Ziwu.)

00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:00.520
(Did the tests show any leads?)

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.681
Yes.

00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:04.401
Let's hear it.

00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:15.641
Wait, just a sec.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.401
Well, at the crime scene,

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.360
from the blood droplets near the victim,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.040
I extracted two sets of DNA.

00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:30.481
The first set
belongs to the victim himself.

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:33.600
I checked. It's not from his relatives.

00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:36.280
The other set is unknown.

00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:38.001
Not exactly unknown,

00:20:38.001 --> 00:20:42.681
it's just an unidentified DNA profile.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.320
It could have been left by the suspect.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.800
DNA tests gave us a direction.

00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:51.080
Right.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.881
It's so late.

00:21:47.721 --> 00:21:48.721
You're still working?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.721
Sorry, Captain Leng.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.120
I disturbed your rest.

00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:55.320
I saw the light on here from my office.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.520
So I wanted to turn it off.

00:21:56.721 --> 00:21:57.800
Then I saw you sleeping.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.921
I thought the light might bother you.

00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.040
So I went to turn it off,
but then you woke up.

00:22:03.921 --> 00:22:05.040
Head home early.

00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:06.881
Write reports tomorrow.

00:22:08.001 --> 00:22:08.961
I'll walk you back.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.921
No need, Captain Leng.

00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:12.472
I live very close.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.320
I live there too. It's on my way.

00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:16.441
Go pack up your stuff.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.320
Yes.

00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:28.040
Captain Leng.

00:22:35.001 --> 00:22:35.721
Captain Leng.

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:36.441
Going to lunch?

00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:37.320
Okay.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.481
Is this all you're having for lunch?

00:22:46.744 --> 00:22:48.040
I just grabbed something quick.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.921
I'm not very hungry.

00:22:50.961 --> 00:22:52.600
I got you a sandwich.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.161
For me?

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.161
Thank you.

00:22:56.161 --> 00:22:58.921
And some tomatoes.

00:22:59.161 --> 00:23:00.161
Captain Leng, I...

00:23:02.161 --> 00:23:03.560
Do you already have the results?

00:23:05.241 --> 00:23:06.520
Let me do a final check.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.280
I'll print it out

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.441
and bring it to you.

00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:09.120
Okay.

00:23:09.441 --> 00:23:10.201
Eat.

00:23:13.641 --> 00:23:14.800
No need, I...

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.001
It's sweet.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.961
You like tomatoes?

00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:21.721
Yes, to get vitamins.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.360
Finish your lunch.

00:23:51.481 --> 00:23:52.360
Morning, Ziwu.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.384
(Yongguang Supermarket)

00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:00.320
Qian.

00:25:00.881 --> 00:25:02.161
The suspect entered the mall,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.384
going to the second floor.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.921
Still on him?

00:25:05.201 --> 00:25:06.280
Not many people inside.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.360
Can't get too close.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.800
Got it.

00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:11.161
Keep your distance.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.280
Did he go to the lockers?

00:26:13.241 --> 00:26:13.881
Yes.

00:26:14.401 --> 00:26:15.481
Leaving already?

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.481
He went into a store,

00:26:19.481 --> 00:26:20.481
ordered, and took a seat.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.201
Okay.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.320
Probably it'll take a while.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.201
He'll head straight
to the bus stop when he leaves.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.961
Keep tailing him.

00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:31.600
I'll loop around.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.800
Meet you at the bus stop.

00:26:57.401 --> 00:27:02.320
Would he really hide stolen goods
in a place like this?

00:27:05.481 --> 00:27:08.040
These self-service lockers
are the least conspicuous.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.201
Usually, no one pays them any mind.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.681
After the crime,

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.120
Geng Tianchou visited this supermarket
every day,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.921
yet never shopped.

00:27:14.921 --> 00:27:16.360
He just wandered around and left.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.360
He's not the homemaker type.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.961
So he went there for the lockers.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.161
But shouldn't this place have cameras?

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.760
Yes.

00:27:26.001 --> 00:27:27.080
But due to camera angles,

00:27:27.921 --> 00:27:30.280
only the two rows
he approached are covered.

00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:33.681
We haven't confirmed
the exact right locker.

00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:35.560
Quite certain?

00:27:35.681 --> 00:27:36.280
Yes.

00:27:36.881 --> 00:27:39.001
But ideally, we catch him red-handed.

00:27:39.921 --> 00:27:43.840
We have evidence against Jiang Yuzhen
and Zhao Junxin individually.

00:27:44.481 --> 00:27:47.080
Yet proving collusion is trickier.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.840
Zhao Junxin remains silent.

00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:53.881
Geng Tianchou is more likely to slip up.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.280
Three's enough.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.481
Save some.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.681
It's pretty sweet.

00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:02.241
Alright.

00:28:18.441 --> 00:28:19.641
Come on.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.080
Who is it? Give me a break!

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.401
This is CID.

00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:31.161
We found a bag
and phone likely belonging

00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:32.600
to your mother, Jiang Yuzhen.

00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:34.280
Come identify them.

00:28:35.641 --> 00:28:36.600
Impossible.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.040
When?

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.961
I'm about to get off work.

00:28:41.481 --> 00:28:42.201
Come tomorrow.

00:28:42.201 --> 00:28:44.040
Wait, what did you say?

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:44.800
Hello?

00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:19.520
Locker 12.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.641
Door open.

00:29:20.641 --> 00:29:22.401
Close the door
after retrieving your items.

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:24.441
Locker 01.

00:29:24.441 --> 00:29:25.560
Door open.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.401
Close the door
after retrieving your items.

00:29:27.608 --> 00:29:28.628
Gosh!

00:29:29.001 --> 00:29:30.080
I'm quite scared.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.961
I've told you many times.

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:58.881
I really don't know
where the stuff came from.

00:29:58.881 --> 00:30:00.560
My mom gave it to me
before she left home.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.881
She told me to hide it well.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.681
Your mom told you to hide it?

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.641
Did you know what was inside?

00:30:05.641 --> 00:30:06.520
No, I don't.

00:30:06.961 --> 00:30:07.760
Really?

00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:09.520
Then why go to the sales office

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.401
and the bank?

00:30:10.681 --> 00:30:11.401
Why?

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.080
I was just hanging out.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.201
What's wrong with that?

00:30:14.721 --> 00:30:15.520
Look where you are.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.641
Watch your attitude.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.881
Weren't you even a little curious?

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.241
My mom told me to.

00:30:23.241 --> 00:30:24.800
She wouldn't hurt me.

00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:27.241
Did you find the locker yourself?

00:30:27.641 --> 00:30:29.280
No, my mom did it.

00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:31.001
I truly know nothing.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.641
Last time, when we asked
about the bag and phone,

00:30:33.921 --> 00:30:34.881
why did you lie?

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.881
My mom told me to hide them.

00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:38.080
So I listened to her.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.881
You're a grown adult.

00:30:41.001 --> 00:30:42.600
You just blindly do whatever she says?

00:30:42.721 --> 00:30:44.040
Even if it's illegal?

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.760
I didn't know it was illegal!

00:30:46.681 --> 00:30:47.800
You didn't know?

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.481
Let me tell you now.

00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:55.681
Current evidence strongly suggests
your mother murdered and stole.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.881
And you're covering up her crimes.

00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:02.161
What?

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.560
But I really didn't know anything!

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.080
He is heartless.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.120
He pinned all the bad stuff on his mom.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.040
Then tell us

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.241
what Jiang Yuzhen did
on the day of the crime.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.520
Again?

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.881
I've said it so many times.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:23.881
Fine.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.481
My mom came back
from the Fuquan Community that day.

00:31:27.481 --> 00:31:29.401
Didn't you guys drop her off
at the gate?

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.120
The next day, she went

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.280
to the hospital to see Liao.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.040
And then she...

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.040
Did Jiang Yuzhen go out in between?

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.481
Probably not.

00:31:38.481 --> 00:31:39.921
She just did what she used to do.

00:31:39.921 --> 00:31:40.881
She cooked for me

00:31:40.881 --> 00:31:42.681
and sorted through her junk.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.888
When did she give you the stolen goods?

00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:47.961
Before she went to the hospital.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800
What exactly did she say?

00:31:50.401 --> 00:31:51.641
She didn't say much.

00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:53.120
She just told me to hide the stuff

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.392
and not to let anyone find it.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.921
Think again.

00:31:56.241 --> 00:31:57.401
The day before the crime,

00:31:57.961 --> 00:31:59.881
did Jiang Yuzhen do anything unusual?

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.760
I really don't know.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.681
I didn't notice.

00:32:05.241 --> 00:32:07.520
When did you find the insurance?

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.201
I found it after the incident.

00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:14.840
It was right under her pillow.

00:32:17.481 --> 00:32:19.560
How did you find out
Jiang Yuzhen was in trouble?

00:32:21.241 --> 00:32:24.001
Someone told me.

00:32:24.001 --> 00:32:24.921
Who told you?

00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:30.401
Liao's wife.

00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:33.641
You know Miao Xiaolan?

00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:36.401
How do you know her?

00:32:38.401 --> 00:32:40.600
My mom worked for them for years.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.921
When I was little,
my mom took me to their home for meals.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.641
Back then, Liao wasn't a big shot yet.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.481
When exactly did she
send you the message?

00:32:49.681 --> 00:32:50.760
What exactly did it say?

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.040
It was that afternoon.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.641
I don't remember the exact time.

00:32:54.641 --> 00:32:56.280
She suddenly sent me a text,

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.441
saying my mom was in trouble

00:32:57.441 --> 00:32:58.441
and at Central Hospital.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.800
Anything else?

00:33:07.241 --> 00:33:08.481
Do you know Miao Xiaolan well?

00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:11.080
Not really, but my mom does.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.481
They were old neighbors, after all.

00:33:12.961 --> 00:33:13.961
Old neighbors?

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.161
Didn't you know?

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.001
They were neighbors

00:33:18.001 --> 00:33:20.120
and classmates at primary school.

00:33:57.848 --> 00:34:03.768
(Tomatoes are delicious.)

00:34:32.952 --> 00:34:37.432
(Longyan)

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.481
Is your boss in?

00:34:39.481 --> 00:34:40.441
My boss is inside.

00:34:41.321 --> 00:34:42.441
Okay. Thanks.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.640
Want something to eat?

00:35:04.321 --> 00:35:05.160
No money on me.

00:35:06.881 --> 00:35:07.881
My treat.

00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:08.720
I told you.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.281
I'm not here to eat.

00:35:13.801 --> 00:35:14.761
So?

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.080
I came to see you.

00:35:20.881 --> 00:35:22.281
You don't have to.

00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:23.281
Same as usual.

00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:27.401
I've been working in the kitchen.

00:35:27.401 --> 00:35:28.921
I even learned how to cook salmon.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.520
That doesn't sound like you.

00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:35.080
Well, I'm free now.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.921
I might as well learn a skill.

00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:39.801
If this store ever shuts down,

00:35:39.801 --> 00:35:40.640
and I'm broke,

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.881
I can be a chef.

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:44.401
Count me in.

00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.080
I'm half a chef myself.

00:35:47.801 --> 00:35:49.160
I haven't forgiven you, you know.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.160
Si Yuanlong gave me a game console.
I cut you into pieces on it every day.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.040
Fair enough.

00:36:19.001 --> 00:36:19.720
I'm fine.

00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:21.560
Don't worry.

00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:33.281
I'm sorry.

00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:38.080
We've known each other
since kindergarten.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.281
No need to apologize.

00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:42.680
I know.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.761
Love fades away,

00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:47.600
yet friendship will remain.

00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:56.080
Alright, I've got work to do.

00:36:56.321 --> 00:36:57.441
Help yourself.

00:37:17.481 --> 00:37:19.001
It's pretty busy today.

00:37:19.361 --> 00:37:20.600
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:37:21.361 --> 00:37:22.160
Thanks.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:22.881
Not at all.

00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:24.240
Lei.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.321
Lei.

00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:28.281
Captain Hao.

00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:28.801
Come on in.

00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:30.160
There are seats here. Over here.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.600
Okay.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.481
- Over here.
- Okay.

00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:33.001
I haven't seen you lately.

00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:34.200
What case are you working on?

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:35.640
Sit.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.080
Still on the fraud case.

00:37:37.481 --> 00:37:38.560
- Hi.
- It's been almost a year.

00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:40.080
It's finally wrapping up.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.640
Look, I've worked my hair right off.

00:37:43.481 --> 00:37:44.841
Come on, you were already bald.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.600
- Come on.
- Sit.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.520
Come on, sit down.

00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:50.361
Order whatever you want today.

00:37:50.361 --> 00:37:51.512
We have new dishes now.

00:37:52.056 --> 00:37:54.881
My apprentice said he'll treat us
to a feast once the case is closed.

00:37:54.881 --> 00:37:56.281
Yeah, my treat.

00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:57.200
Jiao places your order.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.321
I'll go cook for you.

00:37:58.761 --> 00:37:59.640
New dish, huh?

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.441
Is your plan going to work?

00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:09.560
What if that guy just stays at home?

00:38:10.001 --> 00:38:10.801
He can't wait.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.401
How so?

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.680
I checked his account.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.080
He just tipped over 10,000
on a livestream platform.

00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:20.040
His balance is down
to pocket change now.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.560
If he doesn't figure out a way
to make money,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.001
he'll soon be going hungry.

00:38:31.881 --> 00:38:34.441
I did send a text message to Tian.

00:38:35.401 --> 00:38:37.600
His mom left his phone number
with us before.

00:38:38.281 --> 00:38:40.080
Such a big thing happened that day.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.441
How could I not tell him?

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.520
It's just that at the time,
my mind was such a mess.

00:38:45.921 --> 00:38:47.560
So I didn't get a chance to tell you.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.200
Did it cause any problems for your work?

00:38:54.281 --> 00:38:55.200
No, not really.

00:38:56.001 --> 00:38:57.281
We're just here to confirm

00:38:57.281 --> 00:38:59.160
if the message came from you.

00:39:01.441 --> 00:39:03.001
Do you know Geng Tianchou well?

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.680
Not really.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.120
I just met him a very long time ago.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.281
You and Jiang Yuzhen
weren't just old neighbors,

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.560
but classmates at primary school?

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.560
Why didn't you tell us this before?

00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:25.080
I didn't mind,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.881
but Jiang cares about pride.

00:39:29.001 --> 00:39:30.761
She's proud.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.961
She didn't want others
to know about that.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.961
Even Liao didn't know.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.560
So tell us everything
you haven't said yet.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.841
You mean the car accident
a few years back?

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.200
At the time,

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.961
I truly didn't agree
with Liao's actions.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.600
I didn't support him,

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.761
but the company was
at a critical moment in fundraising.

00:39:55.921 --> 00:39:57.200
So I didn't intervene.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.841
It's just that they were so pitiful.

00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:01.680
So I told Liao

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.080
to give them more money in compensation.

00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:08.560
Do you think money can solve everything?

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.240
Of course not.

00:40:11.481 --> 00:40:13.080
But the thing had already happened.

00:40:13.801 --> 00:40:15.881
Monetary compensation is better
than nothing, right?

00:40:18.321 --> 00:40:19.640
Did Jiang Yuzhen know?

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.481
Yes.

00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:25.080
Did she also know
Liao found someone to take the fall?

00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:27.240
Yes.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.841
Then, did she know Zhao Junxin?

00:40:34.881 --> 00:40:36.281
She probably did.

00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:38.761
In that very neighborhood,

00:40:39.128 --> 00:40:40.640
Zhao Junxin put up a protest banner.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.481
It was Xiao Jiang
who saw it and told me.

00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:46.281
So, do you think

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:52.040
it's possible that Jiang Yuzhen
and Zhao Junxin knew each other before?

00:40:55.441 --> 00:40:58.361
Xiao Jiang and Zhao Junxin...

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.361
Jiang Yuzhen had cancer.

00:41:01.361 --> 00:41:02.200
Terminal.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.881
She bought herself
high-value life insurance.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.160
Well...

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.401
Do you still send SMS messages?

00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:30.401
Now, people use WeChat.

00:41:31.441 --> 00:41:32.801
What if you're not WeChat friends?

00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:35.481
Then I'll make a call directly.

00:41:37.321 --> 00:41:39.801
Master, I also think

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.560
it's not quite normal
that Miao Xiaolan texted Geng Tianchou.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.240
What I'm thinking now is,

00:41:48.841 --> 00:41:51.801
could there be another person?

00:41:54.281 --> 00:41:55.160
Miao Xiaolan?

00:41:55.761 --> 00:41:56.921
It's hard to say right now.

00:41:58.441 --> 00:42:01.881
Miao Xiaolan was previously excluded
since she had no means to carry it out.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.240
But considering the motive,

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.240
she never mentioned the theft at all.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.680
If it's not that she doesn't care,

00:42:12.481 --> 00:42:13.401
it must be

00:42:14.441 --> 00:42:17.640
that she likely knew from the start
that Jiang Yuzhen took the stuff,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.672
and that she even tacitly allowed it.

00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:22.841
Look into Miao Xiaolan again.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.520
Release Geng Tianchou for now.
