WEBVTT

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.014
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:36.474
SAMDOORI BARBECUE
ON HOLIDAY FROM SEPT 23 TO OCT 3

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:37.933
EPISODE 13

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.230
You'd better clean up properly, okay?

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:44.690
- Bring the keys...
- I'll bring the keys

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:46.692
to your restaurant tomorrow morning.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:48.235
You've told me a million times.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.572
The judge really only rubs elbows
with the big shots, doesn't he?

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:53.949
Can't believe I made him do dishes.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.701
It's okay, he's my friend.

00:00:56.243 --> 00:00:57.578
Leave the place spotless, okay?

00:00:57.662 --> 00:00:59.455
Or I'll be too ashamed to see Ae-ja again.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:01.040
I'm scared of Ms. Ae-ja, too, okay?

00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:03.459
- Bye!
- Don't forget the keys!

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.685
All thanks to you

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:25.690
the attack dog of the National Assembly is
now the nation's favorite pet.

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:30.695
Everyone gives me
the sweetest smiles these days.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:32.029
It's so sweet, really.

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:35.408
Quite a lot of market vendor owners

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.452
donate their money
to Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:41.122
With each small, but meaningful donation
they make

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:44.208
they hope to contribute
to the tuition fees of those in need

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.211
and cover the medical bills
of rare disease patients.

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:49.964
That was why I attacked Gwang-to.

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:53.759
Thanks to that, I gained popularity

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:56.637
and I'll likely be nominated by my party
in the next election.

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:00.057
I'll pay for the food tonight.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:03.602
Let's call it even

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:05.604
with that.

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:33.007
Wow, I didn't realize
I was sitting on a gold mine.

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:37.803
Convince these members of the Assembly

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:40.347
with no chances of getting nominated

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:44.018
and propose a Special Counsel Act
for the former president.

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:45.519
Didn't you say you'd rip him open

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:48.230
and that all I needed to do was
leave a scar?

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:49.523
That's what the money is for.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:52.777
This is a billion won.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.488
Use it as your campaigning funds.

00:02:59.575 --> 00:03:01.577
And that's for your friends
in the Assembly.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.879
Everyone has been so sweet to me lately.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:13.506
Surprisingly

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.759
that makes me not want to take
all this money.

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:19.678
I'm off.

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.225
The lease deposit for your house is
500 million won, correct?

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:27.812
And

00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:31.732
you'll still say no to two billion won?

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:48.624
The average Korean has
less than 500 million won in assets.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.251
I've been doing my best

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:51.961
to stay average as a politician

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:53.671
but my wife is too savvy, you know?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.550
What would you have done

00:03:57.925 --> 00:03:59.426
had I taken the bribe?

00:04:01.762 --> 00:04:02.930
I would've understood you.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.641
Not disappointed?

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:07.685
I'm not asking you to push
the Special Counsel Act

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:09.895
to do anything bad for society.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.567
But if they strike back,
I won't get nominated.

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:16.861
I don't want that.

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:19.154
Who do you think will be
Gwang-to's first target

00:04:19.697 --> 00:04:21.824
once he's released?

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.496
It looks like I've put a leash on myself.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.377
It's okay if your proposal fails.

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:36.463
Just get people worked up

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.008
to keep Mr. Park on his toes.

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:48.726
The prosecution will form
a special team for Mr. President

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.520
before the opposition proposes
a Special Counsel Act.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.398
It's a shield, in a sense.

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:56.984
Any prosecutor you'd recommend?

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:00.029
I don't have any recommendations

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:02.197
but once the special team sends the list

00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:04.241
I'll analyze it and report to you.

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:05.951
There may be some on the list

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:07.286
who may go against your plan.

00:05:08.954 --> 00:05:09.955
And you?

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.753
Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo would do well.

00:05:16.045 --> 00:05:17.171
No.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.256
He's the one who caused all this.

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:21.675
And why?

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.136
Cheol-woo only looks ahead.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.888
As long as he has a reason

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:27.765
he'll do everything you want.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.142
He might not understand you

00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:32.227
and go overboard
with striking Mr. President.

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:33.729
No.

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.606
What Sin-jin really wants is

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.317
to get rid of Gwang-to for good.

00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:41.737
Arresting all bad guys, no matter what.

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:43.656
That's what justice is to me.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:47.451
It wouldn't look so good

00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:49.995
for the team to be
without the one who started it all.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:52.164
- Mr. Kang.
- Don't worry.

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:55.250
We'll just get rid of him
if he causes trouble.

00:06:07.054 --> 00:06:09.056
If Cheol-woo causes any issues

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:12.685
you'll have to take the responsibility.

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:16.313
It'll be fine.

00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:18.065
As it should be.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:29.785
HERE'S THE REQUESTED INFORMATION

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:32.705
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KIM JIN-HAN

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:43.632
Didn't know

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:45.718
Judge Lee was here.

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:50.264
But who's this guy?

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:54.059
What happened

00:06:54.685 --> 00:06:55.769
with Tae-seong?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.605
You have no idea who got in the way?

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:02.109
Well...

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.282
I ran into a big guy on my way down

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:12.202
after I thought I'd killed Tae-seong.

00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:15.330
A big guy...

00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:31.555
How's Mr. Gwak Sun-won?

00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:38.520
So, you have no idea

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:40.397
when he'll wake up.

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:43.442
Okay, then.

00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:52.618
Get out.

00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:53.994
- Ma'am!
- Just go!

00:07:54.078 --> 00:07:56.163
If you write about any rumors
about the green belt

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:57.289
I'll sue you!

00:07:57.372 --> 00:07:59.249
- Leave me alone.
- Ma'am!

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:01.877
Wait! Just give me a minute to explain.

00:08:02.628 --> 00:08:04.004
Did someone named Jang Myeong-ja

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:05.672
buy a plot of land?

00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:07.424
Who? Jang?

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:09.301
What are you talking about?

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:14.264
It's all on the Real Estate Statistics
and Transactions Report.

00:08:14.348 --> 00:08:15.349
Look at it.

00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:17.476
Someone named Jang Myeong-ja bought land.

00:08:19.937 --> 00:08:21.146
Whatever.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.482
A man brought all the documents.

00:08:25.192 --> 00:08:26.485
Exactly.

00:08:27.152 --> 00:08:28.237
Excuse me, then.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.374
Hey, Mr. Lee. It's me.

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:41.792
This looks delicious.

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:43.335
Thank you.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:48.465
Ms. Jang Myeong-ja works
as a cleaning lady

00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:50.008
at Suojae.

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:52.427
Guess where I saw her name.

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:55.806
It must be
one of Gwang-to's shell accounts.

00:08:56.265 --> 00:08:57.266
Oh, my.

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:00.227
Guess what the account was used for, then.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.478
If it was recent

00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:04.148
it must've been used to buy land
in Hanyang's green belt zone.

00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:05.482
No way.

00:09:06.692 --> 00:09:08.527
I guess you visited Hanyang recently?

00:09:08.861 --> 00:09:10.529
I didn't need to go there to know this.

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:16.118
You have the hunch of a detective.

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.202
So, you'll write about it?

00:09:17.286 --> 00:09:19.288
Wait! You can't eat it like that.

00:09:19.454 --> 00:09:21.665
You have to dip it in this

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:22.958
and swirl it around.

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:24.626
Here. Try it now.

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:30.549
It's good, right?

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:33.719
Darn it.

00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:36.513
There's no way I can write about this
for Daejin Daily.

00:09:36.597 --> 00:09:38.515
As soon as I mention Seonjin

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:39.600
it won't make it

00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:41.602
out of the office.

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:43.312
But you know

00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:45.147
there are

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.233
over 10,000 internet news outlets
in Korea.

00:09:48.317 --> 00:09:51.612
I'll choose one of them, and...

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.039
Do you admit to having hidden
500 billion won in slush funds

00:10:02.122 --> 00:10:03.373
at Jeongdaun Savings?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.585
You don't need to answer him.

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:10.255
I hear Ms. Kim is

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:12.674
now in Hyenam.

00:10:14.468 --> 00:10:15.969
I doubt that she'll get to return.

00:10:21.642 --> 00:10:23.936
So, what's your name?

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:31.068
HYENAM DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:10:33.403 --> 00:10:35.239
Man, that's a lot.

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:43.121
This is a case of serial theft
at Ms. Kim Mal-sun's cabbage patch

00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:44.831
in Baekbang-ri.

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:47.668
Serial theft at a cabbage patch?

00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:48.752
Yeah.

00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:50.587
No less than 17 heads of cabbage

00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:53.048
disappeared in the past three weeks.

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:55.008
The whole village is worried.

00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:57.803
There aren't any surveillance cameras

00:10:57.886 --> 00:11:00.013
so it'll likely end up an unresolved case.

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:02.724
What about this?

00:11:02.808 --> 00:11:04.351
That's also from Baekbang-ri.

00:11:04.851 --> 00:11:06.395
It's a case of an assault on Kkamang

00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:08.438
the village chief's breeding goat.

00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:11.733
The breeding goat?

00:11:11.817 --> 00:11:14.194
Yeah, we have breeding chickens for chicks

00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:16.196
and breeding goats for baby goats.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.199
Baekgoo, Mr. Choi's dog
who lives next door to the village chief

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:21.076
bit Kkamang's butt

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:23.704
but they couldn't reach a settlement deal

00:11:23.787 --> 00:11:26.665
so the village chief sued Mr. Choi
for property damage.

00:11:30.502 --> 00:11:32.796
Where do you even get all these cases?

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.214
Who told you to collect them?

00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:37.801
Well, who else

00:11:37.884 --> 00:11:40.971
but the Chief
and the Head of the Department...

00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:43.348
They also told me

00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:47.519
to tell you to stick
to what you're ordered to do here.

00:11:50.647 --> 00:11:52.733
- Mr. Kim.
- Yeah?

00:11:52.816 --> 00:11:54.901
Place the suspect, Baekgoo,
under emergency arrest.

00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:58.280
- Huh?
- The suspect...

00:11:58.363 --> 00:11:59.823
No, the suspect dog.

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:01.908
Don't forget to read him his rights
at arrest

00:12:01.992 --> 00:12:04.036
and no kibble until he confesses.

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.579
No chew sticks

00:12:05.662 --> 00:12:07.205
or bones, either.

00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:09.791
Only give him water, alright?

00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:14.296
You may go.

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:17.382
I gave her all the trivial cases we had.

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:19.760
CHIEF PROSECUTOR OH JAE-PIL

00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:21.094
Of course not.

00:12:21.178 --> 00:12:22.846
She can't have it easy in exile.

00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:29.061
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:31.104
VICTIM STATEMENT FROM KIM MAL-SUN

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:33.273
17 HEADS OF CABBAGE WERE STOLEN
WITH TRACES OF KNIFE MARKS

00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:51.625
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:52.918
Hey, Mr. Kim.

00:12:53.502 --> 00:12:56.129
You know the case of cabbage theft?

00:12:56.755 --> 00:12:59.633
I've done some research,
and it's a really big deal.

00:13:00.217 --> 00:13:03.178
We'll need to ask phone service providers
for location tracking.

00:13:11.728 --> 00:13:13.939
- That's hilarious.
- I know.

00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:23.323
How are things there?

00:13:23.615 --> 00:13:26.868
Life is really nothing much, huh?

00:13:28.412 --> 00:13:30.622
Every day feels like vacation here.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.417
Sorry for interrupting your vacation.

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:34.960
Enjoy your time, then.

00:13:35.043 --> 00:13:36.962
No, wait!

00:13:37.045 --> 00:13:38.672
Did you have something to say?

00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:39.923
Yeah, I did

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:41.633
but you sound too happy.

00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:43.844
I don't want to interrupt your peace.

00:13:44.845 --> 00:13:46.888
Since when were you so considerate?

00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:48.557
What is it?

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.977
The prosecution will form a special team
for Gwang-to's case.

00:13:52.436 --> 00:13:55.355
The team isn't to prosecute him, really.

00:13:56.022 --> 00:13:57.649
I can't wait to see

00:13:57.732 --> 00:13:59.734
what pathetic prosecutors join the team!

00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:02.904
Don't say that

00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:05.240
and be good when they call you, okay?

00:14:06.074 --> 00:14:08.452
Also, call me
as soon as you're back in Seoul.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.170
This is so boring.

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:22.799
Hello!

00:14:27.554 --> 00:14:29.431
There's less than a 10% chance

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:31.600
that he'll wake up.

00:14:36.897 --> 00:14:39.649
Your case of wrongful death suit
is looking likely

00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:42.986
to rule in favor of the victim.

00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:44.404
Sorry?

00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:48.283
And you were on trial
for illegal prescription of narcotics

00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:50.452
at the time.

00:14:59.127 --> 00:15:00.629
What would you like me to do?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.926
This patient has no family.

00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:12.974
He wouldn't want to be
in a vegetative state

00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:16.811
with just a 10% chance of waking up.

00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:21.942
Breaking news.

00:15:22.025 --> 00:15:25.195
New People's Future Party held
an emergency general meeting today

00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:28.949
and decided to introduce
the S Group Special Counsel Act.

00:15:29.032 --> 00:15:30.951
Sure.

00:15:31.034 --> 00:15:33.495
The opposition needs to do its job, too.

00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:34.955
This is to re-investigate

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:37.249
the allegations of political lobbying...

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.338
Call a meeting at Suojae tonight.

00:15:43.964 --> 00:15:46.258
We're in full power
until Mr. President is released.

00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:48.969
Yes, sir.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.980
HERE'S THE REQUESTED INFORMATION

00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:06.486
DAY TWO OF HUNGER STRIKE
UNTIL MR. PARK GWANG-TO IS INVESTIGATED

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.572
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MUST SHOW JUSTICE

00:16:08.655 --> 00:16:10.907
PASS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL ACT
FOR PARK GWANG-TO!

00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:14.327
DAY TWO OF HUNGER STRIKE

00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:21.251
Is this hunger strike to fight

00:16:21.334 --> 00:16:22.919
or to whine?

00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:26.798
I hear it's healthy to starve a few days.

00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:28.425
Let's go.

00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:33.179
What the hell?

00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:38.476
Should I have just shaved my head instead?

00:16:41.605 --> 00:16:44.232
Perfect timing.

00:16:45.442 --> 00:16:47.444
Did you do this?

00:16:47.527 --> 00:16:49.613
FORMER PRESIDENT PARK PURCHASED LAND
UNDER HIS CLEANING LADY'S NAME

00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:53.700
I have to be on my game, you know?

00:16:54.784 --> 00:16:55.827
Impressive.

00:17:04.044 --> 00:17:06.921
So, he acted like everyone's grandfather
only to be all about bribes?

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:09.382
He used his maid's name
to buy land in the green belt.

00:17:09.466 --> 00:17:10.675
He'll definitely get
a special investigation.

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:11.843
The attack dog in the opposition

00:17:11.926 --> 00:17:14.596
is just attacking Mr. Park
for the upcoming election.

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:15.972
Don't be fooled by the lie.

00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:18.016
If he avoids the investigation,
he's guilty.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.102
The special investigation is an excuse
to bully the former President.

00:17:21.186 --> 00:17:23.021
Enjoy your special investigation!

00:17:25.523 --> 00:17:26.566
This...

00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:29.110
What is Sin-jin doing?

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:31.071
What's taking him so long?

00:17:32.989 --> 00:17:33.990
Damn it.

00:17:35.492 --> 00:17:37.035
IF HE AVOIDS THE INVESTIGATION,
HE'S GUILTY

00:17:37.118 --> 00:17:38.620
HE USED HIS MAID'S NAME
TO BUY LAND IN THE GREEN BELT

00:17:38.703 --> 00:17:42.957
PRESIDING JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:44.376
MR. KWAK SANG-CHEOL

00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:46.503
There's no way
I'm starving over three days.

00:17:50.965 --> 00:17:52.425
Just one more day, until tomorrow.

00:17:57.389 --> 00:18:00.058
The tree that Gwang-to is hanging onto
is shaking.

00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:02.936
Gwang-to will strangle Sin-jin to survive

00:18:03.603 --> 00:18:06.731
and Sin-jin will see this as a chance.

00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:11.277
MR. KWAK CONTINUES THE HUNGER STRIKE
FOR A SPECIAL COUNSEL ACT

00:18:11.361 --> 00:18:13.655
DAY TWO OF HUNGER STRIKE

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:17.283
Who do you think will be first

00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:19.619
to stand by me
once the Special Counsel Act is passed?

00:18:20.245 --> 00:18:21.996
I want you to be first.

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:27.627
The prosecution is preparing
a special investigation team.

00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:30.505
There will be no point
in passing the bill, then.

00:18:31.214 --> 00:18:34.175
People are now also talking
about the land purchases in green belt.

00:18:34.926 --> 00:18:36.553
But once that case reaches the court

00:18:36.636 --> 00:18:39.639
they'll just stall time
until it's forgotten.

00:18:41.975 --> 00:18:44.269
I've been thinking about you a lot lately.

00:18:44.894 --> 00:18:47.981
The more I think about it,
the more I realize I know about you.

00:18:49.107 --> 00:18:52.068
Aren't you curious about how much I know?

00:18:55.447 --> 00:18:57.824
I'm always thinking about you, too.

00:19:02.036 --> 00:19:04.205
We'll get you back in Suojae
as soon as possible.

00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:09.878
Sure, looking forward to it.

00:19:35.945 --> 00:19:38.656
DOCTOR CHO JI-YUN

00:19:52.086 --> 00:19:53.963
Please update me every two hours...

00:19:54.047 --> 00:19:55.632
Dr. Cho?

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.186
We'll just get rid of him
if he causes trouble.

00:20:11.981 --> 00:20:13.566
Police officers will be stationed

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.485
to guard Mr. Kwak's room from now on.

00:20:16.194 --> 00:20:17.904
- I see.
- Where is he staying?

00:20:19.072 --> 00:20:21.157
Sin-jin wouldn't just let Sun-won be.

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:23.117
He's in danger.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.119
Please come this way.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.875
Oh, my stomach!

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:32.460
Oh, no!

00:20:33.378 --> 00:20:34.504
My stomach!

00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:36.881
- Sir, are you okay?
- It hurts so much!

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:39.092
- Please help.
- It hurts!

00:20:39.175 --> 00:20:41.344
My stomach hurts so much!

00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:44.264
Oh, gosh.

00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:46.724
I'm in so much pain!

00:20:50.562 --> 00:20:53.273
Hey, I think I might have a gift
for acting.

00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:57.735
Sin-jin will kill Sun-won.

00:20:58.903 --> 00:21:00.530
What? Why would he kill his underling?

00:21:00.613 --> 00:21:03.449
Because from the moment he's arrested,
he'll be Sin-jin's weakness.

00:21:03.533 --> 00:21:05.869
The doctor in charge is in trial
for a case of medical fatality

00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:07.370
and she's likely to be found guilty.

00:21:07.453 --> 00:21:09.998
Sin-jin will try to use that
and bribe her.

00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:13.376
This is ridiculous.

00:21:14.794 --> 00:21:15.795
PROSECUTOR PARK CHEOL-WOO
FROM CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:17.964
When did you wash your feet?

00:21:18.047 --> 00:21:19.591
- They stink.
- Sorry.

00:21:20.341 --> 00:21:21.384
Are you here?

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.643
Sometimes, patients in a coma

00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:33.521
experience unexpected cardiac arrests.

00:21:34.147 --> 00:21:36.149
I want him gone by morning.

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:39.277
Will I not be found guilty, then?

00:21:39.903 --> 00:21:41.654
You'll be found innocent, as promised.

00:21:43.531 --> 00:21:45.325
Okay, I'll keep you updated.

00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:58.463
CHLORIDE

00:22:30.411 --> 00:22:34.248
DR. CHO JI-YUN

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.796
Are you done?

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.261
The court orders

00:22:47.512 --> 00:22:49.347
a reversal of the lower court's judgment.

00:22:52.183 --> 00:22:53.643
The Defendant is found not guilty.

00:23:31.055 --> 00:23:33.224
There seems to have been a problem
at the hospital.

00:23:35.143 --> 00:23:36.185
Sorry?

00:23:37.145 --> 00:23:38.396
I'll check.

00:23:55.913 --> 00:23:56.956
Are you okay?

00:23:57.749 --> 00:23:58.791
Oh, no.

00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:00.626
Doctor!

00:24:03.421 --> 00:24:04.464
What's wrong?

00:24:04.547 --> 00:24:05.798
Please check him.

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:07.467
Let's see.

00:24:28.488 --> 00:24:29.530
Hey, I have to go.

00:24:29.614 --> 00:24:30.990
Hey!

00:24:35.536 --> 00:24:36.537
Hey.

00:24:37.121 --> 00:24:38.456
Sun-won ran off.

00:24:51.135 --> 00:24:52.136
Look at you!

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:55.807
What happened?

00:24:58.226 --> 00:25:00.186
I asked Sin-jin to get you

00:25:00.603 --> 00:25:02.522
in the special investigation team.

00:25:02.605 --> 00:25:03.606
Why?

00:25:04.398 --> 00:25:05.441
Prosecute Gwang-to.

00:25:05.525 --> 00:25:08.319
That's not what the team is for.
It's to help him!

00:25:08.402 --> 00:25:10.780
That's just what Sin-jin is saying
to the Suojae people.

00:25:10.863 --> 00:25:12.281
Sin-jin's real goal is

00:25:12.365 --> 00:25:13.574
to get Gwang-to arrested

00:25:13.658 --> 00:25:15.284
and become Suojae's boss.

00:25:15.368 --> 00:25:18.246
So, you want me to help Sin-jin
achieve his goal?

00:25:18.329 --> 00:25:20.957
We'll get rid of Gwang-to, then Sin-jin.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.583
Don't think about anything else.

00:25:24.502 --> 00:25:25.503
Fine.

00:25:25.753 --> 00:25:26.921
What else should I know?

00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:31.008
Sun-won just escaped

00:25:31.592 --> 00:25:32.885
from the hospital.

00:25:33.553 --> 00:25:34.595
What?

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:37.682
By the way

00:25:38.891 --> 00:25:40.518
you visited Mr. President, right?

00:25:42.145 --> 00:25:43.938
How is he doing?

00:25:44.897 --> 00:25:45.898
How's his health?

00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:51.112
It's crucial
that Suojae stays strong through this.

00:25:53.156 --> 00:25:54.282
Mr. President is well.

00:25:54.365 --> 00:25:55.366
But he's worried

00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:57.785
about the special counsel.

00:25:57.869 --> 00:25:59.370
The special investigation team is

00:26:00.329 --> 00:26:01.497
ready to go.

00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:02.623
I checked

00:26:03.457 --> 00:26:04.792
the list of people on the team.

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:09.422
Mr. President will be released tomorrow
through the detention legality review.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.634
I'm glad to hear that.

00:26:14.552 --> 00:26:16.554
Yes, that's a huge relief.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.983
The opposition is pushing
for special hearing for S Group

00:26:29.066 --> 00:26:30.568
and a special counsel, right?

00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:32.528
We'll do our best

00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:34.697
but stopping both would be...

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.616
They want a special counsel
for everything!

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.620
It's not like those members are
completely clean, either!

00:26:41.537 --> 00:26:42.914
There's not a single soul

00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:45.249
who hasn't taken my money
in Seocho-gu or Yeouido!

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.173
Let the special hearing take place.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.591
What?

00:26:54.383 --> 00:26:56.761
Take the special hearing,
and stop the special counsel.

00:26:58.554 --> 00:26:59.889
I'll do my best.

00:27:02.016 --> 00:27:05.186
You think
holding a special hearing is easy?

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.855
But it only lasts for a day.

00:27:09.023 --> 00:27:12.693
Half of those on the hearing committee
will have taken money from you, anyway.

00:27:13.486 --> 00:27:15.363
Just get through half a day of it.

00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:28.334
- I'm worried about this.
- It'll be fine.

00:27:28.876 --> 00:27:31.170
I'm sure it'll work out.

00:27:35.091 --> 00:27:36.717
Do you think the guys at Suojae

00:27:38.928 --> 00:27:40.930
want Mr. President to return?

00:27:41.847 --> 00:27:42.932
I'm not sure.

00:27:43.015 --> 00:27:46.018
Not everyone seemed like it.

00:27:47.228 --> 00:27:48.813
I thought so, too.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.650
Disgusting scumbags.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.501
What?

00:28:11.961 --> 00:28:12.962
Okay.

00:28:18.843 --> 00:28:19.885
Mr. Kang

00:28:20.553 --> 00:28:22.388
Sun-won escaped from the hospital.

00:28:23.347 --> 00:28:26.100
What if he realizes
that we tried to kill him?

00:28:33.566 --> 00:28:36.485
Do you know how they train elephants
at safaris?

00:28:38.779 --> 00:28:41.324
From the moment these elephants are born

00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:46.037
they're beaten with iron hooks
and taser batons.

00:28:49.498 --> 00:28:52.251
Just like that,
the elephants lose their free will

00:28:54.712 --> 00:28:56.589
and become slaves to the safari.

00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:00.885
Until they die.

00:29:05.348 --> 00:29:07.099
We will now begin

00:29:07.183 --> 00:29:11.395
the detention hearing,
as requested by the Defendant.

00:29:38.464 --> 00:29:40.549
You seem to be very worried
about Mr. President.

00:29:49.058 --> 00:29:51.018
The review of the legality of detention

00:29:51.102 --> 00:29:53.562
for Mr. Park
at the Seoul Central District Court

00:29:53.646 --> 00:29:55.439
has been going on for eight hours.

00:29:55.523 --> 00:29:56.690
Mr. Park is under arrest

00:29:56.774 --> 00:29:59.652
for illicit political fund collection
and using borrowed names for purchases

00:29:59.735 --> 00:30:02.613
but he has requested to be freed,
claiming an unfair detention.

00:30:03.155 --> 00:30:05.950
Mr. Park claims
the arrest was politically motivated...

00:30:06.033 --> 00:30:08.494
Do we have time to drop by Seonhwagak?

00:30:08.577 --> 00:30:09.578
Yes.

00:30:11.038 --> 00:30:12.123
Let's get a cake.

00:30:13.332 --> 00:30:14.333
Oh, I see.

00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:16.919
Now that I think about it,
it's the owner's birthday today.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.174
SEONHWAGAK

00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:30.933
HERE'S THE REQUESTED INFORMATION

00:30:42.778 --> 00:30:43.821
Mr. Kang.

00:30:48.534 --> 00:30:49.535
I'll go first.

00:30:54.248 --> 00:30:56.917
What a relief.

00:30:57.209 --> 00:30:58.461
How are you recovering?

00:31:00.087 --> 00:31:02.089
Mr. Kang was very worried about you.

00:31:02.756 --> 00:31:04.425
Let's sort out any misunderstandings

00:31:04.508 --> 00:31:05.676
and just...

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:45.508
Mr. Kang?

00:31:48.719 --> 00:31:50.262
I'll always have your back.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.441
You should go home.

00:32:10.032 --> 00:32:11.033
Sun-won.

00:32:13.827 --> 00:32:15.454
Are you going to stab me, too

00:32:16.121 --> 00:32:17.873
and be on the run for life?

00:32:27.883 --> 00:32:30.261
I didn't think you'd ever wake up.

00:32:32.596 --> 00:32:34.932
You weren't alive, nor dead.

00:32:36.016 --> 00:32:38.435
You were bedridden and rotting.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.854
Yet, people would've criticized you

00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:43.899
for being a murderer.

00:32:49.154 --> 00:32:50.322
Do you feel betrayed?

00:32:56.203 --> 00:32:57.246
If so, stab me.

00:33:10.342 --> 00:33:11.802
To cause me the same pain you feel

00:33:13.095 --> 00:33:14.305
about being betrayed.

00:33:19.476 --> 00:33:20.477
Go ahead.

00:33:24.898 --> 00:33:25.941
Come on.

00:33:28.902 --> 00:33:30.279
So, from now on

00:33:37.244 --> 00:33:38.954
only kill those who I tell you to.

00:33:46.128 --> 00:33:48.297
You'll never have to be in court, then.

00:34:10.694 --> 00:34:11.820
I'm

00:34:15.824 --> 00:34:17.368
sorry.

00:35:05.124 --> 00:35:06.208
I have a job for you.

00:35:30.107 --> 00:35:31.233
Good work.

00:35:32.359 --> 00:35:34.278
I told you

00:35:34.361 --> 00:35:36.447
I'd bring you back here
as soon as possible.

00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:40.409
Alright.

00:35:45.122 --> 00:35:46.206
Congratulations

00:35:47.916 --> 00:35:49.543
on your safe return.

00:35:50.794 --> 00:35:52.004
Thank you.

00:35:52.087 --> 00:35:55.299
Do you still feel the same
about serving the nation?

00:35:55.382 --> 00:35:56.383
Of course.

00:35:58.385 --> 00:35:59.511
Amazing.

00:36:00.012 --> 00:36:01.013
Cheers.

00:36:10.355 --> 00:36:12.065
I'm a bit tired.

00:36:12.149 --> 00:36:13.400
Let's call it a night.

00:36:13.984 --> 00:36:16.195
The detention center is uncomfortable

00:36:16.945 --> 00:36:18.280
whatever you do.

00:36:19.907 --> 00:36:21.366
Go ahead. Keep drinking.

00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:13.126
You know very well

00:37:14.169 --> 00:37:17.381
that the press is getting out of control

00:37:18.423 --> 00:37:20.425
and that Mr. President knows
all our weaknesses.

00:37:21.051 --> 00:37:23.345
So, if anything bad happens

00:37:23.804 --> 00:37:25.347
to Mr. President...

00:37:30.769 --> 00:37:31.770
So

00:37:32.312 --> 00:37:34.398
you want me to twist his neck?

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.360
No.

00:37:39.403 --> 00:37:41.196
I'm sure

00:37:41.572 --> 00:37:43.073
that Mr. President also knows

00:37:43.156 --> 00:37:45.617
your weakness.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.537
Doesn't that make you anxious?

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.049
The prosecution can finish him.

00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:06.513
Sorry?

00:38:23.864 --> 00:38:25.574
Congratulations

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.076
Mr. Kang!

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.161
Please

00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:32.039
take good care of Suojae.

00:38:32.122 --> 00:38:33.332
We'll do our best

00:38:34.124 --> 00:38:35.208
to serve you well.

00:38:36.919 --> 00:38:38.587
Oh, come here, Mr. Lee.

00:39:01.818 --> 00:39:03.070
Good work, everyone.

00:39:16.208 --> 00:39:17.292
Sin-jin's rebellion

00:39:18.085 --> 00:39:19.127
has begun.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.688
Do you think
he might've shot himself to death?

00:40:22.315 --> 00:40:23.316
But

00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:26.028
how can someone committing suicide

00:40:26.778 --> 00:40:29.364
shoot himself twice?

00:40:30.866 --> 00:40:31.867
Bang.

00:40:33.118 --> 00:40:34.119
Bang!

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.268
Nam-yong came to me

00:40:59.436 --> 00:41:00.979
and told me something.

00:41:01.563 --> 00:41:02.647
He told me

00:41:03.315 --> 00:41:05.150
never to trust the young judge

00:41:05.567 --> 00:41:06.943
Sin-jin may bring.

00:41:07.444 --> 00:41:08.487
And so

00:41:09.404 --> 00:41:11.198
I never trusted you from the start.

00:41:12.282 --> 00:41:13.784
Did Sin-jin send you?

00:41:14.493 --> 00:41:15.535
No.

00:41:20.707 --> 00:41:23.376
Yeah, I bet everyone in there

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.420
wants my head chopped off.

00:41:25.837 --> 00:41:29.424
How can they ever be at peace
when I know their weaknesses, right?

00:41:29.841 --> 00:41:31.384
But aren't you the same?

00:41:31.968 --> 00:41:34.262
- What?
- Didn't Nam-yong tell you?

00:41:35.472 --> 00:41:37.140
That he gave Sin-jin

00:41:37.474 --> 00:41:39.142
all your weaknesses?

00:41:41.228 --> 00:41:42.687
What are you talking about?

00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:44.856
The record of illicit political funds
of assemblymen

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.650
and the past and present Presidents

00:41:46.733 --> 00:41:48.527
that Nam-yong collected
in the National Election Commission.

00:41:48.777 --> 00:41:50.904
Of course, you're in it, too.

00:41:52.781 --> 00:41:53.990
Nam-yong...

00:41:54.574 --> 00:41:55.867
That bastard!

00:41:56.743 --> 00:41:59.538
You don't have anywhere to run

00:41:59.621 --> 00:42:01.414
as long as Sin-jin has that file on you.

00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:05.961
Why don't you just do your best
with what you have now?

00:42:06.044 --> 00:42:08.338
Like getting revenge, for example.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.554
Join me

00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:18.265
and I'll turn prison into Suojae for you.

00:42:19.141 --> 00:42:20.183
There, you can form

00:42:20.267 --> 00:42:22.602
a new government with new people
and make development plans.

00:42:22.686 --> 00:42:24.187
You won't be bored.

00:42:26.773 --> 00:42:27.858
He's a prosecutor

00:42:28.608 --> 00:42:30.152
on your special investigation team.

00:42:43.623 --> 00:42:46.168
Sure, whatever it is

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.170
let's start tomorrow.

00:42:49.546 --> 00:42:50.630
But you know what?

00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:54.384
I'm too tired tonight.

00:43:05.228 --> 00:43:06.229
Aren't you coming?

00:43:11.526 --> 00:43:12.694
No.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.197
You always get your job done.

00:43:25.457 --> 00:43:26.541
Mr. President

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.710
has disappeared.

00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:32.130
Damn it.

00:43:32.214 --> 00:43:35.717
He probably knows
what we've been doing by now.

00:43:36.301 --> 00:43:37.677
"We"?

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.763
The one who hired a guy

00:43:39.846 --> 00:43:41.473
to try to kill Mr. President is

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:45.018
Mr. Kang, not us.

00:43:49.064 --> 00:43:50.941
You think Mr. President will believe that?

00:43:52.734 --> 00:43:53.777
No.

00:43:54.986 --> 00:43:57.739
We shouldn't be here right now.

00:43:57.822 --> 00:44:00.033
Shouldn't we find a solution?

00:44:00.116 --> 00:44:01.618
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:44:06.414 --> 00:44:07.791
Mr. Kang.

00:44:13.463 --> 00:44:17.008
You caused all of this

00:44:18.051 --> 00:44:20.637
so take responsibility for everything

00:44:21.846 --> 00:44:23.431
and leave.

00:44:25.767 --> 00:44:27.018
Grab him.

00:44:27.852 --> 00:44:28.895
Grab him.

00:44:29.562 --> 00:44:30.563
Grab him!

00:44:32.565 --> 00:44:35.860
Is having a junkie for a daughter
and a cheating wife not enough?

00:44:36.569 --> 00:44:37.821
What?

00:44:40.407 --> 00:44:42.033
Shut it right now.

00:44:42.325 --> 00:44:45.620
This is defamation
through false information

00:44:45.704 --> 00:44:47.122
you bastard!

00:44:47.831 --> 00:44:49.332
What are you doing? Grab him!

00:44:49.416 --> 00:44:50.709
Grab him!

00:44:51.209 --> 00:44:52.794
Grab him from that side.

00:44:53.003 --> 00:44:54.254
Arrest him!

00:44:54.337 --> 00:44:55.797
Arrest him right now!

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.382
Come on. Arrest him immediately!

00:44:57.465 --> 00:44:58.675
Get rid of him right now!

00:44:58.758 --> 00:45:00.260
You think you can get them on board

00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:04.431
by talking to them like this?

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:08.435
And

00:45:09.227 --> 00:45:11.229
you don't think
I have something on you, too?

00:45:13.982 --> 00:45:16.985
Should I start with that clip of you
sexually assaulting your assistant?

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.741
You evil bastard.

00:45:23.616 --> 00:45:25.702
Die!

00:45:25.785 --> 00:45:27.120
Die!

00:45:48.975 --> 00:45:51.895
You fucking bastard!

00:46:01.363 --> 00:46:02.447
Oh, gosh.

00:46:25.512 --> 00:46:26.554
Mr. Kang.

00:46:51.871 --> 00:46:52.997
Hurry!

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:30.076
Why?

00:47:31.703 --> 00:47:33.621
Why now?

00:47:35.331 --> 00:47:36.416
Why?

00:47:56.394 --> 00:47:57.604
Please...

00:47:59.522 --> 00:48:00.648
help.

00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:11.284
Yeah.

00:48:13.745 --> 00:48:14.787
We

00:48:16.456 --> 00:48:18.082
just protected justice.

00:48:24.506 --> 00:48:26.049
I won't forget you.

00:48:41.105 --> 00:48:46.152
SUOJAE

00:49:11.636 --> 00:49:13.012
What took you so long?

00:49:13.763 --> 00:49:15.431
What happened?

00:49:34.325 --> 00:49:35.660
I told you

00:49:37.412 --> 00:49:39.539
the day I became the head of Suojae

00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:43.126
I'd let you sit beside me.

00:49:48.798 --> 00:49:49.841
But why...

00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:54.178
HERE'S THE REQUESTED INFORMATION

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.362
Wow.

00:50:11.988 --> 00:50:14.407
The photos look great.

00:50:15.491 --> 00:50:17.493
Were you also the one who saved Tae-seong?

00:50:17.952 --> 00:50:20.872
I told you I'd stop Nam-yong
from becoming the Chief Justice.

00:50:22.874 --> 00:50:23.916
You did.

00:50:25.585 --> 00:50:26.836
And Yong-jin?

00:50:27.462 --> 00:50:28.546
The victim

00:50:29.255 --> 00:50:31.841
wanted Yong-jin to be tried in court.

00:50:33.259 --> 00:50:35.136
So, you also stole the three billion won.

00:50:36.179 --> 00:50:38.556
You were so obvious with these attacks.

00:50:40.266 --> 00:50:42.352
How did I not even notice the pain?

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:45.772
So, you approached me

00:50:47.148 --> 00:50:48.232
for me.

00:50:55.573 --> 00:50:56.574
The evil

00:50:58.034 --> 00:51:00.578
can never protect justice.

00:51:04.332 --> 00:51:06.376
If you took over the Judiciary

00:51:06.459 --> 00:51:08.294
and even Suojae

00:51:08.836 --> 00:51:10.004
Korea would suffer

00:51:10.838 --> 00:51:14.258
from your narrow-mindedness
and wickedness that you'd call "justice".

00:51:14.342 --> 00:51:16.761
At the top of the Judiciary
as the head of Suojae

00:51:16.844 --> 00:51:18.346
I could change everything.

00:51:19.055 --> 00:51:21.641
I could stop the rich from getting away
with suspended sentences

00:51:22.266 --> 00:51:24.977
and stop powerful people
from determining guilt and innocence.

00:51:29.524 --> 00:51:32.694
If you still want justice,
you still have time.

00:51:43.287 --> 00:51:44.414
Join me.

00:51:46.624 --> 00:51:48.376
Your definition of justice is

00:51:49.794 --> 00:51:51.671
just for you.

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.715
It's unjust and narrow-minded

00:51:54.465 --> 00:51:56.467
for the sake of authority.

00:51:56.634 --> 00:51:57.677
No.

00:51:57.969 --> 00:52:01.013
I never abuse my authority for myself.

00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:10.732
You don't deserve to say that.

00:52:14.026 --> 00:52:15.153
Look what you've done.

00:52:15.987 --> 00:52:16.988
You're nothing

00:52:17.405 --> 00:52:20.074
but a power-driven, cruel murderer

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.619
who always takes bribes for trials.

00:52:27.957 --> 00:52:29.375
This is justice putting people to trial.

00:52:29.459 --> 00:52:31.169
What about the lives you sacrificed?

00:52:31.961 --> 00:52:33.671
Can you say the same to those people?

00:52:33.755 --> 00:52:36.924
They were just sacrifices for justice.
Don't you get it?

00:52:39.594 --> 00:52:41.596
I thought you'd understand me.

00:52:43.806 --> 00:52:44.891
But

00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:47.518
if that's not the case

00:52:51.481 --> 00:52:53.441
I have to do it for justice.

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:07.622
Why did I think you were like me?

00:53:08.331 --> 00:53:11.834
My trivial guilt
for imprisoning your father ruined me.

00:53:12.502 --> 00:53:13.961
And that was your choice.

00:53:15.379 --> 00:53:16.714
If you don't stop here

00:53:17.799 --> 00:53:20.635
the future Sin-jin will be even more evil.

00:53:21.969 --> 00:53:23.513
This was your last chance.

00:54:37.336 --> 00:54:38.796
LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:54:43.426 --> 00:54:44.594
- Hey!
- What's wrong?

00:54:44.677 --> 00:54:46.554
- Fine!
- What?

00:54:46.637 --> 00:54:48.389
- Why?
- Get out, you brats.

00:54:48.472 --> 00:54:49.473
What's going on?

00:55:11.621 --> 00:55:16.125
SEOK JEONG-HO

00:55:28.429 --> 00:55:29.472
Hey.

00:55:29.847 --> 00:55:31.474
I told you not to come to our class.

00:55:32.016 --> 00:55:33.643
Why do you keep coming to our class

00:55:33.726 --> 00:55:35.686
and kicking my kids out?

00:55:36.312 --> 00:55:37.438
Go back to your class.

00:55:37.521 --> 00:55:39.148
- Go back!
- Sir!

00:55:40.191 --> 00:55:43.194
Do you have a best friend?

00:55:43.694 --> 00:55:45.529
What in the world are you talking about?

00:55:45.613 --> 00:55:47.406
No, I don't. Why?

00:55:47.657 --> 00:55:48.783
To me

00:55:49.116 --> 00:55:52.036
this guy, Han-young, is my best friend.

00:55:52.954 --> 00:55:55.331
Do you want a cake for that or what?

00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:56.832
No, I just...

00:55:59.627 --> 00:56:02.171
My friend, Han-young,
has to become a judge.

00:56:02.546 --> 00:56:04.799
So, I'll do whatever it takes
to help Han-young

00:56:04.882 --> 00:56:07.426
enjoy the best environment for studying!

00:56:09.804 --> 00:56:10.846
Hey.

00:56:11.472 --> 00:56:12.807
I knew you said you'd study for real

00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:14.600
but are you set on becoming a judge now?

00:56:16.811 --> 00:56:17.895
Yes.

00:56:18.938 --> 00:56:21.649
Look at you!
Why do you want to become a judge?

00:56:22.149 --> 00:56:23.609
To restore justice or something?

00:56:26.612 --> 00:56:27.697
He will!

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.323
Get his revenge!

00:56:32.034 --> 00:56:33.035
What?

00:56:33.619 --> 00:56:35.830
Both of you, come with me.

00:56:35.913 --> 00:56:37.415
- Wait!
- Follow me!

00:56:37.498 --> 00:56:39.875
My ear really hurts!

00:56:41.002 --> 00:56:42.003
Gosh, this is heavy.

00:56:43.337 --> 00:56:46.382
One, two!

00:56:46.716 --> 00:56:48.009
Stop it.

00:56:48.926 --> 00:56:49.927
Han-young

00:56:50.428 --> 00:56:52.513
you have to become a judge, alright?

00:56:52.888 --> 00:56:55.307
You got us kicked out
when I was trying to study!

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.269
My friend is Judge Lee Han-young!

00:56:58.352 --> 00:57:00.146
He's incredible!

00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:02.606
Keep it down! You're so embarrassing!

00:57:02.982 --> 00:57:04.275
Hey, give it to me.

00:57:04.525 --> 00:57:06.485
Why are you even complaining?
It's so light.

00:57:06.569 --> 00:57:07.611
Man, I'm so tired.

00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:09.321
- Jeong-ho.
- Yeah?

00:57:09.405 --> 00:57:10.740
- You know it, right?
- What?

00:57:10.823 --> 00:57:12.533
That I can run faster than you can!

00:57:14.493 --> 00:57:16.037
Hey, this is cheating!

00:57:17.955 --> 00:57:18.956
Come here!

00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:21.625
The presidential election is tomorrow.

00:57:21.709 --> 00:57:25.254
The early voting turnout is at 32.45%

00:57:25.337 --> 00:57:27.089
and the candidates
from the ruling and opposition

00:57:27.173 --> 00:57:30.426
are doing their last sprints
in Yeouido and at the city hall.

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:10.633
Sir.

00:58:11.175 --> 00:58:12.468
Are you okay, sir?

00:58:13.761 --> 00:58:14.887
Are you okay?

00:58:15.346 --> 00:58:17.890
Hold on. I'll get the doctor.

00:58:45.835 --> 00:58:47.878
The scar was very deep.

00:58:47.962 --> 00:58:50.881
Thankfully, it only reached
your jugular vein.

00:58:51.215 --> 00:58:53.926
Had the weapon reached your carotid artery
at the slightest

00:58:54.009 --> 00:58:56.470
you couldn't have lasted a minute
from the bleeding.

00:58:56.554 --> 00:58:57.930
Mr. Kim Yun-cheol was elected

00:58:58.013 --> 00:59:01.642
by winning 49.8% of the votes
in the final tally of votes.

00:59:02.184 --> 00:59:04.061
Maybe the world will actually change now.

00:59:05.437 --> 00:59:07.231
Anyway, we have to keep you here
for a week

00:59:07.314 --> 00:59:08.941
and see how you do.

00:59:10.192 --> 00:59:12.486
Just sanitize his wound
and dress it today.

00:59:12.736 --> 00:59:13.821
See you.

00:59:24.915 --> 00:59:26.709
Just in case you get the wrong message

00:59:27.293 --> 00:59:29.879
I'm just dropping by
while visiting another friend.

00:59:30.963 --> 00:59:32.131
I just had some time.

00:59:38.888 --> 00:59:40.848
I thought you were really going to die.

00:59:43.767 --> 00:59:46.145
People die once, not twice.

00:59:47.563 --> 00:59:49.315
And have you already died once?

00:59:49.398 --> 00:59:51.108
You say it like you have.

00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:53.402
You're right.

00:59:54.236 --> 00:59:55.738
Code Blue.

00:59:55.821 --> 00:59:58.574
- Cardiac arrest patient in Room 507.
- Oh, no.

00:59:58.657 --> 01:00:00.117
Nurses and doctors,
please see the patient.

01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:02.119
I can do the rest. You can go.

01:00:02.203 --> 01:00:04.079
You just need to tape it. Sorry.

01:00:04.163 --> 01:00:06.332
Cardiac arrest patient in Room 507.

01:00:06.415 --> 01:00:09.168
Nurses and doctors,
please see the patient.

01:00:09.251 --> 01:00:10.711
Code Blue.

01:00:10.794 --> 01:00:13.464
Cardiac arrest patient in Room 507.

01:00:16.717 --> 01:00:17.968
Can you help me?

01:00:44.453 --> 01:00:47.248
I'm fine. Smile.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:45.472
I'm sorry.

01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:54.982
For slapping your face
the first time we met.

01:01:58.819 --> 01:01:59.862
I don't think

01:02:01.196 --> 01:02:03.157
I've apologized for that yet.

01:02:27.765 --> 01:02:31.477
Did you throw away the old gauze
we took off?

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.937
It has to go in the biohazard bin.

01:02:34.438 --> 01:02:35.522
No.

01:02:36.774 --> 01:02:38.233
Oh, did I clean it?

01:02:39.193 --> 01:02:40.486
I've been so busy.

01:02:40.903 --> 01:02:41.945
I'll get going, then.

01:03:22.277 --> 01:03:23.362
Sorry.

01:03:24.947 --> 01:03:25.989
Se-hee...

01:03:27.032 --> 01:03:28.534
What are you doing?

01:03:59.606 --> 01:04:00.607
Damn it.

01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:02.359
Hey, get out!

01:04:03.861 --> 01:04:06.238
Mr. Woo Gyo-hun and Mr. Gwak Sun-won,
Sin-jin's assassin

01:04:06.405 --> 01:04:08.407
died in Suojae last night.

01:04:08.907 --> 01:04:10.993
I heard Sin-jin killed Gyo-hun.

01:04:11.076 --> 01:04:13.704
But Jin-han is also dead.

01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:16.415
They say a robber killed him,
but I'm not convinced.

01:04:16.498 --> 01:04:18.584
All videos from the surrounding cameras
were deleted.

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:20.919
Whatever it was, it wasn't a robber.

01:04:21.003 --> 01:04:22.004
I know.

01:04:22.379 --> 01:04:24.715
Are you okay, by the way?

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.258
Physically, yes.

01:04:26.717 --> 01:04:27.759
But

01:04:28.635 --> 01:04:30.304
I think I'm getting accused.

01:04:30.554 --> 01:04:31.638
What?

01:04:48.113 --> 01:04:50.240
Sin-jin seems to have accused me.

01:04:51.116 --> 01:04:53.785
You should turn yourself in for now.

01:04:53.869 --> 01:04:55.579
I'll take care of the rest.

01:04:56.121 --> 01:04:57.122
No.

01:04:57.831 --> 01:04:59.374
This is something I have to do.

01:05:05.172 --> 01:05:06.173
What?

01:05:09.301 --> 01:05:10.344
Okay, then.

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:18.060
Han-young ran away.

01:05:21.104 --> 01:05:22.981
Are you sure you should be out and about?

01:05:26.902 --> 01:05:28.403
Why? Are you worried?

01:05:29.238 --> 01:05:31.657
That you'd be in danger
once I get arrested?

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.868
Come on. Of course not.

01:05:54.721 --> 01:05:57.057
I believe in your good character.

01:06:16.368 --> 01:06:18.495
Do you trust people?

01:06:21.331 --> 01:06:22.457
No.

01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:26.253
I trust money and power.

01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:28.171
Oh.

01:06:29.006 --> 01:06:30.132
Of course.

01:06:31.675 --> 01:06:34.219
I have to meet Gwang-to.

01:06:35.596 --> 01:06:37.014
Request an attorney visitation.

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.223
Sorry?

01:06:55.157 --> 01:06:57.075
Mr. Kang Sin-jin,
the Chief Judge of the Seoul Central Court

01:06:57.159 --> 01:06:59.786
has been named as the suspect

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:02.956
behind the death of Mr. Woo Gyo-hun

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:06.501
at Mr. Park Gwang-to's home in Gyeonggi-do
two days ago.

01:07:06.585 --> 01:07:08.879
But the investigation discovered

01:07:08.962 --> 01:07:10.297
that there was an accomplice

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.299
present on-site with Sin-jin.

01:07:12.382 --> 01:07:14.176
Mr. Kang has helped our attorneys win

01:07:14.259 --> 01:07:16.553
quite a lot of cases in court.

01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:19.931
If the world hears about that

01:07:21.183 --> 01:07:23.226
our firm will crumble to the ground

01:07:23.685 --> 01:07:26.396
and your brother and I will be arrested.

01:07:28.398 --> 01:07:29.399
Dad...

01:07:29.483 --> 01:07:32.069
So, we'll have to give

01:07:32.903 --> 01:07:34.112
what Sin-jin wants.

01:07:35.864 --> 01:07:37.532
He killed a man!

01:07:37.616 --> 01:07:39.034
So what?

01:07:40.744 --> 01:07:44.706
You think he won't snitch on us
just because he's murdered someone?

01:07:56.009 --> 01:07:57.135
Se-hee

01:07:58.136 --> 01:08:00.764
don't tell me you've fallen for Han-young.

01:08:19.157 --> 01:08:20.242
Pass me the food.

01:08:21.076 --> 01:08:22.619
- You got everything ready?
- Yes.

01:08:23.245 --> 01:08:24.246
Good work.

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:26.790
Come in.

01:08:39.761 --> 01:08:42.055
This is a class on real estate investment
in Seoul.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.599
What?

01:08:44.683 --> 01:08:46.101
They give lectures on frauds...

01:08:46.184 --> 01:08:47.310
Get out!

01:08:48.437 --> 01:08:51.523
I've come all the way to Hyenam,
and you treat me like I'm invisible

01:08:51.982 --> 01:08:54.192
without a single colleague to eat with.

01:08:54.276 --> 01:08:55.819
But he has a drinking buddy

01:08:55.902 --> 01:08:58.488
after pulling a housing scam on dozens
and assaulting people.

01:08:58.947 --> 01:09:00.490
You got it all wrong.

01:09:00.907 --> 01:09:02.117
I'm investigating him.

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:06.580
Is this how you do it?

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:07.664
Huh?

01:09:08.373 --> 01:09:09.541
Well...

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.793
You'll learn in time.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.923
Bullshit.

01:09:17.382 --> 01:09:18.383
What?

01:09:19.092 --> 01:09:20.218
What did you just say?

01:09:20.802 --> 01:09:23.388
You have an imported car
of over 100 million won.

01:09:24.306 --> 01:09:27.976
That's from Mr. Hwang,
the CEO of Hyenam Jeil Trading, right?

01:09:28.059 --> 01:09:30.479
You're out of line.

01:09:30.562 --> 01:09:33.940
That studio unit in the city is
under your son's name.

01:09:34.232 --> 01:09:36.401
How did a college student afford that?

01:09:36.485 --> 01:09:37.903
You trying to end your career?

01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:39.946
Remember, you're in exile.

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:41.907
Just live like you're dead, alright?

01:09:43.992 --> 01:09:44.993
Sir

01:09:45.952 --> 01:09:48.663
you know why I've been exiled, right?

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:55.086
So many people called me a crazy bitch

01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:57.422
when I was going after Mr. Jang Tae-sik.

01:10:00.842 --> 01:10:02.636
Well, I get how you get the job done now.

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:06.681
You want to see
how the crazy bitch from Seoul does it?

01:10:20.403 --> 01:10:22.072
Hand your friend over to me.

01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:23.156
Breaking news.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.450
The new suspect

01:10:25.534 --> 01:10:27.619
in Mr. Woo's murder
at Mr. Park Gwang-to's house

01:10:27.702 --> 01:10:30.288
has been confirmed.

01:10:30.372 --> 01:10:33.083
A DNA analysis of the blood left
at the scene

01:10:33.166 --> 01:10:35.752
- pointed to Lee Han-young
- What?

01:10:35.836 --> 01:10:37.754
the judge
at the Seoul Central District Court.

01:10:37.838 --> 01:10:40.006
The prosecution held
an emergency briefing session

01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:42.092
to confirm the formal indictment of Lee

01:10:42.175 --> 01:10:44.427
as an accomplice in Woo's murder case

01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:46.680
this afternoon.

01:10:54.479 --> 01:10:56.022
I don't know where to go.

01:11:06.116 --> 01:11:09.327
So, Mr. Kang was just a regular?

01:11:10.453 --> 01:11:13.832
I had no idea that he was a Chief Judge.

01:11:14.291 --> 01:11:15.292
But...

01:11:16.001 --> 01:11:18.169
how did the guy...

01:11:18.253 --> 01:11:20.797
Exactly. You never know
what people are thinking.

01:11:22.132 --> 01:11:24.050
When was his most recent visit?

01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:26.219
I can't remember.

01:11:26.595 --> 01:11:30.640
I'm not at the restaurant all day.

01:11:45.655 --> 01:11:47.574
Find me before the police does.

01:11:49.993 --> 01:11:51.912
That's the least you can do

01:11:52.746 --> 01:11:54.456
to be cleared of the accusation.

01:11:58.418 --> 01:11:59.711
It won't take long.

01:12:00.587 --> 01:12:03.006
I was ready to go all the way
when I started, anyway.

01:12:05.926 --> 01:12:07.385
I'm still alive.

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:13.558
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:12:52.055 --> 01:12:54.432
Where is justice in Korea?

01:12:54.641 --> 01:12:57.227
Sin-jin really might return at this rate.

01:12:57.310 --> 01:13:00.063
I wonder if he still has
more cards to play.

01:13:00.188 --> 01:13:02.399
At the end of the day,
only money and power persevere.

01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:05.986
Korea's judicial system has
completely fallen.

01:13:06.069 --> 01:13:08.405
Don't worry. The tables will turn again.

01:13:08.488 --> 01:13:10.115
Don't let things get worse.
Turn yourself in.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.118
We need new justice to change the world.

01:13:13.201 --> 01:13:14.369
I'll prove

01:13:14.452 --> 01:13:16.079
that the justice I've chosen is right.

01:13:16.246 --> 01:13:17.622
Han-young!

01:13:17.831 --> 01:13:19.165
I'll return to the court.

01:13:22.419 --> 01:13:24.421
