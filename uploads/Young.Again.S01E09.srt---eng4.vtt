00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.700
Ms. Liu, morning.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.760
That's too old-fashioned. That won't do.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:06.659
Ms. Liu.

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:08.180
Have you eaten yet?

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.599
That's even more cliché.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.860
Hello.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:14.500
Ms. Liu.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.340
Boss Li.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.800
Every single day,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.740
I see you exercising early in the morning.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.219
Your body is really strong.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:24.939
Pity your eyesight isn't great.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.439
You mistook me for Ms. Liu.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.800
We do look a bit alike.

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:28.740
I took you for...

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.379
My eyesight really is terrible.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.259
It's okay.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.819
It doesn't matter.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.180
Bad eyesight doesn't matter either.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.120
Later I'll get you...

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.139
...some sheep liver to nourish your eyes.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.060
Thanks.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.379
I don't eat sheep liver.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.460
You don't like sheep liver?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.479
That doesn't matter either.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.539
I can switch it to chicken liver for you.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.900
Or else pig liver.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.060
If that doesn't work...

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.960
Chicken liver, sheep liver, pig liver all together...

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.560
...boiled in a pot, chopped up, and mixed with rice for you.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.620
For you.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.159
Are you feeding a cat?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.539
You...

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:57.219
Fine.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.080
Xiao Cai.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.539
Buy whatever liver you want.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.639
Even if you buy a bamboo pole...

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.840
...I'll eat that too, okay?

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.620
As long as you leave first.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.699
Don't hold me up.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.639
Practicing boxing.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.020
Why don't you go outside to practice?

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.159
Everyone loves to gossip.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.979
I'm leaving.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:27.860
Boss Li, morning.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:29.180
Morning.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.020
All that buildup for nothing.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.800
What style of boxing are you practicing?

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:34.500
This is...

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.900
...authentic Chinese boxing.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.400
Tai Chi.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.280
Tai Chi.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.000
I have a Tai Chi Sword.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.560
What a coincidence.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.719
I knew it.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.360
We have a lot in common.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.199
We often do the same things without planning.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.879
Fine, you practice your boxing here.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:52.960
I'll go practice at the entrance.

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:53.699
Don't.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.800
I mean your suggestion is excellent.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.680
Let's go practice together outside.

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.520
Did I suggest that?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.240
I'm practicing sword.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.599
You're practicing boxing.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.319
Mine is Tai Chi Sword.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.240
Yes.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.840
You practice Tai Chi Sword.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.960
I practice Tai Chi.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.000
If we go outside, people will see...

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.080
...how well-matched these two are.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.120
No.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.600
I mean the chemistry.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.839
That's not it either.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.560
Anyway, people will look and see...

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.199
...a matching pair.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.199
We workers have strength!

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.680
We workers have strength!

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.899
The Professor won't get up in the morning!

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.480
The Professor won't get up in the morning!

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.560
I'm feeling unwell.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.439
What are you saying?

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.720
I asked why you haven't got up yet.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.339
I don't feel well.

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:55.740
I have a fever.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.899
You have a fever?

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.220
You're really burning up.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.579
This...

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.740
Tell me, what should we do?

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:15.779
When you're old, your immunity is weak.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.899
Once you get a fever,

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.699
it might trigger other problems.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.220
What on earth should we do?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.259
Old Fan,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.379
you have to hang in there.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.180
I'll go get a volunteer for you.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.579
Okay. You must hang in there.

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:29.139
Persistence is victory!

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:29.779
Okay.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.660
Victory belongs to you!

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.300
Fine.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.019
You really have to hang in there!

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:35.220
Are you going or not?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.500
If you keep fussing, I won't make it.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.220
Darn it!

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.199
Hanyū Eiko!

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.220
Help!

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.459
Old Fan is dying!

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.500
It's nothing.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.120
It's no big deal.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.040
No need to worry.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.639
It is simply...

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.000
External invasion of pathogenic wind,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.199
internal damp-heat,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.600
exuberant liver fire,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600
and deficient lung qi.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.319
Do you understand "deficient lung qi"?

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:02.959
I understand.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:05.079
What do I understand?

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.480
Just tell us what the illness is.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.120
Right.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.899
Use medical language

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:10.959
that you can understand.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.699
He just caught a chill.

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.000
Is it just a common cold?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.360
A vulgar way to put it.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.439
But I suppose you could say that.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.839
However...

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:24.680
You must not take it lightly.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.879
You must...

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.040
take these three medicines I prescribed on time.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.279
Three times a day.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.980
Guaranteed to cure the illness.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.019
Okay.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.740
Alright?

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.019
Understood.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:38.579
Doctor.

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.980
Is this a decoction or pills?

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:43.300
Isn't this just cold capsules?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.339
What did you expect?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.480
But this medicine is really effective.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:50.540
By the way, the patient...

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.579
needs someone dedicated to nursing him.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.699
To prevent him from kicking off the covers when sweating.

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.339
How about I do it?

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:58.220
But I'm a girl.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.379
Would it be inconvenient?

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.579
Let me do it.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:02.139
I can make do on the sofa for a while.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.180
I can handle this.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.540
I was a doctor when I was in the army.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.540
Often staying up all night.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.420
Working through the night.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.860
Boss Li.

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.740
You were a medic back then, right?

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.420
Who?

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:14.379
Who was a medic?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.019
I was a vet.

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:17.740
I often nursed sick pigs.

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:19.019
Stop right there.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.740
Lest the patient hears you.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.019
And gets agitated.

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:23.019
Why?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.939
Treating people or pigs is all about saving lives.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:26.980
As long as it's work...

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.500
I never pick and choose.

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:29.720
Even a skinny pig, I...

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:30.360
Okay.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.980
Boss Li.

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:32.420
That's enough.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.899
I think...

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.500
I should do it.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.339
No way.

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:38.100
That's not good.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.180
How can we let a great artist...

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.339
do this?

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.639
What if he...

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.540
vomits on the floor or soils the bed?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.939
What would you do then?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.100
Let me do it.

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.220
In the army...

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.220
I fed pigs.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.180
Feeding him now...

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:50.699
the Professor is about the same.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:52.540
How can that be the same?

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.819
Alright, say no more.

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:54.379
I'll do it.

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:10.139
Ms. Liu.

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:12.259
When I was a vet back then...

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.899
it was also mouthful by mouthful...

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.300
feeding water to piglets.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.420
But back then...

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.699
I did some technical innovation.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.259
I came up with a clever method.

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:21.160
I and the doctor...

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.819
Boss Li.

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:25.259
Keep your voice down.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.660
The patient needs quiet.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.199
Needs quiet.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.379
Otherwise...

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:32.460
let's let him rest here quietly first.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.700
Let's go out for a walk, the two of us.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.580
And study Tai Chi and Tai Chi Sword.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.580
Professor Fan

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.419
I'm really sorry

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.820
Did I wake you up?

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.659
Actually, I wasn't asleep

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:45.620
You weren't asleep?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.259
Here

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.299
Drink some water

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.159
That's enough

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:52.960
That's about enough

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.039
Don't drink so much water

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.240
Drink too much and you'll wet the bed

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.659
He needs to drink plenty of water right now

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.960
To bring down the fever

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.080
To help him sweat

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.399
That drains a lot of fluids from the body

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.840
So you have to drink more water

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.360
You need to replenish it in time

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.559
Sorry, sorry

00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:08.299
It's okay, it's okay

00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:08.879
Is it that you...

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:09.919
...are uncomfortable sitting like this?

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:10.740
Here

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.299
Come on

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:12.320
Hurry, come sit up

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.720
Sit up

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.279
Sit up and drink

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.320
Ms. Liu, don't

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:16.759
Don't do that, Ms. Liu, you...

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:18.700
Don't

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:21.019
What's wrong? Don't what?

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.500
Don't drink so much water

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.860
Drinking too much water isn't good either

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.580
We just changed the water barrel yesterday

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:29.220
And today it's already hitting the bottom

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.539
Isn't that for his immune system?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.179
Before the immune system kicks in

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:34.740
The urinary system will collapse first

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.860
Yeah

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:38.620
That makes sense

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.460
Makes sense, right?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:39.700
Yes

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.899
Listen to me

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.340
Just let him sleep here

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:44.419
Let's go outside and study Tai Chi

00:09:44.419 --> 00:09:45.259
I won't sleep

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.940
I can't sleep

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:49.259
Unless...

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.659
Ms. Liu, you tell me a story

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:54.080
When I was sick as a child

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.919
My mom would tell me stories

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:58.320
Alright then

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:58.700
No

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.340
You even want Ms. Liu to tell you a story?

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.000
Keep it down

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.279
Telling stories, right?

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:04.879
Telling stories is my strong suit

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:05.679
I'll tell you one

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:06.120
Boss Li

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.759
I'll tell you a ghost story. From Liaozhai

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:08.759
No

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.000
I want the childhood...

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.240
...feeling of a mother

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:14.600
A ghost story?

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.360
You...

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.580
You look just like the King of Hell

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:18.620
I'm scared looking at you

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.000
Who looks like the King of Hell?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.740
That's enough, Boss Li

00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:24.899
Right now, the patient...

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:26.659
...whether physically or mentally...

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:28.059
...is at his weakest

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:28.759
Listen

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.899
You have to follow his wishes

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.159
If we're following my wishes...

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:35.659
Please ask him to leave now

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.740
Why should I leave?

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.379
Fine

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.159
Alright

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:38.700
Okay

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.580
Fine, I'll endure it

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.379
I'll endure it

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.139
I'll just sit right here

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:43.299
And not say a word

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:44.100
Is that okay?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.659
Good

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.720
Okay

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:50.120
Then let's...

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:54.179
Professor

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.659
Let's tell a story

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:59.740
Tell a story just like Mom

00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:04.539
Once upon a time,

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:05.360
there was a mountain.

00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:09.159
Right.

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:10.639
There was a mountain.

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:12.960
And on this mountain,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.799
there was also a temple.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.639
Can you stop messing around?

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.779
How am I messing around?

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:18.779
Ask Ms. Liu.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.340
Is what I said true or not?

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.500
Is there a temple on the mountain?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:21.700
Yes.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.580
Let me think...

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.059
Well...

00:11:23.059 --> 00:11:23.820
Once upon a time, there was a mountain.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.379
On the mountain...

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:24.740
Right.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.740
Yes, there was a temple on the mountain.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.539
I know the rest too.

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:27.620
Not only was there a temple on the mountain,

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.240
there was also a little demon that ate people.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.039
Eating people wasn't enough,

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:30.879
it wanted to eat a professor too.

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.059
Don't... Let me tell you...

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:33.480
That demon specifically eats professors.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.659
Specifically professors named Fan.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:36.240
It eats them bite by bite, just like this.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.299
Boss Li!

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:42.019
I'm scared, so scared.

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:43.120
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.799
Boss Li, what are you doing?

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:46.419
Why are you always making trouble here?

00:11:46.419 --> 00:11:47.139
I'm just...

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.659
Look at you.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.740
You... this...

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.059
It just so happens to be lunchtime.

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:52.019
How about this?

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:53.899
You go to the canteen and get some food.

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:54.620
You're hungry?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:54.980
No.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.620
What would you like to eat?

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.080
No...

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.580
It doesn't matter for me.

00:11:57.659 --> 00:11:58.740
The key is the Professor.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.019
He is physically weak right now.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.580
He must eat on time.

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.259
Didn't the imperial physician say so?

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:05.100
It's best to eat something bland.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.580
A liquid diet is best.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.100
Anyway, you figure it out.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.419
Actually, right now...

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.460
get my food as well.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.179
Okay?

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.700
That works too.

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:16.059
I'll get your food while I'm at it.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:16.940
Old Fan.

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:18.340
Sleep well here.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.100
Protect the doctor well.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:20.940
Don't move around.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.100
Whatever you do, don't leave.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.539
Old Sun is off!

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.500
Ms. Liu

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.679
First, I want to thank you for taking such good care of me.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.039
You're too kind.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.919
It's the least I could do.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.539
A close neighbor is better than a distant relative.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.480
Right?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.200
We should take care of each other.

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:46.440
Besides,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.919
for example, if I got sick,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.039
wouldn't you

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.639
also take care of me

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:52.039
the way I did for you?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.440
That's for sure.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.139
Exactly.

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:56.279
I'd definitely be attentive and considerate.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:57.539
No,

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.960
Xiao Liu,

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.399
I won't let you say things like that.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.200
You will never get sick.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:06.039
But don't worry,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240
even if

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:08.440
you don't get sick,

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.779
I'll still be attentive and considerate.

00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:12.220
Professor,

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.600
Professor, just sit tight.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.120
Well,

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:18.440
us seniors

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.000
caring for each other,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.639
looking after each other,

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:22.720
is only right and proper.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.220
Yes.

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:24.840
Especially you.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.759
You're learned and talented,

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:28.200
and highly respected.

00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:31.019
You've dedicated your life's work and talent

00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:33.299
to the next generation.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.000
I've always admired,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.080
admired you the most,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.039
as an intellectual.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.500
Really?

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:49.220
Ms. Liu,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.639
is that really how you see me?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.059
How come I usually

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.679
just didn't realize it?

00:13:58.379 --> 00:13:59.580
I was too slow.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:00.539
Too muddled.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:01.700
Too careless.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:03.480
But it's not too late now.

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.320
We can start over.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.080
I'm back.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.639
You're back so soon.

00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:09.259
Boss Li.

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:10.039
Isn't it a coincidence?

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.360
I ran into Zhu Zhu and Xiao Xin on the way.

00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:14.320
They were going to get food for Grandma Jin.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.639
So I entrusted them to get the food.

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:18.600
We can't let a small thing like getting food

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.039
interfere with taking care of the patient.

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:21.120
It's such a big matter.

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.399
Taking care of me isn't a big deal.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.759
You ruined my big plan.

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:25.559
What big plan?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480
I just wanted to ask,

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:30.139
what did you buy for me to eat?

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:31.919
Cornmeal porridge, shredded pickles,

00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:33.600
and half a plate of radish leaves.

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:35.399
Keep it light.

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:36.960
You're feeding a rabbit, aren't you?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.840
Isn't this abusing the patient?

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.179
I beg you,

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:41.559
right now, immediately,

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:44.000
go buy me some pig trotters and ribs.

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.759
Stewed offal, stir-fried liver.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.039
If they don't have those,

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.840
gristly meat, anything will do.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.000
I want to eat meat.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.759
Go quickly, okay?

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:52.960
Where am I supposed to find those things for you?

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:53.759
Besides,

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.320
your stomach and spleen are weak right now.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.759
You can't eat those things anyway.

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:57.840
You can't eat rich fish and meat.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.720
Right, Ms. Liu?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.360
Right.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.720
He has to eat something light.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.320
Right.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.039
I agree.

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:02.620
Can't eat it.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:04.039
Absolutely no rich fish and meat.

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:04.600
But I...

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.480
However,

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:08.200
eating a moderate amount,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.360
for example, something low in cholesterol

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.679
and high in nutritional value,

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:12.159
is still okay.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.059
How about this?

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:15.379
I'll go to the cafeteria myself to take a look.

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:16.019
That's good.

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:16.659
You go ahead.

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:17.419
I'll take care of Old Fan.

00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:18.100
No need.

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:19.860
I want Ms. Liu.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:20.700
No need for that.

00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:22.460
Then I'll go with Ms. Liu.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.179
The things are heavy.

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:24.220
Come, I'll help you get the food.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.059
No, but Professor Fan needs someone...

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.179
Sitting and chatting

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.779
isn't as good as getting up and moving.

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:29.659
Let's go together.

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:30.379
Let's go.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.539
The person taking care of him will be here soon.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.240
I can't be without someone taking care of me.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.399
Is it Zhu Zhu or Xiao Xin? Who is it?

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.620
Xiao Cai.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.580
Xiao Cai, why is it you?

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.899
I just met some college students at the door,

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:45.580
so I took the food from them.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.299
Boss Li.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.460
Guess what's in my bowl?

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.539
I brought you some sheep liver.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.139
There's really sheep liver?

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.259
Isn't it a coincidence?

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:56.220
The cafeteria is serving sheep liver today.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.019
Come, open your mouth. It's good for your eyes.

00:15:58.019 --> 00:15:58.779
I'm not eating it.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.740
It's good for your eyes.

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:01.460
If you don't eat, you'll go blind.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.659
Hurry up, open your mouth.

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.620
What time is it now?

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:22.340
Time for my water and medicine, right?

00:16:23.419 --> 00:16:24.460
Medicine, huh?

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:25.500
Here.

00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:26.700
I'll feed you.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:27.779
Who asked you to feed me?

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.659
I want Ms. Liu.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.100
Ms. Liu?

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.419
She can't come.

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:35.879
How come she...

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.500
How do you know she can't come?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.879
Of course I know.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.360
I told her not to come.

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:42.960
How could you?

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:45.879
I'm sick as a dog here.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.519
Come on, Old Fan.

00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:51.480
A minor headache and fever.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.440
You've been lying there for days.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.200
I've figured it out.

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:57.279
As long as Ms. Liu doesn't come,

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:58.759
this illness of yours

00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:00.519
will be cured instantly.

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:01.799
What do you mean?

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:02.960
What do I mean?

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.680
Since we're on the subject,

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.279
I'd like to ask you.

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:11.480
Ms. Liu coming to take care of you,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.359
is it out of pure concern for a comrade?

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.880
Is it out of pure patriotism?

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:20.859
Is it out of a sincere

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.880
belief in saving lives?

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.720
In his fifties,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.200
he traveled thousands of miles to China.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.859
Stop.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.359
You...

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.960
Are you talking about Ms. Liu?

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:30.519
That's Norman Bethune.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.160
Same thing.

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:35.700
Ms. Liu inherited Comrade Norman Bethune's

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:37.700
fearlessness of hardship, filth, and fatigue,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.000
and the spirit of not fearing stench.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
How am I smelly?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.759
That's why she came to care for you.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.920
And as for your behavior,

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:46.599
can you be called a noble person?

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.759
A pure person?

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:51.460
Can you be called a person with moral integrity?

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.200
Can you be called a person

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.480
who is free from vulgar interests?

00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:58.799
Simply a wolf's ambition!

00:17:58.799 --> 00:17:59.880
A beast in human clothing!

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.720
Shut your mouth!

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.559
What did I do?

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.779
You're dumping all these

00:18:05.779 --> 00:18:07.500
shit basins and piss pots,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.180
foot-binding cloths and smelly socks on me.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.220
No, as for what you did,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.400
don't you know yourself?

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.380
You intentionally sent me away multiple times.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:14.920
Didn't you?

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:15.779
To create

00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:18.299
opportunities for you and Ms. Liu to be alone.

00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:18.859
Didn't you?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.339
To achieve your ulterior motives.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.180
Didn't you?

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.180
What motives?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.660
Old Li, let me tell you.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.700
If we're talking about

00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:29.900
having motives,

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.420
it's Ms. Liu who

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:33.660
has motives towards me.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.380
Ridiculous.

00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:37.660
That is just too ridiculous.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.380
You're turning it around on her?

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:40.859
You didn't expect that, did you?

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.740
I didn't.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.619
During the time I sent you away,

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:45.059
in those bits and pieces of time,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.539
Ms. Liu

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:48.180
has already

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:49.259
expressed

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:50.420
that intention to me.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.660
What intention?

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.259
You're making it up.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.400
You can really spin a yarn.

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:54.660
I don't believe it.

00:18:54.819 --> 00:18:55.660
Not a single word.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.140
Believe it or not.

00:18:57.619 --> 00:18:59.019
You have no choice but to believe.

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:01.559
Ms. Liu said it herself.

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:03.099
That I, Fan,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.099
am learned, talented, and highly respected.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.660
That I dedicated my heart and talent

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.940
to the next generation.

00:19:10.259 --> 00:19:11.339
In her heart,

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.059
I am the one she respects and admires most.

00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:14.619
The most lovable person!

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:17.259
The one she likes is me,

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:18.400
Fan himself.

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:22.660
Stop being so gross

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.640
That holy, upright, and aloof

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.539
Ms. Liu

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:28.099
how could she say such mushy things?

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:30.660
But she just had to go and say them.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.259
In front of a patient.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.700
She opened her heart.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.180
No longer hiding anything.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:35.680
You're making it up.

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:36.579
You're bragging.

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:37.519
Actually,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.940
getting sick

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.059
isn't anything to be happy about.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.019
But it's a blessing in disguise.

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:46.279
I have to thank this illness.

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:48.240
It's good that I caught this cold.

00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:51.240
You know, Old Li?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.799
Being fit and never getting sick,

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.880
sometimes,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.960
isn't necessarily a good thing.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.480
Come in.

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:05.839
Xiao Cai.

00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:08.640
Professor Fan.

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:09.759
Come.

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:10.960
Watching TV?

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:12.019
Have a seat.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.900
Sit here.

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:19.859
What are you holding there?

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.759
No...

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:21.500
nothing.

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:27.660
What are you doing?

00:20:27.819 --> 00:20:29.420
Playing hide-and-seek with us?

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.200
It's nothing.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.960
It's just...

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.519
Such beautiful flowers.

00:20:37.079 --> 00:20:38.240
They smell quite nice too.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.960
Right?

00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:40.240
I know this flower.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.059
You know it?

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:42.940
This flower is called...

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.279
Carnation.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.240
Thank you.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.759
What carnation?

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:49.480
Carnations are for mothers.

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:50.799
What are you thanking me for?

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.720
No, these flowers...

00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:53.519
I'm giving them to Ms. Liu.

00:20:53.839 --> 00:20:54.880
For Ms. Liu?

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:56.839
Not for me?

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:57.599
Sorry.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:58.900
So they aren't for you.

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:01.180
But...

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:04.160
isn't it inappropriate to give Ms. Liu carnations?

00:21:04.539 --> 00:21:05.880
This isn't a carnation.

00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:07.380
Then what flower is it?

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.220
I'm not too sure either.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.619
Where is Ms. Liu?

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.059
She'll be back in a moment.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.420
Professor Fan.

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:20.039
Um...

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:22.599
You coming here today...

00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:24.599
is there some other meaning behind it?

00:21:25.839 --> 00:21:27.440
What other meaning could I have?

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:28.519
I just came to...

00:21:28.839 --> 00:21:30.960
express my gratitude to Ms. Liu.

00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.400
Keep it a secret, okay?

00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:35.039
Express gratitude?

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.519
Why keep it a secret?

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.079
Professor Fan.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.720
Look.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.380
I just said it and Ms. Liu is back.

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:44.440
Hurry up.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:44.960
What's wrong?

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.619
Professor Fan has been waiting for you for ages.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.099
Waiting for me?

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:48.440
He's been dying to give you flowers.

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.200
To express gratitude, and keep it secret.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.640
I'm going out.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.599
Don't go out...

00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:54.240
Don't...

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:54.980
Um...

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.799
Don't, don't stop.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:59.000
Go take care of any urgent business you have.

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:00.039
And...

00:22:00.599 --> 00:22:01.839
no rush to come back.

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:03.200
I know.

00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:14.920
Um,

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.319
Please sit, Professor Fan.

00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:16.920
Um,

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:19.359
Ms. Liu.

00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:22.559
I've put you to so much trouble these past few days.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:23.839
I came to thank you.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.640
Here are some flowers for you.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.220
No...

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.279
Not you...

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.000
Why are you being so polite?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.339
No...

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.619
Professor Fan, this...

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.240
These flowers...

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.400
You bought the wrong ones.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.680
Wrong?

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.759
How are they wrong?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.559
These are roses.

00:22:42.839 --> 00:22:44.200
It's not appropriate for you to give me these.

00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:46.160
If you wanted to give me flowers,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.039
you should have given...

00:22:47.319 --> 00:22:48.200
yellow lilies,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.559
or daffodils.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.359
Those are for thanking good friends.

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:53.259
But these flowers...

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.960
This...

00:22:55.359 --> 00:22:56.119
This...

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:58.160
Have you never studied the language of flowers?

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.960
How could I not have studied flowers?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.319
Right.

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:02.759
I haven't studied it.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.680
I just thought these flowers were pretty,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.960
so I just bought them.

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:08.000
I'm sorry, Ms. Liu.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.119
Please don't mind.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.299
No...

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:11.079
Really.

00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:12.720
I should thank you.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.039
Because for so many years,

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.559
no one has given me such...

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.000
such beautiful flowers.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.960
I only...

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.039
did such a small thing,

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.200
and you gave me such beautiful flowers.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.359
I'm simply...

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.720
How about this?

00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:30.599
I'll treat you to a meal later.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.880
That would be great.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.759
No.

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:37.720
I'll treat you to a meal.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.799
What would you like to eat?

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:40.039
Order whatever you want.

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:42.099
Xiao Cai!

00:23:42.099 --> 00:23:43.099
It's terrible!

00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:44.099
Xiao Cai,

00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:45.240
why are you back again?

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.059
Didn't I tell you,

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:47.539
there's no rush to come back?

00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:48.559
I know.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.059
But I have something urgent.

00:23:50.059 --> 00:23:51.380
No matter how urgent, it's not as...

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.519
This *is* urgent!

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:54.400
I mean, haven't you finished your business yet?

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.460
Hurry up and go, go on.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:55.900
Go handle it.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.119
What do you mean "go"?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.500
Let me finish what I'm saying!

00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:00.059
Boss Li, Li Jianguo...

00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:01.339
he's sick again.

00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:03.640
Oh my heavens.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.700
I'll go take a look.
