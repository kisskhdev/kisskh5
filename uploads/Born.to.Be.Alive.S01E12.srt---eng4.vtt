[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.130
[Episode 12]

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.020
Oh no.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.630
It's bleeding again.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.160
It might have hit a vessel.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.880
Here.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.070
Tie it tighter.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.320
Look at his hand.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.310
It's all purple.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.509
Can it go any tighter?

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.800
Apply it on the proximal side.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.650
Who?

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.060
The upper arm,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.190
near the shoulder. Here.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.520
Tie it here. Tighten it.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:18.880
Hang in there.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.120
Yes. Right there.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.780
Tighten it.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.650
Stay in the car!

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.329
Don't move!

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.470
Captain.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.300
What's wrong?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.570
So many people.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.829
What are they here for?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.880
Not sure.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.280
Let's not go over there yet.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.780
It's our truck.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.620
Sangba!

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.640
What's going on?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.620
Captain.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.079
There are over 40 people there

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.280
trying to go into the mountains.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.329
We stopped them,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.010
but they refuse to turn back.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.250
How many vehicles?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.240
Three trucks.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.070
The road is blocked,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.530
but they're still shouting

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.470
to get in.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.140
Are they armed?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.960
They haven't pulled out any guns,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.890
but I'm not sure.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.829
These people are very bold.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.380
Zhacuo.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.850
Get that boss out of the truck.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.340
Get down!

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.520
Those people—

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.160
do you know them?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.530
I don't know them.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.030
You don't?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.370
Do you know them? Speak!

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.200
Don't hit him!

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.900
Why are you pulling me?

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.560
Enough!

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.700
Stop it!

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.220
Let go!

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.610
Those people are the buyers.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.000
You arranged to meet

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.400
in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.120
They hand over the money,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.770
take the pelts,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.100
and then head straight across the border,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.720
right?

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.280
Speak!

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.770
Get up!

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.500
We can't go over there

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.250
with those two

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.350
and a truckload of pelts.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.270
What's there to be afraid of?
We charge through.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.200
Charge through?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.330
Those people

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.060
are here to buy pelts

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.920
from those two.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.170
There are dozens of them.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.570
What if they surround us?

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.770
We have guns.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.180
Yeah.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.240
Don't we have the police with us?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.300
Even the police can't just shoot them

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.060
like that.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.400
Get in the car! Let's go help them!

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.960
We can't go over there!

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.850
Sangba,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.460
you and the county militia stop them.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.320
We'll fall back

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.920
and take a detour
out of the Uninhabited Zone.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.450
Captain,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.130
this is

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.080
the shortest way to Mazhi.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.680
If we take a detour,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.170
the road is harder

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.750
and it'll take

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.200
at least 2 more days.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.500
He is injured.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.310
We can't take the risk.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.270
Get in!

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.820
Sangba!

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.540
Hold them off!

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.190
Okay!

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.680
What took you so long?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.960
My mom made me put mousse in my hair.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.090
It was so uncomfortable.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.420
I washed my hair at home.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.870
Sorry

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.060
to keep you waiting.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.250
The movie

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.909
started over half an hour ago.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.070
Then let's watch the next one.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.420
I'm hungry anyway. Let's eat first.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.820
But I want to see this one.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.530
[Farewell My Concubine]

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.320
It's an opera.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.650
What's so good about it?

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.390
True Lies

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.000
is much better.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.600
It's an American blockbuster.
Very exciting.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.900
Hurry up.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:56.790
It's starting.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.180
You'd better not eat sunflower seeds.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.000
Why?

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.410
Doing that in a movie theater

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.600
shows no class.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.200
Look.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.730
Isn't everyone doing it?

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.850
Want some?

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.830
Eat them yourself.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.600
You know what?

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.540
Foreigners

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.060
eat popcorn when watching movies.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.790
Who hasn't had popcorn before?

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.190
Not the kind from the "black cannon."

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.610
Buttered popcorn.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.700
Have you tried it?

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.180
No.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.080
I'll buy you some next time.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.060
Do you still want the soda?

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.090
Does drinking soda make you look unclassy?

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.520
That is fine.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.970
No!

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.590
Stop!

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.500
Here. Watch these two!

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.390
How are you doing?

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.720
Take a break.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:50.580
Here.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.320
Zhacuo.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.030
I'll go give it a try.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.620
Okay.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.250
Ready?

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.080
Ready.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:08:59.610
Okay!

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.570
I'll drive then!

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:00.940
Okay!

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.460
Drive!

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.580
One, two, go!

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.840
Okay!

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.860
One, two, three!

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.990
Push harder!

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.870
Let's go!

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.230
One, two, go!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.300
Come help!

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.160
Let's pull together!

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.650
Come!

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.930
One, two!

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.670
One, two, three!

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.400
One, two, three!

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.880
Does it hurt badly?

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.010
It's okay.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.100
After we get back and go to the hospital,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.500
I'll be fine
after a couple of days of shots.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.290
How many days will this route take?

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.940
Two days.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.480
Three days at most.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.800
I've been this way.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.270
Follow the river,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.980
cut across the mountains to the north,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.440
and we'll hit the highway,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.930
just bypassing the checkpoint.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.170
Why is Zhacuo's team

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.360
not catching up?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.320
Han.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.260
Move aside first.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.580
Here.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.200
Okay.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.030
Go drive.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.700
Come on.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.050
Come and help.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:38.770
Get up!

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:40.700
Get up!

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.100
Go!

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.830
Push the car!

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.240
Go!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.750
One, two, three!

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.020
Let's go, Zhacuo!

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.760
Zhacuo!

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.440
One, two, three!

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.200
Go.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.680
One, two, go!

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.370
Zhacuo!

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.740
One, two, go!

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.510
Get down!

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:12.670
Get down!

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.630
Get down!

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.050
Han!

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.340
The truck's stuck again.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.360
It keeps sinking as we go.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.390
It's too heavy.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.890
We just dug it out.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.390
It's been a whole day,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.450
and we barely covered 10 kilometers.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.810
Are you two holding up?

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.530
We're okay.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.270
Let's set up the tents.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.980
Everyone is exhausted.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720
We can keep going!

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.220
We can keep going!

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:48.690
We can't stop!

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.960
He's arm is still injured.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.280
Everyone up!

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.880
Get in the car!

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.300
Set up the tents!

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.250
Liquor.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.920
Have some.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.350
Thanks.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.550
Careful, it's hot.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.040
Alright.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.760
He Qingyuan has a serious fever.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.870
The Captain can't get up.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.700
We can't go on like this.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.460
Listen.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.080
Let Han take the Captain

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.250
and He Qingyuan

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.660
go ahead in the jeep.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.440
Zhacuo,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.770
you and I stay and deal with the truck.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.740
That won't work.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.250
With just the two of you,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.200
how are you supposed to dig it out?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.790
If we keep you here,

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.080
can you help dig the truck out?

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.810
We'd have to look after you too.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.170
The truck is too heavy.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.600
We won't get far

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.150
before it gets stuck again.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.650
All our energy and strength

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.980
have been spent

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.360
on digging it out.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.010
We're almost out of water and rations.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.500
You know better than I do what'll happen

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.470
if we keep dragging this out.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.650
No.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.100
We're still far from the highway.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.460
What if we leave you here

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.110
and you run into sandstorms,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.340
blizzards,

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:14.870
or poachers?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.790
That's still better than all of us

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.450
getting stuck here and dying.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.670
As long as someone makes it out,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.910
there's hope.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.300
How about this?

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.580
Bai Ju will drive.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.340
Let's take those two

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.200
out first.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.550
Zhacuo,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:01.940
you and Han

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.550
find a way to drive the truck out.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:05.650
Okay.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.960
I don't know the way.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.630
If, on the way,

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.080
you two patients fall asleep,

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.880
I won't be able to

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.140
drive out on my own.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.980
Zhacuo.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.600
Let's stick together.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:19.890
You'll get me

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:20.550
out of here,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.480
right?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:25.820
Yes.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.390
If you get lost,

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.840
look for the North Star.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.690
If

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:00.860
it's cloudy,

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.970
look at the ice on the ground—

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.050
the side

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.040
that melts faster

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.000
is south.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.080
And remember,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.640
most snow mountains and big rivers

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.100
run east to west.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:19.720
Okay.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.460
Don't just follow the tire tracks—

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.030
they could be your own.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:26.890
Don't worry.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.750
Didn't you say

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.190
that we have to finish the path

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.730
to reach our destination?

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.460
If there's an emergency,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.650
don't hesitate.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.280
Shoot immediately.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.050
I promise.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.180
It's cold at night.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.340
Keep this.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.250
There's half a roll left.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:08.960
On the road,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.920
if it feels loose,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.119
tighten it yourself.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:11.750
Got it?

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.900
Aren't you going with us?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.900
There's no room in the car.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.240
I'll stay and watch over things.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.030
You must

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.480
make it out alive.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:58.890
Take care.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:38.700
Zhacuo!

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.250
Take care of them.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.510
A sandstorm's coming.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.100
Hurry! Hurry!

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.640
Isn't it

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.670
hailing?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.900
How is there a sandstorm coming?

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.400
The weather in the Uninhabited Zone

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.280
is unpredictable.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.180
Here, cover up.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.780
Check the stuff in the back!

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:36.630
The stuff in the back!

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.410
Go check it!

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.660
Hurry!

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.480
The tents are gone!

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.350
The tents are gone?

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.910
Yeah.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.260
Hurry up and check

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.460
what else is missing.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.550
Gas,

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.010
water...

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.570
Pelts.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:04.680
One,

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.480
two, three.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.580
No rations left?

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.550
No rations left!

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.050
Check it out! Hurry!

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.880
Check if there's food underneath.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.660
Zhacuo, let's go!

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.790
Let's find the food!

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.940
The blowtorch is here.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.840
Only a little fuel left.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.040
Did you find the food?

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.410
I remember

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.840
there are some in the cab.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.920
I ate half a flatbread.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.030
There are 3 buns left.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.510
Three?

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.330
One for each?

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.010
It won't last the day.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.480
Keep looking.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.010
Where else can we look?

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.160
Let's go.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.940
Before dark,

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.520
we need to find shelter from the wind.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.070
W-Wait, wait.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.250
Is that... is that a sheep?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.580
It's a baby Tibetan antelope.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.140
It probably got separated

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.250
from the herd during the sandstorm.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:33.770
What do we do?

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.270
It's a wild animal.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.660
Can we take it with us?

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.570
A baby antelope alone

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.900
won't survive.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.970
Let's take it for now.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:18.940
Stop the car.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.970
They could be poachers.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.060
They probably ran out of fuel

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.260
and couldn't get out.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.200
I know.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.420
They could also be

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.850
runaway fossickers.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.250
Get a few buns.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.510
We don't have many left.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.440
Get some.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.330
It's a waste to give the buns to them.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:48.960
Within hundreds of kilometers,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.020
they won't get out.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:50.790
By then,

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.360
no one will have food.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.090
Then it comes out of your share.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:57.750
That's all?

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.770
That's all.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.070
Zhacuo.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.760
Is this an old sheep pen

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.410
that was torn down?

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:10.750
No, no.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.870
It was for hunting years ago.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.420
See the two rows of stones?

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.880
That opening is wider,

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.280
and this one is narrower.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.910
When an animal accidentally wanders in,

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.760
it can only follow the stones.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.640
They put a pile of traps here,

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.650
and that's how they caught them.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.310
Like this?

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:32.520
Yeah.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.450
That's such a clever method.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.920
It's too much trouble.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.780
Nowadays they just use guns.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.150
Stay here.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.520
I'll get you some grass.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.480
Look!

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.030
It was left by the Captain!

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:28.680
Give it to me.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.180
Look.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.250
[You must take care of yourselves!]

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.250
That's the Captain's handwriting.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.670
They passed through here too.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.220
Looks like we're on the right track.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.570
Are those vultures?

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.770
Yes.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.240
Will they bite us?

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.700
No.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.560
If vultures

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:03.880
are flying low,

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:04.980
it means someone

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.040
or some animal nearby is about to die.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.500
They're waiting for the carcass.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.130
Someone's stuck in quicksand.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.330
Don't go over there!

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.720
Come back! Come back!

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.400
There's quicksand!

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.000
Come back!

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:58.980
Come back!

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.640
Wake up!

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.360
Can you speak?

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.290
We need to pull him out.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.460
I'll get the rope.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.300
My friend!

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.050
Are you okay?

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.290
Don't be afraid!

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.170
We'll save you right away!

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:30.970
Don't move!

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.590
Zhacuo!

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.850
Don't panic!

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.330
Hurry!

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.310
Coming.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.480
Hurry.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.250
Here.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.270
Don't move!

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.750
Grab the rope!

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:51.420
Okay.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:51.990
Come on.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.480
Grab it!

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.280
Hold on tight!

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.460
Come on!

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:54.830
Come on!

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.380
One,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.050
two,

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:56.570
three!

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.100
Let's go!

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.270
No, no.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.410
It won't work.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.270
What are you doing?

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.680
Here.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.610
You'll fall into it too.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.590
I'm light.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.960
Hold me tight later.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:15.920
Tighter.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.540
Don't move!

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.350
Alright, alright. Go now.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.810
Alright.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:19.240
Alright.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.370
Give me the canteen.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.790
Don't move!

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:30.400
Be careful!

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.610
Don't worry.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:48.940
Don't move.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:55.700
Don't be afraid.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:11.250
Here.

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.310
Have some water.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.970
Lift your head.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.010
Did you get it?

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:29.150
I'll hold on to you.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:29.920
Don't move.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.000
Okay!

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.940
Pull!

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.570
One, two, go!

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.740
One, two, go!

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.570
It's not working! Pull again!

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.240
Pull!

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.680
Harder!

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.040
One, two!

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.610
Pull again!

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.380
Pull!

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:56.730
Wait a second!

00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.980
It's not working.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.440
Hang in there. It's almost done.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.200
Don't move.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.030
Loosen the rope a bit.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.680
Okay!

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.820
Ready!

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.160
Come on!

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.050
Pull hard!

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.420
One, two, three, pull!

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:52.890
Pull!

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.350
Again!

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.460
Pull!

00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.700
Pull!

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.090
Harder!

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.520
Keep pulling!

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.920
One, two, three!

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:08.770
Quick!

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.110
One, two!

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.030
Pull!

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.250
Pull!

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.980
One, two, pull!

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.980
Harder!

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.530
Pull!

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.110
Again!

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.760
Pull!

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.920
One, two, three!

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:30.830
Almost out!

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.270
One, two, three!

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:34.790
One!

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.180
Again!

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.550
One, two, three!

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:40.360
Wait!

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.380
Come on! Pull!

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.500
Have some water.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.760
Have some hot water.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:45.429
Here.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:53.730
Why did you come into

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.989
the Uninhabited Zone?

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.710
To hunt antelopes?

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.380
No.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.400
Mining gold...

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.050
With my brother...

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.130
A fossicker.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:07.550
Then why did you

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.340
get out alone?

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.600
Where is your brother?

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.270
He got taken.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.000
He was taken away.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.880
He was taken away?

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.650
By whom?

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.340
I don't know.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.860
They had guns.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.090
Guns?

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:30.630
That's similar to what I faced

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.900
when I first came in.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.350
Do you know

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.510
where they took him?

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.670
He fainted again.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.800
Captain.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.530
Are you cold?

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.230
Captain?

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.530
Captain?

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.440
He!

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:34.690
He!

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.090
What did you two do?

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.160
We didn't do anything!

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:42.730
They just passed out!

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.040
Exactly.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.710
Han.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.510
Is it okay to drink with a stomachache?

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.720
It'll warm you up.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.690
I'm fine.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.590
Are you guys cold?

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.050
I'm not cold.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:29.900
Keep it on.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.340
How is He?

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:33.190
Let me check on him.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.570
Captain.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.710
He's burning up.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.650
Let's go now.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.500
Okay.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.400
Duojie.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.130
Duojie.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:34.670
Uncle...

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.710
Get... Director Zhang.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:43.940
Okay.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.420
He Qingyuan has a gunshot wound
to his upper left arm.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.480
He was hit 3 days ago

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.700
and the bullet hasn't been removed.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.880
He's been sent for X‑rays.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.670
Plasma is ready,

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.570
and he'll get a transfusion right after.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:04.630
What about Duojie?

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:05.570
He said it was gastritis,

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.190
an old problem.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.880
But it looks more like
a gastric ulcer to me.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.590
There may be more than one ulcer site.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:10.340
What about the others?

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:10.880
Are they in danger?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.340
The rest

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.360
are suffering from dehydration
and hypothermia

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:12.880
to varying degrees.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.130
They're all being monitored.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:14.990
Where is Bai Ju?

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.860
Bai Ju?

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.590
I didn't see her.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:21.870
Glucose, painkillers,

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.500
gauze, alcohol,

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.830
and morphine.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.280
Give me another box of cardiac stimulants.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:26.780
Okay.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.950
This antibiotic is for you.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.000
Now that you're back,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:32.880
you need a gastroscopy

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.410
to find all the ulcer sites.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.710
I've seen He Qingyuan's X‑rays.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.250
If the necrotic area is too large

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.310
and irreversible,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.110
amputation may be necessary.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:41.970
No amputation.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.860
No amputation.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.550
Ms. Kang,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:40:59.930
you can save him.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.440
You're a cadre

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.860
and you call me that?

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.800
On the way back,

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.060
I kept thinking

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.650
that I should've left

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:21.690
those two gunmen

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.430
in there

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.110
and brought Bai Ju and the others back.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.480
When Bai fell that day,

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.850
his colleagues asked
if he had any last words.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.300
He said,

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.780
"The fugitive fired

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.480
3 shots in total.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:42.690
There should still be

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.190
2 bullets left in the gun."

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.080
And then he...

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:51.590
His colleagues said

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.480
he left me

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.310
no last words.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.440
He was always like that.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.130
When he did something,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:58.730
he focused on that one thing,

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.070
finished it, then moved on to the next.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.130
Don't think too much.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.850
Just focus on what's in front of you.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.530
Food isn't a problem.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:18.860
Gas is the real problem.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.260
Wangmu doesn't have any either.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:34.470
Go to the trading company.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.670
The trading company doesn't take credit.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.330
The money isn't enough.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:52.800
Sell the pelts.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:55.260
What?

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.020
Sell them.
