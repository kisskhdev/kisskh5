♪Everything in my memories
feels so beautiful♪

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.800
Have you made up your mind?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.620
♪In every photo,
your smiles are always so bright♪

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.960
Didn't we agree you'd make it up to me?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.750
♪Giving off a laid-back vibe♪

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.390
♪Maybe time will slowly wear our edges down♪

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.110
♪When we look back,
we'll just laugh at our youth♪

♪If we could go back,

(Is this)

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.080
(a dream?)

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.320
After all these years,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.580
you're still using the same wallpaper.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.480
Were you looking in my phone?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.040
Not interested.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.720
Your phone kept ringing last night.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.360
So I put it on silent for you.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.000
Move aside.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.840
I'm heading out.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.320
How was my service last night?

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.800
Honestly,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.080
it was just okay.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.960
Then let's do it again.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.820
(Keep Love)

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.600
Ruomai.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.040
Where's Ding Daang?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.720
President Hu.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.320
Sorry about that.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.240
She had too much to drink last night.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.840
I took her back to my place.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.560
Then take me to your place.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.880
She left early this morning.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.400
Said she was heading
to the temple to pray.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.920
The temple?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.120
Which temple?

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.560
That temple on Mount Nan.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.200
She said years ago,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.800
she made a wish there

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.080
for a good marriage.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.920
Isn't it a tradition to repay the wish
once it comes true?

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.160
But why didn't she answer my phone?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.560
Maybe she's busying praying
at the temple.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.760
President Hu, please don't worry.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.440
She'll be back soon.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.240
I'm really anxious
that we can't find her.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.080
Don't panic.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.800
You have to trust me.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.640
No,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.160
trust Ding Daang.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.220
(Keep Love)

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.080
Baby,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.160
- if...
- I choose you.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.880
- What if...
- Still you.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.240
But if...

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.080
You're my priority.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.640
I haven't yet...

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.520
You're the most beautiful woman
in the world.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.760
- I...
- Buy what you like.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.300
I'll go with whatever you say.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.960
Baby, you're just too sweet.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.720
With Keep Love around,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.040
no more arguing.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.440
But endless sweetness.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.840
Keep Love just got

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840
two brand-new features.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.240
One's the Quarrel Shield,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.520
which helps couples work through

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.800
any kind of disagreement,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.080
big or small.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.480
The other is the Pain Barrier,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.080
turning every heartbreak

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.800
into a warm memory.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.160
I told you, I really can't pay it back.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.640
If you truly want to help me,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.880
please keep your distance.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.080
Aming.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.200
I've made up my mind.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.540
I'm studying abroad with Professor Luo.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.040
Chen Aming.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.240
I'm going to make you pay for this.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.040
Ding Daang doesn't need you

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.800
to keep going with life.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.400
With Keep Love around,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.200
no matter how many years pass,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.320
no matter the misunderstandings between you,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.720
your first love

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.080
will still be the one you hold dearly.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.400
Congratulations!

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.800
You had excellent sleep last night.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.200
Everything's on track so far.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.800
If you truly feel guilty about
what happened,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.280
stay with me for one more week.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.640
So, what do you say?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.280
Have you made up your mind?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.160
Since you made that choice back then,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.800
you shouldn't have come back.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.800
Why show up all of a sudden?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.640
Why come back just to mess with my life?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.400
Ding,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.840
I don't care where you are.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.880
Get back here right now.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.720
Now!

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.600
Ruomai.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.960
Hey, don't panic, okay?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.920
How can I not panic?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.520
So 'singles' night' means
not coming home all night?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:58.880
You know,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.920
I've been waiting for him for so long.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.680
I just want to spend
a few more days with him.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.680
Do you even realize what you're saying?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.760
Don't you see how risky that is?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.960
Ruomai.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.320
You know best about me.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.040
Alright, alright, I get it.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.880
But let's be clear first.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.280
Take good care of yourself.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.000
Don't let yourself fall for him again.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.520
If anything happens,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.080
tell me right away.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.480
Give me a little more time.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.880
I'll think it through carefully.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.960
Hey!

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.190
Were you eavesdropping?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600
Have you figured out

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.440
how to explain it to your fiancé?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.720
What is it?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.840
You getting scared?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.360
Like it or not,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.480
you've already become

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.840
the third wheel.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.800
I'm just starting out in Mancheng.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.040
Getting tangled in your relationship,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.880
isn't going to do me any good.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.840
If you truly cared,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.400
nothing wouldn't have happened.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.920
But since it already did,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.640
the fallout

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.240
is yours to deal with.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.320
So, Miss Ding, you'd already set me up.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.680
Alright then.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.000
Miss Ding,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.600
what's your plan for today?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.720
I'm in, all the way.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.600
You ordered takeout from my shop.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.280
What's your intention here?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.040
The daily limited chestnut cake.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.520
Top seller in the whole store.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.400
I've just got to taste it.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.120
Do you need me to feed you?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.050
Or you eat it yourself?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.040
Tastes just like back then.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.360
I'm warning you.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.640
Don't act recklessly.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.960
As long as you play nice,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.040
I've got your back in Mancheng.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.200
Otherwise...

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.480
Otherwise I'll get nowhere?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.680
That could work.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.880
Suga Love.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.720
(Suga Love)
A lovely name.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.720
I picked it at random.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.480
Want me to help you pick a name?

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.120
I brought you a gift.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.240
(Suga Love)
From your favorite author.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.440
She's released a new book.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.680
Where did you get it?

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.880
I picked it out for you

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.040
at the bookstore.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.240
Funny thing.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.920
The heroine's name is Ding Daang.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.000
And the hero's

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.040
is called Aming.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.560
Seriously?

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.440
What a coincidence.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.640
I have to read it carefully.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.440
On my way here,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.360
I saw this delicious cake.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.120
I carried it all the way back

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.640
in case it's chipped. Try it.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.600
Tastes good.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.020
(Hu Yitong)

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.520
Ding Daang, you finally picked up.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.200
Where have you been?

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.400
(Hu Yitong)
I bought breakfast for you.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.960
She's already had one.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.200
Who are you?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.040
I'm her fiancé.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.400
(Hu Yitong)
Then who am I?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.560
Good question.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.800
Call back when you figure that out.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.940
(Suga Love)

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.480
Is it fun?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.480
Aren't you the one who likes a thrill?

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.840
Then let's play big.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.560
So where exactly is Ding Daang now?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.000
President Hu, please don't worry.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.400
Before the engagement,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.080
I promise I'll bring her to you.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.400
The pain from one's family of origin

takes a lifetime to heal.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.280
Gu Ruomai.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.280
I'll be the one to heal her trauma.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.680
We should get going.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.840
Where to?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.920
