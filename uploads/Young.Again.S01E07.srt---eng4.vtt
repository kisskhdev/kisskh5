00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.060
Mr. Fan

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.060
I heard you're a retired professor

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.500
with very high academic standing

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.260
so I have a few questions to ask you

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:04.579
You've heard about that?

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.480
Bring it here, let me see

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.260
Here, this one

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.280
You're Yingzi, right?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.960
Hello

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.639
You can ask me questions too, you know

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.439
You don't have to ask him

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.560
Ask you?

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.039
Are you up to it?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.479
Yeah, President Li

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.180
This is in English

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.560
Do you understand it?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.479
I don't understand?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.759
Yeah right

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.439
When I went to India for business back then

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.919
even the beggars there understood English

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.479
President Li

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.180
Then tell us

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.120
what this means

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.039
The meaning of this paragraph is...

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.120
Why should I tell you?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.319
Didn't you say you understood?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.840
Do I have to tell you just because I understand?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.879
Is that so?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.500
If you can translate

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.439
this sentence

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.000
I'll give you one hundred yuan

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.860
Deal?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.659
Deal

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.719
The meaning of this passage is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.400
Heaven gave me talent for a reason

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.800
And a mouse's son can dig a hole

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.599
I earned this hundred bucks easily

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.919
Come back, come back

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.539
Put it down

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.060
I earned this hundred bucks

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.400
You translated it wrong

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.219
Why are you taking it?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.259
You just said

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.099
you'd pay a hundred if I translated it

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.840
You didn't say I had to translate it correctly

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960
Bye-bye now

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.960
You're cheating

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.680
Give it to me

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.539
Give me the money

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:31.560
Xiaolan

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.879
Where have you been?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:33.719
I went shopping

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.479
Zhongguancun No. 1 was really lively

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.120
How can you go shopping during work hours?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.919
What are you doing?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.319
Did you give Gou'er Ye his medicine today?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.800
I actually forgot about that

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.199
How could you forget that?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.080
If Dr. Chang finds out

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.400
How could he possibly know?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.319
If he finds out

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.680
it means you snitched

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.280
Me?

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.680
Gou'er Ye, time for your medicine.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.280
Okay.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.400
Here.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.520
You take it.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.520
What?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.740
It's not for me.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.879
It's for you.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.319
Don't be polite, I'm not hungry.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.360
You have to take it.

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:14.099
What for?

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.139
This isn't medicine.

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.040
It's chocolate.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.319
I won't take medicine if you don't give me chocolate.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.279
For an old man your age,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.339
why are you so greedy?

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.420
Fine, here you go.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:24.120
Here.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.480
Xiaolan.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.839
How can you give him chocolate?

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:29.000
This is my chocolate.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.839
Gou'er Ye.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.040
You have diabetes.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.160
You can't eat sweets.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.680
You must never give him sweets again.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.000
Or it could be dangerous.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.959
Then what should I do?

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:37.600
Without chocolate,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.879
this old man won't take his medicine.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.879
Figure something out.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.319
Gou'er Ye.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.360
Take your medicine first.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.839
After the medicine, I'll buy you eight-treasure porridge.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.720
Sugar-free.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:49.680
Is it sweet?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.720
It's sweet.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.360
Come on, take the medicine first.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.439
This medicine...

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.160
Xiaolan, did you get the wrong medicine?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.259
Impossible.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:00.959
How could I...

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:02.959
You really got it wrong.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.079
Look, this is so dangerous.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.360
Go change it immediately.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:07.199
Okay.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.920
You have to take this medicine away too.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.240
It can't stay here.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.360
Stand there.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.160
Director Chang.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.639
Has Gou'er Ye taken his medicine?

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.639
He has.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.120
You get some rest.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.360
Xiaofang.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.639
It's not that I don't let you eat snacks.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.959
But it's working hours right now.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.120
It wasn't me.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.040
This chocolate is...

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.019
That chocolate is for me to eat.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.040
How could you give Gou'er Ye chocolate?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.199
Do you know what condition he has?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.420
I know.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.319
He has diabetes.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:41.480
You knew, yet you still gave it to him?

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:43.399
If he develops ketones, who's responsible?

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.420
I didn't give him chocolate.

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:46.819
I was trying to give him his medicine.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.980
Just to give him medicine,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.100
you let him eat chocolate?

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:50.540
What medicine is this?

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.519
Do you know you took the wrong medicine?

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.060
This is the wrong one.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.560
This isn't for Gou'er Ye.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.379
Xiaofang, you have disappointed me so much.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.860
Do you know that giving a patient the wrong medicine

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.800
can be extremely dangerous?

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:03.279
You and Xiaolan, the two of you,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.220
are both currently on probation.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.120
Only one of you can stay at the center.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.540
I originally intended to keep you.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.600
I really didn't expect you...

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:09.939
Dr. Chang.

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:10.939
This isn't the one. Xiaofang...

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:11.899
took the wrong one.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.579
It should be this bottle.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.060
I...

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:16.019
Look at this.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.019
You two came from the same place.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:19.420
How can your professional skills differ so much?

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.500
Can't you learn more from Xiaolan?

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.980
Director Chang, this was actually...

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.300
Actually, I was supposed to feed Gou'er Ye.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.019
But I heard Grandma Jin coughing just now,

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.459
so I went to check on her for Xiaofang.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:30.079
I didn't expect that in just this moment...

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.420
Director Chang, please don't criticize her anymore.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.860
She was just trying to help me out.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.860
She can't even do her own job properly,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.819
yet she tries to help others?

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.300
No, she meant well.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.480
Please don't criticize her.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:41.720
Xiaofang, go check on Grandma Jin.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.800
Come back.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:44.420
Come back.

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:47.199
Dr. Chang, are there any other instructions?

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.100
Your shift leader,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.100
Sister Niu,

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:52.420
has taken two weeks of sick leave.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:54.420
So during this period,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.740
the acting shift leader...

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.860
Xiaolan, you do it.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620
Thank you, Dr. Chang.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.339
I, Xiaolan, promise to complete the task.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:03.939
Gou'er Ye.

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:04.620
I'm leaving now.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.339
Remember to take your medicine.

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:06.220
Take your medicine.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.720
Xiaofang

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.279
Go check if today's delivery is here.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.360
But I'm giving Grandma Jin her medicine.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.439
I can't step away.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.759
You dare disobey the boss?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800
If I leave,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.079
who will watch Grandma Jin?

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:30.839
It's fine.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.160
I'm here.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.639
Then you have to be careful.

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:37.439
Don't let her choke.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.079
I know, she won't.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.519
Grandma Jin,

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:43.019
let me give you your medicine.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.279
You want to sleep here?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.060
Here.

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:54.240
What's wrong?

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.899
Why are you coughing?

00:07:58.579 --> 00:07:59.620
A monk?

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.139
From which temple?

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:04.259
Talk about a tangent.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:05.060
Hey.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.819
What is going on here?

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:08.139
Royal Physician Sun, it's my fault.

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:09.420
I forgot to remind Xiaofang today

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.860
to suction Grandma Jin's phlegm.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.100
What?

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.480
You got the munchies?

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:18.819
Who doesn't love a tasty treat?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.500
It's such a routine procedure.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:21.899
Does it need reminding?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.939
Isn't she on probation?

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:25.620
She lacks experience.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.939
It's understandable.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.740
I'll suction Grandma Jin right now.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.699
About this...

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:31.839
please don't tell Director Chang.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.580
That won't do.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.460
This matter...

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.139
I must report to Director Chang immediately.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.019
What? Sleeping?

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.460
Didn't I just wake up from my nap?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.940
Don't! I'll suction the phlegm right now.

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:46.700
No need.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.440
Well...

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.620
This morning,

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:50.559
Xiaofang already did it for me.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.059
You can hear again all of a sudden?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.259
Xiaolan.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.179
Grandma Jin, have an orange.

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:02.779
Why is it that

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:04.600
you're the one looking after Grandma Jin now?

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.139
Xiaofang said

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.080
she had to go out for something.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.340
Here.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:09.820
Hmph.

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:10.980
Just as I thought.

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:26.460
How is this couplet?

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:27.940
Is it neat?

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.539
Not bad, not bad at all.

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:33.860
Noun matches noun.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.500
Verb matches verb.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.259
Adjective matches adjective.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.919
Typo matches typo.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.559
Hey!

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.779
Why can't you say anything nice?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.259
Hello, grandpas.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.139
Xiaofang is here.

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:46.220
Is there a problem?

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:47.539
Do you need my advice?

00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:48.299
No.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.700
It's just that I'm off duty today.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.980
I want to go into town for a walk.

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:52.899
Is there anything you two need to buy?

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.340
I can bring it back for you.

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:55.860
Then first help me...

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.320
...get an ink cartridge.

00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:57.899
Okay.

00:09:57.899 --> 00:09:59.379
Buy me a bottle of Zhonghua ink.

00:09:59.379 --> 00:09:59.820
Sure.

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:00.480
By the way.

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:02.899
If you pass by a pharmacy...

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.299
...buy me a pair of those magnetic insoles.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:06.700
The kind that cures foot odor.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:07.879
You have foot odor?

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:10.460
I hadn't noticed until you mentioned it.

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:12.019
Who has foot odor?

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:13.059
I'm buying them for you.

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:14.899
When you take off your shoes, the smell makes me dizzy.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.899
My feet smell?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.419
Slander!

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.899
Xiaofang.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.940
Buy me a magnetic herbal pillow.

00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:23.220
The kind that treats snoring.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.740
You snore when you sleep?

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.580
I don't snore.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.399
He snores.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.159
His snoring is outrageous.

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:31.340
Keeps me up all night.

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:32.460
Who snores?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.539
You are spreading rumors.

00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:34.860
If you don't believe me, let's listen tonight.

00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:36.299
Then who has smelly feet?

00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:37.340
Smell them right now.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.980
Knock it off, don't embarrass yourself.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.379
Grandpas, please stop arguing.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.740
The things you want to buy...

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.700
...I've written them down.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.980
I'll go buy them for you now.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.700
Don't go yet.

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:46.220
We have to give you the money.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.059
No need, we can settle it when I get back.

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:48.980
I use WeChat Pay.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.779
It's very convenient.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:50.759
Take it first.

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:51.860
After you buy them...

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.860
...we'll settle the difference.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.580
Right. What if mine isn't enough?

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.940
Use Professor Fan's money to cover it.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.340
Don't.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.820
If his money isn't enough, don't buy it for him.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.659
Here, take it.

00:10:58.659 --> 00:10:59.740
Really, no need, Grandpa.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.100
Take it.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.659
When I get back...

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:01.700
How can we not give you money?

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.419
Aha!

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.340
I've caught you this time, haven't I?

00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:06.019
Xiaofang, you have some nerve.

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:07.700
Daring to solicit red envelopes privately.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.759
Who solicited red envelopes?

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.559
I can testify.

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:12.460
She didn't ask for it.

00:11:13.299 --> 00:11:14.179
This red envelope is...

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.539
What red envelope?

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:18.059
This money is for her to buy things for us.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:19.580
Giving things isn't allowed either.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.879
Who gave things?

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:22.860
This money is for her...

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.580
...to buy things on our behalf.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.179
That's right.

00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:26.059
Grandpas.

00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:27.340
What are you afraid of?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.019
If there's a problem, file a complaint.

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:29.860
Don't worry.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.580
She doesn't dare do anything to you.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.299
Xiaolan, you...

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.820
...you are bullying people too much.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.340
That's right.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.019
Don't falsely accuse good people.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.059
Let's go.

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:40.779
Come with me to reason with Director Chang.

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:42.139
Who are you scaring with the Director?

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.299
You think I...

00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:45.460
...wouldn't dare?

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:48.379
Thinking just because someone protects you, you're fine.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.980
Your probation is almost up.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.340
Watch yourself.

00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:56.139
I think you're the one who needs to be careful.

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:58.139
You have too many wicked schemes.

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:59.139
Watch out for premature beats.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.840
I'm so pissed off.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.879
Hello, Dr. Chang.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.360
This is Xiaolan.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.240
I need to report a situation.

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:14.200
My heart has been feeling really uncomfortable lately.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.759
I might be having premature beats.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.759
Who told you to be so scheming?

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:19.799
You... I...

00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:20.779
Calm down.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.159
Calm and objective.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:23.919
Let's not get involved.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:24.679
We'll just investigate.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:26.720
No, she is just too infuriating.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.779
Who do you think you are?

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:28.600
That's enough.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.419
Xiaofang, why are you being so polite with me?

00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:38.460
If I say take it, just take it.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.500
I really can't.

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:40.820
The community has rules.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.419
We can't accept gifts from patients.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:44.019
You're not accepting it.

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:45.200
I'm giving it to you.

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:47.620
Besides, I'm not a patient.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.100
That's still not allowed.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.500
I say it's allowed, so it is.

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:53.799
My daughter brought this back from a business trip.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.799
One box for you.

00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:56.059
One box for Grandma Jin.

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:57.299
Little Li.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.259
Is this for me?

00:12:59.259 --> 00:12:59.820
Yes.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.139
It sticks to my teeth.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.220
Just give it to Xiaofang.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:03.700
You see?

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.299
Grandma Jin has spoken.

00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:06.039
Just accept it.

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:06.820
Try a piece first.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.139
It's really delicious, I'm telling you.

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:08.980
Really, try it.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.759
Xiaogan sesame candy.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.100
It's my favorite.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.620
Really?

00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:14.100
You like it too?

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.340
That's great.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.419
Then these two boxes...

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.659
I'm giving them to Xiaofang.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:19.460
President Li...

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.779
I... I...

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.379
Grandma Jin.

00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:25.460
Royal Physician Sun.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.139
Come take a look, quick.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.220
What's wrong with Grandma Jin?

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:29.179
Grandma Jin.

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:30.980
Where does it hurt?

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.620
Where are the flower buds?

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:35.460
Don't pick them. Wait for them to bloom.

00:13:36.379 --> 00:13:37.220
Royal Physician Sun.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.659
Grandma Jin is getting on in years.

00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:39.860
For the details...

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.139
You'll have to ask Xiaofang.

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:44.059
Xiaofang.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.620
Grandma Jin's...

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:48.559
You...

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.059
Why are you eating snacks during work hours?

00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:52.700
I wasn't eating snacks.

00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:53.740
This is President Li...

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.840
President Li just gave this to me.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.779
She's just having a taste.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.299
You're accepting gifts from an elder?

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.659
No, Royal Physician Sun...

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:01.340
Let me explain.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.000
Save it. No need to explain.

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:04.539
I know exactly what's going on.

00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:05.899
No, Sun...

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:08.500
Xiaolan, what do you have to say?

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:25.940
Stop right there

00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:27.379
Where are you going?

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.100
Taking Grandma Jin out for a walk.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.460
Did you feed her?

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.100
Yes, I did.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.139
Did she take her medicine?

00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:32.980
Yes, she did.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.500
Then...

00:14:34.659 --> 00:14:36.460
Did you take her for a walk?

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:38.299
Not yet.

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:38.940
Look.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.220
How are you doing your job?

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:42.700
Isn't that what I'm doing right now?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.340
Well...

00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:49.580
Xiaolan.

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:51.299
What are you looking for?

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:52.159
I'm finding fault.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:52.860
No.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.620
I'm looking for an excuse.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.460
No, not that either.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.659
I...

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.460
I'm checking to see...

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.299
if there's any work you missed.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.139
Oh, right.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.700
Did you give Gou'er Ye...

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.220
a nail trim?

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.340
Did you cut his hair?

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:07.600
No.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.320
Why not?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.379
Isn't that your job?

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.460
My job?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.139
Why can't you do it?

00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:16.740
If I do it, does that mean you can't?

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.539
Go.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.419
But if I go...

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.940
who will walk Grandma Jin?

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.179
I'm here.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.919
So...

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:26.039
Grandma Jin.

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:27.659
I'm going to leave for a bit.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.500
I'll come back to keep you company later.

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:33.220
Where did you buy that big watermelon?

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.539
Grandma Jin.

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:36.799
I'm busy.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:37.740
You just...

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.100
stay here in the shade...

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.379
and cool off by yourself.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.259
Xiaolan.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.940
Dr. Chang, I...

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.259
I was just taking Grandma Jin for a walk.

00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:52.419
Why are you taking care of Grandma Jin again?

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:53.460
Where is Xiaofang?

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.139
She went out to meet her boyfriend.

00:15:56.139 --> 00:15:57.659
So I'm just doing a bit more to cover for her.

00:15:57.659 --> 00:15:58.940
She found a boyfriend already?

00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:00.179
Even if she found a boyfriend...

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.500
she shouldn't go out during work hours.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.299
That's outrageous.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.779
Fine, thanks for your hard work.

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:07.059
Little Chang, she didn't find a boyfriend.

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:09.139
She went to buy me a big watermelon.

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:10.659
Whenever this happens...

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:12.460
your hearing suddenly works.

00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:13.980
I have things to do.

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:15.059
You just...

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:17.019
stay here quietly for a while.

00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:18.419
Wait.

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:19.460
Wait, I...

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:21.419
I have an emergency.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.279
You said this sentence is...

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.419
Grandma Jin.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.940
Why are you here alone?

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.820
Where's the caregiver?

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.500
This is bad.

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:32.100
Xiaocai.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.259
I need to use the toilet.

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:35.820
No problem.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.100
I'll take you there.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.500
Go away.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.620
Take me where?

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.299
You, a grown man...

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.179
why are you meddling?

00:16:41.179 --> 00:16:42.220
It's okay, no problem.

00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:44.740
We Chinese people...

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.779
men and women keep their distance, understand?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.980
What does that mean?

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:48.779
It means...

00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:50.259
that men and women...

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.779
I'm not explaining it to you.

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:54.179
If I wait any longer, I won't make it.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:54.960
Make...

00:16:55.159 --> 00:16:55.899
it?

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.740
Oh dear.

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:00.820
What happened?

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.139
Still didn't make it.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.480
Giving patients the wrong medicine

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.339
Snacking during work hours

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.460
Meeting your boyfriend on the clock

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.779
Soliciting red envelopes

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:16.019
Accepting gifts

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.299
Neglecting the elderly

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:18.259
Causing Grandma Jin...

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.299
Come here

00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:20.779
Give me an explanation

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.500
I won't explain

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.460
What kind of attitude is that?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.940
I quit

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.019
Is that good enough for you?

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.019
You think you're in the right?

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:32.380
I'm so furious

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.299
I'm really furious

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:36.900
That's how the real world is

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.380
Every workplace

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:40.259
has these deceitful schemers

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.880
who thrive like fish in water

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:42.819
No

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.099
I have to step in

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:54.740
I've made up my mind.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.059
I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.859
Don't go.

00:17:56.859 --> 00:17:57.660
Don't leave!

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.619
With Xiaolan here,

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:01.380
I can't do this job.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.119
Xiaofang, don't be so impulsive.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.759
You're the joy of Changqingju.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.539
If you leave,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.000
the elders will be so upset.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.720
Exactly.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.599
Brother Yusheng, stop talking.

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:12.420
I...

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.079
I can't bear to leave the elders either.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.799
Especially Grandma Jin.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.519
She treats you like her own granddaughter.

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:20.680
If you go, you're dumping her on Xiaolan?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.279
That's right.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:22.319
Grandma Jin...

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.400
Grandma Jin...

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.240
I feel like she's my own grandmother.

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:30.519
But I've already said the words.

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:31.640
What are you afraid of?

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:33.519
I'll write you a certificate tomorrow.

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:34.880
You get the elders to sign it.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.000
It'll definitely work.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.279
Childish.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.279
That's kid stuff.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.079
What signature?

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.759
What certificate?

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.799
None of that works.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.880
The urgent task right now

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:50.559
is for Xiaofang to write a detailed,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.079
concise,

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:54.319
and material-rich resignation report.

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:56.440
Why resign?

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.960
Lao Li, what kind of idea is that?

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:00.000
Isn't this

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:01.279
eating salt when you're thirsty,

00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:02.539
wearing cotton when you're hot?

00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:04.839
Yes, Grandpa President Li.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.359
I'm still on probation.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.960
I can just leave.

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:11.279
Why write a resignation report?

00:19:11.279 --> 00:19:11.920
No.

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:14.279
This resignation report must be written.

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:16.680
Young people

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.319
must finish what they start.

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:22.119
Then what should I write?

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.440
First, the reason for resignation.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:26.599
The process.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.559
Then there's our Changqingju's

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:31.519
elders' ages,

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:32.920
hometowns,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.440
medical history,

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:35.880
marital history,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.240
resumes,

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:38.599
relationships with children,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.039
contact information,

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.519
temperaments,

00:19:41.519 --> 00:19:42.680
hobbies and interests,

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:44.079
and when nursing,

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:45.160
what to pay attention to.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.279
I'm resigning,

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:48.160
what's the use of writing all this?

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.759
It's useful.

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:51.519
Listen to Grandpa.

00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:52.960
That's right.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.799
This child is really outrageous.

00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:59.240
She's here. What's here?

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.319
Why are there so many people?

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.640
I get it.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.079
Preparing to celebrate my successful employment, right?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.559
It's all what I should do.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.119
Look.

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:14.400
Under my meticulous care,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.839
Grandma Jin's cough

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:17.559
is much smoother than before.

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:21.720
Auntie Cai's eye-rolling

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.539
is also more fresh and refined than before.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.200
Grandpa Liang's facial twitching

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.920
is much more lively than before.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.599
You traitor dog!

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.180
Wait for the Eighth Route Army to deal with you!

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.440
Gou'er Ye's cursing

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.640
is also more full of energy than before.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.440
You are shameless.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.000
Mr. Rudy too...

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.119
What are you saying?

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:45.079
Rudy, what he's saying is...

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.519
There are two Chinese characters

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:47.720
that he knows how to write.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.000
You definitely don't know how to write.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.680
Impossible. What characters?

00:20:50.839 --> 00:20:51.640
Shame.

00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:52.839
Can you write it?

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:55.000
Why wouldn't I know shame?

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.619
Don't worry, Xiaofang

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:02.359
The real culprit

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:03.279
We all told Dr. Chang

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:04.160
We all support you

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.240
Child

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:08.319
Don't be afraid

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:10.559
No matter what happens

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.799
Grandma is on your side

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.599
Right

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.799
What's that...

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.400
How do they say it nowadays?

00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:18.920
Back you

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.279
Support you

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:21.559
Support and back you

00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:32.839
No

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.480
Just

00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:34.960
What

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.480
I couldn't hear to begin with

00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:38.240
And you stick this lousy

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.400
lousy thing in here

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:42.319
Lao Li

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:43.680
It's all your fault

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.240
Making the kid write some resignation report

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.279
Isn't this

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:48.799
self-sabotage

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.039
and giving others leverage?

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:51.319
I really don't get you

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.200
It's not strange you don't get it

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.380
It'd be strange if you did

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.319
You haven't navigated the business world

00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:59.359
Don't understand HR

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.119
Don't understand personnel relations

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:02.440
This resignation report

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.599
on the surface is a resignation report

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.920
but in reality

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720
it's still a resignation report

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.920
Isn't that nonsense?

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.839
But the mystery lies in

00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:12.319
this resignation report

00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:13.799
Let me tell you

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.920
Are you listening or not?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.519
Look

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:20.839
Look at you

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.079
how old are you

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:23.079
still doing this

00:22:23.119 --> 00:22:24.839
Do you know what this was called in the past?

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.640
It's called eavesdropping

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:27.460
Honestly

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:29.759
Move aside, all of you

00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:30.599
Here, let me listen too

00:22:32.839 --> 00:22:33.880
You took it away

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:37.359
I've said it before

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680
Of the two of you

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:39.960
only one can stay

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.920
But now

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:44.240
since Xiaofang voluntarily resigned

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:47.039
we have to make a decision early

00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:49.279
Now I announce

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:49.960
Well

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:51.680
Comrade Wang Sufang

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:53.160
go prepare yourself

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.920
Understood

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.519
Tomorrow

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:56.559
you will be Yangliu Xincheng's

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:57.559
official employee

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:58.400
I'll just

00:22:58.819 --> 00:22:59.480
Huh?

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.440
On what grounds?

00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:04.480
Because based on her resignation report

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.839
and our investigation

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:08.079
our conclusion is

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:09.400
Wang Sufang is a

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.200
meticulous and enthusiastic worker

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.819
She knows every senior's condition

00:23:13.819 --> 00:23:14.680
and characteristics

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.440
Moreover

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.160
in her resignation report

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.720
she proposed practical

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.480
and personalized care plans

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.519
Knowledgeable, capable

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:23.680
caring

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.160
This is exactly the most needed

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:27.759
most excellent nursing talent we need

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:28.160
Then

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.759
Then I also

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:29.559
Then you what?

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.599
Not getting along with such talent

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.119
logically speaking

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.640
the one with the problem

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.980
should be you

00:23:37.819 --> 00:23:39.140
Celebrate Xiaofang's employment

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.440
Great

00:23:41.779 --> 00:23:42.940
Didn't you always say

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.519
observe, don't intervene?

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.220
I've thought it over carefully

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.019
and the final conclusion is

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.339
to hell with it

00:23:51.099 --> 00:23:51.940
Come on, everyone

00:23:52.059 --> 00:23:53.859
to congratulate Xiaofang

00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:54.819
tonight is my treat

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.740
Great

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.039
No way

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.359
You can't fight me for this

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.200
I have a '92 Maotai

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.240
Is this called

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:04.480
drinking celebratory wine?
