[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.220
[Episode 7]

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.710
No way.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.420
This is bad.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.039
No, no.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.070
Captain Duojie!

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.539
Captain Duojie!

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.789
Captain!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.650
Captain.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.860
Captain Duojie!

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.229
What's wrong with him?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.280
A sugar rush?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.330
Go to sleep!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.790
Captain, open the door.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.620
Coming.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.710
Captain,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.620
I need to talk to you.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.180
Okay.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.000
Come inside. Calm down.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.600
I'm sorry

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.370
to disturb you,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.810
but

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.340
I have to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.870
talk to you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.000
about this tonight.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.130
I know

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.570
your anti-poaching work

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.780
and protection of Tibetan antelopes

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.230
is very tough

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.090
and admirable.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.590
But have you done the math?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.170
At Zhuoyuan Lake alone,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.500
within one year,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.710
you cracked at least five cases.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.310
On average,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.320
there were over 200

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.000
Tibetan antelope carcasses each time.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.970
That's 1,000 already.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.030
Among these 1,000,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.900
a large proportion

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.030
were pregnant females.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.250
You mentioned in your notes

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.250
that Tibetan antelopes usually

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.930
give birth to only one calf at a time.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.790
Adding in these

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.870
unborn calves,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.120
from your cases alone,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.340
in one year, 1,500

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.460
to 2,000 Tibetan antelopes

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.180
were killed.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.740
Plus

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.870
the pelts seized

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.600
where no carcasses were found,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.960
I'd conservatively double that,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.300
making it 3,000 to 4,000.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.710
That's merely what was seized.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.520
What you didn't see,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.810
I'll estimate at 1,000.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.250
In just one year,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.270
5,000 Tibetan antelopes

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.000
were killed.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.400
The Bolamula region

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.270
spans Qinghai, Tibet

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.080
and Xinjiang.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.610
There're

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.300
about 10 major habitats

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.020
for Tibetan antelopes.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.620
If I assume

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.710
half of these areas

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.180
are experiencing similar poaching,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.190
that means five times

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.780
the rate of population decline.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.840
And the population

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.760
of Tibetan antelopes

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.150
recovers very slowly.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.940
According to your statistics,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.970
in recent years,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.810
the number of Tibetan antelopes

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.750
has dropped from 200,000

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.090
to 30,000.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.370
At this rate—

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.320
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.630
I'm saying,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.980
given the Mountain Patrol's current

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.840
scale and enforcement strength,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.790
you won't be able to prevent

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.120
the Tibetan antelope from going extinct.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.410
I know.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.930
In three years,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.520
or five at the latest,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.210
the Tibetan antelopes in Bolamula

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.680
will be completely extinct.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.620
So... that's why

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.590
we need to come up with something else.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.000
What else can we do?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.250
Expand the Mountain Patrol.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.910
Impossible.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.110
The county can't even

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.700
pay our salaries.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.550
How could they afford to hire more people?

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.560
No matter how much

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.360
you expand the Mountain Patrol,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.160
it won't solve the root problem.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.780
There is only one solution.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.269
Establish a nature reserve.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.010
A nature reserve?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.440
A reserve for protecting
Tibetan antelopes?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.880
Yes.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.320
Right.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.060
That's the only way.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.670
You know that?

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.050
You've thought of it too?

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.570
For our task,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.700
a provincial reserve won't suffice.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.920
It must be a national

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.890
nature reserve.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.220
Uniting Qinghai,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.100
Tibet, and Xinjiang,

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.710
completely sealing off

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.310
the entire Bolamula region.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.760
To give the Tibetan antelopes

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.350
enough space and time

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.090
to recover their population.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.560
A reserve?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.440
What about the development zone?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.390
Mr. Shao,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.730
could you please step out for a moment?

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.400
Sure.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.400
Captain,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.040
the Economic Development Zone...

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.360
are we still doing it?

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.760
Establishing a nature reserve...

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.440
is just my personal idea.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.130
It hasn't fully taken shape yet.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.330
So I didn't

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.340
tell you guys.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.800
Will the county authorities approve it?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.540
I don't know.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.630
I haven't reported it to them yet.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.780
Will we still get permanent positions?

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.230
I know you're all hoping

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.710
for the development zone

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.040
to be established soon,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.130
so your lives can stabilize.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.130
But you heard it

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.190
just now.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.170
Establishing a nature reserve

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.920
is the only way to restore Bolamula

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.600
to its original state.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.250
This path will definitely be harder.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.320
We won't get to be managers

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.920
or deputy managers anymore.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.159
And permanent positions might not
happen anytime soon.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.659
You might want to think about...

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.320
if you want to keep going.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.390
What is there to think about?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.940
I'll follow your lead.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.830
Whatever you tell me to do,

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.450
I'll do it.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.760
I don't need a permanent position.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.240
When the reserve is established,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.960
can I still go on patrol?

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960
I promise you can.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.270
Okay.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.680
I'm a police officer.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.260
I don't care about

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.320
the manager thing.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.310
Many people don't realize

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.070
how important it is to protect

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.200
Tibetan antelopes.

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:35.950
Only we

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.440
can make them understand.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.190
We forge our own paths.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.120
There's always a way.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.640
Yes.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.250
I...

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.310
I've walked away once.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.480
I'd be too ashamed to leave again.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.179
Leave at dawn.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:36.570
It's not safe at night.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.490
Captain,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.420
have you ever considered us
your own people?

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.690
You've been with me the longest.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.370
You shouldn't be asking that.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.960
Yes.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.690
I have been with you the longest.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.600
That's why I don't understand

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.930
why you're keep it from us

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.550
and making this decision on your own.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.480
If Mr. Shao hadn't

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.850
talked to you about this today

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.980
with all of us there,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.590
you would've gone on keeping it from us.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.850
Whenever someone complains

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.270
or feels like giving up,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.550
I always tell them,

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.180
"things will get better once the
development zone is set up."

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.850
It's almost

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.190
become my mantra.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.550
You gave me

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.830
a warm jar to hold onto.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.890
And I gave them

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.420
each a warm jar to hold onto.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.430
Now you're going to

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.630
get us all laid off by the county,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.920
and take the warm jars in everyone's hands

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.940
and smash them.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.830
Is this how

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.320
you treat your own people?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.320
Captain,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.990
you're not

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.940
the only member of the patrol team.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.790
It takes

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.100
all of us

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.820
to be a team.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:53.590
I know

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.750
the tax office is directly administered,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.210
not managed by the county.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.000
If you won't speak up for the county,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.520
that's fine,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.360
but you shouldn't add fuel to the fire.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.410
The state of the county's finances...

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.070
Don't act like you don't know.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.320
Mayor Lin,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.020
we're in a tough spot too.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.530
Things are hard for the county.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.720
We know that.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.040
We're stuck in the middle.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.770
We're the bad guys to everyone.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.100
We can't do our job.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.860
Tell me, what should we do?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.400
Anyway, we can't pay the tax right now.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.530
You'll have to wait.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.460
We've been waiting forever.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.210
Please try to understand our position.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.370
How about

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.170
we discuss this further?

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.100
Here.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.260
Look for yourself.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.050
Last year, Gela Township sold

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.500
16,000 cattle and sheep.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.580
This year?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.100
Less than 2,000!

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.770
Is it because the herdsmen
don't want to sell?

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.080
It's because they were lost
in the snow disaster!

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.780
You think cattle and sheep

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.050
are like snow on the mountains,

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.860
melting and flowing down in the sun?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.920
You want me to bring

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.820
local officials

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.700
to the herdsmen's homes

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.670
and take away the cattle and sheep

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.910
they're keeping for the winter?

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.770
I'm asking you!

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.670
Mayor Lin,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.270
I'll be going then.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.670
You shouldn't have come
in the first place.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.290
What now? Come in.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.510
Mayor Lin.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.220
He?

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.230
What is it?

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.550
A reserve?

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.310
Where did this

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.400
reserve come from?

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.110
Where are you talking about?

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.830
It's a national nature reserve.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.630
The Tibetan antelope population

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.100
is on the brink of extinction.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.650
The idea of

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:53.950
developing first and cleaning up later

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.950
is no longer suitable for Bolamula.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.200
So we must apply for

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.520
state intervention.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.570
Where were you before?

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.770
Why bring this up now?

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.720
The idea of establishing a reserve

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.380
is something I've always had.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.370
But I delayed

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.630
reporting it to the County
Party Committee,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.500
and I didn't even tell

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.230
anyone in the Mountain Patrol.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.150
Simply because

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.600
this in itself

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.930
is a contradiction.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.520
With just

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.920
our county's resources,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.010
we can't find a solution.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.290
As a Party member,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.120
I can complete

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.130
the tasks assigned to me
by the organization

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.930
and set up the development zone.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.400
But as a Mazhi native,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.050
I cannot watch the environment

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.380
be destroyed at my hands.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.310
Comrade Duojie,

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.220
mind your words.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.170
Are you trying to pit our Party

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.940
against environmental issues?

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.400
Both Secretary Chen and I

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.190
have emphasized more than once

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.450
that our future development

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.510
must be scientific

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.650
and standardized.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.390
It's not about reckless exploitation.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.190
Furthermore,

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.450
we are only in the exploration phase.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.390
Investment promotion hasn't even

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.220
officially started yet.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.350
What makes you think

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.050
that development must be

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.840
destructive?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.390
On what grounds?

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.080
Mayor Lin,

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.220
what I just said

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.390
wasn't said lightly.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:01.890
I have conducted

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.020
thorough research.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.150
Yecuo Lake Wetland—

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.200
have you heard of it?

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.750
It is less than

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.000
700 kilometers from here.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.600
Three years ago,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.100
it was still

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.910
a lush wetland.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.770
But now?

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.940
Because of mining,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.000
water got polluted,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.980
groundwater was drained,

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.200
creating hollows,

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.000
and grasslands have turned into desert.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.960
The herdsmen's pastures

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.360
have all been destroyed.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.280
Let me ask you.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.120
When these mining companies

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:22.750
finish stripping the mine

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.840
and leave,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.480
what's left, will it still be wetlands?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.880
It'll just be a dead zone!

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.730
Mr. Secretary,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.760
this is an environmental
assessment report I wrote.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.860
Bolamula

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.620
is in the Sanjiangyuan region.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.160
Glacial meltwater

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.220
flows into many rivers.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.380
If we mine here,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.880
and it affects

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.130
the midstream and downstream

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.530
water quality and volume,

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.260
we become

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.400
criminals against the country

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.500
and humanity.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.850
The importance of economic development,

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.250
I've mentioned it

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.680
at least a hundred times.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.440
Right now,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.320
there are entrepreneurs

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.080
with money in hand

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.170
waiting to invest in Mazhi County

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.710
and Bolamula.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.370
What are they waiting for?

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.700
Comrade Duojie,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.720
they are waiting for

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.180
your exploration report.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.220
This is not negotiable.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.270
It cannot be changed

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.420
by anyone's

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.310
personal will.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.000
Developing mineral resources

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.430
is the fastest way

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.960
to increase tax revenue

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.200
and modernize Mazhi.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.800
But if

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.880
destroying the natural environment

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.630
and causing irreversible damage

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.440
to animal and plant resources

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.200
is the price,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.310
then as a Party member,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.040
a native of Mazhi,

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.450
and a child of herdsmen

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.160
who grew up here,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.440
this is not

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.920
the modernization I want.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.030
Such modernization

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.070
also goes against

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.330
our Party's policy.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.440
There is no point

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.640
in arguing like this.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.670
We cannot

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.620
set up an economic

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.820
development zone first

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.670
to see if

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.210
it destroys the environment.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:16.700
Or

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.480
establish a nature reserve

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.370
and then think about

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.900
how to develop the economy.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.150
What do the Party

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.080
and the people

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.060
expect us to do here?

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.640
To get things done,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.510
comrades.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.780
As for the exploration report,

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.360
Comrade Duojie

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.240
still needs to submit it

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.090
to the county.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.460
If he insists on not submitting it,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:38.440
I will bring up

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.770
the proposal from the last meeting again—

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.800
disband the Mountain Patrol

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.910
and re-establish the exploration team.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.220
Hang on.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.030
Let me share my thoughts.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.960
Comrade Duojie,

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.760
regarding the reserve,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.800
it's not that we can't consider it,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.390
but

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.120
we can't just listen to you

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.760
and look at

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.320
the pelts you brought back.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.290
You must give me

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.200
a formal report

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.740
with a feasible plan.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.300
Otherwise,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.500
the county can't support your proposal

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.050
to apply to the superiors.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.070
Okay, Mr. Secretary.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.650
I will submit the formal report

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.780
as soon as possible.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.600
But as you know,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.080
the subsidies

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.950
need to go to units that need them more.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.410
How the Mountain Patrol will be maintained,

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.770
you'll have to figure out

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.840
on your own.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:34.970
Understood.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.700
It's not going to be easy.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.410
The Mountain Patrol's salaries

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.170
used to be paid by the county.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.600
Although there were delays,

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.420
they were paid eventually.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:47.760
Now

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.520
you'll be entirely on your own.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.050
You might want to reconsider.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.160
It's okay, Mr. Secretary.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.260
I'm very grateful that

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.210
Mazhi has supported us until now

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.720
despite being a poverty-stricken county.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720
I believe

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.790
the Mountain Patrol members

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:07.990
will understand too.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.780
The year before last, I established

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.110
the Mazhi Economic Development Company.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.420
I posted notices around the county.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.830
I remember

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.290
you were the first to come.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.060
At that time, I thought,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.940
I was in luck.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.810
This company will make it.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.200
The first person to come

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.260
was such

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.480
a fine young man.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.530
A high school graduate.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.090
My company's future

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.610
will definitely be extraordinary.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.970
But who would have thought,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.310
for those who came later,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.000
having attended primary school

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.860
was considered highly educated.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.500
So I relied on you heavily.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.030
I made you Vice Captain.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.090
Sent you to learn geological surveying.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.390
Managing money and people.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.570
I thought that one day,

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.970
when I can no longer work,

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.100
you could take my place.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.110
This was my mistake.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.120
You put so much effort

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.120
into the mineral exploration work.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.740
Now I've stopped it,

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.830
and I kept it from you.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:22.770
I've let you down.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.110
I'll discuss with County Mayor Lin

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.290
and find a suitable position

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.270
for you.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.530
You have a good educational background.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.610
Getting a permanent position

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:35.670
shouldn't be hard.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.850
He.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.340
I also want to thank you.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.210
Because of you,

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.590
I made up my mind earlier

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.960
to set up the reserve.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.300
If it weren't for you,

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:11.160

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.740
how long I would have dragged my feet

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.870

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.140
at the animal husbandry station.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.640
How did you

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.840
get involved in this?

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.610
Well, I too

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:07.850
wanted to contribute

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.540
to the county's development.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:11.680
Go ahead.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.210
What do you want from me?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.220
Mayor Duo,

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.510
that place, Bolamula,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.110
I went there once when I was a kid.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:20.910
I haven't dared to go back since.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.540
To be honest,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.270
about entering the mountains,

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.870
I really have no confidence.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.880
So I came to ask for your advice.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.780
It's right to have no confidence.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.690
It's right to be afraid, too.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.000
Bolamula

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:34.900
is not a place where

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.160
just anyone can enter.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.220
Even if

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.750
you think you are prepared,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.850
once you go in,

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.510
you will still encounter

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.040
unexpected difficulties.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.570
Exactly.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.870
That's why I came to you.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.610
I heard

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.610
you've been into the mountains
a lot this year,

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.890
and took a lot of notes.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.910
Your experience

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.510
is summarized very clearly.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.990
Right now, supplies and money

00:24:59.020 --> 00:24:59.950
don't mean much.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.720
Your mineral exploration notes

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.450
are the best.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.140
Please let me take a look.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.940
It'll give me some peace of mind.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.900
I can't give you the notes.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.500
Why?

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.630
I'm working for the county, too.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.770
If these notes

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:14.250
fall into

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:15.440
the wrong hands,

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.240
it won't help them.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.520
It'll harm them.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.940
Harm them how?

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.420
Are you worried I won't do a good job?

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.430
Worried you might not do a good job,

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.830
but even more worried that
you won't come back.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.400
One of

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.570
our team members

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.220
died in Bolamula.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.630
Another was injured last year.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.400
There were several others

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.510
whose families couldn't take it,

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.240
and they couldn't handle it either,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.440
so they all went home.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:43.940
Come look at this.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.020
This place here.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.420
Last year, a group of placer gold miners

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.430
went in with guns.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:55.870
A few days later,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:56.940
they started fighting

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.870
over territory.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.770
Further north,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.330
there were poachers

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.190
who set up camp, posted sentries,

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.800
and chased anyone they saw.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.700
We had to drive them out twice

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.700
before they left.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:11.030
So Bolamula

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.390
isn't a place you can enter

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.920
just because you're brave.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.010
Can we be reasonable?

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.510
If that little girl can go
into the mountains,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.950
why can't I?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.310
The fact that my team members can go in

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.970
has nothing to do with gender.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.050
It's because she knows

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:29.870
how to survive

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.900
in the mountains.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.310
She knows the way, reads the weather,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.530
fixes cars, uses ropes,

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.660
and knows first aid.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.140
She relies on skill to
enter the mountains,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.010
not impulse.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:43.770
Captain.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.330
Come in.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.080
Okay.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.530
Captain.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:49.790
Your wife is here.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.610
She wants you to go down for a photo.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.050
Okay.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.760
Let's leave it at that.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.480
Send my regards

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.770
to County Mayor Lin.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.480
Don't wear this

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.500
when you enter the Uninhabited Zone.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.160
Poachers

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.750
love this kind of clothing.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.250
These routes

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:32.850
and the distribution of mineral belts

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.010
are what the Mountain Patrol

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.570
spent a whole year

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.770
compiling.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.370
This is a part of it.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.700
Great.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.920
This data is very valuable.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:44.290
Why did he

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.420
only give you these few pages?

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.070
Him?

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.550
He wouldn't give me a single page.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.530
This all belongs to the state.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.050
I just grabbed a few pages on my way out.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.020
What do you mean, "grabbed"?

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.640
You're stealing stuff now?

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.070
These documents

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.090
were compiled by the Mountain Patrol.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:04.770
The Mountain Patrol

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.980
belongs to the county,

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.350
not Duojie.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.540
How can you call this stealing?

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.420
I sent you there

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.060
not to go

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.420
behind his back.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.000
I wanted you to learn from him,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.980
so when you go into the mountains,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.380
it will be helpful to you.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.440
But now you're...

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.200
you're escalating the conflict.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.160
Mr. Mayor,

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.450
we are now

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.530
racing against their nature reserve

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.630
to move forward with this

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.690
development zone.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.570
Without this data,

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.300
how can we catch up with them?

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.810
You can...

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.050
give me another

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.190
year or so,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.760
but the result...

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.610
who knows?

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.330
Well...

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:43.010
If you can't get over this,

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.550
I'll return it to him.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.200
Hey!

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.200
Listen,

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.870
you have to follow the rules
when doing things.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:28:59.790
Things like this

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.050
must not happen again.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.570
Okay.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.290
I'm off then.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.820
Take a break.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.400
Have some water.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.850
Okay.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:43.790
Grandma,

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.420
thank you.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.570

we could write

Dongzhiba gave his life

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.030
"Noble"?

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:17.590
Noble.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:19.700
Not just Dongzhiba.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.700
In my heart,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.100
you are all noble people,

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.280
who have risen above base interests.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:24.680
And

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.700
for a great cause,

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.000
you sacrifice personal gain,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.130
and even your lives.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.940
This is worth celebrating,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.740
so more people can know about it.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.540
Dongzhiba's father died early.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.810
His mother went away for work

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.810
and hasn't been back in three years.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.310
They're illiterate,

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:42.740
so

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.310
they never wrote letters.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.680
He and his grandmother

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.010
depended on each other.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:48.220
Officer Bai,

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:48.920
wait a second.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.180
Let me write this down.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.270
He told me

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.310
his grandmother kept pestering him

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.140
to find a wife.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.520
Before going into the mountains,

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.250
she found a pretty girl for him.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.200
He was supposed to go meet her

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.400
when coming back out.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.240
He was only 18.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:12.850
If he were in a city,

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.710
he'd probably still be in school.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.070
Why the rush to find a wife?

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.650
Okay.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.000
Okay.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:19.820
This is so vivid.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:25.180
Sorry.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.690
Please, go on.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.940
That night...

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.220
When the poachers' headlights flashed on,

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.430
shining straight into his face,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.100
he was just like a Tibetan antelope.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.530
He froze completely.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.130
Just as he tried to raise his gun,

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.690
he was shot dead.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.000
What?

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.920
Different from the heroic,

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.000
noble sacrifice

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:02.830
you imagined?

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.990
If you write it like that,

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:06.980
would the newspaper

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.780
lose readers?

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:09.590
No...

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.050
But this is

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:14.440
what

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.460
really happened.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.330
For you,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.790
glorifying suffering

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.450
and using a young life

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.110
to attract attention

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.140
might be meaningful.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:30.640
But for us,

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.280
this is a tragedy for a young man

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.740
and a family.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.150
It means we failed to protect him.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.660
Out here,

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.810
no one wants to trade their life

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:51.240
for a poacher's life.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.720
We just want to

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.920
survive as best we can

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:00.840
and do our job well.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.940
That was

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.670
very well said.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.900
People who haven't been through it

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.500
wouldn't be able to say this.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.030
Officer Bai,

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.420
can you say a bit more?

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.710
Just speak your mind.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:17.670
Let's just chat

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.540
like friends.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.210
Okay.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.260
Then I'll say one more thing.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.150
You can say more.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.150
Don't hold back.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.000
Everyone hopes

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.330
you'll leave here soon.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:31.210
Including me.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.520
Stop following us.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:34.989
The Mountain Patrol

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:36.320
isn't the place for you.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:40.500
Why?

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.880
Because out there,

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.260
everyone's

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.860
first reaction to seeing you

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:46.850
is worry.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.500
It's not like I haven't been
into the mountains.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.630
I've been living with you guys

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:50.340
for so long.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.510
I've never

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.790
dropped the ball, have I?

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.350
It's a tough job.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.440
Never mind running into poachers.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.960
Just a sandstorm

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.230
or a bout of dysentery

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.140
could kill you.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.760
It's not a heroic way to die.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.480
I think

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.350
you should just

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.880
go back where you came from.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.730
Be a good reporter.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.740
There are plenty of stories to write

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.520
and plenty of things to do.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:19.900
Don't you think?

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.510
I've said too much.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.730
Officer Bai Ju,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.570
thank you

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.900
for telling me all that.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.400
But I'm a reporter.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.670
If I see something,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.070
I can't pretend I didn't.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.000
It's professional ethics.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.680
I've decided.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.870
I'm staying here.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:54.880
So,

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.410
can you teach me how to shoot?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.640
As for shooting stances,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.060
besides standing,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.820
there's prone and kneeling.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.780
But one thing never changes—

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.840
you use your hands and feet together.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.190
What did I just tell you?

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.920
Look at you.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.410
Keep your feet shoulder-width apart

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:22.830
or slightly narrower.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.180
Keep your feet parallel

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.030
with toes pointing slightly out.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.360
Keep your weight on
the balls of your feet.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.080
I am.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.960
How long has it been?

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.590
It's only been a minute.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.870
Don't hunch your right shoulder.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:38.230
Your muscles

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.440
will get too tense.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.630
Even without that,

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.620
I already feel

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.240
my muscles tensing up.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.190
Didn't you say

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.730
you hold a camera all day?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.780
Isn't your arm strength good?

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.800
I use two hands for the camera.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.480
This is one-handed.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.730
How is that the same?

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.230
How much longer?

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:55.630
In our shooting training,

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.350
if you can't last five minutes,

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.080
you don't deserve to hold a gun.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.210
What are you doing?

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.080
Hold it up.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.600
-I can't take it anymore.
-You've barely started.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.680
Just looking at your stance

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.800
pisses me off.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.460
Look at how you're standing.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.030
Just like you—

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.360
Push your hips forward.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.830
Stick your lower belly out.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.230
Arch your back.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.290
What are you doing?

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.980
What are you doing?

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:20.800
I...

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.920
-I…
-I'm teaching you.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.650
If you don't cooperate,

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.130
I'll let He Qingyuan teach you.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.090
I'll cooperate.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:28.030
Come on.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.030
Come on for what?

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.030
Hold it yourself.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.650
Hold it for five minutes first.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.170
I'll reset the timer.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.920
The last part didn't count.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.270
I already held it for a minute.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:36.200
Keep holding it.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.900
You're a grown man,

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.820
but you're so weak.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.970
Why isn't it getting better?

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:01.730
The medicine I prescribed,

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:02.990
did you take it on time?

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:03.940
Yes.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.760
I still don't feel well.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.110
Did you use the menstrual belt?

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:10.020
Yes.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.430
What about toilet paper?

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.520
Did you use toilet paper with it?

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:18.880
Well...

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.510
I didn't want to use that.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.840
I used wool instead.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.420
Cairen,

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.690
you can't use wool anymore.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:27.880
Why won't you listen to me?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.480
Well,

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.230
toilet paper is too expensive.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.850
Besides, if I take it home,

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.230
and Duojie and Zhaxi see it,

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.290
they'll use it too.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.670
I didn't tell them.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.340
They're family.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.670
Why can't you tell them?

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.390
It's a health issue.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:40.780
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.870
You have to tell them.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:42.370
Okay.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.890
If you keep ignoring this

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.030
and get an ascending infection,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.320
it will be serious.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.500
I see.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.590
Brother, come here.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.890
There's a vendor here.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:54.940
All right.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.400
How is this one? Does it look good?

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:01.090
It really is a nice necklace.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.680
But it's too expensive.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.070
Who can afford this?

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.730
This turquoise is high quality.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.880
It's already very cheap.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.390
I... I'm saying...

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:16.080
the price of this necklace,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.240
can you go any lower?

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.470
It's just too expensive.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:21.510
Too expensive.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.670
No, no.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.110
It's worn on the neck,

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.780
not on the head.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.340
I... I know that.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.530
I know this necklace

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.090
is worn on the neck.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.130
I mean, for this necklace,

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.010
the price...

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:34.980
the price,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.270
can it be lower?

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.960
Lower the price.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:38.840
Look,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.230
wearing it on the wrist like this

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.760
also works.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.260
Zhaxi,

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.530
don't just stand there watching.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.730
Say something for me.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:51.730
Help me...

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.380
Zhaxi,

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.990
why are you running?

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.030
Zhaxi!

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.120
Why are you running, Zhaxi?

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.230
Why are you running?

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.590
Why?

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.260
You can't speak Mandarin?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.340
Of course I can.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.220
My Mandarin is great.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:12.930
Then why are you avoiding me?

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.180
I didn't mess with you.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.130
Mom said

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.520
you're a bad guy who goes into

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.780
the Uninhabited Zone to hunt antelopes.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.150
Your mom got the wrong idea about me.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.600
I'm a decent person.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.000
I have absolutely never hunted antelopes.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:29.140
I swear.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.380
I swear,

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.340
I swear to Buddha,

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.530
I have absolutely never hunted antelopes.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:34.980
Then why are you buying necklaces?

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.430
I...

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.210
I'm buying necklaces

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.460
to do a good deed.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.810
I buy them

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.700
from herdsmen,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.360
and then I resell them.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:45.230
I am

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.520
promoting traditional Tibetan culture

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.560
and fostering ethnic friendship.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.940
Stop lying.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.650
You just want to make money.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.230
Who doesn't want to make money?

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.300
Don't you?

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.710
How about this?

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.190
You translate for me,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.300
and when it's done,

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.620
I'll give you a cut.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.180
Really?

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:10.930
Really.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.880
I'll give you one yuan.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:14.960
You'll get it once the deal is made.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:16.830
Let's go.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.530
Help me talk to him.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:19.990
Ask him to sell it cheaper.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.120
Do you have anything better?

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.180
It's okay if it's more expensive.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.760
We all use this.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.390
This is the best straw paper.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.500
Do you have that...

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.300
finer kind?

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:37.480
The soft, white toilet paper?

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.810
We don't have that here.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.780
Bigger stores

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:42.710
might have it.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.260
Why don't you sell it?

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.960
Too expensive.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.730
No one buys it.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.070
Even in big stores,

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.760
not many people buy it.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.100
I'll take this then.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.630
Get me ten bundles.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.320
Okay.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.400
Make it five.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:20.690
Mom.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.800
You're back early.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:25.780
You...

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.780
How did you get in?

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.230
Well...

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.830
the key was on the doorframe.

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.730
Zhacuo told me.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:32.430
Don't you know to knock

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.490
before you come in?

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.570
Zhacuo told me...

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:35.610
he said just open the door,

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.320
come in and cook.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:36.860
That's the rule.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.460
What rule?

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:38.070
Aren't you supposed to knock

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.070
before entering?

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:42.820
Yeah?

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.340
I-I didn't know.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.260
I'm sorry.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.870
I'll definitely knock next time.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:49.230
Because...

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.280
when Zhacuo told me,

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:50.900
I was wondering about it.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.500
I thought,

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.280
your family rules are quite strange.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.340
-If bad guys wanted to come in…
-What are you doing here?

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.150
To bring you photos.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.210
I didn't take any photo.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:04.610
I took candid shots in the mountains.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.730
I just got them developed.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.690
Thanks.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:08.470
Now go.
