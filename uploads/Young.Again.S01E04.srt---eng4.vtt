WEBVTT

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.180
I'm not a lonely old man.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.340
I'm here with my wife,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.500
moving into our Yangliu Xincheng together.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.659
Coming to this retirement community

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.859
isn't because my children are unfilial.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.979
I'm just here because

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.379
life is convenient here,

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.060
and there's full medical care.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:14.699
Most importantly,

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:15.500
everyone here

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.180
is about my age.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.539
I'm here to have fun.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.620
About the same age...

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.780
Having fun...

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.340
Professor Zhu,

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.259
so you admit you're here to have fun too.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.219
But that doesn't include him.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.060
As soon as I see him,

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.639
I can't smile anymore.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:32.479
What?

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.539
You're here?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.300
I'm leaving.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.699
What's going on here?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.099
An interview?

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.580
Yes, field research.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.300
Just documenting things.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.460
By the way, Yusheng,

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:45.879
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.180
This place of ours...

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.219
it's not rural farmland,

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.560
so why do you call it "field research"?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.620
Yeah.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.539
Doesn't that make us all field mice?

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.599
And wouldn't Gou'er Ye become a field dog?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.000
Who are you calling a lapdog?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.900
Professor Fan, how did this happen?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.699
Here, sit down quickly.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.099
Is it bleeding?

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.419
No.

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:08.979
No need.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.180
Don't keep covering it.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.539
No blood.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:11.379
Just a bump.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.860
Gou'er Ye, you really are...

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.180
Where is he?

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.500
Look at that.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.780
That old man runs so fast.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:19.620
Understood.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.419
Your field research.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:24.759
Specifically...

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:25.740
social research.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.139
Right.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:27.120
Is my understanding correct?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.219
Yes.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.419
As expected of Boss Li.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.699
Your comprehension is strong.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:32.819
So here's the question.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.340
You went to all this trouble...

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.979
to come to our retirement community...

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.159
to investigate us...

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.740
what is it for?

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.180
Survey sampling.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.180
Data collection.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.580
By analyzing your generation of seniors...

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.180
we hope to reach a universal conclusion.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:49.939
You...

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.580
analyze us?

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.060
Can you understand our era?

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.979
Have you experienced what we went through?

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.740
I think we can.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:58.800
Because we are approaching it from...

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.659
a sociological perspective.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.699
No perspective will work.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.180
Studying us?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.419
Kids these days...

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.780
Can't carry on your shoulders...

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.780
can't lift with your hands...

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.939
Lazy,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:11.939
and ignorant of life's basics.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:13.500
That's not right.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.860
Society is always progressing.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.100
Each new generation surpasses the last.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.300
Each generation is better than the last.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.100
That's not necessarily true.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:24.980
Historically speaking, each generation improves.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.939
However...

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.899
occasionally there are one or two generations...

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.100
that might be exceptions.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.259
The West had The Beat Generation.

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:32.980
Here we have the lying-flat generation.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.779
Lying flat is a minority, after all.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.100
Look at me, didn't I get up early?

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:39.379
Shut up.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.379
You're the most unreliable one of this generation.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.779
You compare yourselves to us?

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:43.819
How can you compare?

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:44.699
The hardships we endured...

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:45.500
the books we read...

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.699
the things we experienced...

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:48.540
To compare with us...

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.819
besides playing video games...

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:50.939
what else can you compare with?

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.540
But we are young

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.500
We have new knowledge

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.139
New concepts

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.100
New skills

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.180
From intelligence to physical strength

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.980
From explosiveness to endurance

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.779
Then we are definitely

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.459
stronger than you guys

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:07.180
If you put it that way

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:09.019
then let's have a competition

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.939
As for the specific events

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:12.920
we'll go back and think about it

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.980
We're competing against them?

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.759
They are all young and strong

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.660
You didn't even discuss it with me beforehand

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.660
Old age isn't about physical strength

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.019
It's agreed

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.259
We won't do those jumping and running events

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.800
If it weren't for my head injury

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.779
like a trivia quiz

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.860
those youngsters definitely wouldn't beat me

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.620
We'd win no matter what we played

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.019
That's not necessarily true

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.899
With Professor Fan's vocabulary

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:38.899
if we compete in memorizing words

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:40.699
we might not actually beat him

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.100
Otherwise, let's compete in eating

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.339
I don't believe that in this area

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:45.420
anyone can outdo me

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.779
Don't talk nonsense

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.579
Old people shouldn't overeat

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:49.459
Besides

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.779
even if you really won

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:51.779
that would only prove

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.420
that our generation are all foodies

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.199
Competing in talents and skills

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.019
We're not sloppy about that either

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.300
I've been a star performer since I was little

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.540
Recitation, clapper talk, crosstalk, three-and-a-half sentences

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.439
There's nothing I can't handle

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.100
Who wasn't a star performer?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.300
I seriously learned the ukulele before third grade

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.500
No issues other than it sounding terrible

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.939
I could dance when I was little too

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.459
They always put me in the front row for welcoming guests

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.339
That...

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.540
Beautiful flowers are blooming

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.259
My arms and legs are old now

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:26.060
It's a bit lacking

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.699
This won't work anymore

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.500
I also learned a couple of hometown opera pieces as a kid

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.100
It's just been a long time since I sang

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.459
I've forgotten it all

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:33.620
Alright

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.699
These can all be competition events

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:36.959
I...

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.180
I did practice piano for a few days in the past

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.459
but I've forgotten most of it now

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.620
It's okay

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:45.060
You can brush up on it

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.860
It'll surely work

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.899
Okay

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.220
You count as one entry

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.060
I'll bring out my treasured masterpiece

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.620
Dingjun Shan, and show it off to them

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:53.819
Let these kids really experience

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:56.220
the profoundness of our traditional Chinese culture

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.500
Yingzi

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.139
how about you?

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:00.620
Me?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.139
I really don't have any talents

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.180
I just studied hard growing up

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:06.980
Oh, right

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.699
I entered a typing contest in middle school

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.240
At the time, I won an

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.120
eighth prize

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.300
That's not...

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:16.360
I think that's enough

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.379
Before the grandpas and grandmas even get to Yingzi

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:20.939
it'll already be three to zero

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:22.079
They'll be totally wiped out

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:24.779
Children

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.139
look here

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:27.980
what can I do?

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.660
You just rest

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.139
You don't need to get involved personally

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:32.899
Who?

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:34.540
Who is pregnant?

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.259
If you ask me

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:37.300
this is enough

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.500
We'll end the battle three to zero

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.100
Don't say we're bullying the kids

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.920
Right

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.480
It's settled then

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.339
It's getting late.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.560
And there's quite a crowd.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.120
Let's get started.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:09.220
The first match.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.740
The Clapper Talk duel.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.500
The opposing sides are...

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.300
Zhu Zhu from the Youth Team...

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:24.899
versus Mr. Liang Shengtian from the Seniors Team.

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:30.139
Well then...

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.759
I will perform a piece for everyone...

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.179
a classic Clapper Talk...

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.100
"Rescue from the Prison Cart."

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.779
Great!

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:42.840
Good!

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:44.759
Don't clap for him.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.019
Why keep clicking the clappers without speaking?

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.259
I'm about to speak.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Good!

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.500
That was amazing! Come on.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.960
Let's look at our judges.

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:50.519
Come on.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:52.840
After a unanimous decision by our judges...

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.320
for this Youth-Senior competition...

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.000
the first round of Clapper Talk...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.159
the winner is, from the Seniors Team...

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.399
Mr. Liang Shengtian!

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:01.159
Yay!

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.440
Let me say a few words.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.960
I think this young man is quite good.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.240
He plays the clappers well.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.240
The key is he dared to choose this old piece.

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.799
And his lyrics were rock solid.

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:13.960
A real talent.

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:15.639
I propose...

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:18.679
that we both be tied for champion in this match.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.440
Great!

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.799
Uncle Liang...

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:26.039
you were really awesome too.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.440
Still going strong.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.159
It's a tie!

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:34.600
Now, next is the intense...

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.740
second round of competition.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.700
First up is our...

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.899
beloved, respected...

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:40.100
and adorable Boss Li...

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.919
Mr. Li Jianguo!

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:44.700
Boss Li!

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:45.600
Go for it!

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.120
Boss Li!

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.039
Go for it!

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.340
I'll do my humble best then.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.019
I'll sing a piece of traditional Peking Opera...

00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:56.899
"Dingjun Shan."

00:10:56.899 --> 00:10:57.659
Good!

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.179
See that?

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:01.259
He's got the moves.

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:44.759
Bravo!

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:46.059
This is a true traditional treasure.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.700
Exactly. You've secured the score for this round.

00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:51.539
Grandpa Li has profound skills.

00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:52.700
He sang really well.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.700
I'll also learn from his example...

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:57.620
and sing a piece of traditional treasure...

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.480
Henan Opera...

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.019
"Mu Guiying Takes Command."

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:01.940
Good! Go Xiao Xin!

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:03.179
Go Xiao Xin!

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:04.139
Let's go!

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:05.259
Let's go-go!

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.179
See that?

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:13.299
We've got the moves too.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:12:59.820
Bravo!

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.940
Xiao Xin!

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.460
Boss Li! Xiao Xin!

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.440
Boss Li!

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.039
Everyone, please settle down.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.159
Everyone, please settle down.

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:12.600
Auntie Xiao Cai.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:17.399
As everyone has seen,

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:19.659
these are different genres.

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:21.500
The performance levels are both excellent.

00:13:22.519 --> 00:13:23.820
You're making it for us judges...

00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:25.580
very hard to judge.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.500
I think...

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.419
our Boss Li was still...

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:29.940
just a tiny, little bit better.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.059
Why do I feel like...

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.539
our Xiao Xin won by a narrow margin?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.580
I think Peking Opera...

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.460
is a cut above.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.039
National quintessence.

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:36.539
That's right.

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:38.740
Doesn't Henan Opera count as National quintessence?

00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:40.179
It counts too.

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:41.000
But the singing...

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.820
is still not...

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.899
They were both wonderful!

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:43.860
They are both National quintessence.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.100
What is the most commendable thing?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.820
It's that a young Gen Z girl

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:49.539
can also love the classics

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.820
and respect tradition.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.700
This is also...

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.940
truly praiseworthy.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.700
Isn't it?

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:55.620
I'll follow Comrade Old Liang's example.

00:13:56.059 --> 00:13:56.940
I suggest...

00:13:57.779 --> 00:13:59.179
that for this competition, Xiao Xin and I

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:00.500
should also be joint champions.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.179
Great!

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.019
Boss Li!

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:02.700
Thank you, Boss Li!

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.279
Boss Li!

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.200
That's about enough.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.519
What are you all laughing at?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720
We hustled all morning,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.840
and didn't win a single point.

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:15.320
It really turned into "friendship first, competition second."

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:19.759
Stop giggling.

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:21.720
Winning or losing concerns

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.480
the reputation of our older generation.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.679
We must win the afternoon match.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.480
We need to step it up, classmates.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.759
The competition this morning...

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:33.120
we won by sheer luck.

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:36.299
We didn't win, either.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.899
Weren't they all draws?

00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:39.539
A draw is better than losing.

00:14:39.539 --> 00:14:41.659
I didn't expect the seniors to be so skilled.

00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:43.139
They're all really amazing.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.019
Because they chose all the events.

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:49.620
So, what's the next event?

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.899
The event for the third match is...

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.860
Speed typing.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:56.779
The participant for the Youth Team is...

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.519
Xie Yingzi.

00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:02.240
Yingzi!

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.059
The participant for the Seniors Team is...

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.720
To be determined.

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:07.200
Okay.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:07.960
To be determined.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.899
To be determined.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.899
Boss Li.

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:11.220
Our participant for this event...

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:11.940
hasn't been decided yet?

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.100
We don't have a participant for this event.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.259
No participant?

00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:16.059
Do we have anyone?

00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:17.340
Typing.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.259
Do we have anyone?

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:19.100
Type my foot.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.820
Do we have anyone?

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.740
Do we have anyone?

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.899
Old Fan.

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:23.500
Don't you type all the time?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.259
The clicking and clacking keeps me awake.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.179
I'm no good at that.

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:27.860
You call that typing?

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.500
I just peck with one finger.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.460
My comrades call it the "woodpecker style."

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:32.580
Then what do we do?

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.620
Are we just...

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.000
going to forfeit and admit defeat?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.940
Don't do that.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.740
If there's no other way,

00:15:38.659 --> 00:15:39.779
I know how to type.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.779
How about...

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.179
I give it a try?

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.460
Try what?

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.100
We have someone.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:45.620
He'll do it.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.379
We have someone.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.259
Please.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.220
Ready...

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:51.000
Go!

00:15:59.539 --> 00:16:00.340
Thirty seconds

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.659
Twenty seconds

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.139
Fifteen seconds

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.299
Ten seconds

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:09.899
Come on!

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:10.720
Come on!

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:11.980
Steady!

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.700
Three

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.620
Two

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:14.580
One

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.259
Stop

00:16:19.299 --> 00:16:19.860
Alright,

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.220
let me check

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.759
the results for both contestants.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.860
Youth Team,

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:28.820
Xie Yingzi's per-minute

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.379
character count is

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.539
219.

00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:35.340
A sure win.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.740
Elder Team,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.860
Mr. Rudy Kraut's

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.299
per-minute character count is

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:45.860
two hundred

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:48.179
and twenty-four.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.740
Okay.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:53.139
I declare

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.659
that for our third event,

00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:57.179
the winner of Speed Typing is

00:16:57.179 --> 00:16:58.500
Mr. Rudy Kraut.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.940
Sorry.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.899
I'm sorry.

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:03.059
I am not the winner.

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:04.740
Why is that?

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.220
It's because...

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:06.740
although

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.339
I did type more characters than her,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.099
however,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.980
there are three errors in mine.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.759
Three errors.

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:14.640
Whereas she has no errors.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.119
So the winner should be her.

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:17.359
Alright.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.759
Then I declare

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.759
that for our

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:24.480
third competition event,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.019
the winner of Speed Typing is

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.359
Xie Yingzi.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.200
We're in trouble, big trouble.

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:39.500
Looks like we're going to lose.

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:40.839
Who's to blame?

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:42.339
It's all on you.

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:43.359
You and Boss Li.

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:45.680
A game of chess you clearly had in the bag,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.339
and you somehow played it to a draw.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.680
What were you doing?

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.440
Taking our seniors' honor

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.680
just to do someone a favor?

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:53.680
Who would have thought Rudy, that foreigner,

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.220
would lose to Yingzi?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.640
We lost because of him.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.799
Alright.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.640
Between us, we're

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.720
hundreds of years old.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.640
Let's not fight among ourselves.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.559
The most important thing now is to figure out

00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:06.400
how we can win this back.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.359
Right.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.000
We have to count on Teacher Liu

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.119
to win it back for us.

00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:11.680
With Teacher Liu, how could we lose?

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.039
That's right.

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.039
Yeah. Come on!

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:16.200
These grandpas and grandmas are amazing.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.859
But,

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:19.079
we still managed to score a precious point.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.000
This precious point

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:23.740
was given to us out of their noble generosity.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.660
Actually, my few lines of Henan Opera

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:28.440
couldn't compare to Boss Li's.

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:29.839
And my bit of clapper talk

00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:31.759
was no match for Uncle Liang.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.799
If I asked him to be my mentor,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.880
do you think he'd accept me?

00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:37.680
Alright.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.519
Stop putting yourselves down.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.259
Keke,

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:43.259
how is your ukulele preparation going?

00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:46.039
I...

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:46.880
Everyone,

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.400
I think the break is just about over.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.900
Shall we continue?

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:51.960
Sure.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.599
You... I mean...

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.880
Teacher Liu, you just...

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.359
Uncles and Aunties,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.480
let's

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.700
continue.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.180
Continue.

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:01.000
Let's go. Let's go.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.539
Let's go.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.799
Teacher Liu, you go first.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:05.500
Teacher Liu goes first.

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:07.640
Hurry up.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.119
It's okay.

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:08.599
It's okay.

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:11.420
Next up is our

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.920
final competition event:

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.400
the singing contest.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.039
The first to perform

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:18.559
is the singer from our Youth Team,

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:21.400
Xia Keke.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.480
Keke!

00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:23.640
Go for it!

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.799
Keke!

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:26.400
Go for it!

00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:27.420
Good luck!

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:29.720
Next, I will sing for you all.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.039
I hope you like it.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:33.880
Great!

00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:03.880
So,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.920
we thank Xia Keke very much

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:08.960
for such an unexpected performance.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.920
And next,

00:20:12.019 --> 00:20:12.700
is...

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:13.799
I personally believe

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:15.079
this is the moment you have all been

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:16.400
looking forward to the most these past few days.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.240
Please welcome the singer from our Seniors Team,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.920
Teacher Liu Minzhi.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:22.599
Yay!

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.279
Thank you.

00:20:29.279 --> 00:20:30.319
Thank you, everyone.

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:33.559
The song I'm going to sing for you is

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.240
"I Love You, China."

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.480
Great!

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.059
Bravo!

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:01.059
Alright,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.619
Teacher Liu,

00:23:07.339 --> 00:23:08.140
tell me,

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:09.579
what was the point of all that?

00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:11.339
We competed so hard for so long,

00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:12.859
only to end in a draw.

00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:14.259
Isn't that like we didn't compete at all?

00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:16.220
A total waste of effort.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.660
It wasn't a waste.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.259
After today's competition,

00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:20.460
we truly feel that

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.660
many of our old ideas

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.859
have changed.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.019
That's right.

00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:24.779
We realized that

00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:25.619
from you grandpas and grandmas,

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:27.700
there is so much we can learn.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.500
When you were young,

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.140
you must have all been the cream of the crop.

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:32.700
In short,

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.339
you are all incredible.

00:23:34.339 --> 00:23:35.099
By that logic,

00:23:35.099 --> 00:23:36.660
you also taught us a lesson.

00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:37.740
We have to admit,

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.099
indeed, each new generation surpasses the last.

00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:41.539
Each generation is stronger than the next.

00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:42.460
No, no.

00:23:42.859 --> 00:23:43.819
Isn't that Gou'er Ye?

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.619
Gou'er Ye!

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.339
Why are you running away?
