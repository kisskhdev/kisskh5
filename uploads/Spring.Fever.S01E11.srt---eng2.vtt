EPISODE 11

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:17.433
Can you please

00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:21.478
not smoke around Han-gyul?

00:01:22.062 --> 00:01:23.480
You brat.

00:01:23.564 --> 00:01:26.483
How dare you glare at your dad like that?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.864
Bring me the booze, now!

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:35.075
Darn it.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.201
Okay.

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:38.203
I'll go get it.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.150
Darn it, what's taking him so long?

00:02:36.804 --> 00:02:38.555
Han-gyul.

00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.490
Han-gyul.

00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:20.889
Jae-gyu.

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:28.605
Jae-gyu.

00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:41.660
Stop it, Dad!

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:45.122
You ungrateful little bastard,
how dare you talk back to me?

00:03:45.873 --> 00:03:46.707
You little jerk!

00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:51.211
Just looking at you

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:53.839
makes my blood boil.

00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:55.424
You brat.

00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.969
Jae-gyu.

00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:24.161
Jae-gyu.

00:04:29.374 --> 00:04:31.668
I could've saved him. Actually...

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.963
I should've saved him.

00:04:36.423 --> 00:04:37.674
But I...

00:04:42.888 --> 00:04:44.640
just walked away and left him there.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:50.145
It's unfortunate you couldn't save him,
but you can't blame yourself.

00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:54.942
I guess God left me this scar...

00:04:56.777 --> 00:04:59.029
so I wouldn't think that way.

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:12.209
So I wouldn't forget my sin.

00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:16.755
This right here is the proof.

00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:21.885
Listen, Ms. Bom.

00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:24.805
I didn't hide this scar because it's ugly.

00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:29.518
Every time I see it,

00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:36.275
I remember the look in my father's eyes...

00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:42.030
It reminds me of that moment...

00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:46.660
so I couldn't bring myself to show it.

00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:48.871
Jae-gyu.

00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:54.877
As I ran out of the house
holding Han-gyul,

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.045
it hit me.

00:05:59.047 --> 00:06:00.340
One day...

00:06:03.927 --> 00:06:06.263
I'd eventually pay for it.

00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:15.147
I kept living on edge,

00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:18.025
wondering when that day would come.

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:20.611
And of all times, it's now...

00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:27.576
when I'm happiest with you.

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:37.252
Even I can't forgive myself.

00:06:38.003 --> 00:06:39.504
Who could possibly forgive me?

00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:44.676
Even if you can't forgive me...

00:06:47.221 --> 00:06:48.805
I won't resent you.

00:06:51.475 --> 00:06:52.434
That too...

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:56.438
is my burden to bear.

00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:26.551
HBM CHARITY CONCERT

00:07:27.844 --> 00:07:29.304
-That day...
-That day...

00:07:33.892 --> 00:07:34.851
I'm sorry.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.562
I got too worked up that day

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:39.481
and spoke out of turn.

00:07:40.148 --> 00:07:41.858
I was the one who was too harsh.

00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:44.528
But I went all the way down to Shinsu

00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:47.072
just to see my daughter's face,
and hearing that

00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:48.657
really threw me off.

00:07:49.283 --> 00:07:50.617
I totally understand.

00:07:51.118 --> 00:07:54.663
If it were me and I found out the guy
my daughter was seeing was like that--

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.582
Say nothing.

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:00.294
Ms. Jeong. How have you been?

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:03.046
I feel like
we keep running into each other lately.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.466
Because the places I go are TV stations,
premieres, all that.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.511
I heard you're starting a new project
with Director Bong Chan-ho.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.847
You've got eyes and ears everywhere.

00:08:12.973 --> 00:08:14.933
I'll be looking forward to some good news.

00:08:15.017 --> 00:08:16.101
Well then, see you later.

00:08:22.858 --> 00:08:24.693
Why? Who's that?

00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:28.822
The one who asked me about Bom
at the press conference.

00:08:28.905 --> 00:08:30.032
Reporter Park from Disfact.

00:08:37.372 --> 00:08:41.668
Strangely enough,
I see him everywhere I go lately.

00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:45.213
As if he's following me everywhere.

00:08:51.928 --> 00:08:53.221
Shinsu.

00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:01.730
-Comfort him?
-Yes.

00:09:02.481 --> 00:09:04.775
But I can't figure out how.

00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:08.904
If I get too serious, he'll feel hurt.

00:09:08.987 --> 00:09:11.323
If I make a big deal of it,
he'll put his guard up.

00:09:12.157 --> 00:09:15.077
Why do you need to comfort him?
Did he get sued again?

00:09:16.286 --> 00:09:17.788
That's not it.

00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:19.998
Han-gyul got into trouble, didn't he?

00:09:20.082 --> 00:09:22.125
He's not the type to get into trouble.

00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:25.962
Ms. Bom, come over here quickly.

00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:28.298
What's going on?

00:09:28.924 --> 00:09:32.094
It's the finals.
The answer sheets are out.

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:35.555
Han-gyul marked number three
on every single Korean history question.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.307
There must be some mistake.

00:09:37.391 --> 00:09:38.767
Take a look.

00:09:39.643 --> 00:09:41.645
Has he lost his mind?

00:09:41.728 --> 00:09:42.896
What the heck is going on?

00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:47.734
Han-gyul marked all threes for math too.

00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:50.695
Life science is all threes as well.

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:51.780
Why would he do that?

00:09:58.453 --> 00:10:00.372
Han-gyul, are you finished already?

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.999
It's only been ten minutes.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.793
Yes.

00:10:11.007 --> 00:10:13.260
I'll talk to him.

00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:16.638
What was he thinking?

00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:28.984
Can you tell me what happened?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.827
I thought it was unfair.

00:10:39.703 --> 00:10:40.579
What?

00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:43.665
Ms. Bom.

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:47.169
Se-jin studies really hard.

00:10:48.378 --> 00:10:52.382
She always works harder than me,
so why is it always me who comes first?

00:10:52.466 --> 00:10:55.135
Shouldn't the one who works harder win?

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.972
Besides, I'm not even planning
to go to college

00:10:59.055 --> 00:11:00.974
and I don't need to do well on exams.

00:11:02.642 --> 00:11:03.560
Han-gyul.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:05.687
Well...

00:11:08.398 --> 00:11:11.401
I get that you care about your friend,

00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:14.946
but fairness isn't
about cutting yourself short.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.159
You both should do your best
and respect the results.

00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:22.329
On top of that,
if someone as gifted as you

00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:24.289
wants to make things fair,

00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:26.291
it's not by holding yourself back.

00:11:26.374 --> 00:11:28.710
You need to help others to catch up.

00:11:35.592 --> 00:11:38.345
I should let your uncle know
as your homeroom teacher.

00:11:38.428 --> 00:11:40.180
Wait, let me tell him.

00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:44.893
I wasn't thinking straight.

00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:47.103
Please give me a chance

00:11:47.187 --> 00:11:50.065
to speak to my uncle myself this time.

00:11:56.947 --> 00:11:57.906
Han-gyul.

00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:15.674
When did mealtime get so quiet
in this house?

00:12:19.219 --> 00:12:22.305
Han-gyul, isn't your uncle
acting weird these days?

00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:24.933
He used to say
family should look at each other

00:12:25.016 --> 00:12:27.060
instead of staring
at their phones at the table.

00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:29.688
For days, he keeps looking
at his phone at the table.

00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:31.231
Eat up.

00:12:31.898 --> 00:12:33.650
Don't you think Han-gyul's acting weird?

00:12:33.733 --> 00:12:35.777
He jumps at just hearing his name

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.696
and looks anxious
like he's hiding something.

00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:40.615
Han-gyul, you got something to say?

00:12:42.993 --> 00:12:44.369
No, nothing.

00:12:45.954 --> 00:12:46.871
Thanks for the meal.

00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:48.415
Hey.

00:12:50.292 --> 00:12:51.293
Eat some more.

00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:02.762
THAT WOMAN

00:13:06.683 --> 00:13:08.351
I sent all the paperwork. What now?

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:13.857
Where?

00:13:19.487 --> 00:13:20.947
Why did you want to see me here?

00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:24.576
You couldn't stand being here
even for a second,

00:13:25.243 --> 00:13:26.995
so you just left.

00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:33.251
Yes, I hate this place.

00:13:36.546 --> 00:13:39.299
Every time I come here,
I remember getting beaten

00:13:40.884 --> 00:13:42.636
and how poor we were.

00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:48.600
And thinking about our father
being part of this place

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:52.520
makes me sick.
I can't stand a single thing about it.

00:13:58.401 --> 00:14:00.070
That woman came by.

00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:03.406
Who?

00:14:05.116 --> 00:14:05.950
Yoon Bom.

00:14:12.207 --> 00:14:14.042
I'm sorry for dropping by out of the blue.

00:14:15.043 --> 00:14:18.838
I asked Han-gyul
and found out where you are.

00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:21.132
I see...

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:24.594
Is that so?

00:14:25.178 --> 00:14:27.764
Why did you come to see me?

00:14:28.723 --> 00:14:31.851
Recently, Mr. Sun told me

00:14:35.105 --> 00:14:36.981
about your father.

00:14:41.236 --> 00:14:43.196
I have nothing to say about that.

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.532
Don't come back over something like that.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.209
He said,

00:14:57.001 --> 00:15:00.463
"I can't even forgive myself.
Who would forgive me?"

00:15:01.923 --> 00:15:04.008
Then who

00:15:04.884 --> 00:15:06.970
would be able to forgive him?

00:15:07.804 --> 00:15:11.015
Are you saying that's me?

00:15:11.599 --> 00:15:15.687
Mr. Sun is still locking himself up
in his own guilt.

00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:18.314
I think someone needs to forgive him

00:15:18.398 --> 00:15:20.692
so he can be free of that memory.

00:15:20.775 --> 00:15:21.985
And that's something

00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:25.155
only someone
who's been through the same pain

00:15:26.823 --> 00:15:27.991
can do.

00:15:32.078 --> 00:15:32.996
Listen.

00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:38.376
I'm the kind of person who ditched my kid,
only thinking about myself.

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:42.046
The poverty? I was so sick of it.

00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:43.965
Getting beaten?

00:15:45.216 --> 00:15:46.843
That pushed me over the edge.

00:15:47.469 --> 00:15:50.263
I dumped all the responsibility and guilt
onto Jae-gyu

00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:52.932
and ran off without looking back.

00:15:55.268 --> 00:15:56.311
The pain?

00:15:58.104 --> 00:15:59.022
Forgiveness?

00:16:03.193 --> 00:16:04.944
Do you think I didn't say it to Jae-gyu

00:16:05.028 --> 00:16:07.697
all this time
just because I never had the chance?

00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:08.615
No.

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:12.410
It's because I felt so shameful.

00:16:14.287 --> 00:16:18.249
All the more reason not to run away again.

00:16:20.251 --> 00:16:21.711
Please, I'm begging you.

00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:25.882
You're such a fool.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.220
You're pathetic.

00:16:32.597 --> 00:16:33.640
So helpless.

00:16:36.267 --> 00:16:39.729
I ran off leaving my child
and my past behind

00:16:39.813 --> 00:16:41.689
and I live with my head held high.

00:16:43.274 --> 00:16:45.735
And you're punishing yourself
when you did nothing wrong?

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:49.364
You killed who?

00:16:50.824 --> 00:16:51.741
No.

00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:56.454
It wasn't you

00:16:57.914 --> 00:16:59.958
who killed our father. It was God's doing.

00:17:09.217 --> 00:17:10.218
Jae-gyu.

00:17:11.803 --> 00:17:14.013
The scar on your arm...

00:17:15.682 --> 00:17:18.393
isn't proof
that you couldn't save our father.

00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:22.814
It's proof that you saved Han-gyul.

00:17:34.993 --> 00:17:35.952
Hee-yeon.

00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:40.415
If I hadn't hesitated back then...

00:17:45.086 --> 00:17:46.212
maybe Dad...

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:50.133
-and all three of us--
-Would've all died.

00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:52.135
Dad, you...

00:17:54.679 --> 00:17:55.680
and Han-gyul.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.728
And I would've died too.

00:18:02.687 --> 00:18:04.981
Had anything bad happened
to the kid I abandoned,

00:18:05.064 --> 00:18:06.941
I wouldn't have been able
to live with myself.

00:18:08.526 --> 00:18:10.570
So let go of the guilt now.

00:18:17.744 --> 00:18:19.329
Han-gyul grew up so well.

00:18:22.165 --> 00:18:23.333
Thank you for saving

00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:26.377
and raising him.

00:18:39.098 --> 00:18:40.516
I'm so sorry.

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:44.395
It took me 18 years

00:18:45.772 --> 00:18:47.523
to finally say this.

00:18:57.367 --> 00:18:58.576
Bom-sik! No, stop.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.662
Bom-sik, no.

00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:12.006
He must have met with her.

00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:16.511
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

00:19:17.345 --> 00:19:18.596
Did I make things harder?

00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:38.032
You're here?

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:42.537
I nodded off watching TV.

00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:51.087
Why are you just standing there?
Do you want to come in?

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.172
I've got coffee today

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:56.009
and I can make some ramyeon
if you're hungry.

00:19:59.387 --> 00:20:01.764
I just met my sister.

00:20:02.348 --> 00:20:05.643
What did she want?
Did she ask you to sign some more papers?

00:20:05.727 --> 00:20:07.687
Or did she show off her bag?

00:20:09.272 --> 00:20:10.606
She said you came by.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.443
Gosh, I told her not to tell you.

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:15.319
I knew she couldn't keep stuff to herself.

00:20:18.114 --> 00:20:19.532
Bom, you see...

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.706
I said it was my burden to bear,

00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:31.836
but inside, I was completely overwhelmed.

00:20:34.464 --> 00:20:36.424
I said you didn't have to forgive me,

00:20:38.092 --> 00:20:39.802
but inside, I was scared.

00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:43.222
Terrified, actually.

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:48.436
I'm sorry,

00:20:50.063 --> 00:20:51.272
and thank you...

00:20:53.608 --> 00:20:55.443
for understanding someone like me.

00:21:00.156 --> 00:21:01.407
Thank you

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.911
for coming back to your old self.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.252
You know what?

00:21:14.212 --> 00:21:17.298
I know the perfect way to wrap things up

00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:19.092
when things get this awkward and cheesy.

00:21:20.093 --> 00:21:20.927
How?

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.935
I'm totally up for it.

00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:38.444
No, not here today.

00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:46.119
Here.

00:22:23.573 --> 00:22:24.949
Mr. Choi!

00:22:26.075 --> 00:22:27.201
This is serious.

00:22:27.285 --> 00:22:30.788
I've been dealing with so much lately
that most things seem minor.

00:22:31.747 --> 00:22:34.584
Are you sure it's serious enough
to make such a fuss?

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:36.127
Unfortunately,

00:22:38.337 --> 00:22:39.547
yes, I'm sure.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.590
DISFACT

00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:48.556
I need to talk to Hye-suk
when that PE teacher isn't around.

00:22:49.348 --> 00:22:51.309
Geez, just where is she?

00:22:53.436 --> 00:22:54.979
-Excuse me.
-Oh, hi.

00:22:55.062 --> 00:22:56.981
Are you a teacher at this school?

00:22:58.191 --> 00:23:00.067
Well...

00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:03.112
I'm pretty involved with a teacher here.

00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:04.572
Who are you?

00:23:04.655 --> 00:23:05.615
I see.

00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:07.909
So, the thing is... I'm...

00:23:13.539 --> 00:23:15.041
PARK JAE-YEONG, REPORTER
DISFACT

00:23:15.124 --> 00:23:18.461
It's a good thing I happened
to meet that guy first.

00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:21.505
He didn't interview anyone else?

00:23:22.632 --> 00:23:23.925
I think he's met someone.

00:23:24.008 --> 00:23:26.260
He knew Ms. Bom was dating a parent

00:23:26.344 --> 00:23:29.680
and that she came here
because of an affair.

00:23:29.764 --> 00:23:30.848
But...

00:23:31.933 --> 00:23:33.684
does anyone at school know about that?

00:23:35.478 --> 00:23:39.190
Do you know
why she came down here from Seoul?

00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:41.984
There is one.

00:23:42.068 --> 00:23:43.694
Who?

00:23:43.778 --> 00:23:45.905
So what did you tell the reporter?

00:23:45.988 --> 00:23:47.323
Oh, come on.

00:23:47.406 --> 00:23:49.242
I've been working with you for years now.

00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:50.701
I just said,

00:23:50.785 --> 00:23:53.621
"I know someone who has decisive evidence
of Ms. Bom's affair."

00:23:53.704 --> 00:23:55.748
"But too many people are watching here,

00:23:55.831 --> 00:23:58.209
so let's go to Seoul and talk in private."

00:23:58.292 --> 00:23:59.293
Then I sent him off.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.464
Mr. Oh.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.342
Have I ever said that I love you?

00:24:07.051 --> 00:24:09.845
It wasn't you I wanted to hug.

00:24:11.889 --> 00:24:14.058
First, please draft
a fact-confirmation statement

00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:15.977
based on your conversation
with the reporter.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:16.894
Sure.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.569
Please prepare a draft of this
and email it to me.

00:24:25.653 --> 00:24:26.570
Okay.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.117
I'll ask Ms. Bom
to sign a power of attorney.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.077
So have the audio recordings
and transcripts

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.621
related to the affair notarized
to preserve the evidence.

00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:37.498
On it.

00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.335
All right.

00:24:43.838 --> 00:24:44.922
Ms. Jeong.

00:24:45.631 --> 00:24:46.674
What?

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.801
Who showed up where?

00:24:49.593 --> 00:24:51.762
Why? What is it this time?

00:24:51.846 --> 00:24:54.307
I'll go to Seoul
to speak with the reporter first.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.183
Make sure to let the agency know,

00:24:56.267 --> 00:24:58.686
and just in case,
it'd be best to prepare a counter-article

00:24:58.769 --> 00:25:00.479
or an official statement in advance.

00:25:02.982 --> 00:25:05.568
Honey!

00:25:05.651 --> 00:25:06.527
Are you okay?

00:25:08.571 --> 00:25:09.780
Gosh, this is bad.

00:25:11.657 --> 00:25:12.992
-Seon-woong.
-Yes?

00:25:15.536 --> 00:25:17.163
-Your grades improved a lot.
-Thank you.

00:25:25.004 --> 00:25:26.297
Sun Han-gyul.

00:25:39.727 --> 00:25:41.228
-Sol.
-Yes?

00:25:43.189 --> 00:25:44.106
Good job.

00:25:47.443 --> 00:25:48.277
Se-jin.

00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:54.033
Good job.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.205
-Min-guk.
-Yes?

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.293
What?

00:26:04.377 --> 00:26:05.878
GRADE - RANK - SUBJECT AVERAGE

00:26:07.296 --> 00:26:10.883
Is Se-jin actually smiling
at her report card?

00:26:10.966 --> 00:26:13.344
Hey, Se-jin is in first place!

00:26:13.427 --> 00:26:14.970
-What?
-Really?

00:26:15.054 --> 00:26:15.971
For real?

00:26:16.055 --> 00:26:18.265
That's crazy. Did she flip the whole game?

00:26:28.234 --> 00:26:29.610
Congratulations.

00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:41.705
What?

00:26:45.126 --> 00:26:47.002
Well, you know...

00:26:47.086 --> 00:26:48.337
Seriously...

00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:50.131
You know what? Well...

00:26:51.006 --> 00:26:53.008
You got a mosquito bite?
Why are you scratching?

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.512
What are you doing the day after tomorrow?

00:26:57.805 --> 00:26:58.681
Saturday?

00:26:58.764 --> 00:27:00.891
If you're not busy,
we could grab a meal together.

00:27:01.642 --> 00:27:03.519
Why would I have a meal with you?

00:27:05.104 --> 00:27:06.564
Why can't we have a meal together?

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.904
I'll text you the address,

00:27:13.988 --> 00:27:15.865
so come if you want. If not, don't.

00:27:15.948 --> 00:27:17.658
I'll just wait a bit

00:27:17.741 --> 00:27:19.952
and if you don't show up,
I'll manage. Do as you like.

00:27:22.413 --> 00:27:24.248
It's steak, by the way.

00:27:28.252 --> 00:27:30.129
ATTORNEY CHOI I-JUN

00:27:33.716 --> 00:27:36.302
Gosh, who keeps calling nonstop?

00:27:38.012 --> 00:27:38.888
What?

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.308
-Hello...
-Ms. Bom.

00:27:42.391 --> 00:27:44.560
I have something urgent to tell you.

00:27:44.643 --> 00:27:45.519
What?

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.147
TEACHERS' OFFICE

00:27:57.823 --> 00:27:59.575
Ms. Bom, take this call.

00:27:59.658 --> 00:28:01.160
I didn't mean to listen in,

00:28:01.243 --> 00:28:04.079
but he's talking about some actress
and reporter. What's going on?

00:28:05.247 --> 00:28:06.165
Hello?

00:28:11.337 --> 00:28:13.923
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

00:28:15.216 --> 00:28:17.843
Reporters might come for you, Ms. Bom,

00:28:18.636 --> 00:28:22.640
so don't go anywhere today
and go straight home after school.

00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:25.351
Set your phone
to automatically record every call.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.645
Yes.

00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:29.939
Ignore calls from unknown numbers.

00:28:30.022 --> 00:28:31.148
Let me know right away.

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:34.610
I'll meet the reporter in Seoul
and get back to you.

00:28:36.028 --> 00:28:37.071
Hey.

00:28:37.655 --> 00:28:39.823
What are you talking about? What reporter?

00:28:49.959 --> 00:28:51.418
Ms. Bom!

00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:53.003
Dong-pyo?

00:28:55.256 --> 00:28:56.632
You're here.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.886
Master told us to keep an eye
on your house,

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.096
no questions asked.

00:29:02.179 --> 00:29:04.723
He said we should make sure
you can rest easy with no worries

00:29:04.807 --> 00:29:06.100
while he's away in Seoul.

00:29:06.809 --> 00:29:08.936
Han-gyul's uncle is... going where?

00:29:11.313 --> 00:29:13.399
You barged into the car,
so I'm taking you with me.

00:29:14.024 --> 00:29:14.900
But remember.

00:29:15.484 --> 00:29:17.111
Don't cause a scene or raise your voice

00:29:17.194 --> 00:29:19.780
unless you want to get charged
with interfering with my job.

00:29:20.489 --> 00:29:22.408
If you break stuff,
that's property damage.

00:29:22.491 --> 00:29:23.659
Hitting someone is assault.

00:29:23.742 --> 00:29:26.120
That's enough.
Let's stop by somewhere real quick.

00:29:26.996 --> 00:29:28.414
Where?

00:29:28.497 --> 00:29:31.292
It's rude to go empty-handed
on our first visit.

00:29:31.834 --> 00:29:33.127
I should get dressed properly.

00:29:34.545 --> 00:29:37.131
He told me to tell you not to worry
since he'll take care of it

00:29:38.507 --> 00:29:39.883
and to give you this.

00:29:58.611 --> 00:29:59.778
ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT

00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:02.448
The headline's catchy,

00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:06.869
but you need at least a photo
to get clicks.

00:30:06.952 --> 00:30:09.121
This has zero visual appeal, geez.

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:12.291
I heard someone's got the evidence.

00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:14.043
-Really?
-Yes.

00:30:24.219 --> 00:30:26.221
REPORTER PARK JAE-YEONG

00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:36.899
Hello, everyone!

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:40.861
Who's that?

00:30:42.321 --> 00:30:45.824
I'm here to see Reporter Park Jae-yeong.

00:30:46.283 --> 00:30:47.409
Did you use a private loan?

00:30:47.534 --> 00:30:48.952
-Or co-sign for someone?
-What?

00:30:49.912 --> 00:30:51.246
Did you have an affair?

00:30:51.664 --> 00:30:53.207
Where's the Entertainment Department?

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.209
"Politics."

00:30:55.292 --> 00:30:56.418
"Business."

00:30:57.044 --> 00:30:58.671
Where's Reporter Park Jae-yeong?

00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:00.339
"Society."

00:31:04.218 --> 00:31:05.094
Where is he?

00:31:05.594 --> 00:31:07.221
Oh, "Sports."

00:31:07.304 --> 00:31:08.222
Hide for now.

00:31:08.305 --> 00:31:09.973
I'll step out for a second.

00:31:10.057 --> 00:31:11.141
Just hide.

00:31:15.854 --> 00:31:17.856
"Entertainment Department." There it is.

00:31:23.445 --> 00:31:25.572
Hi there.

00:31:25.656 --> 00:31:27.574
I'm the department head.
What can I do for you?

00:31:27.658 --> 00:31:30.953
I wish nothing but happiness and peace
in everything you do.

00:31:31.036 --> 00:31:32.371
SUN JAE-GYU

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.540
Sun Jae-gyu?

00:31:34.623 --> 00:31:36.083
Who's Sun Jae-gyu?

00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:37.501
That'd be me.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.922
I'm here to speak
with Reporter Park Jae-yeong.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.299
Oh, shoot.

00:31:44.925 --> 00:31:47.803
He had to leave early
for personal reasons.

00:31:50.013 --> 00:31:52.057
Then I can just wait until tomorrow.

00:31:52.975 --> 00:31:54.768
I've got plenty of time.

00:31:57.563 --> 00:32:02.901
You see, I'm the one in charge,
so you can speak with me.

00:32:03.694 --> 00:32:06.655
So you're the one in charge, huh?

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.159
I heard that Reporter Park

00:32:10.242 --> 00:32:12.745
is doing a piece
on Ms. Jeong Nan-hee's daughter.

00:32:12.828 --> 00:32:15.080
I heard he came all the way
to Shinsu for the story.

00:32:15.164 --> 00:32:17.207
I figured I'd offer a little help.

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:22.963
So you're the one
with the decisive evidence?

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:28.552
I nearly got the wrong idea.

00:32:28.635 --> 00:32:31.847
We were planning to break it tomorrow.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.223
So, what did you bring?

00:32:33.307 --> 00:32:34.266
What is it, a call?

00:32:35.058 --> 00:32:36.393
A text?

00:32:36.477 --> 00:32:39.396
Or even better,
photos or videos of the affair?

00:32:44.443 --> 00:32:46.028
The affair...

00:32:46.653 --> 00:32:47.780
The affair?

00:32:47.863 --> 00:32:49.907
I brought the evidence
that there was no affair.

00:32:52.785 --> 00:32:54.787
Gosh, I can't believe this.

00:32:55.454 --> 00:32:56.872
Hey, look.

00:32:56.955 --> 00:32:59.291
Who cares about an article
proving it wasn't an affair?

00:32:59.374 --> 00:33:03.253
People click when it appears
like it happened.

00:33:05.172 --> 00:33:06.799
Then just don't run the story.

00:33:09.843 --> 00:33:11.094
Who are you?

00:33:11.678 --> 00:33:12.513
Me?

00:33:14.723 --> 00:33:16.809
I'm a parent at the school
where Ms. Yoon works

00:33:16.892 --> 00:33:18.101
and I'm seeing her.

00:33:22.397 --> 00:33:23.565
How did you get in here?

00:33:24.274 --> 00:33:25.859
I want to prove what's written here

00:33:25.943 --> 00:33:27.027
is not true,

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.278
so let me do an interview.

00:33:28.946 --> 00:33:29.780
Get out.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.241
I'm not interested. Just leave.

00:33:36.203 --> 00:33:38.872
I went through the articles
on my way here.

00:33:38.956 --> 00:33:41.250
You've written
a lot of entertaining pieces, huh?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.628
You put question marks on every title,

00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:47.130
throw in words
like "suspicion" or "allegedly"

00:33:47.214 --> 00:33:50.300
and make rumors sound like facts.

00:33:50.384 --> 00:33:51.885
Unbelievable.

00:33:51.969 --> 00:33:54.221
Security? This is the entertainment desk.

00:33:54.304 --> 00:33:56.306
Yes, this is the Entertainment Department.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:58.642
You're supposed to cover celebrities.

00:33:58.725 --> 00:34:02.062
Why are you doing stories
on a non-celebrity family member?

00:34:02.855 --> 00:34:03.981
Reporter Park, you're back?

00:34:05.774 --> 00:34:07.818
What do you think you're doing?
Give it back.

00:34:07.901 --> 00:34:08.819
Hey.

00:34:09.403 --> 00:34:11.905
SELECT AUDIO FILE
DELETE

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.494
Wait.

00:34:19.371 --> 00:34:21.707
Did you just delete the recording?

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.667
You think we've never dealt
with this before?

00:34:24.251 --> 00:34:27.379
You ignorant fool.
I guess you've seen stuff somewhere.

00:34:27.462 --> 00:34:29.965
Now that the recording's off,
what did you say?

00:34:30.048 --> 00:34:32.301
You said we run stories
that aren't even true?

00:34:32.384 --> 00:34:33.594
Listen.

00:34:33.677 --> 00:34:36.972
We never publish things
that aren't factual.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.517
We avoid making definite claims,
hint at things,

00:34:41.101 --> 00:34:44.021
and craft the story vaguely and subtly,

00:34:44.104 --> 00:34:45.522
based only on facts.

00:34:45.606 --> 00:34:48.233
Look, we never said she had an affair.

00:34:48.859 --> 00:34:50.402
We only write "There's a suspicion"

00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:52.821
or "This tip came in."

00:34:53.405 --> 00:34:56.700
Reporters only go this far.

00:34:56.783 --> 00:34:59.244
How it's interpreted is up to the reader.

00:35:03.874 --> 00:35:07.419
No wonder you're a department head.
You're quite the speaker.

00:35:09.463 --> 00:35:11.048
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:35:13.175 --> 00:35:14.009
Yeah.

00:35:15.218 --> 00:35:16.178
Hey, Phillip.

00:35:16.261 --> 00:35:18.221
You still haven't hung up?

00:35:18.805 --> 00:35:21.141
What? The call was recorded?

00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:26.980
What he said about crafting the story
vaguely and subtly was recorded.

00:35:27.064 --> 00:35:29.983
Wow, what he said about
hinting at things was recorded?

00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:31.193
-Did you just--
-Yes.

00:35:31.693 --> 00:35:32.861
Right.

00:35:34.321 --> 00:35:36.740
Like the department head said,
I'm an ignorant fool.

00:35:36.823 --> 00:35:38.825
I forgot to hang up
while carrying the flowerpot.

00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:40.994
Keep that recording handy.

00:35:41.078 --> 00:35:42.412
Jae-gyu.

00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:45.123
Hey, Attorney Choi.
You had something to say on legal grounds?

00:35:45.207 --> 00:35:46.124
Come over here.

00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:47.417
Yes, my phone.

00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:48.585
Hey, come over here.

00:35:49.169 --> 00:35:50.963
-Here.
-Oh.

00:35:52.673 --> 00:35:53.715
Hello.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.218
I'm Choi I-jun, the legal counsel
for Ms. Jeong Nan-hee

00:35:56.301 --> 00:35:59.137
and Ms. Yoon Bom,
and the head of Choi I-jun Law Office.

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:07.938
Regarding malicious reporting
on Ms. Yoon Bom,

00:36:08.021 --> 00:36:11.566
we submitted a request
for a preliminary injunction.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.736
Hey, make sure to submit
the call recording as evidence.

00:36:17.072 --> 00:36:19.825
If any report is released
before the court reaches a decision,

00:36:19.908 --> 00:36:22.285
we'll file a petition
with the Press Mediation Committee

00:36:22.369 --> 00:36:23.996
to pursue all legal measures,

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:26.665
including corrections, rebuttals
and claims for damage.

00:36:29.001 --> 00:36:31.670
If the report contains false information,

00:36:31.753 --> 00:36:34.381
we'll consider filing
a criminal complaint for defamation

00:36:34.464 --> 00:36:35.924
under relevant laws.

00:36:41.388 --> 00:36:44.891
Seems like you're busy,
so let's just leave it at that.

00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:47.310
Attention. Say bye.

00:36:50.105 --> 00:36:51.606
Good work.

00:36:52.566 --> 00:36:53.817
Good work. Bye.

00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:03.493
They're gone. Come out.

00:37:06.705 --> 00:37:09.166
Man, talk about bad luck.

00:37:09.249 --> 00:37:12.252
Some thug and a smug know-it-all
show up as a package deal.

00:37:12.335 --> 00:37:13.378
What do we do?

00:37:14.629 --> 00:37:16.631
At this point, we've got two choices.

00:37:17.716 --> 00:37:19.468
Either keep it quiet and move on,

00:37:19.551 --> 00:37:23.180
or go all out
and turn it into a full-blown mess.

00:37:39.613 --> 00:37:40.739
How did it go?

00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:45.285
I met with the reporter
and put in a preliminary injunction.

00:37:45.368 --> 00:37:48.080
That means we can stop the article, right?

00:37:48.163 --> 00:37:53.001
A preliminary injunction
is a court request to stop the article,

00:37:53.585 --> 00:37:57.255
but it doesn't guarantee
the story won't come out.

00:37:57.339 --> 00:37:59.758
What kind of law works like that?

00:37:59.841 --> 00:38:01.593
So if the article gets out,

00:38:01.676 --> 00:38:03.929
the victim is supposed to
sit there and take it?

00:38:04.554 --> 00:38:06.389
Seriously, this is ridiculous.

00:38:06.932 --> 00:38:07.933
Who was that?

00:38:09.643 --> 00:38:10.769
Sun Jae-gyu?

00:38:13.105 --> 00:38:16.983
Jae-gyu put in a lot of effort today.

00:38:20.237 --> 00:38:23.490
If the article doesn't come out
or this situation is resolved well,

00:38:24.116 --> 00:38:25.534
it'll all be thanks to him.

00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:28.578
Just so you know. I'll be in touch later.

00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:33.542
Why? What did Attorney Choi say?

00:38:35.544 --> 00:38:37.921
Say something already.

00:38:50.392 --> 00:38:51.768
Hey, there you go.

00:38:51.852 --> 00:38:53.728
You can do it if you put in the effort.

00:38:53.812 --> 00:38:55.647
Just keep it up like this, okay?

00:38:56.398 --> 00:38:58.733
I seriously worked hard for this test.

00:38:58.817 --> 00:39:00.443
The kid who's always top of your class,

00:39:00.902 --> 00:39:03.071
I bet he's crying his eyes out right now,

00:39:03.155 --> 00:39:05.407
since you finally beat him
for the first time.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.118
Come on, who cares about him
on such a great day?

00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:09.870
Hey, Grade 1 student.

00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:14.583
Today, I'm buying premium ribeye for you!

00:39:18.879 --> 00:39:20.797
-Mom.
-Yes?

00:39:21.339 --> 00:39:22.674
I'm stepping out for a moment.

00:39:22.757 --> 00:39:25.218
Aren't you going to have beef?
Where are you going?

00:39:25.302 --> 00:39:27.012
Hey, Grade 1 student!

00:39:30.557 --> 00:39:33.393
Two steak and cheese subs, please.

00:39:33.476 --> 00:39:36.104
Make that with low-sugar onion sauce.

00:39:36.188 --> 00:39:37.689
Sure, coming right up.

00:39:45.197 --> 00:39:46.072
Why?

00:39:46.907 --> 00:39:48.867
You lost your appetite after losing to me?

00:39:51.161 --> 00:39:52.329
That's not it.

00:39:52.412 --> 00:39:55.498
I passed on premium Korean beef
to grab a sandwich with you.

00:39:56.791 --> 00:39:58.418
What did you say last time?

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.755
"Studying is a stamina game."

00:40:01.838 --> 00:40:04.341
"If you just sit here upset,
how are you going to beat me?"

00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:10.805
Are you happy getting first place?

00:40:13.642 --> 00:40:15.101
Honestly, I love it,

00:40:16.186 --> 00:40:17.979
minus feeling bad toward you.

00:40:20.106 --> 00:40:22.442
It feels great being praised
by my mom and dad,

00:40:23.151 --> 00:40:26.238
and it's thrilling
to see my classmates jealous.

00:40:29.366 --> 00:40:31.034
But the best part?

00:40:35.038 --> 00:40:36.248
Realizing hard work pays off.

00:40:39.793 --> 00:40:41.461
It feels like the world notices it.

00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:50.553
Se-jin.

00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:53.723
-Listen...
-What?

00:40:59.020 --> 00:40:59.854
Never mind.

00:41:01.064 --> 00:41:02.732
You look really pretty when you smile.

00:41:04.526 --> 00:41:05.402
Come on.

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:08.863
I'm pretty whether I'm smiling or not.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.491
What are you doing? Have some.

00:41:11.574 --> 00:41:13.368
The sauce is really good.

00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:14.494
Okay.

00:41:24.004 --> 00:41:25.005
It's good.

00:41:25.964 --> 00:41:27.924
Geez, you ran just ten minutes.

00:41:28.675 --> 00:41:31.386
No wonder you guys come in last
with stamina like that.

00:41:31.469 --> 00:41:33.513
Mr. Jeong, I'm 24th.

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:34.639
Kim Min-guk came in last.

00:41:34.723 --> 00:41:39.519
All right, listen. What we need right now
isn't training, it's refueling.

00:41:39.602 --> 00:41:40.979
Let's eat up.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.690
My goodness,

00:41:43.773 --> 00:41:47.444
your mom's wrists got worn out
from changing your diapers, but for what?

00:41:48.737 --> 00:41:51.740
Her back got bent
from carrying you around, but for what?

00:41:51.823 --> 00:41:53.199
Wait, stop.

00:41:53.283 --> 00:41:54.701
Why are you bringing up our mom?

00:41:54.784 --> 00:41:58.246
I'm saying this because your grades
are worse than Han-gyul's,

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.081
who marked number three on every question.

00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:03.126
He marked three for every question?

00:42:03.918 --> 00:42:06.171
Then he's the one
who should be in trouble.

00:42:06.254 --> 00:42:08.340
-Why are we getting scolded?
-Exactly.

00:42:09.799 --> 00:42:12.385
You little brats,
where do you think you're going?

00:42:14.679 --> 00:42:15.972
Let's go together!

00:42:20.185 --> 00:42:21.519
What was that about?

00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:24.981
Sun Han-gyul.

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:29.152
Did you mark only number three
on the tests?

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.075
Is that true?

00:42:37.243 --> 00:42:38.078
Se-jin.

00:42:40.372 --> 00:42:41.831
The thing is...

00:42:42.582 --> 00:42:44.876
-Let me explain why--
-Was it because of me?

00:42:48.213 --> 00:42:49.672
I said, was it because of me?

00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:08.108
If you're asleep, fine.

00:43:09.275 --> 00:43:10.693
If not, just listen.

00:43:13.029 --> 00:43:14.072
Regarding Ms. Bom,

00:43:16.199 --> 00:43:19.327
I'll take care of all the legal matters,
so don't worry.

00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:21.037
And about what I said

00:43:23.748 --> 00:43:25.625
in front of Ms. Jeong before...

00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:31.297
I didn't really mean that.

00:43:42.183 --> 00:43:45.145
To someone like you, friendship

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.022
probably means nothing,
like the air you barely notice.

00:43:49.274 --> 00:43:50.150
But...

00:43:52.444 --> 00:43:53.611
to me,

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.948
you were...

00:44:00.493 --> 00:44:01.828
my only friend.

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:04.539
The only way I could come to terms

00:44:04.622 --> 00:44:07.292
with my one and only friend
running off with my money

00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:11.421
was to convince myself

00:44:13.631 --> 00:44:16.468
that you were the one
who set that house on fire.

00:44:18.136 --> 00:44:20.889
That was the only way I could hate you,
and the only way...

00:44:22.557 --> 00:44:26.352
your betrayal would make sense to me.

00:44:31.816 --> 00:44:32.984
Did you say "betrayal"?

00:44:34.444 --> 00:44:35.361
You weren't sleeping?

00:44:37.614 --> 00:44:40.074
I didn't betray you. You did.

00:44:42.118 --> 00:44:42.952
Me?

00:44:46.164 --> 00:44:47.248
That night...

00:44:55.256 --> 00:44:57.175
as I ran out of the burning house...

00:45:01.262 --> 00:45:02.972
I went straight to you.

00:45:04.432 --> 00:45:08.895
Everything went blank,
and all I could think of was you.

00:45:11.022 --> 00:45:12.482
Sun Jae-gyu?

00:45:12.565 --> 00:45:15.193
You've been coming home late every day.

00:45:15.276 --> 00:45:17.237
I heard you've been hanging out
with that kid.

00:45:18.196 --> 00:45:19.989
His dad's an alcoholic,

00:45:20.073 --> 00:45:24.244
and his only sister
has a child with no father.

00:45:24.327 --> 00:45:26.246
Geez.

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:29.874
Now that I think about it,
you said before you didn't need a car...

00:45:30.708 --> 00:45:32.001
He's not my friend.

00:45:32.919 --> 00:45:34.712
Why would I hang out with a kid like that?

00:45:34.796 --> 00:45:36.130
That'd be beneath me.

00:45:36.756 --> 00:45:39.008
I just felt a little pity for him,

00:45:40.009 --> 00:45:41.553
that's all.

00:45:41.636 --> 00:45:43.846
-Right?
-Of course.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.598
To make life at school easier,

00:45:45.682 --> 00:45:47.392
I've got to make friends with those kids.

00:45:49.018 --> 00:45:50.395
He isn't my friend,

00:45:51.938 --> 00:45:53.147
so don't worry.

00:45:56.526 --> 00:45:58.444
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

00:46:12.083 --> 00:46:13.126
He's not my friend.

00:46:13.835 --> 00:46:16.629
I just felt a little pity for him.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.673
That's all.

00:46:21.092 --> 00:46:22.969
I put the money I stole to good use.

00:46:24.512 --> 00:46:25.638
I got a place to stay

00:46:26.514 --> 00:46:28.683
and took Han-gyul to the hospital
when he was sick.

00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:30.268
I worked like crazy

00:46:31.227 --> 00:46:32.729
so I wouldn't look pathetic.

00:46:34.105 --> 00:46:36.316
And so you'd never run your mouth
like that again

00:46:36.399 --> 00:46:37.859
if we ever crossed paths,

00:46:37.942 --> 00:46:41.529
I kept my distance from everyone
and focused on Han-gyul,

00:46:42.905 --> 00:46:44.699
doing nothing but making money.

00:46:44.782 --> 00:46:46.034
Wow.

00:46:47.702 --> 00:46:49.203
Feels like I finally got an apology.

00:46:52.498 --> 00:46:53.833
What?

00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:58.630
Then that means I was your friend too,

00:46:59.714 --> 00:47:03.885
if it hurt you that much to hear
we weren't friends that you ran away.

00:47:05.428 --> 00:47:07.680
Does that matter right now?

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:10.099
It does.

00:47:10.183 --> 00:47:14.729
Whether you used the money
to go to college or to raise Han-gyul,

00:47:14.812 --> 00:47:17.106
I was okay
as long as you figured out a way to live.

00:47:18.191 --> 00:47:21.277
I had saved that money for you
in the first place,

00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:25.948
but back then, I didn't really have
a choice to get the money from my father.

00:47:28.326 --> 00:47:29.994
As long as I could get that money,

00:47:30.787 --> 00:47:31.954
bad-mouthing you to my dad?

00:47:33.122 --> 00:47:34.040
I would've done it...

00:47:36.125 --> 00:47:39.295
a hundred times, a thousand times,
without hesitation.

00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:54.268
The boss is here.

00:47:55.144 --> 00:47:57.105
Attention, salute!

00:47:57.188 --> 00:47:58.523
Victory!

00:47:59.607 --> 00:48:00.525
At ease!

00:48:01.734 --> 00:48:02.860
All clear while on duty!

00:48:03.403 --> 00:48:05.238
-Welcome back!
-Boss!

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.031
At ease!

00:48:07.115 --> 00:48:08.157
Why here?

00:48:12.912 --> 00:48:13.996
Stay with her.

00:48:15.373 --> 00:48:18.084
Tonight isn't going to be easy

00:48:19.961 --> 00:48:20.962
for Ms. Bom.

00:48:21.754 --> 00:48:26.134
-What about you?
-I need to go check on someone

00:48:26.217 --> 00:48:28.511
who'd probably be having a hard time
without me tonight.

00:48:30.388 --> 00:48:32.682
My favorite actor, Jeong Nan-hee.

00:48:32.765 --> 00:48:33.891
Whatever.

00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:36.227
Here, keep this.

00:48:38.271 --> 00:48:39.105
Bye.

00:48:44.527 --> 00:48:47.321
Will this size fit me?

00:49:08.426 --> 00:49:09.761
My little baby.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.805
Bom-sik, did you wait for me?

00:49:19.979 --> 00:49:21.355
Was everything all right?

00:49:21.439 --> 00:49:22.315
Well...

00:49:23.107 --> 00:49:25.401
I was fine
with the jiu jitsu people around.

00:49:26.486 --> 00:49:28.905
Was everything all right for you too?

00:49:29.822 --> 00:49:31.115
Oh, man.

00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:33.534
I've only been in the countryside.
I'm kind of clueless.

00:49:33.618 --> 00:49:36.996
We went to the company
and talked to the reporter.

00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:38.873
But apparently,

00:49:39.874 --> 00:49:41.667
stopping an article legally
is pretty hard.

00:49:46.088 --> 00:49:48.216
Thank you for making the effort.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:52.678
Well, it's possible

00:49:54.013 --> 00:49:55.598
the article will come out tomorrow.

00:50:06.609 --> 00:50:07.652
Perfect.

00:50:09.529 --> 00:50:12.114
Let's stay up all night and have fun,
the three of us.

00:50:16.494 --> 00:50:18.246
Let's leave tomorrow for tomorrow.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.626
Let's do the stuff we didn't get to do,
eat whatever we want,

00:50:23.709 --> 00:50:24.961
and just have fun, okay?

00:50:33.344 --> 00:50:34.345
Sure.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:37.807
Bom-sik, where should we go?

00:50:45.898 --> 00:50:47.567
Bom-sik's so adorable.

00:50:48.484 --> 00:50:50.194
Bom-sik's got long legs.

00:50:50.278 --> 00:50:52.029
"Bom-sik's got long legs."

00:50:52.113 --> 00:50:54.031
Wow, you're good.

00:50:54.115 --> 00:50:56.701
Bom-sik's a tough guy.

00:51:01.747 --> 00:51:03.374
Moisture check, perfect.

00:51:04.292 --> 00:51:07.003
Digestion's great. He's healthy.

00:51:08.504 --> 00:51:09.338
You're good.

00:51:10.339 --> 00:51:12.466
-Bom-sik, can you turn?
-There you go.

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.677
-Good boy.
-Wow, good job.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.137
Bom-sik, did you turn?

00:51:17.221 --> 00:51:18.931
You're a genius, Bom-sik.

00:51:19.015 --> 00:51:20.391
Look, it's right there.

00:51:20.474 --> 00:51:21.517
Oh, boy.

00:51:21.601 --> 00:51:23.811
Oh, my gosh! Our Bom-sik is a genius.

00:51:23.895 --> 00:51:24.729
My gosh, good boy.

00:51:25.688 --> 00:51:26.564
You love it?

00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:29.817
Bom-sik.

00:51:31.527 --> 00:51:33.446
Slice it right down the middle.

00:51:36.032 --> 00:51:36.866
Wow.

00:51:37.366 --> 00:51:38.576
Now, in it goes.

00:51:38.659 --> 00:51:39.493
Okay.

00:51:39.577 --> 00:51:42.997
In the preheated pan,
put some cooking oil.

00:51:43.664 --> 00:51:46.375
Give it two clockwise circles.

00:51:46.459 --> 00:51:48.044
Now toss the green onions in.

00:51:50.129 --> 00:51:50.963
In they go.

00:51:51.047 --> 00:51:54.634
Let them crisp up a little.

00:51:56.218 --> 00:51:58.763
Mix them together
so they're combined well.

00:52:00.598 --> 00:52:02.808
Let me try.

00:52:02.892 --> 00:52:04.185
-What?
-I want to give it a try.

00:52:05.269 --> 00:52:06.938
Hang on.

00:52:11.108 --> 00:52:13.444
Let me try one more time. Again.

00:52:14.278 --> 00:52:15.112
Hold on.

00:52:16.989 --> 00:52:18.157
Geez, no way.

00:52:19.367 --> 00:52:22.620
Now, have a seat.
Sitting still makes things easier.

00:52:22.703 --> 00:52:23.955
Here you go.

00:52:25.873 --> 00:52:27.375
Thanks for the food.

00:52:29.919 --> 00:52:30.753
How is it?

00:52:30.836 --> 00:52:32.421
It tastes just like yukgaejang, right?

00:52:35.174 --> 00:52:37.969
This hits the spot. It's way better
than the store-bought ones.

00:52:38.052 --> 00:52:39.720
Yes, eat up.

00:52:53.025 --> 00:52:54.026
This is spot-on.

00:53:01.659 --> 00:53:03.619
Bom-sik, there you go.

00:53:05.121 --> 00:53:06.163
You want to keep playing?

00:53:13.212 --> 00:53:14.380
What are you thinking about?

00:53:17.633 --> 00:53:18.467
Mom.

00:53:35.985 --> 00:53:38.279
MOM

00:53:47.121 --> 00:53:47.997
Hello?

00:53:48.497 --> 00:53:49.623
Don't hang up, just listen.

00:53:52.293 --> 00:53:53.669
Turn off your phone now.

00:53:54.503 --> 00:53:57.506
Don't search, don't text,
don't read any comments.

00:53:58.632 --> 00:54:00.217
It'll feel way more unfair

00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:03.721
than you imagine.

00:54:06.307 --> 00:54:08.809
One insult will cut deeper

00:54:10.394 --> 00:54:12.605
than a hundred words of support. And...

00:54:14.398 --> 00:54:15.608
that one insult

00:54:17.193 --> 00:54:19.195
will eat away at your heart.

00:54:20.905 --> 00:54:22.782
Even so, brace your core
and stand up tall.

00:54:23.657 --> 00:54:25.951
Don't skip meals
because you don't have an appetite.

00:54:26.035 --> 00:54:28.329
Even if you feel sick or nauseous,
chew something.

00:54:29.288 --> 00:54:33.459
Tonight, you probably
won't get a wink of sleep.

00:54:37.421 --> 00:54:41.717
In moments like this,
having someone around helps you stay sane.

00:54:41.801 --> 00:54:43.677
Tell that Sun Jae-gyu guy or whoever

00:54:45.471 --> 00:54:47.515
to stay with you if you need him to.

00:54:50.434 --> 00:54:54.897
If only you'd been born
into an ordinary family.

00:54:58.692 --> 00:55:01.737
Of all people, you ended up
with a mom like me.

00:55:06.742 --> 00:55:07.618
I'm hanging up now.

00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:25.344
Now I see...

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:30.766
Mom must've had nights
like this all the time.

00:55:36.272 --> 00:55:38.440
Oh, man, I can't fall asleep.

00:55:38.524 --> 00:55:40.401
I'll just keep playing with Bom-sik.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:46.949
Ms. Bom, try to get some sleep
like your mother said.

00:55:47.741 --> 00:55:48.659
Tomorrow,

00:55:50.202 --> 00:55:52.413
it might become a long day.

00:56:15.186 --> 00:56:16.437
Grandma.

00:56:17.021 --> 00:56:18.147
Look at this.

00:56:21.275 --> 00:56:23.152
What the heck does it say?

00:56:23.235 --> 00:56:27.698
So it says when Ms. Bom was in Seoul...

00:56:27.781 --> 00:56:29.783
-Did Ms. Bom get involved in this?
-Really?

00:56:37.917 --> 00:56:39.960
"An affair with a parent"?

00:56:41.253 --> 00:56:44.298
His wife stormed in during class
and even slapped her?

00:56:45.382 --> 00:56:46.800
Oh, my goodness.

00:56:46.884 --> 00:56:47.801
Why? What's going on?

00:56:52.056 --> 00:56:53.933
She's actress Jeong Nan-hee's daughter?

00:56:54.016 --> 00:56:55.267
Jeong Nan-hee?

00:56:55.351 --> 00:56:57.394
You mean that famous lady on TV?

00:56:57.478 --> 00:56:58.896
I don't think I can see her face.

00:56:58.979 --> 00:56:59.813
What is it?

00:57:01.148 --> 00:57:03.025
Have you guys seen Ms. Bom today?

00:57:03.567 --> 00:57:04.944
No, I haven't.

00:57:05.027 --> 00:57:05.903
I haven't.

00:57:40.896 --> 00:57:41.855
Ms. Bom.

00:57:47.486 --> 00:57:49.029
Bom...

00:58:59.683 --> 00:59:02.394
And as a teacher, I feel so ashamed.

00:59:02.478 --> 00:59:04.980
Even if you don't believe me,
there's nothing I can do.

00:59:05.064 --> 00:59:06.065
But I hope you do.

00:59:06.648 --> 00:59:09.318
I'm sorry, Mom.
Please listen to me this time.

00:59:09.401 --> 00:59:11.820
Both Ms. Bom and I will be going to Seoul.

00:59:11.904 --> 00:59:12.905
Is it time already?

00:59:12.988 --> 00:59:14.990
What you're doing right now
is very dangerous.

00:59:15.074 --> 00:59:17.534
It's our last night.
So why not be a little dangerous?

00:59:17.618 --> 00:59:18.619
Something sparkly.

00:59:18.702 --> 00:59:20.245
Hey, Sun Jae-gyu!

00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:22.164
Mr. Sun?

00:59:22.247 --> 00:59:23.540
You're here, Ms. Bom?

00:59:31.048 --> 00:59:33.050
