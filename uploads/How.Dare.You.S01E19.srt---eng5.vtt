00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.990
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.030
[Episode 19]

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.240
What does it say?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.100
It's Yan language.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.190
The Emperor
is going to Mount Bei tomorrow.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.840
Someone wants to kill you.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.210
You can leave the city
through the west gate.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.160
Could our identities

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.300
have been exposed?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.110
Does he know
we're planning to kill the Emperor?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.090
That's impossible.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.670
If that were the case,

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.840
how could we still be

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.450
safe here at the posthouse?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.430
Could there be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.560
other compatriots hiding in the city,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.030
quietly aiding us?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.870
Or is this some kind of trap?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.560
[Capital of Xia]

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.550
[Zhao Wucheng,
Commander of the Imperial Guards]

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.810
Hurry up!

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.650
Keep up!

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.660
Hurry!

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.300
They withdrew many Imperial Guards.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.600
The Imperial Guards

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.870
are the Emperor's personal troops.

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.310
Pulling out so many at once?

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.610
Could it be that

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.260
Xiahou Dan really went to Mount Bei?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.960
Then aside from the Emperor,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.490
who else would want us dead?

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.120
The people of Great Xia are treacherous.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.450
We don't know if the note

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.120
is true or false.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.200
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.390
Stop the carriage!

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.920
Stop!

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.920
Well...

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.230
My Lord, are you alright?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.210
I'm fine.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.690
Did...

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.680
Did something

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680
just rush past?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.680
Did it?

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.650
I didn't see anything.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.810
This forest is huge.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.730
It was probably a small animal.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.090
Alright.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.250
Let's go.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.360
Steady the carriage.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.750
Yes.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.020
Let's go.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.830
Your Highness,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.560
at Mount Bei,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.000
Lord Cao has already made arrangements
with his men.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.260
As for Lord Mu, he's on his way
to the posthouse with his men.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.120
Thank you.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.800
Please, sit.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.120
Stop.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.440
My Lord,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.240
they have all left the city.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.340
Great.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.640
Remember,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.870
make a big scene later.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.240
Do you understand?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.560
Yes.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680
Once it's done,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.190
Her Majesty will reward you generously.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.120
I should thank Her Majesty.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.180
Thank you, My Lord.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.480
Move!

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.280
Move!

[Yixuan Inn]

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.950
Hurry up and get out of the way!

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.240
By order of the Empress Dowager.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.950
The envoy delegation
has violated the laws of Great Xia

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.480
and endangered the safety of its people.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.390
They are to be arrested immediately!

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.350
On His Majesty's command, we're here...

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.240
Anyone who resists

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.840
will be executed on the spot!

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.760
The letter was right.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.470
Someone wants to kill us.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.960
The Emperor's soldiers are fighting them.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.020
Your Highness,

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.020
should we charge out in the chaos?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.000
How many of them are here?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.030
Several dozen.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.850
The people of Great Xia
truly underestimated us.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.520
They think these few men

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.310
are enough to kill us all.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.800
It's hot.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.530
Let it cool down first.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.260
Once we deal with them,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.920
we'll come back and drink it slowly.

[Most of the assassins were killed or
injured. The plan went smoothly]

Excellent.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.590
He truly deserves his title
as the top fighter in Yan State.

Thank you.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.730
Satisfying!

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.590
We killed so many people of Great Xia.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.990
Let's see how that old
Emperor of Yan can still talk peace now.

what should we do next?

Change into their clothes

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.700
and take their weapons.

are going to Mount Bei!

carried by a fair wind.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.390
It seems this rain

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.360
is inevitable.

out of the city.

My Lord,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.850
I followed your order and...

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.840
I only gave one order today.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.750
That was to guard the gate as usual.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.430
Do you hear me?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:52.720
Yes.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.940
Watch the situation closely

and report any developments at once.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.910
My Lord, are you worried...

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.740
You never put all your eggs in one basket.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.390
Only Heaven knows

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.990
whether today we'll save the Emperor...

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.450
or be too late.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.960
A ceasefire and trade
between Yan and Great Xia

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.390
does Prince Duan no harm.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.480
No matter how you look at it,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.940
he has no reason
to sabotage the peace talks.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.960
So what detail have I missed?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.200
Your Highness, don't worry.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.750
His Majesty said if there's an emergency,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.550
he will send someone to tell you.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.320
Has Consort Xie
shown any unusual behavior?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.380
Consort Xie has been in her courtyard

all morning.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.670
She's been burning paper offerings
for her unborn child.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.470
She's burning them very slowly.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.440
It's more like she's toasting them

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:49.970
than burning them.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.120
Roasting them... with fire?

are secretly aiding them.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.270
We're going to save His Majesty.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.130
Your Highness,

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.080
His Majesty told us

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.000
that if there is any danger,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.870
we are to protect you

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.320
and ensure you do not leave the palace.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.080
The mountain must be crawling
with Prince Duan's men.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.750
Besides, you don't know martial arts.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.950
Even if you go there, it would be in vain.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.850
Can you mobilize the Imperial Guards?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.960
Only Prince Duan can do it.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.220
That's what I thought.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.240
Zhao Wucheng,
Commander of the Imperial Guards,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.910
has already been bought over
by Prince Duan.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.170
If we report it rashly,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.580
it will only alert him.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.150
There's no time to worry about that now.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.680
Bring out what we prepared.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.230
Your Highness,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.770
Consort Xie sent someone to deliver this.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.950
[Token]

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.380
Xie Yong'er?

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.100
That's it.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.200
You stay in the palace
and protect Consort Xie.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.800
The rest of you, come with me.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.880
The surroundings here
are indeed quite pleasant.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.080
I am glad you like it, Mother.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.630
Heaven bestows
the Five Virtues upon our people,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.750
including a mother's kindness
and a son's filial devotion.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.150
Now that the rain falls
to bless all things,

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.180
it is all thanks to Your Majesties.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.610
Walk with me.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.609
Are you alright?

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.390
There are soldiers hiding in the woods.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.460
They were already there
when we went up the mountain.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.880
It's a good thing
Wanyin didn't come along.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.330
Did you bring the thing?

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.550
What lovely weather.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.260
Son, you attend to countless affairs
and keep the realm in your heart.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:04.960
[Be Remembered with Honor for All Ages]

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.290
Despite such busyness,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.070
you still took the time
to inspect my mausoleum with me.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.750
I'm deeply moved.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.650
Look.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.070
Mount Bei

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.270
has pleasant scenery.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.350
This mausoleum is quite magnificent.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.160
Son,

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.920
you are thoughtful.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.160
All of this

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.550
is simply my duty.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.480
Indeed.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:37.640
My son

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.110
lingers in the harem

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.640
and busies himself
with the affairs of Great Xia.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.440
Now

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.510
he even has to worry about

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.080
matters of other states.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.860
Your duties truly

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.720
are too many.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.110
I can't help but worry for you.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:11.590
[Be Remembered with Honor for All Ages]

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.000
His Majesty's choice

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.660
of Mount Bei as the site

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.690
shows his remarkable insight.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.130
And with your abundant blessings,

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.070
it is a perfect match.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.680
Such maternal kindness and filial devotion

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.000
are a blessing

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.460
to the people of Great Xia.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:30.310
[Be Remembered with Honor for All Ages]

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.680
As long as my son is here,

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.490
of course it is a blessing
to the people of Great Xia.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.500
It's just that...

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.830
Now you've grown up,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.790
you have more and more

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.510
ideas of your own.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.720
While

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.110
I'm pleased,

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.740
I'm actually more worried about you.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:57.030
Mother,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.000
why do you say that?

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.810
Do you remember

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:02.960
Shanyi, the dancer?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.180
The one who tried to assassinate you.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:10.670
Alright.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.440
Let's not talk about it.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.000
It's just that

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.240
there's one thing I don't understand.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.350
Didn't that incident

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.590
already teach you a lesson?

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.000
Yet in what you've been doing
these past few days,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.530
I see signs of you
repeating the same mistake.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.170
Shanyi...

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.580
was originally sent here
as a dancer to perform.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.010
Why did she stay

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.150
and become my concubine?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.880
And why did she

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.070
attempt to assassinate me
at the cost of her own life

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.270
when she knew

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.050
it could never succeed?

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.770
Others might not know,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.300
but Mother,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.030
don't you know?

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.480
What are you implying?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.350
What I mean is that

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.530
a ceasefire and peace talks

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.250
benefit the people of Great Xia.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.830
Why are you

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.950
so unwilling to allow it?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.400
Yan State

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.120
lies in a harsh and barbarous land.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.240
They are

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.100
bloodthirsty

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.500
and incorrigible.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.980
You saw it yourself

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.920
at the Grand Longevity Banquet.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.400
Their greedy eyes and wild ambitions

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.800
were clear for all to see.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:34.920
Son,

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.400
surely you saw that too.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.830
Thank you

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.460
for your concern, Mother.

[Be Remembered with Honor for All Ages]

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.590
Forget it.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.270
Let's say no more.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.070
There is no point in saying more.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.240
I only hope the young Crown Prince doesn't
take after your temperament

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.120
and grow so stubborn.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.670
By the way,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.480
yesterday,

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.400
the young Crown Prince
mentioned you to me.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:07.580
He said

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.160
he missed his father.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.510
Go away!

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.000
Your Majesty,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.010
this is a reward from the Empress Dowager.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.640
Whether Xiahou Dan cooperates or not...

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.200
Don't come over!

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.070
He must give me...

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:21.440
Go away.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.920
A Crown Prince.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.210
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.810
From this day on,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.790
he shall be the one and only Crown Prince

of Great Xia.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.200
Yes.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.170
If you have some free time,

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.830
go see him

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.550
and check his studies.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.480
Things are unpredictable.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.790
If anything happens,

the Crown Prince

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.970
may have to take over the throne
temporarily.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.640
It's better to be prepared

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.140
in advance.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.510

Mother,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.930
did you suddenly say this today

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.070
because you think

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.310
he can now replace me

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.310
as your new puppet?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.170
Are you out of your mind?

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.470
You don't actually think

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.500
I would develop any fatherly affection
for him, do you?

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.890
What do you mean?

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.850
Where is the Imperial Astronomer?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.830
I am here.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.110
Check the feng shui

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.430
of the lower palaces,

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.510
the sacred paths,

and the stele pavilions nearby.

Look carefully.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.730
There must be no mistakes.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.590
Y-Yes,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.000
Your Majesty.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.070
Did you intercept any news?

Ma'am,

we have been stationed here

but no urgent messages
have arrived from the city.

It's already this hour.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.720
Lord Mu should have acted by now.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.170
How could there be no movement?

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:27.790
Guards!

Didn't Mu Yun send men to intercept them?

Assassins!

I wonder if His Majesty is safe.

His Majesty is in danger.

As his subject,

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.390
I must go save him.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:55.190
Right.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.740
What is this guy made of?

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.580
Iron and steel?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.550
Judging by your fighting skill,

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.550
you must be Tu'er,
the top fighter of Yan State, right?

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.550
That's right.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.860
I'm here to take
the Great Xia Emperor's head!

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.860
Who are you?

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.810
I'm just an ordinary servant

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.830
in the palace of Great Xia.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.440
You people of Great Xia are all talk!

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.780
Bring it on!

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.240
Come on.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.440
What's that?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.610
Nine Heavens Mystical Fire Repeating
Sleeve Crossbow!

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.990
Today,

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.350
either you die,

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:00.800
or I do.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.210
And who are you?

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.020
Mind your own business.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.130
Everyone, close in!

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.940
He can't aim!

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.270
Yeah, his aim's awful.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.050
Your Majesty, do it!

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.510
Do it, Your Majesty!

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.560
Your Majesty, watch your back!

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.700
Dan.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.560
What is it, Your Highness?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.410
Nothing.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.520
Keep moving.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:32.920
Dan.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.060
How are you?

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.940
Mr. Bei.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.650
Stop!

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.880
Restricted royal grounds.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.210
No unauthorized entry!

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.190
[Token]

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.770
It's our own people.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.300
What are you doing here?

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:00.720
[Token]

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.120
His Highness assigned us

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.590
to go up the mountain immediately.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.120
Make way.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.110
Let them pass.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.770
Over there!

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:43.860
Mr. Yang?

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.540
Your Highness?

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.000
What are you doing here?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
It's a long story.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.310
How are things on your side?

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.240
His Majesty is trapped at the mausoleum.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:51.810
The forest

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.790
is filled with Prince Duan's ambushers.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.070
I tried to go down the mountain
to fetch the Imperial Guards,

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.620
but was pursued by the ambushers.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.640
Thank you for saving me just now,
Your Highness.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.500
Your Highness!

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.490
Bad news!

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.920
Someone is catching up.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.510
Mr. Yang.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.920
Run east through the forest,

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.920
then head down the mountain. Hurry!

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.510
Your Highness,

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.790
what... what about you?

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.000
Don't worry, Mr. Yang.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.750
I have a plan.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.450
Mr. Yang.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.320
The safety of His Majesty

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.400
and the future of Great Xia

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.600
are entrusted to you.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.670
You must bring the Imperial Guards
to save him.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.640
I

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.190
am going!

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.900
Xiahou Dan.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:29.690
I'll be there soon.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.160
Hold on.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:32.690
I have to...

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:34.580
hold on.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.760
There is someone

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.670
waiting for me to go back.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.820
Zhang San's Diary.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:56.360
Long live the Emperor!

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.400
You may rise.
