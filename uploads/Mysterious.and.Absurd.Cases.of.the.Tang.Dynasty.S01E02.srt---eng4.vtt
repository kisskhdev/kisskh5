WEBVTT

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.800
What is inside my belly?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.200
Get out! Get out of me!

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.520
What is it?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.160
Get out!

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.560
No!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
Who are you?

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.800
Get out!

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.400
Who are you?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.520
Come out!

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.720
Get out!

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.600
Madam! Madam!

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.520
What is wrong?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.560
My husband.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.520
There is a ghost!

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.520
He has returned.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.960
He has returned.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.440
He has returned.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.120
There are no ghosts. Where would a ghost come from?

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.760
Listen to me.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.280
Hurry and drink this soothing medicine.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.160
Have a good sleep, and you will be fine.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.720
I cannot sleep.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.720
He... he is right inside my belly.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.160
He is right inside my belly.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.640
He wants to come out.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.480
Please, stop causing more trouble.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.760
A clear conscience fears no ghosts.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.200
You...

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.040
Madam.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.560
Jin'er was stillborn.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.960
Was it you?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.360
What do you mean?

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.520
We have been husband and wife for decades.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.240
You suspect me?

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.800
No, no, no, no.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.360
How could I suspect you?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.960
Come, drink the medicine.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.880
I will not drink it.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.760
I know that after all these barren years...

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.120
...you blame me.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.600
But for so many years...

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.800
...I have done so much for this family.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.920
Yet in your heart, there is only that Witch.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.600
Do you want to divorce me now?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.040
Is that why you are falsely accusing me?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.560
Madam.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.920
I have never suspected you.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.760
The manor has not been peaceful lately.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.840
Please do not make a scene.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.480
Rest well.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.320
I will fetch another dose of medicine.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.200
You feed me medicine every day.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.520
What are your intentions?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.960
You all want to kill me.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.520
You all want to kill me!

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.760
Li Niangu!

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.800
You might as well just kill me!

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.120
End it all once and for all.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.680
So you can elevate that Seductress to my place.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.880
Madam! Madam, do not!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.080
Do not!

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.680
You, take this to the side room.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.120
Hurry up, there's another one.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.640
Quick, quick, quick! And you!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.800
Go over there.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Hurry and bring me that water.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.520
Do you hear me?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.800
Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.680
Hurry up!

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.960
Take more.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.640
You, move this table over there.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.120
Why are you all standing around?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.520
Get moving, get moving!

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.560
Hurry, everyone is waiting!

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.840
Quick, quick, quick!

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.280
You two, go over there, over there.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.120
What's so interesting on the street?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.040
Do you also think...

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.920
...there is something wrong with Li Manor?

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.720
Mm-hmm.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.120
Li Manor is exceptionally busy today.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.680
A coffin.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.240
Li's wife, Madam Zhang, was frightened.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.520
The dead infant was dug up.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.360
Who is this coffin prepared for now?

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.600
Be careful.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.440
Did you hear that?

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.160
Hurry.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.480
Interesting.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.160
Let's go take a look.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.480
My Lord.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.720
What should we do about this?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.920
This guy...

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.280
...ate half my monthly salary by himself.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.960
I really can't do anything about him.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.280
Madam Zhang died a sudden, violent death.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.960
This matter is becoming increasingly bizarre.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.760
Could it be...

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280
...that there really are ghosts?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.080
With me here...

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.280
...what are you afraid of?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.920
The more bizarre things get...

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.360
...the more afraid Li Niangu becomes.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.360
That is only to our advantage.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.960
Then regarding this Ritual...

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.160
...we will rely on you, Divine Master.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.240
Rest assured.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.360
Will you need laborers for the burial?

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.800
No need.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.800
Thank you.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.560
Let's go.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.120
Someone has passed away...

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.400
...yet they set up a ritual hall instead of a mourning hall.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.760
Conducting a Ritual instead of funeral arrangements.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.280
Interesting.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.240
Acting Vice Minister.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.760
Please forgive my lack of manners.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.400
Mm.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.800
This is...

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.920
...my wife.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.600
She has just passed away.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.640
Since we are here...

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.000
...let us pay our respects together.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.200
That won't be necessary.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.160
Do not...

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.600
...taint yourself with that bad luck.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.440
Bad luck?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.920
Everyone must die eventually.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.000
Why speak of bad luck?

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.680
My Lords, you do not know the details.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.480
My wife...

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.840
...committed suicide by throat-slitting.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.080
Suicide by throat-slitting?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.640
Why?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.720
My wife has been repeatedly frightened recently.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.640
She was restless and anxious.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.400
Her spirit could not take it.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.520
Last night, it was as if she were possessed.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.440
Do you not find this matter suspicious, my Lord?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.480
To conclude Madam was merely frightened?

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.160
Suspicious?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.600
Where is the body?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.920
My Lord...

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.720
...follow me.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.760
Please.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.080
My Lord.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.520
I would not dare speak falsely.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.600
Please look.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.000
The sharp weapon entered here.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.080
Slitting the neck.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.120
Observe that the wound is deep at the start...

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.160
...and gradually becomes shallower.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.360
This is because blood loss and pain intensified...

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520
...causing the strength to gradually weaken.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.600
It matches the characteristics of suicide by throat-slitting.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.280
At first glance...

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.120
...there are no signs of poisoning.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.520
My Lord

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.000
Look

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:45.800
I told you so

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480
An infant's skull

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.880
Shouldn't scare someone like this

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.680
But Madam Zhang's pupils are dilated and bleeding

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.440
It is indeed a sign of death by fright

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.840
Then there must be another reason

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.480
However, the stillborn in Hong Xiu's womb

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.640
Must be related to Madam Zhang

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.760
Using this skull to lure out the ghost in Madam Zhang's heart

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.920
Was it Hong Xiu

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.080
Or someone else

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.240
Madam Zhang's body needs further examination

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.840
Truly a pair of master hands

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.720
To make this skull so realistic

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.640
But

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.720
Do children have this many teeth?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.080
Are you questioning my skills?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.040
How about I make one for you next time?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.560
No need, thanks

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.040
Really

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.120
Just let me carve one

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.200
Next time I'll help you

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:24.560
No need

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.440
No

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.000
No, no, no

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.240
You

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.840
Don't be so polite

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.560
Are we still investigating today or not?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.440
Close doors and windows

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.320
Guard against thieves

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.240
Close doors and windows

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.200
Guard against thieves

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.720
Qin Shitou

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.640
You are Qin Shitou

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.240
Ghost!

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.680
There's a ghost!
