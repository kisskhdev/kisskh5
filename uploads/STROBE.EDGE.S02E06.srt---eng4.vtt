WEBVTT

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.560
My heart can't help but insist I love Ren.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.270
I wouldn't want to pull those two apart.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.520
Everyone's so obsessed with Ren these days, aren't they?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.950
I like you, Takumi.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.120
Kinoshita, I like you.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.550
Even if there's someone else you like, I want you to choose me.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.080
Please don't give up on Ninako.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.910
[Finale]

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.180
You're not even a bit charmed.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.700
Sorry.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.390
Morning.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.380
Morning.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.670
What? You were with Takumi yesterday?

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.820
Yeah. He seemed seriously down in the dumps.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.550
Sounds like he'll be skipping school for a while, too.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.220
Really?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.850
You're early.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.190
Could you scram?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.630
I'm supposed to be meeting up with a girl.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.140
She won't be coming.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.450
Huh?

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.780
I asked if I could take her place.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.250
What?

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.260
Didn't things work out for you and Kinoshita?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.130
I was rejected. For good, this time.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.710
What about you?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.360
You confessed, so aren't the feelings mutual?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.220
She's been avoiding me the entire day.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.000
Why?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.540
Probably because I'm not the one for her.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.360
So you're just gonna give up?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.900
Are you?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.850
Yeah, I don't care anymore.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.980
I'll just go mess around with some other girls.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.130
Besides, acting earnest and devoted isn't my style.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.300
You know that's not true.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.480
Huh?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.410
You act all composed, while blazing ahead of me.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.930
And I watch over your desperate efforts from behind.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.430
That's where I belong.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.730
I knew, since the moment you first spoke to me.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.570
My place...

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.970
was right at your back.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.410
You're not acting like the Ando I look up to.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.410
So put on that confident swagger when you're around me.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.950
Damn it.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.590
Excuse me.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.280
I'm sorry for running my mouth the other day.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.620
I was only trying to get in your way.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.220
I didn't want you getting any closer to Ichinose.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.540
Okay.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.410
Let's put that behind us then.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.840
You still like him, don't you?

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.940
Will you tell him how you feel?

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.250
No.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.370
Ren and Ando's friendship was torn apart in the past.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.410
And I don't want to make it any worse.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.230
I didn't realize you were so self-centered, Ninako.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.770
I came to grab something I forgot...

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.260
Why were you sitting at my desk?

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.560
Wasn't I rejected?

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.700
I'm not letting you go until I get an answer.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.670
No! I have a lot on my mind right now!

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.720
I wasn't trying to corner you.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:19.480
No, that's not it. I was getting desperate.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.110
I wanted to see if my confession made you waver.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.330
Sorry.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.720
I made Ren apologize, when it wasn't even his fault.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.300
Why can't I give him an answer?

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.490
What am I so afraid of?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.430
There you are.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.810
I heard Mao told you all about my past with Ren.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.830
Do you pity me, for losing to Ren twice?

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.900
No...

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.160
Then are you trying to protect my friendship with Ren?

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.790
I never asked you to do that.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.130
You're only doing this for yourself.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.520
You feel like you're helping by holding yourself back.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.060
Why do you look so miffed? I'm on the mark, aren't I?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.520
I didn't realize your feelings for Ren were so shallow, Ninako.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.720
Don't worry, I'll get along peachy with Ren.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.800
So why not choose me instead?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.220
You're doing this on purpose.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.210
You're making yourself the bad guy.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.490
You're giving me an excuse to go see Ren.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.180
You're right. I was doing this for myself.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:08.160
I didn't want to be the person who broke you two apart.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.890
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.040
I'm sorry for making you act like this.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.950
I won't lie to the people who matter to me anymore.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.170
- I... I like...
- Say that to his face.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.830
Not to me.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.410
Go.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.850
Sprint, and you might just catch up to him.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.160
She never even turned to look back.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.090
What a nice guy.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.810
Shut up.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.700
Now it's my turn to go on the offensive.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.160
Get ready, because I'm coming after you with all my might.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.630
I won't be swayed so easily. Not anymore.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.790
I don't mind.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.050
That just means I get to prove how serious I am.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.470
I pushed him away once before.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.920
I was only ever protecting myself.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.010
Run!

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.460
Faster, so you can catch up to Ren!

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.800
Ren, I like you.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.500
I already have a girlfriend.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.230
Will you continue to be my friend regardless?

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.000
So you're quitting the part-time job?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.350
I'm trying to make more time for Mayuka now.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.520
Mayuka needs you right now, Ren.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:17.100
Remember when you said
I'd face my limits soon enough?

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.760
I think I'm coming to realize
what you were talking about.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.560
I thought your feelings would only trouble him.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.100
Ren and Ando treasure whatever bond they share.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.620
I can't stand to destroy it again.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.980
It bothers me when you're not feeling well.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.030
I don't like Ren anymore.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.230
I want to help you, in any way I can.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.940
I like you.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.740
I took plenty of detours to get here.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.150
I made just as many mistakes, too.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.240
But if there's one thing that hasn't changed...

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.440
It's how I feel about him.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.120
I want to spill my heart out to you, right now.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.870
- Ren!
- Kinoshita.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.050
I love him.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:02.670
Ren!

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:07.230
And I don't want him to just know it.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.010
- Kinoshita, I...
- Ren.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.150
There's something I want to tell you.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.220
I won't avoid the matter any more.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:31.260
When you confessed to me,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.220
I was so happy, I thought I was dreaming.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:41.210
But I couldn't give you an answer immediately.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:50.010
Because I was only trying to protect myself.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.880
So...

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.250
It's okay.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.220
Take your time, I'm listening.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:22.440
I was always trying hard, in all the wrong ways.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:29.200
I said I had a lot on my mind, but that's not true at all.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.350
I only have one thing on my mind.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.210
Ren, I like you.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.780
I like you.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.590
I want to be your number one.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.180
I want to call and text you just to chat.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.600
I want to share cakes with you at a cafe.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.840
And when I eat a bit too much, you'd laugh and forgive me.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.890
I want us to hold hands like it's second nature, and...

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.410
I like you too, Kinoshita.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.640
I love you.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.050
I love you, too.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.730
I love you too, Ren.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.780
Congrats, Ninako!

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.990
Thanks, you two!

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.110
So, who confessed first?

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.280
- Well...
- Come on, tell us.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.890
- That's a secret.
- Aw!

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.620
Ando.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.000
Ando.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.850
- Ando.
- Don't talk to me.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.520
I'm not in the mood to chat with you right now.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:59.790
Give me time to activate my pride, stupid Ren.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.450
- Ando.
- I told you -

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:06.450
That attitude of yours has always been my saving grace.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.410
Like I care, idiot.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.700
Hey, Takumi.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.510
Wanna come over today?

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.280
Sorry, but I'm quitting that lifestyle.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.850
I've gotta stay confident for a certain someone, you know?

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.090
Ritsuko!

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.110
I can't believe you seriously came to visit.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.670
I came to recharge my Ritsuko batteries.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.300
- Gross.
- Huh?

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.350
Don't act like my boyfriend after one kiss.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.120
Aw, man...

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.150
Wait up, Ritsuko!

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.470
[Ritsuko LOVE!]

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.670
For real?

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.870
So, when's the wedding?

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.310
Not funny, Dad.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.800
Right after we graduate.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.950
Someone's a bit too happy.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.790
- Am not.
- No need to be embarrassed.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:30.590
I currently have no interest in romance.
Work is far too much fun!

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.470
Mayuka is practically dating her job.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:38.570
But I do hope to fall in love again one day.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.510
Here you go, Mr. Moriya.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.090
- Kyoichi!
- Long time no see, sir.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.870
How was the cheer squad this year?

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:55.310
I worked with a team
that grew as people during our time together.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.490
Sir!

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.090
Yes, sir!

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:08.010
Excuse me. Could I get one iced latte, and a Takumi to go?

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.850
Love makes your chest squeeze.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.940
It makes your heart ache.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.660
It makes you feel tearful for no reason.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.500
It makes you feel like something is stabbing through your heart.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.980
Huh?

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.700
What do you mean, "huh"?

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.930
You wanted to hold hands like it was second nature.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.010
I know I'm the one who said it, but my heart still skipped a beat.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.910
Ren, does your throat squeeze when you're nervous, too?

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:02.090
I feel more of a tightness around my collarbones.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:06.840
Interesting. So that's how it feels for guys.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.510
Smells like a summer night.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.350
Why did you laugh?

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.870
I wasn't laughing.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:37.330
Don't lie, I saw you smirk.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.750
Then let's say it was for no reason.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.850
There's another one.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.130
Another reason to love him.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.330
[Epilogue]

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.700
Aw, man.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.790
I don't want today to end.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.850
Neither do I.
