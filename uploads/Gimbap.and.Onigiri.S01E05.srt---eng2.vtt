00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:19.082
He is someone who is
always helping me. Mr. Sakumoto.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:22.919
I had heard
that you were a former athlete.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.380
I think that it's amazing how you have

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:27.215
found another path for yourself,

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:30.176
even after ending
your career as an athlete.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:32.887
It's not something that everyone can do.

00:00:45.358 --> 00:00:49.487
{\an8}ITO - THANKS FOR TODAY.
MR. SAKUMOTO REALLY ENJOYED IT!

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.073
{\an8}ALSO, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:54.617
{\an8}BUT I MET
MIYAUCHI AT A WEDDING THE OTHER DAY.

00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:56.369
{\an8}SHE'S SO CUTE, AS ALWAYS.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:06.754
{\an8}YOU USED TO DATE MIYAUCHI, RIGHT?

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:14.345
{\an8}CLOSED

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.390
{\an8}I'm glad your sister was all right.

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:18.433
{\an8}Me too.

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:19.684
You were a lifesaver. Thanks.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:22.478
No worries.
It was just our regulars, anyway.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.232
I guess you can run this restaurant
without me now.

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.109
No, no, I can't.

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:29.652
I was panicking.

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:36.075
- Shige…
- Huh?

00:01:36.826 --> 00:01:39.913
Thank you for the other day.

00:01:42.332 --> 00:01:45.627
I appreciate you taking me to the market.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.254
It cheered me up.

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:49.380
Yeah?

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.342
Well, I'll ask for your help again.

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:53.760
- Of course.
- Okay.

00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:56.262
I'll get it.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.974
Hello, this is Tanomi.

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:03.311
I'm very sorry this is so sudden.

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:05.813
Thank you very much.

00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:08.358
Then I will visit before you open.

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:10.151
Thank you very much.

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:14.280
Miyauchi, are you open tomorrow at 17:00?

00:02:14.364 --> 00:02:16.074
I have one appointment.

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:18.534
I'm going to propose the idea
for the reception.

00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:21.412
I might not make it in time.

00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:22.580
Okay.

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:24.666
I'll give them an overview
while we're waiting.

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:27.001
What's the place called?

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.837
Tanomi. I sent you a link.

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:34.467
All right.
I'll head there as soon as I'm done.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.222
I took a look at your revised file.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:43.559
Separately,
each piece looks somewhat passable.

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:47.105
But as a whole,
it seemed incohesive to me.

00:02:48.648 --> 00:02:50.024
Incohesive?

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:54.278
Can it be that you don't have
a clear picture of the general theme?

00:02:54.362 --> 00:02:58.282
What is the message
you want to convey through this piece?

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:02.370
RISING BUBBLES,

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:07.542
The cultural festival is your chance
to promote your work before you graduate.

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:09.711
So try to work on it a little bit more.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.257
Okay. I'll think about it.

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:30.982
{\an8}OVERVIEW OF RECEPTION FOR CLIENTS

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:32.442
{\an8}We're holding a reception

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.987
{\an8}for our authors
and those we want to show appreciation to.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.699
I believe our guests
would be thrilled if we could

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:41.659
cater from your restaurant and serve

00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:44.704
the delicious food
that I always eat at Tanomi.

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:45.788
I see…

00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:47.957
I appreciate it.

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.169
It's an honor coming from you, Ms. Ishida.

00:03:51.252 --> 00:03:54.505
But we don't have
any experience in catering.

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:59.344
Plus, this is our regular working day.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:03.097
Taiga, what do you think about this?

00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:04.182
Huh?

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:08.019
I have done something like a soup kitchen

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:10.646
when I went to training camp for my club.

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:15.193
If we prepare for it well,
I don't think it will be impossible.

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:20.740
All right then, Ms. Ishida.

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:24.786
This is Hase, by the way.
How about we put him in charge?

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.955
Of course, I will oversee it with him too.

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:29.290
That's perfect.

00:04:29.374 --> 00:04:31.876
Okay, it's settled then.
Is that okay, Taiga?

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:35.254
Yes. I look forward to working with you.

00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:36.631
Thank you!

00:04:36.714 --> 00:04:38.091
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:41.135
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.723
This is Miyauchi,
the one in charge of this event.

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:46.641
Okay.

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:51.396
Taiga?

00:04:52.522 --> 00:04:54.482
- What?
- You know each other?

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.110
Oh, we went to college together.

00:04:57.193 --> 00:04:58.444
Oh yeah?

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.072
Excuse me.

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.617
- My name is Miyauchi Masumi.
- Hello.

00:05:05.326 --> 00:05:07.036
We will be in your care.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.455
I look forward to working with you.

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.291
Well then, that makes things easier.

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:13.418
- True.
- Hello.

00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:14.544
- Yeah.
- Hello.

00:05:14.627 --> 00:05:16.129
We'll be in your care.

00:06:24.405 --> 00:06:26.490
A publishing company's party, huh?

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:28.409
That sounds cool.

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:29.535
Thanks.

00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:31.787
She's our regular customer,

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:34.790
and Shige said
that he'll leave it up to me,

00:06:34.874 --> 00:06:36.542
so I want to give it my all.

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:38.502
I see.

00:06:39.003 --> 00:06:41.088
It might be a lot of work,
but do your best.

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:43.216
Thanks.

00:06:44.217 --> 00:06:45.927
About the menu…

00:06:46.427 --> 00:06:48.054
Aside from the light refreshments,

00:06:48.137 --> 00:06:50.848
I'm thinking about serving
a nutritious, warm soup.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:54.936
What about dak gomtang?

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.104
Dak gomtang?

00:07:02.777 --> 00:07:05.154
This might be easy to eat.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.781
Interesting…

00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:09.700
ENERGIZE YOURSELF
WITH THE CHICKEN SOUP - DAK GOMTANG

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:11.786
RECIPE - TWO TO THREE SERVINGS

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:13.621
This is great.

00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:15.248
Thank you, Rin.

00:07:15.748 --> 00:07:17.291
I need to work hard too.

00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:26.759
Are you working on your piece
for the cultural festival?

00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:28.886
Yeah.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.056
But I'm kind of having
a difficult time with it.

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:33.808
I see…

00:07:34.684 --> 00:07:37.186
I wish I could do something to help.

00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:38.563
{\an8}SALMON FILLETS PEEK OUT

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:39.897
{\an8}I'm hungry.

00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:43.609
Baegopa?

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:48.823
I'm hungry.

00:07:52.368 --> 00:07:53.494
That's it.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.330
Something I can do for you.

00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:03.129
Onigiri.

00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:05.506
Yay!

00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:10.261
Let me see…

00:08:15.683 --> 00:08:20.146
A lot of people are going to be there
at your cultural festival, right?

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:21.147
Yeah.

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:24.567
I guess professional artists
are going to be there too.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:28.738
Apparently, the cultural festival has
opened up opportunities for many people.

00:08:29.572 --> 00:08:30.865
I see.

00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:35.578
So in order to achieve
some kind of success before graduation,

00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:38.247
this piece I'm working on
is really important.

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:41.292
Graduation…

00:08:56.098 --> 00:08:59.518
I'm sure you'll be able to find
the answer you're looking for.

00:09:02.772 --> 00:09:03.856
Yeah…

00:09:08.903 --> 00:09:10.780
Okay, it's ready.

00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:21.248
Thank you for the food.

00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:22.291
Enjoy.

00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:27.713
It's warm. It's so comforting.

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:39.016
If I find a job in Japan,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.435
I might be able to be with you longer.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.981
What?

00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:48.734
What?

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:54.782
Forget what I said.
Oh, that reminds me. The flyer!

00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:56.492
The flyer…

00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:57.868
There it is.

00:09:58.494 --> 00:10:00.830
Can you post this at your restaurant?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.164
Okay.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:04.917
TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF FINE ARTS FESTIVAL

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.377
It's the same…

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.298
It's on the same day
as the event that I just told you about.

00:10:12.508 --> 00:10:13.718
Oh…

00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:18.389
Well, I guess
there's nothing we can do about that.

00:10:20.182 --> 00:10:23.352
When it's complete,
show me your artwork, okay?

00:10:24.854 --> 00:10:25.771
Okay.

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:12.318
Oh my god!

00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:14.904
I'm only 10% finished.

00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:18.908
I just decided on my motif too.

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:22.536
You still have time. No need to rush.

00:11:23.037 --> 00:11:26.332
Amane, you're already done, aren't you?

00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:27.416
Yeah.

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:29.376
So fast…

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:32.880
So, what are you doing after you graduate?

00:11:34.173 --> 00:11:37.718
I got a couple of offers,
but I'm still deciding.

00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:40.012
Mitsuki, you're going into gaming?

00:11:40.095 --> 00:11:42.806
The job offer will be revoked
if I can't graduate, though.

00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:47.811
Rin, you're going back to Korea, right?

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:51.941
Actually, I haven't really decided yet.

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:53.359
Really?

00:11:53.943 --> 00:11:58.739
I wonder if it's too late
to find a way to stay in Japan?

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:03.160
Try going to Career Services.
You can get a consultation.

00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:06.497
- Thanks. I'll try going.
- Yeah.

00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:12.962
In your case,
it will be important to find a company

00:12:13.045 --> 00:12:15.464
that will support your visa application.

00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:18.592
Are there any job listings
for animation companies?

00:12:18.676 --> 00:12:20.594
Check that bulletin board over there.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.223
Those are all listings
catering to international students.

00:12:24.306 --> 00:12:26.058
JOB LISTINGS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.824
JOB OPENING

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.452
Are you proposing
to Onigiri Man or something?

00:12:45.536 --> 00:12:49.039
No, I'm not. Where did that come from?

00:12:49.123 --> 00:12:53.002
Why are you looking for a job in Japan?

00:12:53.085 --> 00:12:55.004
Because you want to be with him, right?

00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:59.133
Or what? Do you seriously
just want to work over there?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.553
Well…

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:06.348
At this rate,
I'll end up listening to my mom

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:08.726
and giving up on my dream.

00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:12.104
Let me ask you this.

00:13:13.022 --> 00:13:14.940
What is the most important to you?

00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:16.358
Animation?

00:13:16.442 --> 00:13:17.568
Onigiri Man?

00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:19.153
Your mom?

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:21.447
I can't answer that so suddenly…

00:13:25.492 --> 00:13:28.662
I don't know. They're all important.

00:13:31.123 --> 00:13:34.168
Sorry. I have to attend a meeting now.
Talk to you later.

00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:35.085
LEE YUNGYEOL EXITED THE ROOM

00:13:35.169 --> 00:13:36.086
Hey, wait…

00:13:47.264 --> 00:13:52.603
{\an8}RÉSUMÉ

00:13:57.983 --> 00:14:02.154
It's nice and colorful,
and each bite leaves you satisfied.

00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:04.198
Thank you.

00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:06.367
This daikon can use

00:14:07.534 --> 00:14:09.995
a little more salt
if you want it to stay fresh longer.

00:14:10.996 --> 00:14:12.373
Okay.

00:14:12.456 --> 00:14:15.167
All right, that is all the input I have.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.545
Can I use the kitchen a little bit longer?

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:20.339
Sure, but don't wear yourself out.

00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:23.759
I have to go too.
What about you, Miyauchi?

00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:27.513
I want to go over the logistics with him.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.306
Well then, goodbye.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.141
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:35.688
First of all, let's talk about the venue.

00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:37.648
Okay.

00:14:42.903 --> 00:14:44.863
Okay, this is too awkward.

00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:48.659
I agree.

00:14:48.742 --> 00:14:50.911
Who would have thought I'd meet you here?

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:52.830
- What a surprise.
- Yeah.

00:14:53.914 --> 00:14:56.083
Well, since this is for work,

00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:58.794
let's not walk on eggshells
around each other.

00:14:59.586 --> 00:15:01.463
- Okay. Thanks.
- Okay.

00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:05.050
So about the layout
for the day of the event…

00:15:05.134 --> 00:15:05.968
‪Yeah?

00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:09.555
I'm thinking of putting a table here
where you can cook.

00:15:12.057 --> 00:15:13.976
- This is just a suggestion, but…
- Yeah?

00:15:14.643 --> 00:15:16.603
Is there space for a portable stove?

00:15:18.063 --> 00:15:19.440
All right.

00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:21.608
What do you think?

00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:34.538
What in the world… This is great.

00:15:36.999 --> 00:15:38.792
Wow, thanks.

00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:41.628
Want to eat lunch?

00:15:42.504 --> 00:15:43.380
Yeah.

00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:45.841
Japanese sake…

00:15:46.717 --> 00:15:48.510
Oh, where's Taiga today?

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:51.472
What?
Oh, I had him pick things up at the store.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:53.974
That reminds me.

00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:58.395
- He told me to give this to you, Noa.
- Huh?

00:15:58.479 --> 00:15:59.480
{\an8}TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF FINE ARTS FESTIVAL

00:15:59.563 --> 00:16:00.439
What's this?

00:16:00.522 --> 00:16:03.025
Rin's school is having
a cultural festival, apparently.

00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:06.403
Now he's even advertising for her, huh?

00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:08.322
{\an8}KAPPABASHI DOUGUGAI STREET

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:25.672
Wow…

00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:28.509
There it is.

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:37.810
What's this?

00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:46.777
How are you, Rin?

00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:53.450
Who is that old man? Where are you?

00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:55.035
Kappabashi.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:58.872
It's a place where they sell
a bunch of kitchenware and tableware.

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:01.125
It's my first time coming here.

00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:05.045
There's something similar in Korea.

00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:07.798
It's called Hwanghak-dong.

00:17:08.298 --> 00:17:10.884
They sell frying pans
and glassware and stuff.

00:17:10.968 --> 00:17:13.011
Oh yeah? Hwanghak-dong?

00:17:14.555 --> 00:17:16.807
If you're ever there, show it to me.

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:18.934
Show you Hwanghak-dong?

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:21.687
Sure.

00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:29.528
No matter where you go,

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:34.283
let's share what we're seeing,
just like we are now, and go on dates.

00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:37.327
What?

00:17:38.162 --> 00:17:41.582
There's no time difference,
so we can talk to each other anytime.

00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:49.923
If both of us try our best,
even if we're far apart,

00:17:50.424 --> 00:17:52.509
I don't think we'll be lonely.

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:54.011
- I know, right?
- Yeah!

00:17:54.094 --> 00:17:56.638
- I'm wearing print on print.
- That's too much!

00:17:56.722 --> 00:18:00.142
Sorry, you have class, huh?
I'll call you tonight.

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:01.476
Okay.

00:18:08.984 --> 00:18:11.570
You don't care if we're far apart, do you?

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.997
JUN-HO - DID YOU EAT ALREADY?

00:18:23.957 --> 00:18:25.292
"No matter where I go"?

00:18:26.293 --> 00:18:28.587
Why is he assuming that I'm going away?

00:18:30.088 --> 00:18:31.381
You're an international student…

00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:37.221
I know, but doesn't he want to be with me?

00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:42.726
He can't just tell you to stay in Japan.
That would be irresponsible.

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:48.982
I'm not talking about responsibility.

00:18:49.066 --> 00:18:52.110
I just want to know how Taiga truly feels.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.456
I know.
Taiga is an honest and sincere guy.

00:19:05.415 --> 00:19:09.378
He's not the type
to thoughtlessly say things like that.

00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:12.422
But still…

00:19:15.884 --> 00:19:16.927
Rin.

00:19:18.595 --> 00:19:22.140
Right now, the most important thing
is to think about what you want

00:19:22.224 --> 00:19:23.809
to do with your future, right?

00:19:23.892 --> 00:19:25.394
You can think about him after that.

00:19:30.148 --> 00:19:32.025
You came to Japan
to study animation, right?

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:35.570
‪Right…

00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:41.034
Well then, do your best.

00:19:41.576 --> 00:19:44.538
I'm looking forward
to your cultural festival, too.

00:19:45.247 --> 00:19:47.416
For now, focus on your artwork.

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:50.294
Okay?

00:19:52.587 --> 00:19:53.797
You're right.

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:57.968
I should be focusing
on what's in front of me first.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:04.474
Master, I am deeply grateful.

00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:08.520
{\an8}Is that so?

00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:10.731
{\an8}Should you need more assistance,
you may ask me.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.505
- Taiga.
- Huh?

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:40.302
The cooking space
that I was talking about…

00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:47.851
{\an8}10 MINUTES - GAMEY

00:20:47.934 --> 00:20:49.936
{\an8}20 MINUTES - NOT GAMEY - NOT ENOUGH COLOR

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.938
{\an8}30 MINUTES

00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:16.963
UPLOAD COMPLETE

00:21:31.311 --> 00:21:33.730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.774
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:21:35.857 --> 00:21:38.610
- Here you go.
- We have postcards here.

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:40.779
- Please take a look.
- Enjoy.

00:21:58.588 --> 00:22:03.135
{\an8}TAIGA - I'M SORRY I CAN'T GO TODAY
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT

00:22:16.314 --> 00:22:17.441
Mr. Hase.

00:22:17.941 --> 00:22:20.235
It's almost time.

00:22:20.318 --> 00:22:21.778
We'll be in your care.

00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:23.947
Yes.

00:22:24.865 --> 00:22:29.661
{\an8}RECEPTION - MEIYOSHA

00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:33.957
Noa, you're off work?

00:22:34.708 --> 00:22:36.918
Yes, I forgot to add another shift.

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:46.386
{\an8}HOW IS IT GOING TODAY?

00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:51.474
{\an8}AKINORI - IN LINE AT THE PACHINKO PARLOR
MIGHT NEED YOU LATER

00:23:00.108 --> 00:23:01.943
TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF FINE ARTS FESTIVAL

00:23:02.027 --> 00:23:05.822
I redrew the moment
the character falls, over and over again,

00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:08.658
and adjusted the timing
until the very last minute.

00:23:08.742 --> 00:23:11.286
So when I heard the audience laugh,
I felt very happy.

00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:13.997
Your experimentation with the timing
really paid off.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.002
Well then, please give her
another round of applause.

00:23:26.801 --> 00:23:29.554
Next up, is Ms. Park Rin.

00:23:33.642 --> 00:23:34.976
You can do it, Rin!

00:23:46.404 --> 00:23:49.532
I am Park Rin, a second-year
in the Department of Animation.

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:52.744
The title is Onigiri.

00:23:53.245 --> 00:23:55.121
I hope you enjoy it.

00:23:55.997 --> 00:23:57.832
Thank you for watching.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.931
TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF FINE ARTS
DEPARTMENT OF ANIMATION

00:24:13.014 --> 00:24:15.934
ONIGIRI - PARK RIN

00:25:33.386 --> 00:25:35.096
Where do you want to go?

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.890
I want to go see

00:25:36.973 --> 00:25:38.892
- that pretty blue artwork.
- Me too.

00:25:50.028 --> 00:25:52.447
{\an8}ONIGIRI

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.656
{\an8}Noa?

00:25:57.619 --> 00:25:58.453
{\an8}Hello.

00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:01.164
I didn't know you came.

00:26:02.248 --> 00:26:05.168
I got a flyer at Tanomi.

00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:06.586
And I had time, so…

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:09.547
What did you think?

00:26:12.717 --> 00:26:17.806
Well, it's so different from
the world that I live in.

00:26:17.889 --> 00:26:19.641
So it was new and exciting.

00:26:24.729 --> 00:26:25.855
Is she your friend?

00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:31.152
She's Noa,
a regular at Taiga's restaurant.

00:26:32.487 --> 00:26:33.738
Hello.

00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:35.740
I'm Rin's senior from college.

00:26:36.324 --> 00:26:37.492
Kang Jun-ho.

00:26:40.954 --> 00:26:43.915
We have to celebrate tonight,
since you worked so hard.

00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:46.668
Want to come too, Noa?

00:26:47.335 --> 00:26:49.629
No, it's okay. I have to go to work.

00:26:51.673 --> 00:26:53.007
I'm sorry.

00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:55.427
I promised to meet Taiga today.

00:26:56.219 --> 00:26:57.387
Promised?

00:26:58.221 --> 00:27:00.223
We're going to have
an afterparty together.

00:27:03.768 --> 00:27:06.604
I see. Another time, then.

00:27:08.314 --> 00:27:09.566
Thank you.

00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:10.900
- Thank you.
- Hello.

00:27:10.984 --> 00:27:12.527
Thank you.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.655
Hello.

00:27:27.667 --> 00:27:31.087
- Even the background is calculated.
- What artists have inspired you?

00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:33.047
I wasn't inspired by anyone.

00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:35.508
I imagined everything in my mind.

00:27:35.592 --> 00:27:37.218
- Of course.
- Amazing.

00:27:37.302 --> 00:27:39.596
I bet all the studios want you.

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:41.973
I've never seen a student
with this much talent.

00:27:42.056 --> 00:27:43.600
- I agree.
- True.

00:27:44.726 --> 00:27:45.977
She's amazing.

00:27:46.936 --> 00:27:48.313
Ms. Park Rin?

00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:50.815
Yes?

00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:53.985
I saw your film.

00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:55.570
It was very interesting.

00:27:58.448 --> 00:27:59.991
Thank you very much.

00:28:00.074 --> 00:28:03.995
You have a very unique perspective.

00:28:04.078 --> 00:28:07.707
Also, the characters were very cute.

00:28:10.001 --> 00:28:11.961
You like Onigiri?

00:28:12.545 --> 00:28:14.881
Yes, I do.

00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:16.799
I see.

00:28:18.676 --> 00:28:23.640
I've posted my past works
on my social media.

00:28:23.723 --> 00:28:24.641
If you'd like…

00:28:24.724 --> 00:28:26.601
Thank you. I'll take a look at them.

00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:36.903
Thank you.

00:28:45.203 --> 00:28:46.162
Here you go.

00:28:49.707 --> 00:28:50.959
This is so good.

00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:53.461
Soup really hits the spot
at these kinds of events.

00:28:54.629 --> 00:28:57.590
It's such a comforting and warm flavor.

00:28:59.968 --> 00:29:02.345
- I came back for seconds.
- Thank you.

00:29:03.513 --> 00:29:05.056
This is really good.

00:29:05.139 --> 00:29:06.266
Yes.

00:29:06.349 --> 00:29:08.268
- It's called dak gomtang.
- Oh I see.

00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:13.773
- Want to sing together?
- Really? I'd love that!

00:29:13.857 --> 00:29:14.983
I'd love that!

00:29:17.318 --> 00:29:18.236
Here you go.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.911
Jun-ho, are you Rin's ex-boyfriend
or something?

00:29:30.707 --> 00:29:31.583
Of course not!

00:29:32.959 --> 00:29:36.921
If I was her ex,
I would never go to see her like that.

00:29:37.005 --> 00:29:40.174
Really? What's the big deal?

00:29:40.258 --> 00:29:41.759
It's unacceptable

00:29:42.302 --> 00:29:46.055
to hang out with your ex
when you're dating someone new.

00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:48.808
Interesting…

00:29:48.892 --> 00:29:50.351
You're pretty strict, huh?

00:29:50.435 --> 00:29:54.355
When you're dating,
trust is everything, after all.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.276
Trust, huh?

00:30:00.528 --> 00:30:02.113
Noa…

00:30:02.196 --> 00:30:06.242
Why aren't you checking your phone?
I was on a roll today, you know?

00:30:06.326 --> 00:30:07.410
Sorry.

00:30:08.202 --> 00:30:09.412
Water, please.

00:30:13.374 --> 00:30:14.709
What's wrong?

00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:16.920
Were you dumped by a girl or something?

00:30:18.546 --> 00:30:20.131
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:21.174
Oh?

00:30:23.134 --> 00:30:24.636
You're the one from the other day…

00:30:29.557 --> 00:30:30.391
You know each other?

00:30:30.475 --> 00:30:32.477
Cheers!

00:30:38.232 --> 00:30:39.442
That's good.

00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:41.069
I see.

00:30:41.152 --> 00:30:44.447
So hyeongnim means older brother?

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.284
Even if it's not your real brother,
you can use it for good friends.

00:30:48.368 --> 00:30:49.827
Interesting.

00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:52.830
I love that.

00:30:53.539 --> 00:30:55.792
I'm an only child, after all.

00:30:56.292 --> 00:30:59.295
If only I had an older brother like you…

00:31:00.254 --> 00:31:01.089
I can only wish.

00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:05.718
What are you saying?

00:31:05.802 --> 00:31:07.887
We had drinks together,
so we're basically brothers.

00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:12.475
Hyeongnim! I'll be in your care!

00:31:13.851 --> 00:31:16.187
I'm happy to have
a dongsaeng in Japan now.

00:31:18.147 --> 00:31:20.108
- Hyeongnim!
- Dongsaeng!

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.160
- Did you really--
- So good!

00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:34.664
Your cooking is the best!

00:31:35.248 --> 00:31:36.332
It was so delicious!

00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:38.751
Thank you.

00:31:39.836 --> 00:31:42.922
The party was a success, huh?
That's great.

00:31:45.174 --> 00:31:49.387
There's a lot I need to improve on,
but I felt a strong sense of fulfillment.

00:31:50.304 --> 00:31:52.140
What does "fulfillment" mean again?

00:31:53.182 --> 00:31:54.183
Um…

00:31:55.268 --> 00:31:57.353
Like a feeling of accomplishment.

00:31:58.104 --> 00:32:02.525
The excitement you feel when you
succeed in doing what you needed to do.

00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:10.199
{\an8}Rin, you're the amazing one.
I can't believe you made this.

00:32:14.203 --> 00:32:17.540
My classmate was getting
a lot more recognition.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.876
But…

00:32:21.544 --> 00:32:24.213
I put in everything
that I could right now.

00:32:26.466 --> 00:32:27.633
That's why…

00:32:28.634 --> 00:32:31.054
I will pat myself on the back for now.

00:32:33.014 --> 00:32:34.724
- That's right.
- Yup.

00:32:41.355 --> 00:32:43.066
I thought about it…

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:46.069
Just like you said,

00:32:47.028 --> 00:32:50.948
if we try our best to share
everything with each other,

00:32:52.492 --> 00:32:56.871
we won't be lonely
even if we're far apart…

00:32:58.122 --> 00:32:59.582
I think.

00:33:13.012 --> 00:33:14.514
Yeah…

00:33:16.682 --> 00:33:17.558
Let's try our best.

00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:26.943
Rin…

00:33:28.027 --> 00:33:32.448
One thing on your bucket list was
"drinking ramune at a hot spring," right?

00:33:33.699 --> 00:33:34.909
Yeah.

00:33:37.745 --> 00:33:42.250
Now that we're finally not so busy,
why don't we celebrate

00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:43.960
and go on a trip?

00:33:44.627 --> 00:33:47.088
Let's drink ramune at a hot spring.

00:33:52.927 --> 00:33:54.220
I'd love that.

00:34:16.075 --> 00:34:19.203
{\an8}Mr. Hase's food was a great hit!

00:34:19.287 --> 00:34:21.122
{\an8}- We need to work together again.
- Yes.

00:34:21.873 --> 00:34:23.583
- Right?
- All right, let's drink tonight.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.793
Oh, that reminds me.

00:34:25.877 --> 00:34:30.756
A customer gave me
some good sake, so I chilled it.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.633
Hey, Master.

00:34:32.717 --> 00:34:35.136
Why are you trying to get me drunk?

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.556
Reiko, let's give this back to them.

00:34:39.223 --> 00:34:40.975
Tanukichi!

00:34:41.976 --> 00:34:44.854
- Let's go home.
- I'm going home.

00:34:44.937 --> 00:34:46.856
- Take me.
- Thank you very much.

00:34:46.939 --> 00:34:49.233
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Get home safe.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.034
TANOMI

00:34:58.117 --> 00:34:59.535
Up we go.

00:35:02.288 --> 00:35:03.289
Good work.

00:35:07.752 --> 00:35:09.337
Masumi?

00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:13.341
My answer?

00:35:15.927 --> 00:35:17.053
The art instructor position?

00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:18.346
Yes.

00:35:18.429 --> 00:35:22.058
It'll be rude to make them
wait any longer.

00:35:22.141 --> 00:35:26.229
And plus,
you have no other options, right?

00:35:26.312 --> 00:35:27.521
That's not…

00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:28.356
‪NUMAZU PORT, UCHIURA PORT
‪LOCAL FISH THAT'S IN SEASON

00:35:28.439 --> 00:35:31.067
Please just give me a little more time.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.368
{\an8}TO: STUDIO JUPITET
RÉSUMÉ INCLUDED

00:35:54.715 --> 00:35:56.217
I sent it.

00:36:13.776 --> 00:36:15.945
{\an8}You don't have to be so on guard.

00:36:17.488 --> 00:36:20.741
{\an8}But I guess, who wouldn't be,
if your ex-girlfriend ambushes you?

00:36:21.617 --> 00:36:23.035
{\an8}That's not it…

00:36:25.705 --> 00:36:29.250
{\an8}I wanted to apologize to you.

00:36:30.209 --> 00:36:32.712
{\an8}For saying a lot
of condescending stuff to you back then.

00:36:33.879 --> 00:36:35.464
{\an8}I'm really sorry.

00:36:35.548 --> 00:36:36.966
{\an8}Wait, wait, what?

00:36:38.009 --> 00:36:41.887
{\an8}Back then, as in when we were dating?

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:43.931
{\an8}Yeah.

00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:47.310
{\an8}That was…

00:36:48.227 --> 00:36:50.479
{\an8}my fault for dwelling on the past.

00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:52.565
{\an8}That's not true.

00:36:53.274 --> 00:36:55.192
{\an8}I was overwhelmed myself.

00:36:56.319 --> 00:37:00.156
{\an8}I had just started working
and all I could think about

00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:04.368
{\an8}was my future and "planning my life."

00:37:08.497 --> 00:37:09.665
But right now,

00:37:10.499 --> 00:37:14.462
I kind of understand how you felt.

00:37:16.672 --> 00:37:17.840
What?

00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:23.596
The thing is, I'm dating a girl right now.

00:37:24.513 --> 00:37:26.307
She's from Korea.

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:30.353
Oh yeah?

00:37:33.647 --> 00:37:37.026
She's planning on returning home
in a few months,

00:37:38.402 --> 00:37:39.612
but…

00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:42.865
Sometimes I wonder if
I would be able to tell her

00:37:43.991 --> 00:37:46.869
something different
if I had a clearer vision of my future.

00:37:52.166 --> 00:37:56.504
But I guess I just have to do my best,
one thing at a time.

00:38:03.886 --> 00:38:06.722
Taiga, you've changed.

00:38:15.689 --> 00:38:16.524
‪How?

00:38:17.942 --> 00:38:18.776
You look old.

00:38:20.486 --> 00:38:21.612
‪Come on…

00:38:21.695 --> 00:38:24.657
- That goes for you too.
- Not at all.

00:38:33.791 --> 00:38:37.253
Why wouldn't you turn down
a job offer from your ex-girlfriend?

00:38:37.336 --> 00:38:39.880
{\an8}I wish you would've accepted it,
even just for a second.

00:38:39.964 --> 00:38:43.050
{\an8}Sorry. I can't keep up with you.

00:38:43.134 --> 00:38:44.009
