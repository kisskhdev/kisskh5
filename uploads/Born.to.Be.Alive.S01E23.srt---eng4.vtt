[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.210
[Episode 23]

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:44.670
Is it the two towns

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.330
that lost their water supply?

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.420
Yes.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.330
We found the cause.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.590
Large-scale mining

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.259
will

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.170
definitely affect

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.500
the groundwater table.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.350
Sand and gravel

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.170
extraction

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.600
widens the river channel

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.150
and increases its drainage capacity.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.320
So the river reaches

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.910
the dry season earlier

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.760
and drops to lower-than-normal levels.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.420
Simply put,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.210
it could lead

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.760
to groundwater depletion.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.690
A bit late for that, isn't it?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.300
Why didn't you say that earlier?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.190
It was in a geography exam.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.050
But I only remembered when I saw it.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.170
I've always said

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.310
that you should come out here

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.680
to take the exam.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.060
Once we seize the gold mine,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.120
the 90,000 they owe us

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.180
have to be taken

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.140
from their gold.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.460
You really are

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.660
obsessed with money.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.430
90,000?

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.880
That's too little.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.140
Let's take them down

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.440
and grab all the gold.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:36.970
I agree.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.300
Sangba.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.580
Go back

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.370
and take the map and the note

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.530
to County Mayor Lin.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.910
And get armed police

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.650
and public security personnel here
as soon as possible.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.330
A round trip

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.760
takes at least four days.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.890
We'll wait for you here.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.500
Okay, Captain.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.230
Don't worry.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.120
Give them a submachine gun.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.170
Here's an extra barrel of gas.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.500
You can drink it if you run out of water.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.390
You jinx.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.300
You're giving me this much;

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.970
you won't have enough.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.300
We don't have enough gas
to go back anyway.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.360
Sangba.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.579
We're all counting on you.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.620
Got it.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.680
Okay.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.620
Tell me.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.880
Why don't you eat meat?

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.430
Haven't you heard it from them?

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.450
I want to hear it from you.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.610
I used to hunt antelopes, you know?

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.780
I hunted so many

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.440
that I lost count.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.210
One day,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.620
in the Uninhabited Zone,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.930
I got caught in a heavy snowstorm

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.870
and fell into a snow pit.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.300
Do you know

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.970
what it means to fall

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.830
into a snow pit?

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:51.120
Then how

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.060
did you survive?

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.550
Tibetan antelopes
are very afraid of humans.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.350
In that snow pit,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.330
there were many of them

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.390
huddled together.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.100
I fell right into the middle of them.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.570
Maybe they were afraid of dying, too.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.370
They surrounded me tightly.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.070
Later,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.240
I was saved by the Mountain Patrol.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.870
Since then,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.780
I've never eaten meat again.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.630
How can you steal?

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.890
How can you steal?

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.270
I...

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.290
How can you steal?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.960
I only have a little left.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.390
Nonsense.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.710
I saw a huge bottle

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.720
under your bed.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500
That big bottle is off-limits.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.230
I'm saving that for my wedding.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.290
You've been on so many blind dates.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.510
You'll never

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.510
get a chance to drink it.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.830
You...

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.860
You jinx!

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.680
Ask Captain.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.480
You jinx!

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.150
Zhacuo!

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.870
Bai!

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.830
Hand it over.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.540
He Qingyuan.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.950
Be generous.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.690
If you keep hiding the wine,

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.250
how will you ever find a wife?

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.630
Let's make an exception today.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.490
Everyone has a drink.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.900
Great.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.960
Okay.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.380
Nice wine, Han.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.970
It's good.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.970
I only grab it. I don't drink.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.600
Captain.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.930
Smells great.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.190
Here.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.070
Shao.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.500
Come on, have a sip.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.610
You wasted it.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.980
What's there to fight over it?

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.250
You...

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.040
If you're not drinking,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.190
why waste it?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.520
It tastes bad.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.370
Look here.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.720
Victory is in sight.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.370
Let's look to the future.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.700
Let me interview you.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.360
Deputy Captain He,

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.350
you go first.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.820
What should I say?

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.640
After the gold mine is closed

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.130
and the nature reserve is established,

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.520
what are your plans?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.980
Of course, I'll stay in the reserve

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.980
and keep working.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.720
We'll be well-equipped then.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.500
We'll have so many jeeps,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.360
we won't be able to count them all.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.420
As for me,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.390
I'll sit in the office,

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.450
drink tea,

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.070
and keep the books.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.130
Just thinking about it is wonderful.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.790
Zhacuo, what about you?

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:48.960
Me?

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.620
My dad wants me to go back and herd sheep.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.930
But I think

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.020
herding Tibetan antelopes

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.350
is pretty much the same.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.850
I'll gather the sick ones

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.330
and the lost little ones

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.430
all together

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.150
and open a kindergarten for them.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.510
That's called...

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.580
conservation work, right?

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.140
Han, it's your turn.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.190
I have nothing to say.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.580
I'll listen to Captain.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.440
I'll do whatever

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.140
he says.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.810
Stop laughing.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.770
Bai Ju,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.980
it's your turn.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.440
I want to set up a forestry police unit,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.000
and ideally get

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.620
a helicopter too.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.910
With forty thousand square kilometers,

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.040
we could finish a patrol

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.040
in one day.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.250
Then just fly

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.240
straight back to the county

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.570
and go home for a shower.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.930
That would be so nice.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.600
A helicopter

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.000
would scare the Tibetan antelopes, right?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.110
What a buzzkill.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.210
Well,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.550
I'll stick to driving then.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:11.540
Captain,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.110
it's your turn to give a summary.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.340
Wait.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.140
Actually, I don't really have

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.930
a summary.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.150
Everyone spoke very well.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.870
But I can talk about

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.580
my dream.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.700
Captain,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.050
why do you change your clothes

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.550
for the interview?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.630
Cairen gave me

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.620
this jacket.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.360
Since we're going on TV,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.720
I put it on

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.180
to make Cairen happy.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.630
Let me talk about my dream.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.360
I hope that in the future,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.480
the world won't need

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.970
nature reserves anymore.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.550
No more nature reserves?

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.220
Shut up.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.120
If one day,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.550
Bolamula

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.500
can fully recover

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.900
its vitality and beauty,

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:17.640
I hope

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.410
it will no longer need armed patrols

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.320
and no longer need

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.860
to be fenced off

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.020
in the name of a nature reserve.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.320
I hope people will truly

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.480
protect it from their hearts,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.430
respect it,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.100
and appreciate it.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.620
People can quietly

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.910
stay by its side,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.030
and it

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.230
can forever soothe

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:43.810
people's souls.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.340
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.980
You usually talk so much.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.600
How did you know it was me?

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.900
My intuition.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.040
I was just thinking you'd show up,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.790
and then you did.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.490
So you were thinking of me.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.070
I think I just

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.680
saw my parents.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.340
Don't scare me.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.740
I feel like

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.960
they're watching me.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.980
When I was little, my mom,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.540
Director Zhang, told me

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.970
that if I ever missed my birth parents,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.430
I could just look up at the stars.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.890
But back then,

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.010
I just thought

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.230
that was just to comfort kids.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.510
So why do you believe it now?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.340
Maybe

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.010
I started to believe it
after entering the mountains.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.980
Whenever I see the starry sky,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.900
I can't help but think of them.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.620
That's actually

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.550
a instinct.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.560
Those stars are,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.690
in a way,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.150
our mothers.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.700
What do you mean?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.390
We are all made of

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.990
the same matter as the stars.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.540
We are one way

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.680
for the universe

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.650
to know itself.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.740
You're making that up, right?

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.820
No, that's real.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.960
And it wasn't me.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.380
A

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.140
foreign astronomer said that.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.980
And I believe,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:21.870
when you're

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.340
gazing at the stars,

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.180
the stars are looking at you, too.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.700
Maybe,

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.070
in some part of the universe,

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.200
you and your parents

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.510
are talking right now.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:40.860
Then, I wonder

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.970
what we'd talk about.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.840
About you going to the police academy.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:52.600
About

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.270
Bolamula.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.290
About environmental protection.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.100
If there's time,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.300
maybe even about me.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.700
Sometimes I forget...

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.910
how I got here.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.040
I forget what I went through

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.460
in the past twenty years.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.700
And I even forget

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.050
who I am.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.800
It feels like

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.330
ever since I was conscious,

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.590
I've been here.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:34.960
I've become

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.040
a stone at the foot of a snow mountain,

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.070
or a Tibetan antelope

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.360
running forever

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.350
on this wasteland.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.500
According to

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.030
that astronomer's theory,

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.510
people,

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:08.980
stones,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.390
and Tibetan antelopes

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.030
aren't actually that different.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.170
We are all just

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.830
tiny parts of the universe.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.780
Eventually, we'll become stars

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.390
and return to the sky,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.100
right?

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.740
Sometimes,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.790
forgetting is a form

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.990
of self-protection.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.550
But whether you

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.900
remember it or not,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.140
everything you've experienced

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.300
and every step you've taken

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.590
has shaped who you are now.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.120
You don't have to try
to remember anything.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.770
Because those experiences

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.310
are already

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.270
part of you.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.460
Talking big again.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.140
Just treat it as big talk then.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.540
But I think

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.770
we are like this starry sky.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.120
It seems chaotic.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.380
But every star

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.700
has its own path.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.550
We may not see the future clearly,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.210
but as long as we walk boldly forward,

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.590
we will definitely find our direction.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:21.430
What about you?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.810
What is your direction?

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.430
Mine is the same as yours.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.220
Bolamula.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.460
This land.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.790
The starry sky.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:45.740
And you.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.960
Jiumei. Jiumei. Jiumei.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.750
Look ahead.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.760
Good morning.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.250
You're getting good at this.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:02.600
Here.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.960
You're almost catching up to He Qingyuan.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.100
Here.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.940
Wash up with hot water.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.220
You're giving me special treatment again.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.950
Special treatment for ladies.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.350
Here.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.980
I think

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:21.990
you are the one best suited

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.210
to handle logistics.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.350
I'm telling you,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.250
I might not be as good at

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.510
fixing cars as you guys,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.680
but I'm a great shot.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.120
Compared to whom?

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.550
Zhacuo?

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.440
Save us some bullets.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.330
I'm not comparing myself to him.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.840
I only compete with myself.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.300
I've made great progress.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.420
How is it?

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.460
Is it good?

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.300
Better than raw.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.960
Who is it?

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.440
Come up, quick!

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.350
Wake them up.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.450
Wake up. Something's wrong.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.010
The second truck

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.210
looks like Sangba's.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.200
No way.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.140
The gas barrels on the truck bed are ours.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.120
It is ours.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.640
Then...

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.100
the truck is there.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.870
Where are they?

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.470
Where are Sangba and Jiumei?

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.060
It's Sangba.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:44.910
It's him.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.480
Jiumei is there, too.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.790
No.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.730
They're going in.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:54.310
Get the guns!

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.960
Stop them!

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.290
Liu, start the truck!

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.000
Stop them!

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.210
Let's go!

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.770
Get in!

00:20:59.160 --> 00:20:59.680
Let's go!

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:00.490
Stop Zhacuo!

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.850
Zhacuo!

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.720
Go quickly!

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.300
Go help!

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.200
Stop arguing!

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:07.920
You called me a jinx

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.420
and that summoned the bad luck!

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.570
I won't say it anymore!

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.010
Quiet.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.620
Quiet.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.420
Quiet.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.520
I'll stop shouting.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.170
I'll stop.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.430
Captain.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.260
Put all the gas in one truck.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.350
Liu, drive back to the county town.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.330
I'm not leaving.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.510
I don't dare.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:47.540
I know

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.450
you've never

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.710
driven this far alone.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:52.850
But many things

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.860
won't wait

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.990
until you're ready.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.170
You are

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840
our only hope now.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.030
We don't know the situation inside.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.310
How many people?

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600
How many weapons?

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.930
If we go in blindly—

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.930
It'll be too late.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.860
A round trip takes four days.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.020
That's without getting stuck

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.350
or hitting a snowstorm.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.380
If we keep waiting,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.870
they will be dead by then.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.560
Open the roadblock.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.140
I'm Duojie.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.850
You're Li Yongqiang.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080
County Mayor Duo.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.560
We meet again.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:44.880
What are you people

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.000
doing out here?

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.260
You saw it.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.760
It's just a small-scale business,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.140
quarrying some stone.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.340
Do you have a permit?

00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:59.820
I'll apply

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.700
when I get back.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.230
I'll handle it immediately.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.820
No need.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.530
Submit the application directly to me.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.220
Let's talk.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.240
No problem.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.530
Let's go inside

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.350
and talk.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560
You caught my men.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:17.640
Release them first.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.070
Move.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.070
What's your name?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.580
Zhang Yuan.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.040
Is Zhang Yang your brother?

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:16.600
Yes.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.530
He is.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.490
Do you know him?

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.910
I do.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:24.920
Miss.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.550
I beg you.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.420
Please take me with you.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.220
They killed everyone

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.790
who tried to run.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:28.480
I'm terrified.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.270
Please save me.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:29.760
Officer,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.700
I want to go home too!

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.420
I want to leave, too.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.070
I want to go home too.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.130
Shut up, all of you.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.720
Don't move!

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.780
What are you doing?

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.020
What are you doing?

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.010
Drop it!

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.250
Drop the gun!

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.160
Drop the gun!

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:40.630
Don't move!

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.360
Drop the gun!

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.170
Drop the gun!

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.010
Don't move!

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:45.740
Drop the gun!

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:46.850
This is Mazhi County‘s territory!

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.910
Put down your guns!

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.720
Does the county have jurisdiction here?

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720
I'll teach you a lesson for your father!

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.250
Put down!

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:52.790
I'll kill you!

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.750
Put it down, or I'll shoot!

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:54.550
Shoot me then!

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.070
Put it down, or I'll shoot!

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.750
Nobody moves!

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.410
Don't move!

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:00.580
Police!

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.270
Don't move!

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.030
Police!

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.210
Nobody moves!

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.010
I'm a police officer.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.070
I have full authority here.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.520
Put down your guns, everyone!

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.450
There's no need for conflict here.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:09.880
Whoever shoots

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.510
goes to prison.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.570
No one will escape!

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:32.360
Listen to me.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:34.990
Put down your guns.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.230
I'll put mine down first.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.440
Dongzi.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.510
Stand up!

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.420
County Mayor Duo.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:41.220
I can let this kid

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.060
and your team members

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.230
go.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.020
But I'm a businessman.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.740
Mutual benefit.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.150
Then we're friends.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.180
Before you go,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.080
I want to talk to you

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.450
about a partnership.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.690
Okay.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:57.720
Please.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.360
County Mayor Duo.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.410
Your head's worth two million.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:23.680
I could buy your life

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.720
for two million.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.200
But I don't want to do that.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.450
I want to make friends with you

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.550
with this money.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.940
Li Yongqiang.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.920
You've killed my men.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.100
As long as you don't interfere

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.100
with my business,

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.240
my people will steer clear

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.520
of your patrols

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.010
in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.440
You've got it wrong.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.030
I didn't come here

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.030
to make arrests.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.320
I'm here to deliver a notice.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.570
What notice?

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:00.950
We both know

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.020
what lies beneath

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.620
Bolamula.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.680
The county's next step

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.610
is to build a development zone here

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.290
and regulate the gold mining industry.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:11.240
As long as you cooperate

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:11.970
and pull out,

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.610
I can promise you this:

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.820
Once the development zone is established,

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.420
we'll prioritize
issuing you a mining permit.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.230
The location will still be Mount Qimar.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.400
When the time comes,

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.690
you can operate out in the open.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.150
I don't trust you.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.420
Aren't you afraid

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.380
you won't make it out of here today?

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.770
Do you take me for a fossicker?

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.670
I'm a member of the Mazhi County Party
Standing Committee,

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:03.870
Deputy County Mayor,

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.940
and Manager
of the Economic Development Company.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.070
You think killing me here

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.040
means no one will care?

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.380
Then what do you think—

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.260
that I can mine gold here

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.270
all on my own?

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.660
Eat slowly.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:32.430
Slow down.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.680
Do you know where

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.960
the hostages are held?

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.200
There's a dugout

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.870
behind that shed ahead.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.050
The captives

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.450
are all locked in there.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.920
The one who caught me
in the Uninhabited Zone

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.680
was him.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.010
Do you know

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.470
who he's talking about?

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.310
Get down!

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:42.120
Come back!

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.710
Hide! Hide!

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:49.290
Han!

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.150
Han!

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.630
Han!

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:38.340
Han.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.530
Let's go!

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.090
Sangba!

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.170
Jiumei!

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.220
Sangba.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:20.940
Captain!

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.340
Bai Ju!

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.440
Captain!

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:23.000
Get in!

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.460
Zhacuo!

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.480
Don't go!

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:24.940
Zhacuo,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.280
come back!

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:25.810
Hurry up.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.260
Get in!

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.690
Get in, quick.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.350
Get down.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:40.840
Help, quick.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.900
Come down and help.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.550
Han, drive!

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.600
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.810
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.720
Get in, quick!

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.700
Get in, quick!

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.940
Captain, let's go!

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.350
Get in!

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:20.910
Let's go!

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.590
Shao Yunfei!

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.550
Shao Yunfei!

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.850
Captain!

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:29.110
Get in.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:45.630
Get down!

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.610
Stay down!

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:54.100
Give me a gun!

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.610
Let's go!

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.040
Let's go!

00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.690
Stop the car!

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:00.750
Stop the car first!

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.760
Stop!

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.320
Get in, quick!

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.080
Let's go!

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.530
Are you okay?

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.570
I'm fine.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.810
[Two weeks later]

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:02.390
The Qima'er Gold Mine

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.340
in Bolamula

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.530
has been sealed off.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.940
During this operation,

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.560
the police arrested

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.050
12 suspects,

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.730
rescued 47

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.760
abducted miners,

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:15.670
and seized a large amount

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.260
of gold and gold ore.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.230
According to our investigation,

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.500
all transactions of the gold mine

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.600
were in cash.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.270
But since the suspect

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.650
Li Yongqiang is dead,

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:26.800
the whereabouts
of most of the illicit money

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.980
are unknown.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:30.680
What's suspicious is...

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:32.460
Li Yongqiang

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.620
was the gold mine's

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.940
sole investor,

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.880
but his verifiable income

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.800
was not enough to support

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.060
the mine's operation.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.690
Regarding these points,

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:41.300
we are conducting

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.760
further investigations.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.050
According to instructions from superiors,

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.900
next,

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.430
our county will join forces
with neighboring

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:52.160
Boluo County

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.890
and Zaqu County

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.620
and carry out

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.690
a concentrated crackdown on illegal

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.750
gold mining activities in Bolamula.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.200
Public Security, Armed Police,

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.960
the local militia, and joint defense units

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.230
will immediately form

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.060
a joint inspection task force

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.610
to carry out

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:10.300
comprehensive law enforcement operations.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.000
Tomorrow,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.610
all units must submit

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.070
the personnel lists to me.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.210
Right.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.970
The province has already

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.630
approved the establishment

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.350
of the Forestry Police in our county.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:23.670
The next step is to select some people

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.880
for training at the Provincial
Public Security Department.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.010
As for the specific quota allocation,

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.720
the Public Security
and the Mountain Patrol

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.540
can negotiate it yourselves.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.330
Go back and draw up the list,

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.310
and get it to me as soon as possible.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:48.470
Your operation this time

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.380
achieved great results,

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.800
but the cost was also high.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.000
I need to make a self-criticism

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.730
regarding my previous remarks

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:07.860
about the Mountain Patrol's work.
