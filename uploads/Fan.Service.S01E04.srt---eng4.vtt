WEBVTT

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:08.608
So Geonwoo, what does success mean to you?

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.680
When I was a kid, it was being on TV.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:17.416
It felt like the whole world was inside.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:20.587
Then it was doing commercials,

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.257
and as I got older, starring in a drama,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:29.129
winning awards, and so on.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.664
The bar just kept getting higher.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.633
Yeah.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.169
But lately, I'm not so sure.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.604
When my insomnia is really bad,

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:42.041
just getting a good night's
sleep feels like success.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.375
When I'm on a strict diet,

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.079
being able to eat whatever
I want feels like a win.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.248
My definition of success

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.951
is always changing.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:58.958
So, what's the hardest part
about being in this industry?

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.498
Always having to smile in front of people.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.935
Even when I'm falling apart inside,

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.605
no one can really tell.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.975
That's the hard part.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.457
Can you check if I look okay?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.340
Uh... do I look alright?

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.010
Is that really so important?

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.969
I've always wondered something.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.537
Huh?

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:22.442
When did you and Taewoo get so close?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.713
We first met at a local gym.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.182
Taewoo was pretty shy back then,

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.118
so I looked out for him.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:38.290
You might already know this,

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.259
but when I was a kid,

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.194
back when I was a child actor,

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:46.266
there was a scene
where I had to get in a car.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.370
I was actually kidnapped that time.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.070
Kidnapped?

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.372
Yeah.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.643
People said I was unusually calm.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.411
When I got out of the car,

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.946
I didn't even cry.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.849
I seemed totally fine.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.918
That's because

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.188
the person who took me

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.590
was my father.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.594
We started filming and got in the car.

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.397
My dad was in the driver's seat.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:22.202
I was so excited, asking
where we were going.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.271
But my dad...

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:30.510
just kept crying and saying he was sorry.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:34.646
He took me to a toy store,

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.082
bought me a robot,

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.052
and then he just left.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.021
It never made the news.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:45.057
Only my mom, my manager,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.126
and I knew about it.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.496
I really didn't want the world to know.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.432
But...

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.835
is it okay that

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.838
you're telling me this?

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.141
Yeah.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.511
I just needed someone to talk to.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:11.150
For some reason, I
felt like I could trust you.

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:17.790
Hyung, what are you talking about?

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.795
So you don't trust me?

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:27.700
You knew I hated you, yet
you still kept this from me?

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.369
Taewoo, it's not like that...

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.070
Not like that?

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.138
You know

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.241
I've always been the odd one out.

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:38.477
To everyone else, I'm just
Geonwoo's little brother.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:41.748
Even the stuff about
Dad only belongs to you.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.386
I knew you felt left out.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.187
That's why I couldn't tell you.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.156
If you had known about Dad too,

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.224
it would've hurt you even more.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.358
Stop making excuses!

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.727
That's my business too.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.663
You just made me look like a fool.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.432
That's enough.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.602
Let's calm down before we talk.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.271
Jaeyeon...

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.939
You said you'd always be on my side.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.441
Taewoo.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.910
I'm not taking sides here.

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:13.478
Taewoo, don't be like this.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.347
This isn't Jaeyeon's fault.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.515
Enough.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.216
I get it now.

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.286
In the end, I'm always second best.

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:22.889
Taewoo!

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.531
Let go of my hand.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.032
I'll be right back.

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:37.036
I'll go talk to Taewoo and come back.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.073
Please wait for me here.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.687
Taewoo!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.360
Hey, where are you going?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.961
What am I supposed to do?

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:05.230
What am I supposed to do staying here?

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:06.665
Don't run.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.868
I'm right here.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:12.605
Let's go together, okay?

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.243
Come on.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.787
Taewoo...

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.588
Stop drinking so much.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:30.789
Huh?

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.658
About your brother...

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.427
Jaeyeon...

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.430
I know.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.666
I know he's hurting too.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:46.738
He's been on set since he was a kid.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.841
He barely even went to school.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:52.211
He doesn't really have any friends.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.813
I know.

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:57.083
I know I've just been blaming him.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.418
I know...

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.386
Taewoo...

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.789
You were just a kid back then, too.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.090
We're still young.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.026
We're only in our twenties.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:10.930
Let's just consider this part
of the healing process, okay?

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.466
I feel so bad for my brother.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.003
I had no idea back then.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.606
I just really missed my dad.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:25.111
I hate that I'm like this.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.583
Looking back...

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:34.019
I'm really glad I have you.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.588
Jaeyeon...

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.958
If I didn't have you,

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.395
I don't think I would've made it this far.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:17.763
Man... you're so heavy.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.424
Finally...

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:04.143
Don't go.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.856
This isn't right...

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.699
Goodbye...

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.700
