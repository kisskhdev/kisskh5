00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.300
Xiao Man.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.400
At yesterday's court,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.980
why did you join the ministers
in pressing me to appoint an Empress?

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.740
Has even you chosen
not to stand with me anymore?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.420
I deserve death.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.939
Why are you kneeling?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.460
Have you not knelt enough?

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.540
What servant?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Do you truly not understand my heart?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.699
I am unworthy of Your Majesty.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.820
No.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.020
You are worthy.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.340
You are the one most worthy
in all under Heaven.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.300
But Your Majesty

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.220
cannot afford to contend
with the Zhen clan.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.780
Your Majesty,
it is time for morning court.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.660
I will wait outside.

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:18.785
Other than you,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.660
I will marry no one.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.940
I heard

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.860
the Grand Princess's words.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.340
Your Majesty cannot reopen my case,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.140
I understand.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.900
I cannot move
against Xiang Gu right now.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.320
His remaining influence still endures.
The army's loyalty still lies with him.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.729
Now the borders are unsettled.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.640
It is a time of troubles
within and threats without.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.940
If I move against him,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.980
what will happen
to the people of Great Qian?

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.630
You cannot act for now.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780
Then when will you be able to act?

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.380
I do not know.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.100
Grant me a little more time.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.259
Xiao Man.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.300
Enough.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.580
I understand.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.680
(I cannot move
against Xiang Gu right now.)

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.859
(Now the borders are unsettled.)

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.800
(It is a time of troubles
within and threats without.)

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.140
(If I move against him,)

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.900
(what will happen
to the people of Great Qian?)

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:56.419
(My sister, do not speak again
of righting old wrongs)

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.260
(or clearing past injustices.)

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.420
(It means nothing to the dead.)

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.059
(Your father and mother)

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.659
(gave their whole lives to Great Qian.)

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.420
(And what did they gain in the end?)

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.900
(I will not accept such an ending.)

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.020
(And neither should you.)

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.859
Are you not afraid
I will disappoint you?

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.060
I am not afraid.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.659
Other than you,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.100
there is no one else
who can help me do this.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.740
So I can only place my bet

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.260
on what stands
between my Emperor and me.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.180
I tell you this.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.220
You have won.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.940
We both have.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.860
So you are no longer angry with me.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.659
As long as our hearts are together,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.380
nothing is impossible.

00:05:30.925 --> 00:05:33.420
(Is there truly a way
to have it both ways?)

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.140
(To honor the realm
and not fail the one I love.)

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.500
Aunt.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.220
Today, I will raise again
the matter of the border defenses.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.540
Please speak, Your Majesty.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.060
I have decided
to review the treasury accounts.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.539
Without my order,

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.860
no one may move the treasury silver.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.019
We must raise funds for military pay,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.420
and entrust them to Elder General Xiang
to reinforce the border.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.340
Your Majesty is wise.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.019
If there is any change at the border,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.219
the sooner I act,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.419
the more secure Great Qian will be.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.540
Your Majesty.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.099
According to procedure,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.579
a decision of this importance

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.659
must still be issued by imperial edict.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.659
But Your Majesty
has already given a verbal order.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.220
Why would that not suffice?

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.099
This matter admits no delay.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.419
Without an edict,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.019
it violates ritual propriety above,
and established rules below.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.340
The Ministry of War
cannot carry it out in stages.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.539
Please wait
until Director Jia has recovered,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.020
then issue the order.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.299
Director Jia has been confined
to bed recently.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.019
Military affairs are
of great consequence.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.100
I ask Your Majesty
and the ministers to reconsider.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.060
An imperial edict is issued.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.700
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor proclaims,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.139
with unrest at the borders,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.619
after auditing the state treasury,
all military funds are to be mobilized,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.099
and placed under General Xiang Gu.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.280
The Elder General is hereby ordered to
take full charge of reinforcing the borders.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.139
Minister of War, Sun Gong
is to fully cooperate

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.580
without fail.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.400
So ordered.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.419
Without the seal
of the Directorate of Ceremonial,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.420
the edict cannot take effect.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.295
(The Emperor's Seal)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.007
(The Emperor's Seal)

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.700
Insolent child.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.020
Do you even know what you are doing?

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.340
Forging an imperial edict
while I am ill.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.059
Why are you helping the Emperor?

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.700
I am not helping the Emperor.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.060
I am carrying out my father's
and mother's final wishes.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.899
Back then, they were willing
to give their lives

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.219
to secure years of peace
for the people at the borders.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.419
Uncle, you

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.419
colluded with foreign powers
to invade Great Qian.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.500
That is what truly confirms
those false charges,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.659
and runs directly against
what my parents stood for.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.540
Enough. Say no more.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.980
Uncle.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.180
Listen to what she is saying.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.059
You must have been misled

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.659
by that Emperor.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.460
I have not lost my clarity.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.019
All these years,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.219
you watched Chu Ying grow up.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.820
He is innocent.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.520
Uncle.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.460
From childhood to now,
I have never begged you for anything.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:27.970
I beg you now.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.379
For the sake
of our parents' last wishes,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.340
and because Chu Ying is someone
you raised with your own eyes,

00:08:33.862 --> 00:08:35.222
stop this.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.979
I believe that even if you succeed,

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.980
you will not truly be at peace.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.100
I do not wish for you,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.539
or my brother,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.740
to live your whole lives in regret.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.860
Brother.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.179
Your bond with Sister-in-law is strong.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.100
You will surely
have children in the future.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.739
Must you let hatred continue,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.380
so that your future children

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.980
also live their lives in regret?

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.500
Children?

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.020
The future?

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.340
There has long been no future
between the Princess and me.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.700
Because she is a daughter
of the Chu family,

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.540
with the blood
of the Chu dynasty in her veins.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.500
Xiao Man.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.219
Every word you have said,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.419
I have thought through

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.740
countless times already.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.899
But when the one
who stayed by your side each day

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.060
dies before your very eyes,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.860
only then will you understand

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.620
that all those feelings
of love and attachment

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.740
can be cast aside.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.020
I cast life and death aside long ago.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.020
As for you and the Emperor,

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.260
forget it all as well.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.940
Xiao Man.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.260
I understand the pain in your heart.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.099
But your brother is right.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.460
They carry the blood of our enemies.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.980
Remember this well.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.300
Your surname is Zhen.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.659
You are a daughter of the Zhen family,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.940
the daughter of Xiao Congrong!

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.820
Vengeance is your fate.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.259
You must kill them all.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.059
Kill!

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.699
Kill!

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.780
Kill!
