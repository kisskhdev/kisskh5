WEBVTT

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.599
What are you two chatting about?

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.359
I say, haven't seen you in ages.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.280
Mr. Fan.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.319
How is your book coming along?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.959
Still about fifty thousand words short.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.519
It'll be finished any moment now.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.379
This...

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.539
Isn't this that crosstalk performer?

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.840
Called...

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.479
Called what's-his-name...

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.479
Professor!

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.759
Finally caught you.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.520
What is it?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.759
Look what you...

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.719
Left in the bathroom.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.840
Shouldn't you thank me properly?

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:22.979
Thanks.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.740
Thanks.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.400
You didn't peek at anything you shouldn't have, right?

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.800
Look at this guy.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.439
I didn't look at anything.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.039
Happy now?

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.300
I just answered a call for you.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.599
You answered it?

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.800
That wasn't the publisher, was it?

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.319
If not the publisher...

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.080
Who else could it be?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.800
They aren't calling to rush the draft, are they?

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:51.919
No.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:53.759
They asked me to tell you...

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.400
Just finish your manuscript within a week.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.719
Don't rush at all.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.879
Over fifty thousand words in a week...

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.280
How can I not rush?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.960
It's not about whether you can...

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.120
Stop squawking like that.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.560
It's early in the morning.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.639
Is there a crow passing by?

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.560
I'm not going to banter with you.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.120
I have to go back and write immediately.

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.800
The newspaper! That's my newspaper.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:26.120
Boss Li.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.439
You're finally back.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.719
I have something urgent to discuss with you.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.159
What is it now?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.599
Speak.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.719
Here's the thing.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.960
Our community...

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.400
Is preparing to join the district's...

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.280
Elegant Senior Contest.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.639
So according to the higher-ups...

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.159
Each residence will hold selections.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.080
Specifically for our Changqing Residence...

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.960
We need to produce a skit.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.800
I've discussed it with the students.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.360
We unanimously recommend...

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.479
You to play the male lead in this skit.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.319
He dies a miserable death.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.280
It's a disaster.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.680
Keep your voice down.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.039
What happened now?

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.039
Don't ask.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.800
Isn't our Changqingju putting on a skit?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.039
I know about that.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.680
They came to me first thing.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.339
Why does it have to be me?

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.860
I don't want to give people the impression...

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.300
...that besides me in Changqingju...

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.379
...there are no capable people left?

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.839
Right?

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.100
You really can't refuse.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.339
Can't refuse? I...

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:29.779
Let me tell you the truth.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:30.740
Besides you...

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.819
...I have nowhere else to find...

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.420
...such a suitable candidate.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.459
That really...

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.420
What do you mean?

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:37.980
Look here.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:40.019
The Professor is busy rushing his draft.

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:42.100
Lao Liang went to the hospital for a checkup.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.259
Rudy babbles on...

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.540
...and can't speak Chinese clearly.

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:45.699
Gou'er Ye is...

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.759
...confused about everything.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.519
Me, Ms. Liu...

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:50.000
...and Grandma Jin are all women.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.160
So you tell me...

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.040
...where else can we find such a candidate?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.199
So you're asking me because no one else fits?

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:57.899
Right.

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:58.879
No.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.879
Look at how clumsy I am with words.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.160
I can't even explain things clearly.

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.639
Usually, we're afraid you're busy.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And we don't dare trouble you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.600
But now, we have to trouble you.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.839
Besides...

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.160
...this male lead role...

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.519
...is simply custom-made...

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:18.879
...specifically designed for you.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.720
Didn't they feel you were a bit lacking?

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.000
So Ms. Liu and Xiao Cai

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.920
came to find me.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.120
They insisted I participate.

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.240
Pestering me endlessly.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.540
Insisting that I join in.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.860
It's miserable.

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:34.139
Just miserable.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.560
If you're participating, then participate.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.000
What's so miserable about it?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.600
Just go ahead and do it.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.759
They insisted I play the male lead.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.860
Look here,

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.699
this male lead

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.579
is essentially a domineering CEO.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.180
Usually,

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:49.579
he puts on official airs,

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:50.939
pretends to know what he doesn't,

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:52.699
is self-righteous,

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.459
and is a stubborn old man.

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.220
So, playing yourself.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.860
What do they call it in the industry?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.019
You wouldn't understand this.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.459
Insiders call this "playing oneself."

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.860
Right.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.540
Shoo.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.300
Who?

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.379
Am I like that usually?

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:08.680
Usually you're exactly...

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.060
just...

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.819
very, very different from that character.

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:13.660
Because you

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.220
have great acting skills.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.839
So whatever role you play, you look the part.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.060
That is true.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.100
Wherever I go, I'm a key artistic figure.

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:25.660
When I was a soldier in the army,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.740
I was transferred to the division propaganda team.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.779
Later, I just quit.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.980
Alright.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.980
So you,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.819
can you promise to take this male lead

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:35.379
and nail it?

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:37.939
Then I'll reluctantly

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.300
give it a try.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.420
You get to play the male lead and you call it miserable?

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.860
They think highly of you.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:45.699
Don't act like a victim when you got lucky.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.579
What luck?

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.100
Do you know who's playing the female lead?

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.600
The female lead?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.519
That must be a gentle, kind,

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.959
young and beautiful,

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.040
middle-aged...

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.720
just a little bit past it, female comrade.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.120
I'm asking who is playing it.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.199
Is it Ms. Liu?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.360
I...

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:09.519
No.

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:11.319
Xiao Cai is playing the female lead.

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.019
You're acting opposite her?

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.860
Exactly.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.500
That really is miserable.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:20.019
Thanks for understanding.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.660
Understand what?

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.259
I mean poor Xiao Cai is miserable.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.740
What kind of talk is that?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.259
That she gets to act opposite me,

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:31.459
is a blessing she earned in a past life.

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:34.100
Look at how eccentric she usually is.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.100
She can't get her lines out.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.060
So what if she's eccentric?

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:38.779
Xiao Cai,

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.220
has a good heart.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:42.500
She's just a bit simple-minded.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.660
She's simple-minded?

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:45.220
I didn't see that.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.300
If you didn't see that,

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:48.899
then you're the simple-minded one.

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:49.660
Nonsense.

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:52.060
Tell me how she's simple-minded.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.420
Isn't it obvious?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.819
If she wasn't simple-minded,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.660
how could she pick you as the male lead?

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.860
Hey, what a thing to say.

00:07:58.259 --> 00:07:59.860
So, anyone who picks me as male lead

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.939
is simple-minded?

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:01.439
Well, that...

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:01.839
That...

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:02.579
That Xiao Ying...

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:03.220
Fine.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.620
Can you stop causing trouble?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.139
I'm writing a draft here.

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:09.459
I don't have time to banter with you.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.660
Fine.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.139
Just you wait.

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:16.660
Shenzhou has gone to space

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.060
The national football team has clocked out

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.139
It's getting late

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.139
Dinner is ready

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:24.860
Old woman

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:26.740
I'm calling out "Old woman"

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.860
Why are you chiming in?

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.779
What? Do you want to help me rehearse?

00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:32.019
Who's helping you rehearse?

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.500
I'm telling you...

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.620
...not to make a sound when speaking

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:37.620
How can one speak without making a sound?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.659
Besides, I'm not "speaking"

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.379
I'm reciting lines. It's serious business

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.419
Can't you memorize silently?

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.340
A psychologist specializing in memory research,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:46.980
Ebbinghaus

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.779
Alright

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.019
Habits formed over so many years,

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.259
Can't be changed overnight

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:53.059
Just bear with it

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.019
Shenzhou has gone to space

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.379
The national football team has clocked out

00:08:58.379 --> 00:08:59.379
Hello, Chief Editor Fang

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.539
It's like this

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm currently revising a manuscript

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:05.820
I don't have time to write anything else

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:07.000
You'd better find someone else

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.220
The national football team has clocked out

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.379
It has nothing to do with the payment

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:10.220
I really don't have the time

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.820
Clocked out

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.779
Right, clocked out

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.940
What "clocked out"?

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:14.340
Are you done yet?

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.179
Are you done yet?

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:16.100
I wasn't talking to you

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.019
Not talking to you

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:17.940
I'm talking to you

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:19.340
Not talking to you? Then talking to me

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.460
I'm talking to you!

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.820
I'm really not talking to you

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:24.460
He is talking to you

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:25.460
Hello?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.259
I can't be bothered with you

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:28.320
Don't, don't hang up

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.019
Don't hang up

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:33.460
Can't you go somewhere else to recite?

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:34.659
Why should I?

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.539
You reciting here affects my writing

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.340
Well, your phone calls affect my reciting

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:39.799
You...

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.480
Uh, Director Yuan

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.179
The national football team went to space

00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:46.899
Look

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:47.940
Can the national football team go to space?

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.779
I really don't have time these days. Dream on

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:50.580
I've said all I need to say

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.259
You should find someone else

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:52.580
You messed up my words

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:54.580
You're turning it around on me?

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.000
No

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.940
I wasn't talking to you. I'm blaming...

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.940
Not talking to you. Uh...

00:09:58.019 --> 00:09:58.879
Alright, alright

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.179
I won't cause trouble for you anymore

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.820
I can't beat you, so I'll avoid you

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.259
I'll go recite outside

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.820
You'd better stay far away from me

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.580
No

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.340
I wasn't talking about you

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.259
Shenzhou has gone to space

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.460
The national football team has clocked out

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:12.220
Clocked out

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.220
Hello, Director Qiu

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.299
Hello

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:16.860
Finally, some peace

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.019
What is it?

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.240
Hello.

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:36.000
Look who's here.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.639
Boss Li.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.399
How is your skit rehearsal going?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.720
It's miserable.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:46.120
I didn't want to participate at first.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.600
But they insisted I play the male lead.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.679
I have a million things to do.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:53.399
Where would I find the time?

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:55.120
He didn't ask you that.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.200
Just tell us about the competition.

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:58.679
It's miserable.

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:01.080
We ended up in the semi-finals.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:03.600
You made the semi-finals.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.120
That's a good thing.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.960
What's so good about it?

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:10.320
Being in the semi-finals

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.039
means we have to keep rehearsing at night.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:14.240
Since we're in the semi-finals,

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.759
we have to win a prize, right?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.279
I feel like right now,

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:19.960
the burden on my shoulders is quite heavy.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.279
Don't worry.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.080
With you in it, you definitely won't win.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.320
You can rest assured.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:26.639
Alright.

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.120
Let's not disturb him anymore.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:28.759
Make room.

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:30.720
Let's go. I'm not eating.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.259
I'm done eating.

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:32.399
Enjoy your meal.

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:36.559
Lao Fan

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.279
Is it because of what happened a couple of days ago

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:41.240
that you still can't let it go?

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.159
Don't worry.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:45.279
I won't hold it against you.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.080
What do you mean *you* won't hold it against *me*?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.679
It's *me* who won't hold it against *you*.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.679
Fine.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.820
Alright, let's drop it for now.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.399
How many words did you write today?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.159
How many words?

00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.840
Well...

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.279
I wrote five hundred words this morning.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.639
A whole morning and only five hundred words?

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.159
At this speed,

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:05.639
how are you going to finish the task?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.240
Tell me about it.

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:09.360
That's why I didn't even dare to eat lunch.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.200
I buckled down...

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.919
in the afternoon,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.039
and deleted another four hundred words.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.000
So you only wrote one hundred words?

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:15.419
Why are you so slow?

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:16.879
It's not that I'm slow.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.840
It's that people keep calling me.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.240
If it's not my students,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.399
it's my friends.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.879
This one wants to commission an article,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.879
that one invites me to give a lecture.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600
And others,

00:12:26.919 --> 00:12:27.960
want me to be a guest speaker.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:29.879
And some want me to attend seminars.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.320
I spend all day just answering the phone.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:33.960
If I don't agree,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.720
they won't hang up.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.960
Tell me, how am I supposed to write?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.639
It's all the phone's fault.

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:41.360
How about I give you an idea?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.039
What kind of rotten idea do you have?

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:44.320
My "rotten idea"...

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.639
What do you mean "rotten idea"?

00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:48.919
It's a bona fide good idea.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:50.519
What good idea?

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:52.320
Just don't answer the phone, problem solved.

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:53.799
But it's noisy.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.600
That's why I say you're dumb.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.919
Set your phone to silent mode.

00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:59.320
Throw it in the drawer.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.480
As the saying goes,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.720
"What you don't hear won't bother you."

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:05.320
Is there such a saying?

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.240
Close enough.

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:08.080
This method of yours...

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:10.039
does it work?

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:11.419
What if someone is looking for me

00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:13.039
for something important?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.960
After you finish writing,

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:17.279
call them all back at once.

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:18.679
How's that for an idea?

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.679
Not great.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:21.559
But I could give it a try.

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.799
Hurry up and eat, you haven't touched it.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:26.200
I think...

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.320
when you finish saying this part,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.519
shouldn't I respond to you?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.840
Right, exactly.

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:33.200
Yes, that would be good.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.799
Doesn't crosstalk have that thing...

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:35.639
the supporting role, right?

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:37.360
It's called a perfect match.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.600
With you, when the time comes, really...

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.120
we...

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.639
Boss Li.

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.320
Why are you here so early?

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:45.919
No, wait, it seems...

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:46.879
it's not time for your...

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:48.639
Changqing Residence rehearsal yet, is it?

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:49.399
Is that so?

00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:52.279
I came to see your Yannian Residence's program.

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:53.539
To learn a thing or two.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.200
And to boost our confidence in winning the championship.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.320
From what you're saying,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.240
it seems like your Changqingju

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.679
is better than ours.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.799
Better? No way.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.960
Compared to you guys,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.159
our Changqingju is way behind.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.240
At least you have self-awareness.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.519
You guys have everything.

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:17.080
Writers, directors, actors, costumes, makeup, props.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.840
Right?

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.759
We have nothing at all.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.000
We had to hire a director from the Central Academy of Drama,

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:26.360
borrow costumes from the People's Art Theatre,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.679
hire makeup artists from the Beijing Film Academy,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.279
rent sound equipment from the Communication University,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.279
and ask CCTV for the script.

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:34.320
Only the actors are our own.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.279
We're practically destitute.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:37.960
I...

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:39.759
Turns out this young man

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:42.399
came here just to show off.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:43.120
Elder Lü,

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:46.080
these days they don't call it showing off.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.360
This is authentic

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:48.519
"Versailles."

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.559
I don't care what you call it.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.639
Anyway, if you want to win the championship,

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.919
ultimately, it depends on acting skills.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:14:59.320
Yes.

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:01.120
Speaking of acting skills,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.360
we're even further behind you guys.

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:04.360
Yes.

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:07.039
But we invited Ms. Liu

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.759
to give us some pointers.

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:10.679
Ms. Liu Minzhi, do you know her?

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:12.320
From the Children's Art Theatre,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.080
a famous performing artist.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:15.019
I know.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.440
Ms. Liu is... Get out!

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:17.639
You...

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:19.080
You haven't figured it out yet?

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:21.139
He's doing this to piss us off.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:23.200
Annoying, so annoying.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.480
If you want to win an award,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720
you have to rely on real skill.

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:27.919
Acting.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.379
Right.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:31.000
It must be based on real skill.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.879
We're actually just here to participate.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.919
Getting First Prize would be just passable.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.480
You...

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.320
the way you talk, kid...

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.759
you are just too infuriating.

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:45.440
Little Li,

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:47.440
you...

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.240
although your education level isn't high,

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:51.840
I think there is a character

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.480
you should know.

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.840
Compared to you, my education level...

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.980
Any rare characters,

00:15:58.519 --> 00:15:59.799
please feel free to ask.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.879
Simple.

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:03.299
It has an "ear" radical on the left,

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.960
and "stop" on the right.

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:07.820
How do you pronounce this character?

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:10.379
On the left is...

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.539
This character is pronounced "Shame".

00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:17.500
Good that you know.

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:23.019
This old man is calling me shameless.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.899
Isn't he?

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.539
Professor

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:41.019
How's the progress today?

00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:42.940
You're asking about the word count again, huh?

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:44.340
All morning today,

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.620
I wrote two thousand five hundred words.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.379
Look at that.

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:47.980
Listening to me was right, wasn't it?

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.220
Two thousand five hundred words in just one morning.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.259
But this afternoon I deleted three thousand words.

00:16:54.379 --> 00:16:56.259
So you wrote nothing and actually owe five hundred.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.620
So what should I do?

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.100
All day long,

00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:00.539
I've been doing nothing but answering calls.

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:01.860
How am I supposed to write?

00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:04.059
What I write looks like garbage even to me.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.079
I have to say, you...

00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:07.740
I told you,

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.299
put your phone on silent and keep it in the drawer.

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:11.539
Don't answer calls.

00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:13.220
You just won't listen to the voice of experience.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.539
Don't mention your lousy idea.

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:18.099
It messed up something important for me.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.380
What important business do you have?

00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:21.500
You don't hold a massive fortune,

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.460
and you don't command thousands of troops.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.460
Just a lowly Professor,

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.660
and a retired one at that.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.900
What big business could you have?

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.339
Don't look down on us intellectuals.

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:33.460
An old friend from my youth...

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:36.019
before his departure,

00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:38.099
wanted to see me one last time.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.460
Before his execution?

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:44.859
Your friend got shot?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.700
Look at that.

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:48.099
Chose the wrong friends, didn't you?

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:49.019
Who? Who?

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:50.660
It's your friend who got shot!

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.859
I meant that...

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.180
this old friend of mine, his son

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.420
plans to take him abroad to settle down.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.660
Before he left,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.140
he wanted to see me one last time.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.660
But because I put my phone on silent,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.819
I missed the call.

00:18:03.099 --> 00:18:04.619
Well, he's flown off now.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.700
That is quite a pity, huh?

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.619
It seems not answering the phone

00:18:11.619 --> 00:18:13.180
isn't such a good idea.

00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:16.140
I've got it.

00:18:17.099 --> 00:18:18.339
I have another idea.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.740
Just fake an illness.

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:21.900
Fake an illness?

00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:23.579
If you're sick,

00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:24.900
when people look for you,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.660
would they still have the nerve to bother you?

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:28.460
That actually...

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.140
that really is an idea.

00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:31.059
Right?

00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:32.460
But how do I fake it?

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:34.859
Look at you, honestly.

00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:36.019
And you call yourself a Professor.

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:37.299
You don't even know how to fake being sick?

00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:38.700
Didn't they teach that at your university?

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.259
Next time a call comes, just say...

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.539
Answer it!

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.180
Fake being sick!

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.500
Hello? Who is this?

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:53.819
Chef Wang?

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.099
Hello. What's up?

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.660
The food show on the Science Channel?

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.859
To be honest with you,

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:02.819
I really don't have time these days.

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:03.579
Fake illness!

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.660
I'm currently faking an illness.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.140
No, I...

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.140
I'm currently sick.

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:11.539
What illness do I have?

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:12.660
How should I know?

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.900
How would I know?

00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:15.099
No, I...

00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:16.539
It's that I haven't decided yet.

00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:17.059
No, wait.

00:19:17.319 --> 00:19:18.019
It's...

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:19.660
it's that I haven't been diagnosed yet.

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:21.660
What a mess.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.019
How is it?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.220
Following this master's brilliant plan,

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:30.339
the calls have dropped off, right?

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:32.140
You don't say, they really have.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.420
Listening to me was right.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.099
Go create in peace.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.779
I'm off to the rec room to rehearse.

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:37.740
I'll give you some space.

00:19:37.819 --> 00:19:38.700
Thanks a lot.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.259
Lao Li.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.500
Wait a second.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.259
Could you please tell...

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:45.059
Xiao Cai, Lao Liang,

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:46.660
Xiao Fang, plus Rudy and Gou'er Ye,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.900
especially Ms. Liu,

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.339
just say I'm extremely busy lately.

00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:50.539
Don't come by unless it's urgent.

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:51.740
I need to focus wholeheartedly

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.779
on writing my draft.

00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:54.220
That's all nonsense.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.019
Why would they visit you for no reason?

00:19:56.339 --> 00:19:57.539
Especially Ms. Liu.

00:19:57.819 --> 00:19:59.220
When has she ever sought you out?

00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:01.079
It's all just your wishful thinking.

00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:02.660
Get out.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.259
You're annoying.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.619
Who is it now? Come in.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.339
Professor Fan. Grandpa Fan.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.420
Yu Sheng? What are you all doing?

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.099
Professor Fan,

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:26.980
we heard you were sick.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.299
We came to check on you,

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:29.380
to see if there's anything we can help with

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.200
or any care you need.

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:31.400
No need.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.819
I...

00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:32.900
I can manage by myself.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.220
Why are you being so polite?

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.299
We came to the retirement community

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:37.259
specifically to serve the elders.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.140
Students, really, there's no need.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.700
Actually, I'm quite fine.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.380
Grandpa Fan,

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.220
how about I go get Dr. Sun for you?

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:43.900
Wait here.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.240
Don't!

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.619
Take a couple pills to suppress it.

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:46.079
No need.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.220
How about checking your temperature?

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.559
No need.

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:48.660
Drink some hot water then?

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:50.619
Just great.

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:52.940
Another day gone to waste.
