WEBVTT

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:51.072
They say it's like
a cloud swallowing the moon.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:52.782
So that's when he shows up?

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.950
No.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:57.745
That's how long it takes him
to rob a single storehouse.

00:00:58.538 --> 00:00:59.873
So did you see him?

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:02.584
Indeed, I did.

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:05.962
The moment the cloud released the moon.

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:09.507
He was a Baekjeong!

00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:12.468
It's the return
of Im Kkeok-jeong's spirit!

00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:13.720
What are you talking about?

00:01:13.803 --> 00:01:15.597
I heard he had a sharp, handsome nose,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.808
and he's the prettiest man in Joseon.

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:20.059
That way! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:23.062
What the heck? It's not a human.

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:25.982
It's a monster with fur all over its body.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:29.235
What?
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.404
I thought he was a 100-year-old hermit.

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:37.201
Does a 100-year-old have the energy

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:39.829
to distribute ten thousand seok of rice
across the capital?

00:01:39.913 --> 00:01:41.039
Oh, really?

00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:45.460
So this thief is a handsome man
who wants to shack up with a widow?

00:01:45.543 --> 00:01:47.211
Watch out for good-looking men.

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:50.882
Well, it's a monster covered in fur,
with monstrous strength.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.343
Oh, for goodness sake.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:56.221
-I told you.
-Ma'am.

00:01:56.304 --> 00:02:00.183
I saw that great, righteous thief
with my own two eyes last night!

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.101
He's a Baekjeong.

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.856
There's been improvement.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:10.735
For the next three days,
clean your eyes with salt water

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:12.695
and then rinse them with warm water.

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.280
Thanks, Eun-jo.

00:02:14.364 --> 00:02:15.448
By the way,

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:18.243
you know eye problems
can affect your vision, right?

00:02:19.953 --> 00:02:20.870
A pig?

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:25.208
I know. A chicken head.

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:28.878
What's that?

00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:30.380
A dragon?

00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:32.674
Baekjeong, my foot.

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:35.718
Oh, it's a snake head.

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:36.928
It's a chicken head.

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:38.137
Seok-sam, that punk.

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.890
His eyes lie just as much as his words do.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.186
These herbs are good
for child malnutrition.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.689
There's no way
he saw this righteous thief.

00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:51.067
Well, how can a thief
possibly be righteous?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.902
Do you really think so?

00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:54.362
The granaries of corrupt officials

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.407
are filled with things
taken from the people.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.409
Which means those granaries

00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:00.868
rightfully belong to the people.

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:02.620
So it isn't theft.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:05.623
It is merely giving back
what was taken from them.

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:07.500
You heard him.

00:03:08.918 --> 00:03:11.504
Are you on the thief's side too, sir?

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.467
How could I ever take a thief's side?
I'm only speaking the truth.

00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:19.137
Rumors are never wholly true.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.889
So maybe

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:24.183
the name is fake.

00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:26.352
The name?

00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:29.147
People call him Gil-dong.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:31.149
"A friend on the road"?

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:33.568
Is that what it means?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.155
Well, some say that
it means "the rope on the ground."

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.824
This is a real headache.

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:42.452
The truth is lost amid countless rumors.

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:46.748
-Did I just say…
-Did you just say…

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.624
"lost"?

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:12.982
YI YEOL
GRAND PRINCE DOWOL

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.235
I told you,

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.322
when you're lost in the case,
you can always come to me.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:23.659
He has good ears.

00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:25.828
It's good to see you again,
Your Highness.

00:04:25.912 --> 00:04:27.121
It has been a long time.

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:30.500
That said,

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:34.128
the moral order has collapsed.
This is no small matter.

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:38.132
Please have a seat here.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.303
I know we're both busy,
so let us dispense with formalities.

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:45.848
And there is no need for thanks.

00:04:45.932 --> 00:04:49.602
This isn't the first time I've
shared my wisdom with you thick-heads.

00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:53.815
We are deeply grateful
for your constant help

00:04:53.898 --> 00:04:55.316
with our investigations.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:01.989
The great thief
who stole ten thousand seok of rice?

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.659
-Who are the victims?
-There are none.

00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:09.080
Those crooked officials
couldn't come forward,

00:05:09.163 --> 00:05:10.832
afraid their own sins would be exposed.

00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:12.625
They just chose not to.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:15.753
-And I wouldn't either, if I were them.
-Why is that?

00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:18.881
Someone reported
that they saw Gil-dong here,

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:20.383
at the Chief Censor's storehouse.

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:21.300
That's right.

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:24.720
One of our slaves
saw something suspicious.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.063
The storehouse is already full again.

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:36.440
The Chief Censor
must be blessed with fortune,

00:05:36.524 --> 00:05:38.025
though he doesn't seem like it.

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.110
Well, the truth is…

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:41.070
You couldn't find anything stolen.

00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:44.115
That's right, sir.
Everything is exactly as it was.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.576
-Search the place.
-Yes, sir.

00:05:56.502 --> 00:05:57.753
I found it!

00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:06.429
It looks like a bowl of rice.

00:06:06.512 --> 00:06:10.057
-Did Gil-dong leave this drawing?
-Yes, Your Highness.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.856
Could it be…

00:06:18.357 --> 00:06:19.358
Weigh the rice now.

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.325
How much is missing?

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:32.330
One sack should fill an entire jar,
but exactly three does are missing.

00:06:34.123 --> 00:06:37.919
That means Gil-dong stole
just three does of rice.

00:06:38.002 --> 00:06:41.380
This is why his thefts
were usually discovered much later.

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:45.259
And even when it's discovered,
the amount is too small to report.

00:06:46.427 --> 00:06:49.388
Has anyone claimed to have received
the stolen goods from Gil-dong?

00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:51.182
Not a single one.

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:55.186
He's just a petty thief
who steals for himself.

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:59.190
And people speak of him
as a righteous thief.

00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:04.445
Are there

00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:06.614
more of his drawings, like this?

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.868
Why does he leave these drawings?

00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:13.079
If he didn't, no one would ever notice.

00:07:13.162 --> 00:07:14.580
That's what I'm talking about.

00:07:14.664 --> 00:07:16.749
It's like he's messing with us.

00:07:16.832 --> 00:07:18.042
Well, apparently,

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:20.044
he's proud of his thefts.

00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:21.671
Humans, by nature,

00:07:21.754 --> 00:07:24.006
affirm their sense of worth
by revealing their strengths.

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:27.093
Oh, I get it.

00:07:27.176 --> 00:07:29.262
Just like how you gather
all the court ladies to brag

00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:31.889
every time you solve a case.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.018
It means he's the kind of man
who craves attention as well.

00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:38.271
Is that a question or a criticism?

00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:40.022
I wouldn't dare. It's a mere question.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:41.774
No more questions from now on.

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:45.820
I get why you spread out the drawings.

00:07:50.074 --> 00:07:51.033
Gil-dong wants

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:53.911
to brag about his thefts everywhere.

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:59.083
And there are rumors
calling him a righteous thief.

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.419
He must be puffed up with pride.

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.630
Well, who do you think
started those rumors?

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:05.548
No way.

00:08:06.424 --> 00:08:07.300
Gil-dong.

00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:12.179
Seize those spreading the rumors.

00:08:12.263 --> 00:08:14.223
The false rumors
are covering up the thefts,

00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:16.183
so that's where we'll find the culprit.

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:17.476
Yes, Your Highness.

00:08:19.937 --> 00:08:21.522
Your Highness,

00:08:21.606 --> 00:08:24.483
aren't you supposed to have tea
with the Queen Dowager around 4:00?

00:08:25.318 --> 00:08:26.736
Why are you saying that now?

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:27.945
You said no more questions--

00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:30.489
Don't you know
how to say things as a statement?

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.137
Hey, wake up.

00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:55.222
Wake up!

00:08:57.558 --> 00:08:58.768
Is His Majesty here?

00:08:58.851 --> 00:09:00.353
It's another Majesty!

00:09:00.436 --> 00:09:01.479
What?

00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:04.106
Your Majesty!

00:09:05.775 --> 00:09:07.276
Why did it have to be you?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.487
Couldn't you have made it
more convincing at least?

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:12.114
I'm here to have tea with the Prince,

00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:15.326
so you should have made me think,
"My boy is taking a well-deserved nap"

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:18.537
and had me come back another time.

00:09:19.163 --> 00:09:20.831
That is what you are here for!

00:09:21.415 --> 00:09:23.584
We beg for mercy, Your Majesty!

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:28.756
His Majesty is keeping
a close watch on the Prince.

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:31.425
You people can't protect the Prince.

00:09:37.598 --> 00:09:39.433
Send word to my brother that

00:09:39.517 --> 00:09:41.268
we must hasten
Yeol's marriage arrangements.

00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:42.645
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:07.253
YI GYU
THE KING OF JOSEON

00:10:08.838 --> 00:10:11.507
They're trying to marry Yeol
to the Chief Censor's daughter?

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:13.759
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:14.677
If that happens,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.389
the Chief Censor will start
protecting Grand Prince Dowol.

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:21.475
As if everyone's out
to get the Grand Prince.

00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:23.185
Her Majesty frets too much.

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:26.647
This is all because I failed
to earn Her Majesty's trust.

00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:28.023
It is my fault.

00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.651
That is not true, Your Majesty.

00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:32.236
Secretary Im.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.489
What do you think I should do
to appease Her Majesty?

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.326
IM SA-HYEONG
CHIEF ROYAL SECRETARY

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.664
I have a family in mind
for Grand Prince Dowol's marriage.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.916
The Commander-in-Chief in Goryeo--

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.501
I'm sure you know what you're doing.

00:10:48.252 --> 00:10:51.255
It's my younger brother's marriage,
so see to it personally.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:05.019
A military clan from Goryeo?
I wonder what they're doing now.

00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:08.314
They must be growing rice
somewhere in the countryside.

00:11:08.397 --> 00:11:11.942
What a sly fox you are.

00:11:12.026 --> 00:11:14.320
If I'm a fox, what are you, Geum-nok?

00:11:15.446 --> 00:11:16.864
GEUM-NOK
SUK-YONG

00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:19.825
I'm a nine-tailed fox, of course.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.382
Your Majesty.

00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:39.261
SHIN YEO-GYEONG
QUEEN CONSORT

00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:42.932
I hear my niece and
the Chief Secretary's son got engaged.

00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:43.933
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:47.102
The Im family is seeking to expand
its influence through marriage ties.

00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:51.565
Everyone knows their scheme,
yet there is no one to stop it.

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:53.150
It is truly grievous.

00:11:54.944 --> 00:11:55.986
Oh, Geum-nok!

00:12:01.158 --> 00:12:03.661
It tickles, Your Majesty!

00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:06.872
I am deeply sorry

00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:10.000
that such grievous misfortunes
keep befalling Your Majesty.

00:12:11.126 --> 00:12:13.045
But please do not be disheartened.

00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:16.340
My son will will look after your niece

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:18.592
with the greatest care.

00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:22.179
IM JAE-I
IM SA-HYEONG'S SECOND SON

00:12:31.647 --> 00:12:33.649
THE TALE OF SUKHYANG

00:12:35.484 --> 00:12:37.361
SHIN HAE-RIM
THE QUEEN CONSORT'S NIECE

00:12:43.576 --> 00:12:45.411
They call this erotic?

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:47.705
It's too bland.

00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:41.550
Well.

00:13:41.634 --> 00:13:43.677
It looks like we're really destined.

00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:45.304
Pardon?

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.642
I didn't expect to meet my fiancée here.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.813
Wait, are you…

00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:57.524
My father is the Chief Royal Secretary.

00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:02.071
This is the woman who is to be my wife.
Pay your respects.

00:14:02.154 --> 00:14:04.323
Hello, I'm No-eul.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.117
And this woman here will be my concubine.

00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:09.119
No, maybe you already are.

00:14:10.704 --> 00:14:13.707
If we went by who undressed first,
I would be the consort,

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:16.627
but I'll let you have that place.

00:14:19.338 --> 00:14:22.007
It's great to see my wives get along.

00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:24.593
Now that we're all here,
why don't we have a drink?

00:14:24.677 --> 00:14:25.970
We'll be family.

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:27.513
That sounds lovely.

00:14:28.597 --> 00:14:32.977
I should get going.
My brother is probably waiting for me.

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:45.322
Why don't you marry her,
instead of tormenting that lovely woman?

00:14:45.406 --> 00:14:46.573
Marriage is a gamble.

00:14:46.657 --> 00:14:49.827
-I want to win far more than what I stake.
-What?

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.454
In this country, from kings to slaves,

00:14:52.538 --> 00:14:56.750
everyone uses marriage
to secure wealth, honor, power,

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:58.085
and higher status.

00:14:58.836 --> 00:15:01.296
So I might as well play for higher stakes.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.883
She's the Queen Consort's niece.
What could possibly be a higher stake?

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:06.927
Something like…

00:15:08.929 --> 00:15:09.763
love.

00:15:12.516 --> 00:15:13.934
How typical.

00:15:14.018 --> 00:15:17.187
You highborn are all the same.

00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.940
Yes, I'm trying to put together
a typical charade.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.652
I have expectations to meet, after all.

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:30.367
Stay healthy, okay?

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.244
-Sir.
-Hello.

00:15:32.327 --> 00:15:34.538
I'm here to pick up the herbs I asked for.

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:36.081
Sure. Just wait a second.

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:54.349
I'm back, Young Master.

00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:58.312
-Wait, stop there.
-Yes?

00:15:59.855 --> 00:16:03.150
I told you not to come in
wearing that physician's robe,

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:04.943
reeking of my patients.

00:16:05.986 --> 00:16:07.529
I meant to change first,

00:16:07.613 --> 00:16:10.074
but things were hectic
at the Hyeminseo today.

00:16:10.783 --> 00:16:13.702
Do you think bringing home some money
suddenly makes you someone?

00:16:13.786 --> 00:16:15.037
But I'm your family's slave.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.622
-So what?
-What do you mean?

00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:18.415
Could a slave be someone?

00:16:20.834 --> 00:16:22.377
-Of course not.
-Exactly.

00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:23.712
Right.

00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:28.092
You're just being mean for no reason.

00:16:29.384 --> 00:16:31.386
How dare you talk back to me?

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:40.562
Where did she go?

00:16:41.647 --> 00:16:42.523
Mother!

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.506
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:10.759
I know you're tired. Give it to me.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.432
Look at how dirty
the young master's socks are.

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:19.852
Is he secretly seeing a woman
at night or what?

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:24.314
Don't say that. He's not even married.

00:17:25.858 --> 00:17:27.943
I'll hang them.

00:17:28.026 --> 00:17:29.862
You go back and take the medicine.

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.071
Let's do it together.

00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:34.199
Come on.
You need to take it while it's hot.

00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:35.576
Come on.

00:17:45.961 --> 00:17:48.005
HONG MIN-JIK
HONG EUN-JO'S FATHER

00:17:48.672 --> 00:17:50.090
Eun-jo, come to my room.

00:17:54.386 --> 00:17:56.305
What is it you wish to say, my lord?

00:17:57.764 --> 00:18:01.018
You can call me "Father" at home,
as I said.

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:05.022
How can I? I'm a concubine's daughter.

00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:07.191
People would point fingers at you
if they heard that.

00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:18.744
What is this?

00:18:19.494 --> 00:18:22.873
From now on, wear these
whenever you go to Secretary Im's house.

00:18:24.249 --> 00:18:26.668
Where did you get the money
to buy the silk clothes?

00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:28.795
No, actually,

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:32.549
why would you want me to wear these
when I go to his house?

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:35.594
You must be aware

00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:37.679
that his eldest son
has taken no concubine.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.726
We will have your wedding soon.

00:18:46.355 --> 00:18:48.523
I humbly beg you, please call it off.

00:18:49.107 --> 00:18:52.861
I wish to live here with you and Mother
for the rest of my life.

00:18:54.488 --> 00:18:55.614
My foolish child.

00:18:55.697 --> 00:18:59.409
No parent would wish their child
to grow old alone.

00:18:59.493 --> 00:19:02.162
It's time for you to live a woman's life.

00:19:03.205 --> 00:19:05.290
I have never wanted a woman's life.

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:14.841
You have suffered enough in this house.

00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:16.760
You have had enough.

00:19:21.974 --> 00:19:23.684
You may be a concubine's child,

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:26.228
but I wish them to treat you with respect.

00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:27.980
That's why I prepared these.

00:19:28.063 --> 00:19:29.439
So be sure to wear them.

00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:47.749
The officer at the constabulary
will be reprimanded.

00:19:50.294 --> 00:19:52.212
Why not first fault the Prince

00:19:52.296 --> 00:19:54.798
for lingering about the constabulary?

00:19:56.633 --> 00:19:59.094
It was all for the security of the capital

00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:02.681
and ultimately,
for the people and you as well, Mother.

00:20:02.764 --> 00:20:03.849
Don't worry about me.

00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:07.769
From now on,
live for one woman, not for me.

00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:17.112
Marry the Chief Censor's daughter.
His family will be a great support to you.

00:20:27.456 --> 00:20:28.540
Yes, Mother.

00:20:30.542 --> 00:20:31.918
So you're doing it?

00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:34.963
But let me meet her first.

00:20:35.797 --> 00:20:37.299
I need to know about her personality.

00:20:37.382 --> 00:20:40.260
I want to see if she's reliable,
and most of all,

00:20:40.344 --> 00:20:41.511
if she's beautiful.

00:20:41.595 --> 00:20:44.473
No, that is not how it's done.

00:20:44.556 --> 00:20:48.060
I guess Gil-dong robbing that house
wasn't for nothing after all.

00:20:51.688 --> 00:20:55.025
Have you made any progress
in catching that thief, Gil-dong?

00:20:55.108 --> 00:20:58.362
I heard he robbed your storehouse too,
so I've been keeping a close eye on it.

00:20:58.445 --> 00:21:02.532
I'm so relieved to hear that,
Your Highness.

00:21:06.995 --> 00:21:10.624
Please excuse the humble refreshments.
I didn't expect your visit today.

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:14.336
The refreshments at our palace
pale in comparison to this.

00:21:15.879 --> 00:21:18.632
So I had a look around the storehouse,

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:21.009
and I couldn't quite see…

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.011
Now, I see it.

00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:29.017
This is my daughter.

00:21:30.018 --> 00:21:31.061
Pay your respects.

00:21:31.144 --> 00:21:32.646
This is Grand Prince Dowol.

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:35.440
I am Jin, of the Kim Family.

00:21:35.524 --> 00:21:38.193
-Does your name "Jin" mean "beauty"?
-Yes, Your Highness.

00:21:38.276 --> 00:21:40.278
My name is Yi Yeol.
"Yeol" means "happiness."

00:21:40.362 --> 00:21:43.532
It seems like the two of us
are living up to our names.

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:03.677
Why don't we go hunting together sometime?

00:22:04.678 --> 00:22:06.555
I was sheltered,
can't stand anything rough.

00:22:06.638 --> 00:22:08.140
Stabbing, killing…

00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:10.475
anything involving blood
just doesn't appeal to me.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.230
Is that something you fancy?

00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:19.025
As a woman,
I certainly do not fancy seeing blood.

00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:20.360
What a shame.

00:22:20.444 --> 00:22:23.113
Because that's what you need
to become a Grand Prince's wife.

00:22:23.196 --> 00:22:26.116
Rivalry and intrigue are fundamental
to life in the royal court.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.202
-Your Highness.
-There's no need for pretense.

00:22:29.286 --> 00:22:30.912
It will only embarrass us both.

00:22:33.832 --> 00:22:36.042
If you give birth to a prince,

00:22:36.126 --> 00:22:38.128
he would be deemed a threat
to the crown prince.

00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:40.172
You may witness your child poisoned,

00:22:40.255 --> 00:22:42.382
or murdered under the guise of suicide.

00:22:43.592 --> 00:22:45.427
But I suppose you know that much.

00:22:46.928 --> 00:22:48.805
-In case of a conspiracy--
-Your Highness.

00:22:48.889 --> 00:22:51.099
Your words can be heard beyond the fence.

00:22:51.183 --> 00:22:52.934
Even if, after a bloody power struggle,

00:22:53.018 --> 00:22:56.229
I were to ascend the throne
and you were to become Queen Consort,

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.481
you would soon be deposed.

00:23:00.275 --> 00:23:01.818
And why would that be?

00:23:02.986 --> 00:23:05.030
Your family may be wealthy,

00:23:05.113 --> 00:23:06.781
but it holds no real power.

00:23:07.824 --> 00:23:10.160
I don't think your family
can guard the Queen's palace.

00:23:10.243 --> 00:23:11.578
But Your Highness--

00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:13.788
A king cannot be a husband.

00:23:14.456 --> 00:23:16.333
A king doesn't protect his woman.

00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:19.753
He protects his throne.

00:23:20.754 --> 00:23:22.422
Your father must know.

00:23:23.632 --> 00:23:26.218
Because he is the one
who deposed His Majesty's mother.

00:23:32.974 --> 00:23:35.602
Why did you refuse
the Chief Secretary's daughter?

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:38.647
Brother!

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.399
Come now.

00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:43.735
I told you not to call me Brother.

00:23:43.818 --> 00:23:44.819
Yes, Your Highness.

00:23:45.862 --> 00:23:49.908
But why can I not call you Brother?
You are my brother.

00:23:52.494 --> 00:23:55.622
Because our mother isn't my mother.

00:23:57.123 --> 00:23:59.918
My birth mother is the deposed queen,
cast out of the palace

00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:01.461
by political strife.

00:24:03.505 --> 00:24:05.715
Do you understand what this means, Yeol?

00:24:07.842 --> 00:24:09.928
It means you and I are enemies.

00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:15.725
So, Yeol,

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:18.478
keep your brilliance
hidden from the world.

00:24:19.354 --> 00:24:22.732
Keep yourself from my sight,
and do nothing,

00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:24.401
unless

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:27.570
you want to lose your mother like me.

00:24:30.824 --> 00:24:32.450
I could not protect my mother,

00:24:33.034 --> 00:24:35.328
but you must protect yours.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:42.877
To me, marriage is

00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:44.796
a place of refuge.

00:24:45.463 --> 00:24:46.965
Do you wish to go into hiding?

00:24:48.174 --> 00:24:50.427
I must remain as unnoticed as possible.

00:24:51.136 --> 00:24:54.514
Well, you certainly want to remain
unnoticed by Her Majesty today.

00:24:56.641 --> 00:24:58.018
Do you think she'll kill me?

00:24:58.101 --> 00:24:59.769
She definitely will, right?

00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:04.649
Oh, my goodness!

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.776
Your Highness.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.487
I'm so sorry!

00:25:09.571 --> 00:25:10.780
Am I dead already?

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.160
I'm smelling death.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.289
Dae-chu, what's this hole for?

00:25:19.372 --> 00:25:20.957
Is it for breathability?

00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:23.418
It's just ragged.

00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:24.627
What?

00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:27.964
They were the only clothes I could borrow.
Since we were rushing…

00:25:29.132 --> 00:25:31.718
I am not going anywhere looking like this.

00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:35.221
If you make me wear these rags
for more than an hour,

00:25:35.305 --> 00:25:36.848
you will pay dearly for it.

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:40.935
I'll run to the palace and be right back!

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:07.253
-Did you see my grandfather?
-Yes, sir.

00:26:08.671 --> 00:26:12.967
My father says my grandfather's bedsores
and complexion have improved greatly

00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:14.969
since you began treating him.

00:26:16.179 --> 00:26:19.224
I'm just doing
what I have been doing back in Hyeminseo.

00:26:21.434 --> 00:26:23.395
Give her a little more
than her usual fee today.

00:26:23.478 --> 00:26:24.521
Yes, sir.

00:26:26.898 --> 00:26:27.816
Excuse me, sir.

00:26:32.529 --> 00:26:34.781
About our marriage…

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.243
One.

00:26:39.077 --> 00:26:40.203
One.

00:26:41.371 --> 00:26:42.497
One.

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:44.833
One.

00:27:00.765 --> 00:27:02.851
How dare a lowlife like you
speak to me like that?

00:27:02.934 --> 00:27:05.061
Do I look like a lowlife to you?

00:27:06.187 --> 00:27:08.231
Even filthy water and ragged clothes

00:27:08.314 --> 00:27:11.025
cannot conceal my nobility
and elegant bearing.

00:27:11.109 --> 00:27:13.153
This rude wretch!

00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:16.698
Look, you keep calling me wretch.

00:27:16.781 --> 00:27:17.991
You wretch!

00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:19.534
Are you asking for trouble?

00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:28.376
You must have really lost your mind.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.963
This is against the moral order.
Come with me to the constabulary.

00:27:32.046 --> 00:27:34.966
My goodness. That mad wretch
is earning himself a hundred lashes.

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:38.052
That mad slave is digging his own grave.

00:27:39.512 --> 00:27:40.555
Follow me.

00:27:42.807 --> 00:27:43.850
What?

00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:47.103
Let go of me.

00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:48.646
Let me lead the way.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.149
As a matter of fact,
I frequent the constabulary.

00:27:51.816 --> 00:27:53.443
So let me lead the way.

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:56.946
It seems like
I need to beat some sense into you!

00:28:21.262 --> 00:28:22.388
Where did he go?

00:28:24.724 --> 00:28:25.600
Who are you?

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.979
Sir,

00:28:30.063 --> 00:28:32.690
please do not soil your noble hands.

00:28:32.774 --> 00:28:34.651
This man is a slave.

00:28:34.734 --> 00:28:36.194
A slave?

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:38.988
This is none of your concern.

00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:44.619
He's right. Please step back, my lady.

00:28:44.702 --> 00:28:47.747
This madman doesn't know what he is doing.

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:50.124
Please show the generosity of a nobleman.

00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:54.712
A nobleman's generosity
isn't for lowly slaves.

00:28:56.548 --> 00:29:00.093
It is thanks to lowly slaves
who till the land and harvest the crops

00:29:00.677 --> 00:29:03.012
that you can wear such fine clothes

00:29:03.096 --> 00:29:05.974
and appear so well-fed
and radiant as you do.

00:29:06.724 --> 00:29:08.476
And if this slaves dies,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.019
who's going to feed the cows?

00:29:11.437 --> 00:29:14.107
Is he from your household, my lady?

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.358
"My lady"?

00:29:16.192 --> 00:29:17.068
Oh, "my lady."

00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:18.820
Right. Yes.

00:29:18.903 --> 00:29:21.281
He is my slave.

00:29:21.364 --> 00:29:22.782
Who? Me?

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:25.785
Ever since

00:29:25.869 --> 00:29:29.622
my grandfather passed away,
our family fell on hard times.

00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:31.875
So every hand we have is precious.

00:29:31.958 --> 00:29:34.252
But then he fell from a pear tree

00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:36.337
and completely lost his mind.

00:29:37.005 --> 00:29:38.840
So I always have to keep an eye on him.

00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:43.761
I bet it's a lot of work.

00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:47.974
My apologies. Please punish me instead.

00:29:50.643 --> 00:29:53.021
No, that wouldn't be necessary.

00:29:53.104 --> 00:29:55.356
Of course, it isn't.

00:29:57.984 --> 00:30:00.194
Don't apologize without my permission.

00:30:00.278 --> 00:30:01.988
Especially when it's on my behalf.

00:30:03.072 --> 00:30:06.576
No one would dare punish me.

00:30:07.911 --> 00:30:10.580
Also, I'm not anyone's slave--

00:30:14.626 --> 00:30:16.753
What happened to my knees?

00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:20.340
Who did this to my knees?

00:30:23.968 --> 00:30:25.470
Did you kick me to my knees?

00:30:27.513 --> 00:30:29.807
Look. I'm this country's--

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:34.479
He's been saying

00:30:34.562 --> 00:30:36.940
he's possessed by a general's spirit
for the past few days.

00:30:37.023 --> 00:30:40.026
And he keeps yelling like this.

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:42.320
Be quiet.

00:30:42.403 --> 00:30:45.156
Does this slave
really belong to your family?

00:30:45.657 --> 00:30:46.699
Yes.

00:30:46.783 --> 00:30:48.660
He does.

00:30:48.743 --> 00:30:50.370
He's my slave girl…

00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:51.287
-Girl?
-Girl?

00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:52.705
Slave boy!

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:54.707
Boy. He's my slave boy.

00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:56.292
Slave boy?

00:30:58.336 --> 00:30:59.587
Hello, Seung-baek.

00:31:01.339 --> 00:31:02.840
Young Master?

00:31:02.924 --> 00:31:04.801
If they find out I'm a slave, I'm done.

00:31:05.677 --> 00:31:08.471
Thank you for forgiving us.
Now, please excuse us.

00:31:11.557 --> 00:31:14.352
Let go.
I do not want you to regret anything.

00:31:15.103 --> 00:31:17.689
Please, I don't want
to be beaten to death.

00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:19.774
-Death?
-Yes. Come on. Let's go.

00:31:21.275 --> 00:31:22.777
What's all this fuss about?

00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:25.738
It was some madman.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.534
He looks familiar.

00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:44.924
Will you let go now?
I don't think they're following us.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.594
Why did you run?

00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:51.097
Well, my young master…

00:31:52.557 --> 00:31:54.267
Wait a minute.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.727
You know I saved your life, right?

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.645
It's his life that was spared.

00:31:59.022 --> 00:31:59.897
Oh, my.

00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:04.193
You weren't just pretending
to be a madman.

00:32:04.277 --> 00:32:05.278
A madman?

00:32:05.987 --> 00:32:09.365
Weren't you pretending to be mad
to escape punishment?

00:32:10.283 --> 00:32:12.201
There was no one at the market earlier

00:32:12.285 --> 00:32:14.370
who could dare punish me.

00:32:14.454 --> 00:32:15.997
This man is seriously mad.

00:32:19.208 --> 00:32:20.710
I can't believe how I look either.

00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:22.378
I refuse to explain further.

00:32:22.462 --> 00:32:24.672
I refuse to help you further too.

00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:26.382
-Farewell.
-Not so fast.

00:32:27.842 --> 00:32:29.510
There's something I need to know.

00:32:33.222 --> 00:32:36.100
What did you mean when you said
you would be beaten to death?

00:32:36.184 --> 00:32:38.019
That's why I followed you here,

00:32:38.102 --> 00:32:39.896
so you'd better explain.

00:32:39.979 --> 00:32:41.647
Of course it means that

00:32:41.731 --> 00:32:44.525
once they find out it was a lie,
we would both be punished…

00:32:45.318 --> 00:32:47.028
If I tell him I'm a slave as well,

00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:48.821
he'll be utterly shocked.

00:32:49.697 --> 00:32:51.491
Because you're not my slave.

00:32:51.574 --> 00:32:54.327
I was trying to avoid punishment
for my lie. That's what I meant.

00:32:54.994 --> 00:32:56.996
So why get involved in the first place?

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:01.292
Your punishment
would not have ended with you.

00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:04.212
Your mother, your father
and even your relatives

00:33:04.295 --> 00:33:05.838
would have gotten lashes.

00:33:07.507 --> 00:33:08.925
What a nosy woman.

00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:11.552
I know.

00:33:12.512 --> 00:33:14.597
My nosiness is one of the few blessings

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:17.892
I was born with.

00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:19.143
I don't like it either.

00:33:20.186 --> 00:33:21.479
What are the rest?

00:33:22.188 --> 00:33:25.858
Poverty, misery, sadness and tears.

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:31.364
Of all my misfortunes,
the one blessing I have

00:33:31.447 --> 00:33:32.573
is my mother.

00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:43.709
And my father.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.509
Why is he looking at me like that?

00:33:52.677 --> 00:33:54.178
I should stop answering him and go.

00:33:54.262 --> 00:33:55.096
I'll get going now.

00:34:06.983 --> 00:34:08.526
My silk clothes…

00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:10.111
I can't let them get wet.

00:34:26.752 --> 00:34:28.254
You're quite nimble.

00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:30.464
I have never been rained upon in my life.

00:34:31.174 --> 00:34:33.801
-You may not believe me, but it's true.
-Sure.

00:34:33.885 --> 00:34:35.553
Because, if I were to fall ill,

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:37.597
several physicians
would be held to account.

00:34:38.431 --> 00:34:40.600
You may not believe this either,
but it is true.

00:34:40.683 --> 00:34:41.767
Sure.

00:34:41.851 --> 00:34:43.561
-You don't believe me, do you?
-No.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.461
What are you doing?

00:35:09.587 --> 00:35:10.963
I don't want them to get muddy.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:16.093
These are the first silk shoes and dress
I have ever had.

00:35:17.803 --> 00:35:19.305
Is your family that badly off?

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:22.892
Even so, a young lady
shouldn't so easily bare her feet.

00:35:24.435 --> 00:35:26.312
What's the big deal?

00:35:41.702 --> 00:35:43.037
What are you doing?

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.165
You may not know this
because you haven't been rained upon,

00:35:46.249 --> 00:35:48.209
but being in the rain,

00:35:48.292 --> 00:35:51.295
it feels as though
all your sorrow is washed away.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.006
I don't believe you.

00:35:58.219 --> 00:35:59.595
It really does.

00:36:00.513 --> 00:36:02.223
You may not believe it though.

00:37:04.785 --> 00:37:06.787
Is it rain that just hit my back?

00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:08.539
I think it was a thunderbolt.

00:37:10.082 --> 00:37:13.627
I wish the thunderbolt hit your mouth too.

00:37:14.378 --> 00:37:15.588
It's…

00:37:15.671 --> 00:37:18.049
It's so cold. I can't move.

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:26.766
Take it off.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.934
I see what you're doing.

00:37:29.894 --> 00:37:32.855
You need to wring the water out of it
so it dries quickly.

00:37:38.778 --> 00:37:41.906
Don't be so dramatic. It's just some rain.

00:37:41.989 --> 00:37:44.700
This is the first time
cold water has touched my body.

00:37:44.784 --> 00:37:47.703
My body has only ever touched
warm water fragrant with flowers.

00:37:49.622 --> 00:37:52.625
Well, no one asked you to go stand there.

00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:54.835
You said
those were your only silk clothes.

00:38:00.591 --> 00:38:02.510
You weren't born with many blessings.

00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:05.679
You might as well avoid the rain.

00:38:11.727 --> 00:38:12.603
Well…

00:38:13.854 --> 00:38:14.939
Thank you.

00:38:15.815 --> 00:38:18.567
"Thank you"?
You're supposed to say "I'm honored…"

00:38:24.198 --> 00:38:27.410
Pardon me. Did you see a man sitting here?

00:38:28.202 --> 00:38:30.871
This is bad. He hates rain.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.925
Do you not know how to do it?

00:38:44.218 --> 00:38:46.262
My hands are not meant for tying knots.

00:38:57.022 --> 00:38:59.525
You have never been rained upon

00:38:59.608 --> 00:39:01.402
nor tied a knot on your jacket.

00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:02.736
What do you even do?

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.656
Nothing. It's a very important task.

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:07.700
So that's how you lost your mind.

00:39:19.378 --> 00:39:21.255
It seems the rain has stopped.

00:39:31.891 --> 00:39:32.850
I'm good.

00:39:32.933 --> 00:39:33.976
I'm throwing them away.

00:39:34.059 --> 00:39:37.271
I will not let that foul-smelling thing
touch my body.

00:39:38.647 --> 00:39:40.941
He's a madman.
Let's not waste words on him.

00:39:41.025 --> 00:39:43.319
Since you threw them away, I'll take them.

00:39:47.406 --> 00:39:48.991
What is your father's name?

00:39:50.117 --> 00:39:53.162
Your family may be in decline,
but it still has a name.

00:39:54.455 --> 00:39:56.415
Should I just tell him the truth now?

00:39:56.499 --> 00:39:58.584
That I'm a slave like him?

00:39:59.793 --> 00:40:01.754
Her face has hardened.

00:40:01.837 --> 00:40:03.964
Has her family been completely wiped out?

00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:09.303
Never mind, if you don't want to say it,
but do this for me.

00:40:10.262 --> 00:40:13.140
On the day of the full moon,
come to Soha Village around 6:00.

00:40:15.476 --> 00:40:17.186
Why should I do that?

00:40:18.062 --> 00:40:20.856
I'd like to offer a generous reward
for your nosiness.

00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:23.817
These are enough for me.

00:40:23.901 --> 00:40:25.444
Well, then, take care.

00:40:27.613 --> 00:40:29.073
They're not enough for me.

00:40:30.574 --> 00:40:31.700
And I must

00:40:32.743 --> 00:40:33.994
see you

00:40:35.246 --> 00:40:36.288
once again.

00:40:39.416 --> 00:40:40.584
Please come.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.713
I will.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.933
Reward, my foot.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.396
A reward?

00:41:00.938 --> 00:41:04.066
You're getting a punishment
for treating me like a mad slave.

00:41:06.569 --> 00:41:08.862
Your Highness, you were here.

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:10.197
It's been over one hour.

00:41:13.367 --> 00:41:14.577
Father.

00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:18.122
Yes. Come in.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.299
Father, is Eun-jo getting married?

00:41:28.382 --> 00:41:32.219
That would mean even fewer wages
coming into this house.

00:41:32.303 --> 00:41:33.137
Enough.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.888
I heard you even bought her silk clothes.

00:41:34.972 --> 00:41:36.432
Where did you get the money?

00:41:37.516 --> 00:41:41.270
It's the money Eun-jo earned,
which I set aside little by little.

00:41:41.937 --> 00:41:43.564
I will sell those silk clothes.

00:41:43.647 --> 00:41:46.191
They're bought with a slave's money,
so they're mine.

00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:48.319
Get out of my room.

00:41:48.402 --> 00:41:50.321
You can't let Eun-jo go!

00:41:50.404 --> 00:41:51.363
Get out of my room!

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:28.859
I humbly beg you

00:42:28.942 --> 00:42:31.737
to postpone the wedding,
if only for a short while.

00:42:32.279 --> 00:42:34.198
I must look after my ailing mother.

00:42:35.908 --> 00:42:39.453
And ever since that incident,
my family is still badly off.

00:42:39.536 --> 00:42:42.039
We need the money I earn.

00:42:44.458 --> 00:42:47.795
I understand what you're saying,
but my grandfather has little time left.

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:50.673
Pardon?

00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:52.174
The Old Master, sir?

00:42:52.966 --> 00:42:54.718
My father does not wish

00:42:54.802 --> 00:42:57.221
his father to meet a lonely death.

00:42:57.304 --> 00:43:00.015
So he wanted to get him a concubine
who would look after him.

00:43:02.768 --> 00:43:04.353
The man I was to marry was…

00:43:05.604 --> 00:43:07.481
the Old Master?

00:43:08.941 --> 00:43:10.317
You seem displeased.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.822
Not at all, sir. I beg your pardon.

00:43:17.616 --> 00:43:19.451
Make that face again,

00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:23.372
and your entire family
will be cast out of that house.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.461
You should be grateful
that your father and I are friends.

00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:31.839
I am not like my father.

00:43:31.922 --> 00:43:34.049
I would have slain
every living creature in your house

00:43:34.133 --> 00:43:36.885
on the very day of the literati purge
if I were him.

00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:51.984
Keep a clear head.

00:43:52.067 --> 00:43:54.194
This marriage must happen, no matter what.

00:43:54.903 --> 00:43:58.282
In Joseon, marriage is a transaction
for everyone.

00:43:58.365 --> 00:44:01.577
From the king
down to a concubine's daughter like me.

00:44:02.244 --> 00:44:04.246
So I will weigh the terms as well.

00:44:06.623 --> 00:44:07.624
One.

00:44:10.753 --> 00:44:11.879
One.

00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:15.799
One.

00:44:17.384 --> 00:44:18.469
One.

00:44:43.243 --> 00:44:44.536
Is that the lord?

00:44:45.621 --> 00:44:47.080
Not even one nyang?

00:44:47.164 --> 00:44:49.625
It took me ten full nights
to transcribe them.

00:44:49.708 --> 00:44:51.210
The truth is…

00:44:51.293 --> 00:44:54.171
These four books have too many errors.

00:44:54.838 --> 00:44:56.590
Is that so?

00:44:56.673 --> 00:45:00.302
My eyesight has grown dim with age.

00:45:00.385 --> 00:45:02.596
Then deduct the errors from the payment.

00:45:03.889 --> 00:45:05.766
I'm sorry I couldn't pay you more.

00:45:05.849 --> 00:45:08.268
Don't worry. Thank you.

00:45:19.029 --> 00:45:21.281
Excuse me, sir. I have a question.

00:45:22.324 --> 00:45:26.036
When did the man who just left
start the transcription work?

00:45:26.119 --> 00:45:28.205
About a year ago.

00:45:28.288 --> 00:45:30.290
A year?

00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:34.294
It's good for coughs. Brew it and take it.

00:45:35.587 --> 00:45:37.381
How did you get this rare medicine?

00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:45.138
He is Lord Hong Min-jik.

00:45:45.222 --> 00:45:49.685
He spoke harsh truths to the king,
and was swept up in the literati purge.

00:45:49.768 --> 00:45:53.897
He was stripped of his post,
and all his property was confiscated.

00:45:57.568 --> 00:45:59.903
Eun-jo is here, my lord.

00:45:59.987 --> 00:46:01.405
Yes, come in.

00:46:09.079 --> 00:46:11.290
Are you coming from Secretary Im's house?

00:46:11.373 --> 00:46:12.541
You look beautiful.

00:46:12.624 --> 00:46:14.126
My lord.

00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:17.546
Is the man I am to marry--

00:46:17.629 --> 00:46:19.172
You mean, Seung-jae?

00:46:19.256 --> 00:46:20.132
What about him?

00:46:20.799 --> 00:46:22.259
Just as I thought,

00:46:22.342 --> 00:46:25.304
Father does not know
that the marriage is to the Old Master.

00:46:25.387 --> 00:46:28.765
He would never imagine
that it could be the Old Master.

00:46:29.933 --> 00:46:31.184
Never mind.

00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:43.113
I hear he even lives
in someone else's house.

00:46:43.196 --> 00:46:45.949
It is a shame that such a great man
met with such a fate.

00:46:46.033 --> 00:46:47.909
Make that face again,

00:46:47.993 --> 00:46:51.622
and your entire family
will be cast out of that house.

00:47:16.897 --> 00:47:21.276
Your Highness!

00:47:22.277 --> 00:47:23.362
Come in.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.326
A message has come from the constabulary.

00:47:30.452 --> 00:47:32.913
So they've caught onto Gil-dong.

00:47:33.664 --> 00:47:34.665
Gil-dong?

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:36.625
I don't know anything.

00:47:36.708 --> 00:47:39.044
I only know him
by what I've heard from others.

00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:41.672
If you cannot confess
who you heard it from,

00:47:41.755 --> 00:47:44.257
you may be punished as an offender.

00:47:45.092 --> 00:47:46.093
Pardon?

00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:51.098
You cannot be serious, sir.

00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:53.225
She's a woman.

00:47:53.308 --> 00:47:55.018
She's a widow with a child.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.271
I'm just saying.

00:48:01.358 --> 00:48:02.359
Well…

00:48:02.442 --> 00:48:05.737
I did see Gil-dong that night.

00:48:05.821 --> 00:48:10.325
He was jumping from roof to roof.

00:48:10.409 --> 00:48:11.660
It can't be her.

00:48:11.743 --> 00:48:14.788
You see a tiger and think it's a pig.
What do you know?

00:48:14.871 --> 00:48:16.123
What did you say?

00:48:17.332 --> 00:48:20.085
Tell me exactly what you saw
without exaggeration.

00:48:22.838 --> 00:48:24.798
He's a Baekjeong. I'm sure of it.

00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:31.805
What's that?

00:48:35.183 --> 00:48:38.311
I saw him only dimly, but I'm sure of it.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:41.022
He was wearing a Baekjeong's mask?

00:48:42.816 --> 00:48:43.775
Farewell, sir.

00:48:43.859 --> 00:48:45.610
Wait for me.

00:48:45.694 --> 00:48:47.571
Are you sure
you want to let the widow go?

00:48:50.031 --> 00:48:51.616
I'm letting her go for a reason.

00:48:54.411 --> 00:48:57.414
I saw him only dimly, but I'm sure of it.

00:48:58.123 --> 00:49:01.168
You see a tiger and think it's a pig.
What do you know?

00:49:01.877 --> 00:49:04.045
They seemed to be hiding Gil-dong.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:07.090
They must know him.

00:49:08.967 --> 00:49:09.968
You.

00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:12.888
-You'd better stop running your mouth.
-What?

00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:15.015
Well, you know why I ran my mouth.

00:49:15.098 --> 00:49:16.725
I said, wait for me.

00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:21.021
Prepare a wanted sketch of Gil-dong,
and keep a close watch on the widow.

00:49:21.104 --> 00:49:22.981
If we follow her closely,
we'll catch Gil-dong.

00:49:23.064 --> 00:49:24.149
Yes, Your Highness.

00:49:25.692 --> 00:49:27.444
Are you going back to the palace now?

00:49:28.278 --> 00:49:29.696
I have a plan for today.

00:49:30.238 --> 00:49:31.448
Please come.

00:49:32.199 --> 00:49:33.867
I will.

00:49:36.536 --> 00:49:38.914
Soon, it will be time for punishment.

00:49:43.251 --> 00:49:44.085
Eun-jo!

00:49:44.169 --> 00:49:47.506
I'm sorry I'm late.
Something urgently came up.

00:49:51.134 --> 00:49:52.427
The baby just fell asleep.

00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:53.845
Thank you.

00:49:53.929 --> 00:49:56.681
I will see you later at night.
I need to go somewhere.

00:49:56.765 --> 00:49:58.016
Very well. I'll see you.

00:50:09.528 --> 00:50:11.404
How do you do, my lord?

00:50:12.364 --> 00:50:13.365
Yes, Eun-jo.

00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:18.245
I have something to say.

00:50:24.125 --> 00:50:27.212
My lord. Please step outside.

00:50:37.013 --> 00:50:39.307
These are for Eun-jo's wedding.

00:50:44.104 --> 00:50:47.065
-Did Chief Secretary Im send these?
-Yes, my lord.

00:50:49.651 --> 00:50:52.571
Store them safely
and do not let anyone lay a hand on it.

00:50:59.995 --> 00:51:01.454
We will choose an auspicious day

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.957
and hold the wedding.

00:51:07.335 --> 00:51:08.753
My lord,

00:51:08.837 --> 00:51:11.882
all the wedding gifts have been delivered.

00:51:11.965 --> 00:51:14.050
Very well.

00:51:16.428 --> 00:51:18.138
Lord Hong is not aware

00:51:18.221 --> 00:51:21.016
that this marriage is

00:51:21.099 --> 00:51:22.392
to the Old Master.

00:51:23.935 --> 00:51:26.021
He must have misunderstood what I said.

00:51:27.022 --> 00:51:30.150
I know he adores you
even though you're a concubine's daughter.

00:51:30.775 --> 00:51:32.986
You may be a daughter to him,

00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:34.654
but to me, you're just a slave.

00:51:37.198 --> 00:51:39.826
Then please let him
keep misunderstanding it.

00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:42.871
Until the wedding day,

00:51:42.954 --> 00:51:46.374
please let my family believe
that I am to marry the young master.

00:51:47.167 --> 00:51:48.251
And why must I do so?

00:51:49.002 --> 00:51:50.879
Lord Hong is not the kind of father

00:51:50.962 --> 00:51:53.131
who would marry his daughter off

00:51:53.214 --> 00:51:55.508
to a widower in his seventies.

00:51:56.551 --> 00:52:00.513
You must know his character
as well, my lord.

00:52:01.348 --> 00:52:02.223
And

00:52:02.307 --> 00:52:04.517
if Lord Hong were not where he is now

00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:07.646
because of the literati purge,

00:52:07.729 --> 00:52:11.816
you would not have asked such a favor

00:52:13.318 --> 00:52:15.111
of a man who was once

00:52:16.237 --> 00:52:17.656
the Minister of War.

00:52:20.784 --> 00:52:23.536
Are you saying I dishonored your father?

00:52:26.164 --> 00:52:27.666
Very well. Go on.

00:52:28.375 --> 00:52:31.503
Let it be said that this marriage
was solely my own desire.

00:52:32.462 --> 00:52:36.383
My desire to live in comfort
under the protection of a powerful family.

00:52:38.343 --> 00:52:40.011
What a truly devoted daughter you are.

00:52:42.555 --> 00:52:44.099
I could never compare to you, my lord.

00:52:47.352 --> 00:52:50.730
My father will never rise
from his sickbed.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.566
That means

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:57.612
you will never be able
to live a woman's life.

00:52:57.696 --> 00:53:01.324
Does causing your father grief
concern you more than that?

00:53:02.283 --> 00:53:07.414
I would spend the rest of my life
living only with Lord Hong and my mother.

00:53:07.497 --> 00:53:10.834
I have no regrets,
even if I cannot live a woman's life.

00:53:12.585 --> 00:53:15.296
If you have such resolve,
why not refuse it?

00:53:17.132 --> 00:53:19.050
When Lord Hong's property was confiscated,

00:53:19.592 --> 00:53:22.679
you took in our household, my lord,

00:53:22.762 --> 00:53:26.975
and helped us keep our home at least.

00:53:27.058 --> 00:53:30.687
I'm merely grateful that
I can repay your kindness in this way.

00:53:31.771 --> 00:53:34.107
It's for her filial piety.

00:53:35.942 --> 00:53:37.736
Such a bright child

00:53:38.945 --> 00:53:41.322
was born to a concubine.

00:53:44.117 --> 00:53:45.785
He must have felt deep regret.

00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:00.341
I have nothing to lose in this deal.

00:54:01.468 --> 00:54:02.677
One.

00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:04.971
Both the house and Lord Hong are safe now.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:06.598
One.

00:54:06.681 --> 00:54:08.558
Mother can live a comfortable life now.

00:54:09.392 --> 00:54:10.268
One.

00:54:10.351 --> 00:54:12.437
I'm marrying into a powerful family.

00:54:13.271 --> 00:54:14.189
One.

00:54:14.272 --> 00:54:17.650
I have grown children
and even grandchildren now.

00:54:17.734 --> 00:54:18.568
One.

00:54:18.651 --> 00:54:20.779
And my husband will be…

00:54:23.406 --> 00:54:24.449
Eun-jo…

00:54:25.241 --> 00:54:29.162
I will take care of your mother,
so do not worry

00:54:29.245 --> 00:54:31.831
and live as a woman

00:54:32.624 --> 00:54:35.710
sharing a life of grace and love
with your husband.

00:54:41.341 --> 00:54:45.053
There is no marriage in Joseon
that trades in love.

00:54:46.763 --> 00:54:49.057
And it applies even less
to a slave like me.

00:55:03.196 --> 00:55:05.657
They say one feels unsettled
on the day before the wedding.

00:55:06.658 --> 00:55:08.159
Maybe that's true.

00:55:09.994 --> 00:55:11.329
That means

00:55:11.412 --> 00:55:14.457
you will never be able
to live a woman's life.

00:55:15.708 --> 00:55:18.294
Do I regret it now?

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.179
I didn't realize
I walked all the way here.

00:56:01.379 --> 00:56:04.299
What is he doing here?

00:56:04.382 --> 00:56:07.218
On the day of the full moon,
come to Soha Village around 6:00.

00:56:07.802 --> 00:56:09.137
That was today?

00:56:10.972 --> 00:56:13.808
Has he been waiting all along?

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.814
How did I end up here?

00:56:34.287 --> 00:56:35.496
How strange.

00:56:36.831 --> 00:56:38.333
Of all days,

00:56:40.585 --> 00:56:43.546
of all times,

00:56:44.839 --> 00:56:46.090
and

00:56:47.425 --> 00:56:48.635
of all people…

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.879
If I am no longer allowed
to live a woman's life…

00:57:27.882 --> 00:57:30.760
If tonight is my last chance…

00:57:50.572 --> 00:57:51.573
What took you so long?

00:57:51.656 --> 00:57:53.616
Do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting--

00:58:29.485 --> 00:58:30.486
That…

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.447
That would be my reward.

00:58:44.917 --> 00:58:46.002
Your Highness.

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.254
Your Highness.

00:58:48.338 --> 00:58:50.340
Why is your face red?

00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:52.467
I just got…

00:58:53.885 --> 00:58:55.553
robbed now.

00:58:57.221 --> 00:58:58.222
What did they steal?

00:59:00.016 --> 00:59:01.476
Well…

00:59:25.792 --> 00:59:27.627
I must have lost my mind.

00:59:29.003 --> 00:59:30.338
Why did I do that?

00:59:36.969 --> 00:59:38.179
Where did she go?

00:59:43.267 --> 00:59:45.019
Oh, dear. It's getting late.

00:59:45.103 --> 00:59:46.854
It's the curfew hour!

00:59:46.938 --> 00:59:48.356
Close the gates!

00:59:53.444 --> 00:59:55.780
Please forgive me
for my madness earlier today,

00:59:57.031 --> 01:00:00.159
and forgive me in advance
for my future nosiness.

01:00:13.673 --> 01:00:14.799
Maybe I missed her.

01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:51.043
You.

01:00:53.921 --> 01:00:55.548
I will catch you no matter what.

01:01:49.936 --> 01:01:52.855
Security is especially tight today.

01:01:52.939 --> 01:01:55.483
Gil-dong was the one
with the Baekjeong's mask.

01:01:55.566 --> 01:01:57.860
If the woman kissed first,

01:01:57.944 --> 01:01:59.362
it must be love.

01:01:59.445 --> 01:02:01.697
Well, I do have the looks for it.

01:02:01.781 --> 01:02:02.615
We must find him.

01:02:02.698 --> 01:02:05.618
Has anyone seen this woman?

01:02:05.701 --> 01:02:07.787
Why would you go to such lengths?

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.414
It's disgusting to see
a lowly concubine's daughter

01:02:10.498 --> 01:02:11.707
acting like his sister.

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:12.792
He saw a suspicious man.

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:15.002
Heading to Chief Secretary's storehouse?

01:02:15.086 --> 01:02:16.838
There you are, Gil-dong.

01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:20.883
