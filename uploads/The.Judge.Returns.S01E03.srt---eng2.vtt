WEBVTT

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:35.013
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.025
Ju-yeong, repeat it out loud after me.

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:50.779
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin...

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:55.868
"The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin..."

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:57.953
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.206
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.374
Say it louder!

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.625
Even louder! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:06.628
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:07.796
Even louder!

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.383
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.218
To death!

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.555
To death!

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.394
So ordered!

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.843
Mr. Lee?

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:08.690
Wow.

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:10.609
I'm so glad

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.194
you're alive.

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.198
Your hell begins now.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.137
EPISODE 3

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:53.568
You hit him on purpose, didn't you?

00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:55.279
I don't think so.

00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:57.114
I tried to slam on the brakes.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:02.286
I heard you sentencing him to death.

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:06.456
A judge shouldn't do this.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.375
Do I have to be nice, too?

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.544
Do prosecutors have to be nice?

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.478
How did you know
that Kim Sang-jin was a serial killer?

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:30.314
Criminals can't hide who they are.

00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:35.902
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.036
You want to be a prosecutor?

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.579
I've been a judge for years.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.039
Why would I quit now?

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.333
Your robe is still basically brand new.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:51.168
It's too early for you to talk like that.

00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:56.631
What I mean is, I haven't been
a judge for long enough

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:58.258
to consider a career change.

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.219
I'm going to stay under your supervision

00:04:01.303 --> 00:04:02.596
and be a judge forever.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:03.764
Who says?

00:04:04.806 --> 00:04:05.849
Hey

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:09.353
how did you know Kim Sang-jin was

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:10.687
a serial killer?

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.357
It's all thanks
to your wonderful teaching.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.816
My parents gave birth to me

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.070
but you raised me, sir.

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:19.154
What?

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:21.573
Do you take classes for that?

00:04:21.656 --> 00:04:23.033
I just do as I'm taught.

00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:25.410
Fine, don't tell me.

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:30.540
I have good and bad news.

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:31.708
I'll share the bad first.

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.210
- Why?
- Because I want to.

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:36.254
You may have arrested the murderer

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:38.799
but you know
you can't take his case, right?

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:41.009
A newbie judge like myself can only take

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:42.344
petty crime cases.

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:43.720
Serial killer cases are

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:45.514
for presiding judges and above.

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:48.850
The Chief Judge knows about the case

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:50.018
and is very pleased.

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:53.730
What?

00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:55.357
And the good news?

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:58.443
I told you. The Chief Judge
is pleased with your work.

00:04:58.944 --> 00:04:59.945
That's all you need.

00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:02.989
BAEK YI-SEOK, CHIEF JUDGE
AT CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:05.200
Corporations struggle most
with labor unions.

00:05:05.283 --> 00:05:07.285
For mere paid employees

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:08.995
they sure go on strikes a lot.

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:10.789
It's not only bad for corporates.

00:05:10.872 --> 00:05:12.958
Isn't it also a huge loss for the nation?

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:14.292
Don't you agree?

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:17.963
Here's my take.

00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:20.674
Violent and illegal strikes are

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:22.551
absolutely unacceptable.

00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:26.555
We should charge these strikers
billions of won for damage

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.057
and ruin all their families.

00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.269
So, what's your point?

00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:33.979
Oh, that being said

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.523
I think the case

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:39.067
of the illegal strike
by the PK Steel Labor Union

00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:41.027
under the Chungnam District Court

00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:44.239
deserves the harsh punishment
the prosecution requests.

00:05:44.322 --> 00:05:46.408
So, you've already gone
to the prosecution.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.911
Of course, we must follow the procedure
with public service work.

00:05:50.912 --> 00:05:52.414
I guess

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.003
PK Steel fed you some poison before that.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:00.964
What? Poison?

00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:04.176
I let you in
because you were an assemblyman

00:06:04.885 --> 00:06:07.554
and here you are,
trying to bribe the Chief Judge.

00:06:09.055 --> 00:06:11.266
Those in robes must protect

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.852
the law and conscience, not corporations.

00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:17.689
I can see why you got
on the bad side of the higher-ups

00:06:17.772 --> 00:06:19.149
and ended up here.

00:06:19.232 --> 00:06:21.735
You should learn to protect yourself

00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:23.612
before the invisible law and conscience.

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:24.779
Oh, and get a grip, too.

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:27.157
You're one to talk, Mr. Kim!

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.658
Look here, Chief Judge.

00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:30.452
I'm just telling you

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:31.661
because it seems to me

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.206
that we'll meet again in court soon
for your bribery case.

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.373
What did you just say?

00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:36.583
Get out.

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:40.837
When you're in court

00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:44.174
I'll be sure to sentence you much harsher
than the prosecutors.

00:06:45.217 --> 00:06:46.843
Go ahead.

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.137
I thought you'd understand.

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:51.014
Gosh.

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:05.487
Come right in.

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:20.293
Was he trying to bribe you?

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.128
Don't mind him.

00:07:22.212 --> 00:07:24.548
The world is full of jerks and garbage.

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:27.425
Which is why

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:30.178
I'm even happier
when I see a good junior colleague.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.721
Good work.

00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:32.931
Thank you, sir.

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:36.851
You deserve a present

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:39.104
for successfully tackling a big case.

00:07:39.437 --> 00:07:40.689
Do you want anything?

00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:42.524
This is an opportunity

00:07:42.607 --> 00:07:44.651
from Chief Judge Baek,
the Titan of the Judiciary.

00:07:44.734 --> 00:07:46.778
I must seize the opportunity
while it's here.

00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:48.947
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG BECOMES
THE SYMBOL OF JUSTICE

00:07:51.283 --> 00:07:52.325
JUDGE LEE'S PERSISTENT INVESTIGATION
UNCOVERS A MURDER CASE

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:53.910
IS JUDGE LEE MORE THAN JUST HARSH WORDS?

00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:57.497
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG ARRESTS
A SERIAL KILLER

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:01.876
What an interesting guy.

00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:06.214
But not good enough.

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:10.635
He just started as a sole judge.

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:13.305
And he hasn't joined Baek's side yet.

00:08:13.388 --> 00:08:15.140
That's not what I mean.

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:18.560
What would he have done
if he took this case as a judge?

00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:21.313
I'd like to continue

00:08:22.397 --> 00:08:23.815
taking Kim Sang-jin's case.

00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:30.488
Are you asking me to promote you
to a Presiding Judge?

00:08:31.656 --> 00:08:32.699
That's too soon.

00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:36.244
No, I'd like to be
the Reporting Judge for this case.

00:08:36.578 --> 00:08:37.829
In other words

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.748
you'd like to be demoted

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:42.083
if that's what it takes
to end the case yourself?

00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:43.918
Yes, sir.

00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:48.006
Alright.

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:51.343
Every judge should be
this noble and courageous.

00:08:53.428 --> 00:08:55.513
Judge Lim, the case is yours,
and so is Judge Lee.

00:08:56.097 --> 00:08:57.098
Yes, sir.

00:09:11.988 --> 00:09:13.114
How many cases

00:09:13.198 --> 00:09:14.949
has Haenal Law Firm taken recently?

00:09:15.283 --> 00:09:17.702
There have been 12 cases in total
since last year.

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:20.538
As directed, I made sure
the court ruled against them every time.

00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:23.208
There's just one merger case now.

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:24.459
Okay.

00:09:29.714 --> 00:09:31.049
Hello, sir.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.718
It's been a minute.

00:09:34.552 --> 00:09:35.887
There have been 12 cases

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:39.557
and you lost in every one of them.

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:42.560
I can't imagine
Haenal's reputation after that.

00:09:42.727 --> 00:09:43.728
I know.

00:09:44.479 --> 00:09:45.563
I'm ashamed.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.901
It's on me for hiring such weak lawyers.

00:11:01.848 --> 00:11:04.309
It's an issue to have
such incapable employees

00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:06.978
but it's not good for the owner

00:11:07.562 --> 00:11:09.981
to blame them entirely, either.

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:19.324
You're right.

00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:21.075
So

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:24.704
what should the owner do, then?

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:30.168
If you eat too quickly, you get heartburn.

00:11:31.419 --> 00:11:32.921
But if you just wait around...

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:47.519
you'll also lose in your 13th case.

00:12:02.283 --> 00:12:03.451
Please help me.

00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:17.215
Whether we flip the coin

00:12:18.466 --> 00:12:19.717
or set it straight

00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:23.179
doesn't it entirely depend
on whose hand it's in?

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.895
It's the same in court.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.253
Like this?

00:13:21.112 --> 00:13:22.947
Did you see Seon-cheol's face?

00:13:23.364 --> 00:13:25.450
When you swirled the soup with your spoon?

00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:26.784
No.

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:29.454
When I placed the sea cucumber
in his bowl.

00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:33.958
He seemed mortified.

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:36.794
He was about to throw up any minute.

00:13:37.295 --> 00:13:38.963
But what can he do about that?

00:13:39.589 --> 00:13:41.549
This is how you tame people.

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:44.135
Had we reached out to Haenal
from the start

00:13:44.218 --> 00:13:45.637
would he have taken my hand?

00:13:46.554 --> 00:13:49.474
No, he would've undermined you.

00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:50.642
Exactly.

00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:54.646
Smart people with all the wealth think

00:13:55.313 --> 00:13:57.815
they're the best
until they're put in their place.

00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:02.070
Let Haenal win in court this time.

00:14:02.862 --> 00:14:04.656
It's a reward for holding the coin right.

00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:08.993
I'll meet with the panel tomorrow.

00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:16.584
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:14:25.677 --> 00:14:27.261
His legs got completely wrecked.

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:29.514
I hear he'll be lame for life.

00:14:29.597 --> 00:14:31.349
That's his punishment.

00:14:31.432 --> 00:14:34.769
It's like the universe is
the prosecutor and the Justice.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.522
I know, right?

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:55.373
In my previous life,
I made a wrong call on my first case

00:14:55.748 --> 00:14:57.709
and that was the start of my nightmares.

00:14:59.544 --> 00:15:02.547
It's time to straighten that out.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.606
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:15:23.443 --> 00:15:26.237
This concludes my argument.

00:15:28.823 --> 00:15:30.575
She was just 20.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.995
She wasn't supposed to die

00:15:34.495 --> 00:15:36.080
so soon, just like that.

00:15:37.498 --> 00:15:38.583
So, tell me

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.334
why that bastard is still alive.

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:43.337
You hit him with your car.

00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:45.590
Why didn't you just kill him then?

00:15:46.424 --> 00:15:48.342
Because I'm not the one to judge him.

00:15:48.843 --> 00:15:50.511
It's the victim's family.

00:15:51.345 --> 00:15:52.346
What?

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.681
Every night

00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:56.851
I curse and strangle Kim Sang-jin.

00:15:57.894 --> 00:16:00.354
And I hope my desperate thoughts

00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:02.190
finally reach him eventually.

00:16:03.608 --> 00:16:05.693
Pray for a life full of agony

00:16:07.945 --> 00:16:09.197
for him.

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.787
How can a judge say that?

00:16:16.621 --> 00:16:17.830
I hope his agony

00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:24.045
washes away your pain
of losing your daughter.

00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:48.903
I have to see that monster again?

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:51.030
No.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.408
My presence in court won't change
the outcome.

00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.914
Attending a funeral

00:16:59.997 --> 00:17:02.250
doesn't bring the dead back, either.

00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:06.087
Yet, we attend them.

00:17:09.173 --> 00:17:10.424
For whomever it may be

00:17:11.008 --> 00:17:13.928
that is how we pay respect
to the dead and their loved ones.

00:17:14.011 --> 00:17:17.098
But you'll leave it to another person
to prosecute the man

00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:18.850
who killed your mother?

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:23.521
I guess I can write a quick verdict
and go to bed, then.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.941
But you're a judge.

00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:30.444
Do your job! You're a judge!

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.865
Is a judge

00:17:36.284 --> 00:17:38.369
closer to her than her own son?

00:17:43.457 --> 00:17:45.042
Reporting Judge Lee Han-young

00:17:45.126 --> 00:17:48.129
will read the final verdict
to close the case.

00:17:58.306 --> 00:17:59.390
Judge Lee.

00:18:01.475 --> 00:18:03.519
- May I get up?
- Why?

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:14.405
Who should the victims resent?

00:18:25.249 --> 00:18:28.336
They say, "Hate his deed,
but don't hate the person."

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.255
Whoever said that,
I'd like to ask them this.

00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:36.010
"Who should the victims
and the bereaved hate, then?"

00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:39.180
Would you still be able to say that

00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:40.932
if your innocent family died?

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:42.808
Hating perpetrators

00:18:42.892 --> 00:18:45.102
who hurt your family and neighbors is

00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:47.438
a human instinct and a given right.

00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:48.940
Your innocent neighbors

00:18:49.023 --> 00:18:51.025
not one, but three,
were killed ruthlessly.

00:18:51.108 --> 00:18:52.109
Not only that

00:18:52.526 --> 00:18:53.694
but the sole survivor

00:18:53.778 --> 00:18:55.863
almost became an accomplice
to a mortifying crime.

00:18:58.449 --> 00:19:01.202
Therefore, I hate him.

00:19:09.377 --> 00:19:12.129
I'll curse him every single day

00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:13.464
and strangle him in my dream.

00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:15.299
In consideration

00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:18.219
of the heartfelt curse

00:19:18.302 --> 00:19:19.720
of the first victim's family...

00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:22.890
If there comes a day
Kim Sang-jin gets released

00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:26.894
I'll wait for him

00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:29.563
and count the days every day.

00:19:29.647 --> 00:19:32.817
And the second family's dedicated heart
for revenge...

00:19:36.904 --> 00:19:37.989
Mi-ju was

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.993
a bride-to-be.

00:19:46.664 --> 00:19:48.207
I MISS YOU, TOO

00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:49.292
The unbearable pain

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:52.003
of the third victim's family,
who died to save someone

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.799
the sheer fear of the fourth victim,
who almost became an accomplice

00:19:57.383 --> 00:19:58.759
along with the unlived lives

00:19:58.843 --> 00:20:00.928
and the weight of the crimes

00:20:02.763 --> 00:20:04.432
the court sentences Kim Sang-jin...

00:20:10.646 --> 00:20:11.856
to a death penalty

00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:14.275
in the final verdict.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.578
Right on!

00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:34.462
Thank you!

00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:37.131
Thank you so much, Your Honor!

00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:41.385
At last, goodnight for me

00:20:41.469 --> 00:20:42.887
and goodbye to you.

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:44.638
You bastard.

00:20:48.642 --> 00:20:50.644
In my previous life, my wrong judgment led

00:20:50.728 --> 00:20:52.146
a child to die

00:20:52.229 --> 00:20:53.898
and Ju-yeong to become an accomplice.

00:20:56.484 --> 00:20:59.820
But this time, I saved them.

00:21:03.074 --> 00:21:04.075
And

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:06.577
I saved myself

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.414
from a lifetime of nightmares.

00:21:30.184 --> 00:21:32.061
Oh, gosh! Are you okay?

00:21:49.703 --> 00:21:51.330
Don't back up.

00:21:51.414 --> 00:21:52.415
Hey.

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:54.542
You think the court is the Colosseum?

00:21:55.376 --> 00:21:57.128
It's not a venting outlet for victims!

00:21:57.211 --> 00:21:58.879
It's the least we can do
when we can't behead him.

00:21:58.963 --> 00:21:59.964
What?

00:22:01.715 --> 00:22:02.967
Whatever it is

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.552
don't you know
all court decisions are recorded?

00:22:04.635 --> 00:22:05.719
So, what's next?

00:22:05.845 --> 00:22:08.264
That's why I made sure
the sentence was legally sound.

00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:10.641
Even legally speaking,
a death sentence made sense.

00:22:10.724 --> 00:22:12.101
Wow.

00:22:12.601 --> 00:22:14.687
What a clever, crazy little judge you are!

00:22:17.148 --> 00:22:19.442
Can we talk in private later?

00:22:19.608 --> 00:22:20.776
Yes, sir.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.039
Any updates on Yi-seok?

00:22:34.373 --> 00:22:35.916
Has he been talking to anyone?

00:22:36.792 --> 00:22:38.127
No, not yet.

00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:41.964
If he meets with anyone,
make sure to check on them.

00:22:42.047 --> 00:22:43.048
Yes, sir.

00:22:43.132 --> 00:22:45.634
And you were in the same cohort
as Judge Lee?

00:22:46.385 --> 00:22:49.221
Yes, and we're roommates.

00:22:49.805 --> 00:22:51.307
Why are you asking about him?

00:22:53.767 --> 00:22:56.562
He got bashed on for being so harsh

00:22:56.645 --> 00:22:58.814
but he seems to be way more than that.

00:23:02.485 --> 00:23:03.736
- What?
- Sorry?

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:05.821
Nothing, sir.

00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:07.031
You should head back.

00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:12.244
They started colluding here?

00:23:12.328 --> 00:23:13.996
How long have they been a team for?

00:24:16.225 --> 00:24:17.977
Nice to see you again, Sin-jin.

00:24:32.491 --> 00:24:35.661
Yi-seok hasn't been up to much so far.

00:24:36.161 --> 00:24:38.998
Has he really lost all his claws?

00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:44.003
I'll keep an eye on him.

00:24:44.503 --> 00:24:48.674
But do you really need to keep an eye
on Yi-seok, anyway?

00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:52.511
Isn't it over since he's been demoted
to the Chungnam District Court?

00:24:53.762 --> 00:24:55.431
Yi-seok is resilient.

00:24:56.724 --> 00:24:59.351
His resilience alone earned him trust
from the Judiciary.

00:25:01.604 --> 00:25:03.856
But it's too much.
He's too strict with the rules.

00:25:04.523 --> 00:25:05.899
He'll definitely go against me

00:25:05.983 --> 00:25:07.943
if he ever returns
to the Seoul District Court.

00:25:09.778 --> 00:25:12.698
Why don't you take
his judge's robe for good, then?

00:25:12.781 --> 00:25:14.366
Despite that

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:18.621
the Judiciary needs at least one person
like Yi-seok.

00:25:19.788 --> 00:25:22.124
To keep the rotten ones from taking over.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.211
I see.

00:25:29.548 --> 00:25:31.550
How many politicians are in a lawsuit?

00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:35.471
Four from the ruling party
and five from the opposition

00:25:35.554 --> 00:25:37.640
for bribery and illegal political funding.

00:25:37.723 --> 00:25:38.974
Who are the judges?

00:25:39.058 --> 00:25:41.644
I made sure they were
from the Hanwool Research Association.

00:25:41.727 --> 00:25:43.395
The opposition party criticized

00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:45.147
the Judiciary's recent ruling, right?

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.231
Yes, sir.

00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:48.901
Align the verdicts

00:25:48.984 --> 00:25:51.403
with the prosecutors' indictment
for the opposition.

00:25:53.322 --> 00:25:54.907
We have to teach them what happens

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.575
when they challenge our authority.

00:25:58.327 --> 00:25:59.328
Yes, sir.

00:26:00.245 --> 00:26:01.997
And the companies caught for tax evasion?

00:26:02.581 --> 00:26:03.582
Right.

00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:06.752
I suggested that the judges charge

00:26:06.835 --> 00:26:09.755
only 30% of the initial charge
in the second trial

00:26:09.838 --> 00:26:12.508
in exchange for 20% in commission.

00:26:13.592 --> 00:26:15.094
This means the companies only pay

00:26:15.177 --> 00:26:17.596
half of what they actually owe

00:26:17.846 --> 00:26:19.181
so they'll definitely take it.

00:26:19.765 --> 00:26:20.766
Okay.

00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:07.771
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

00:27:25.914 --> 00:27:29.168
Your son was fair in court this time.

00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:36.341
I'm not too late this time, am I?

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.178
Ms. Shin!

00:27:42.514 --> 00:27:43.515
My son!

00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:45.434
Back then, I called my mom

00:27:45.851 --> 00:27:47.144
"Ms. Shin."

00:27:47.227 --> 00:27:48.854
Weren't you going to come on Saturday?

00:27:53.609 --> 00:27:54.860
Oh, my.

00:27:54.943 --> 00:27:56.612
What's wrong with you? Huh?

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.781
Hey.

00:28:04.787 --> 00:28:06.955
What judge works so late into the night?

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:08.624
My poor boy. You must be exhausted.

00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:11.043
I had an errand to run nearby.

00:28:11.126 --> 00:28:12.461
But I have to return tonight.

00:28:13.879 --> 00:28:15.047
Is something wrong?

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:18.050
Do you need money?

00:28:19.468 --> 00:28:20.552
Is work getting too hard?

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.848
- Your girlfriend left you, didn't she?
- No!

00:28:27.059 --> 00:28:28.101
My gosh.

00:28:31.146 --> 00:28:32.147
Come on.

00:28:32.231 --> 00:28:34.900
Your Honor, you don't need to do this.

00:28:35.484 --> 00:28:37.903
Man, sitting at my desk all day

00:28:37.986 --> 00:28:39.571
makes me feel like I'm rotting.

00:28:39.988 --> 00:28:41.573
My knees and joints are getting bad

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:43.992
maybe because I'm in my 40s now.

00:28:45.077 --> 00:28:48.080
You should take care of your health.

00:28:48.163 --> 00:28:49.832
Should I bring some joint supplements?

00:28:49.915 --> 00:28:51.917
Stop it. You're not over 40.

00:28:52.417 --> 00:28:53.502
People will hear you

00:28:53.585 --> 00:28:55.254
and think I'm an old lady.

00:28:56.004 --> 00:28:57.172
No, I'm not over 40.

00:28:57.256 --> 00:28:58.924
I'm just saying I feel like I am.

00:28:59.007 --> 00:29:01.176
Preventive measures are best
for staying healthy.

00:29:02.094 --> 00:29:04.513
Take care of your own body.

00:29:05.264 --> 00:29:07.683
Since when were you so chatty?

00:29:09.184 --> 00:29:10.435
I can't do this.

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:12.354
Are you complaining about it?

00:29:12.437 --> 00:29:15.524
No, I love how chatty you are.

00:29:27.536 --> 00:29:29.037
Weren't you coming on Saturday?

00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:32.040
He had something to do nearby.
He's just visiting for a bit.

00:29:35.085 --> 00:29:38.213
I still can't look at Father in his eyes.

00:29:40.215 --> 00:29:41.884
Is the car outside yours?

00:29:42.384 --> 00:29:43.635
Yes, I got a used car.

00:29:43.719 --> 00:29:46.221
Should we get him to drive us home?

00:29:46.305 --> 00:29:48.807
- Can you drive us?
- Of course.

00:29:48.891 --> 00:29:50.142
Have dinner at home, then.

00:29:50.225 --> 00:29:51.643
Do you have time for kimchi stew?

00:29:51.935 --> 00:29:53.145
Yeah, I'm starving.

00:29:53.729 --> 00:29:54.730
Let's go now.

00:29:54.813 --> 00:29:55.814
Let's go, honey.

00:29:55.898 --> 00:29:57.900
Just close the gate first.

00:29:57.983 --> 00:29:58.984
Hello.

00:29:59.067 --> 00:30:00.319
My, my.

00:30:01.445 --> 00:30:02.738
Hello.

00:30:03.322 --> 00:30:04.323
Hello.

00:30:04.406 --> 00:30:05.908
You're the owners, right?

00:30:06.408 --> 00:30:07.576
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:10.454
Soon told me to come here.

00:30:10.913 --> 00:30:12.205
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:13.290
It's okay.

00:30:13.373 --> 00:30:16.043
You came right on time.
We were about to close.

00:30:20.255 --> 00:30:23.175
Find a complicated case
and assign it to Judge Lee.

00:30:24.092 --> 00:30:25.677
He just started his sole trials.

00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:29.014
Don't you think it's too early
to assign him

00:30:29.097 --> 00:30:30.182
to a complex case?

00:30:30.265 --> 00:30:31.850
That's the whole point.

00:30:33.644 --> 00:30:35.062
I'm curious

00:30:35.145 --> 00:30:36.480
as to what he'll do.

00:30:38.398 --> 00:30:40.400
We will begin the trial

00:30:40.484 --> 00:30:43.737
for Case 2025GD1435,
involving Defendant Park Hyeok-jun.

00:30:43.946 --> 00:30:46.657
You have the right to remain silent

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.659
and only make statements favorable to you.

00:30:49.076 --> 00:30:52.829
Please state your name, ID number,
and address.

00:30:57.501 --> 00:30:59.503
My name is Park Hyeok-jun.

00:30:59.586 --> 00:31:03.840
My address is 234, Yeong-il-dong,
Mayeong-gu, Seoul.

00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:08.637
KIM SEON-HUI

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:16.269
Why are you here?

00:31:16.353 --> 00:31:18.855
How dare you come here?

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:21.775
Bring my Seon-hui back to life!

00:31:21.858 --> 00:31:24.611
Bring her back!

00:31:25.112 --> 00:31:26.947
I didn't do it.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.116
- I really didn't.
- No?

00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:31.702
I don't believe you!

00:31:31.785 --> 00:31:34.621
You killed my daughter
to take her insurance money!

00:31:34.705 --> 00:31:36.206
You killed her!

00:31:36.957 --> 00:31:37.958
Honey!

00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.293
- Honey!
- Auntie!

00:31:40.377 --> 00:31:41.420
Auntie!

00:31:41.795 --> 00:31:42.796
Auntie.

00:31:43.213 --> 00:31:44.256
Oh, no.

00:31:47.718 --> 00:31:49.886
Ms. Kim Seon-hui signed up
for life insurance

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.055
three months before the accident.

00:31:52.139 --> 00:31:53.724
But the beneficiary was

00:31:53.807 --> 00:31:55.642
not anyone from Ms. Kim's family

00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:57.894
but instead, her fiancé

00:31:57.978 --> 00:32:00.313
and the defendant of the case,
Mr. Park Hyeok-jun.

00:32:00.564 --> 00:32:03.567
I cannot help but question the situation
as a prosecutor.

00:32:04.317 --> 00:32:06.236
The restaurant that Mr. Park runs

00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:08.488
in the city earned

00:32:08.572 --> 00:32:11.241
about 2.5 million won per month
in net profit.

00:32:11.324 --> 00:32:13.493
That means he earned
about 300 million won annually.

00:32:13.577 --> 00:32:15.412
Therefore, I cannot help but doubt

00:32:15.495 --> 00:32:16.496
the idea of Mr. Park

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.915
committing a murder

00:32:18.999 --> 00:32:21.835
for that insurance money.

00:32:22.085 --> 00:32:23.754
Moreover, Mr. Park knew nothing

00:32:23.837 --> 00:32:26.256
about Ms. Kim signing up

00:32:26.339 --> 00:32:27.841
for life insurance

00:32:27.924 --> 00:32:30.010
and there's no proof that he did.

00:32:35.766 --> 00:32:39.603
How can you get a complicated case
right after solving a murder case?

00:32:40.187 --> 00:32:41.188
Man...

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:42.939
You're the unluckiest guy

00:32:43.523 --> 00:32:44.608
in history.

00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:46.443
- Is that instant coffee?
- Yeah.

00:32:46.777 --> 00:32:49.863
Why? You never have any.
It's too sweet for you.

00:32:50.489 --> 00:32:52.365
No, I don't. But it smells nice.

00:32:52.866 --> 00:32:53.867
Where are you going?

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:54.951
The site of Ms. Kim's accident.

00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:56.953
You won't find anything there.

00:32:57.037 --> 00:32:59.289
You don't even have enough time
to write the verdict.

00:32:59.372 --> 00:33:01.374
Are you going to write it at home?

00:33:01.458 --> 00:33:03.126
Homework is for high school kids.

00:33:07.547 --> 00:33:09.966
Do you always have to have the last word?

00:33:13.428 --> 00:33:14.763
Seriously.

00:33:20.644 --> 00:33:21.978
Man.

00:33:22.395 --> 00:33:23.980
You can't tell me

00:33:24.648 --> 00:33:26.066
he's sane.

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:28.068
Wow.

00:33:28.568 --> 00:33:29.653
What is this?

00:33:31.404 --> 00:33:33.198
KIM JIN-HAN
FROM SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:33:34.699 --> 00:33:35.742
Yes, Mr. Kim?

00:33:48.922 --> 00:33:50.090
Hey, Ms. Shin.

00:33:50.173 --> 00:33:51.758
Did you have dinner?

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:54.094
I'll be home late today.

00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:55.762
Yeah.

00:33:55.846 --> 00:33:57.347
By the way

00:33:58.098 --> 00:34:00.350
you know the old lady
who came to the junkyard?

00:34:00.934 --> 00:34:04.104
Oh, the scrap paper lady
who came at night?

00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:05.772
Does she live near there?

00:34:06.356 --> 00:34:07.357
I'm not sure.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.276
Judging by how she brings us scraps

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:10.610
she probably does. Why?

00:34:10.694 --> 00:34:12.779
Nothing. I just thought of her.

00:34:13.363 --> 00:34:14.447
That's random.

00:34:15.282 --> 00:34:17.450
You'll sleep at home tomorrow, right?
It's Saturday.

00:34:17.534 --> 00:34:18.535
Yup!

00:34:19.035 --> 00:34:20.453
See you later, Ms. Shin.

00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:31.882
It should be right about here.

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:06.583
NO ENTRY

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:19.596
UNDER POLICE INVESTIGATION

00:35:25.227 --> 00:35:27.020
THE EXTERAL VIEW OF THE CAR
AFTER THE ACCIDENT

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.231
At first, I thought it was an accident.

00:36:11.898 --> 00:36:13.817
But it turned into a lawsuit

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.070
when Ms. Kim turned out to have signed up
for eight life insurances

00:36:17.153 --> 00:36:18.571
worth 1.2 billion won

00:36:18.655 --> 00:36:20.657
all with the beneficiary being her fiancé

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.409
Mr. Park Hyeok-jun.

00:36:22.993 --> 00:36:23.994
Excuse me.

00:36:30.417 --> 00:36:31.584
Hello.

00:36:31.668 --> 00:36:33.503
You're a detective, right?

00:36:34.087 --> 00:36:36.589
I've never met such a handsome detective.

00:36:36.673 --> 00:36:38.675
You're surprised
because I blew your cover.

00:36:38.758 --> 00:36:40.927
My intuition is

00:36:41.011 --> 00:36:42.262
just on another level.

00:36:45.598 --> 00:36:46.599
Nice to meet you.

00:36:46.683 --> 00:36:49.019
I'm Song Na-yeon,
a reporter at Daejin Daily.

00:36:51.229 --> 00:36:53.940
Song Na-yeon, the legal correspondent
at Daejin Daily?

00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.610
Will the death of S Construction's CEO
affect the ruling?

00:36:58.194 --> 00:36:59.195
Mr. Lee!

00:36:59.529 --> 00:37:01.364
Mr. Lee, please say something...

00:37:05.035 --> 00:37:06.036
Please get out of my way.

00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:07.287
Sir!

00:37:07.537 --> 00:37:08.621
So, we meet again.

00:37:09.873 --> 00:37:12.542
You must be here
for Ms. Kim Seon-hui's case.

00:37:12.625 --> 00:37:16.379
No need to be that surprised.

00:37:16.463 --> 00:37:17.881
You're in the middle of nowhere

00:37:17.964 --> 00:37:18.965
with your car there

00:37:19.049 --> 00:37:20.467
snooping around in the mountains

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.551
in the heat.

00:37:21.634 --> 00:37:23.720
I can just tell
by how you're snooping around.

00:37:23.803 --> 00:37:25.805
It's pretty obvious, don't you think?

00:37:26.222 --> 00:37:27.724
Oh, you must be curious

00:37:27.807 --> 00:37:29.809
about why a legal correspondent is here.

00:37:29.893 --> 00:37:30.894
I didn't ask.

00:37:30.977 --> 00:37:33.063
Where should I even begin?

00:37:33.146 --> 00:37:34.731
Since you must be curious

00:37:34.814 --> 00:37:36.066
allow me to explain.

00:37:36.316 --> 00:37:37.984
Ms. Kim, who recently died

00:37:38.568 --> 00:37:40.653
was actually my friend.

00:37:40.737 --> 00:37:43.239
No need to feel bad for me or anything.

00:37:43.323 --> 00:37:45.075
We weren't best friends or anything.

00:37:45.158 --> 00:37:46.659
We just knew each other

00:37:46.993 --> 00:37:48.411
for a very long time.

00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:49.913
But Detective

00:37:49.996 --> 00:37:51.790
what do you think about the case?

00:37:51.873 --> 00:37:53.583
Do you think Park Hyeok-jun really did it?

00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:54.751
I have a feeling

00:37:55.418 --> 00:37:57.921
he killed her for the insurance payout.

00:37:58.004 --> 00:37:59.005
Right?

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:01.674
Are you done? Is it my turn to talk?

00:38:01.758 --> 00:38:03.676
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

00:38:05.512 --> 00:38:07.514
Reporter Song Na-yeon at Daejin Daily?

00:38:07.597 --> 00:38:08.598
Yup.

00:38:08.681 --> 00:38:10.100
Can you get the word out

00:38:10.183 --> 00:38:12.268
about the case as much as possible?

00:38:12.352 --> 00:38:14.104
It's best to get the public involved.

00:38:14.187 --> 00:38:15.355
Yeah, of course.

00:38:15.438 --> 00:38:17.190
I'll do anything.

00:38:17.273 --> 00:38:19.943
Please, just find the person
behind Seon-hui's death.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.694
Oh, your friend, Ms. Kim?

00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:23.029
- Yeah.
- Do you know

00:38:23.113 --> 00:38:26.116
her cousin, Ms. Kim Ga-yeong, then?

00:38:26.699 --> 00:38:29.619
Yeah, I do. We all hung out with Seon-hui.

00:38:33.706 --> 00:38:35.875
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

00:38:52.183 --> 00:38:54.144
How does your trolley never break?

00:38:54.978 --> 00:38:56.646
It's uphill, too!

00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:58.731
How did you bring all this?

00:38:58.815 --> 00:39:00.900
Don't you worry about that.

00:39:00.984 --> 00:39:03.820
Just give me a good price for these.

00:39:04.737 --> 00:39:05.822
Ms. Shin!

00:39:05.905 --> 00:39:07.574
- Hi.
- Hey, Han-young.

00:39:07.657 --> 00:39:08.908
Oh, Han-young.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.078
This is my son. He's a judge.

00:39:12.996 --> 00:39:17.584
Wow, I didn't know
you had such an accomplished son!

00:39:17.667 --> 00:39:22.172
He must be the most upright person
if he's a judge.

00:39:35.101 --> 00:39:36.144
What's going on?

00:39:36.519 --> 00:39:37.520
What?

00:39:37.604 --> 00:39:38.938
You said that was too sweet.

00:39:41.357 --> 00:39:43.443
I've tasted enough bitterness.

00:39:44.486 --> 00:39:45.653
- What?
- Take your call.

00:39:46.946 --> 00:39:48.823
This is for my Ms. Shin.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.201
Hey.

00:39:51.534 --> 00:39:52.952
And for you, Father.

00:39:53.286 --> 00:39:54.287
Thanks.

00:39:55.455 --> 00:39:56.456
Have some coffee.

00:39:56.539 --> 00:39:57.790
Oh, my.

00:39:57.874 --> 00:40:00.126
- A coffee from Your Honor?
- I pronounce

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.211
I'm honored.

00:40:01.294 --> 00:40:03.880
that the Plaintiffs' claims are
hereby dismissed.

00:40:03.963 --> 00:40:05.798
My Na-yeong...

00:40:05.882 --> 00:40:08.301
My poor baby.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.389
I'm sorry.

00:40:13.473 --> 00:40:14.474
For what?

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.726
Why?

00:40:21.481 --> 00:40:22.815
Well, I made your coffee

00:40:23.399 --> 00:40:24.651
too watery.

00:40:24.984 --> 00:40:25.985
Oh!

00:40:26.486 --> 00:40:27.820
I should've made it better.

00:40:27.904 --> 00:40:29.405
It's fine.

00:40:29.489 --> 00:40:31.991
The older you get,
the blander your food should be.

00:40:32.075 --> 00:40:33.743
That's the secret to good health.

00:40:34.994 --> 00:40:38.581
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:42.835
It's 8,400 won,
but you can take 9,000 won.

00:40:42.919 --> 00:40:45.505
- Oh, gosh. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:40:46.923 --> 00:40:49.092
Thanks so much for the coffee!

00:40:49.175 --> 00:40:50.343
- Sure.
- You're welcome.

00:40:50.426 --> 00:40:51.761
Get home safely.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.682
Should we have dinner

00:40:56.683 --> 00:40:58.685
at home or out?

00:40:59.519 --> 00:41:00.853
No, you're always eating out.

00:41:00.937 --> 00:41:02.355
Let's just eat at home.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.441
Wait, I forgot something.

00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:08.361
You two can have dinner without me.

00:41:08.444 --> 00:41:09.529
Enjoy!

00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:20.373
Kim Yun-cheol, is it?

00:41:21.958 --> 00:41:24.127
No, it's Kim Yoon-hyeok.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:26.212
Oh, yeah, Yoon-hyeok.

00:41:26.879 --> 00:41:28.631
- Let me pour you one.
- Yes, sir.

00:41:32.468 --> 00:41:33.469
Thank you.

00:41:39.058 --> 00:41:40.476
So, is Justice Kim Jun-man

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.271
the next Chief Justice, then?

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.399
Yeah, I've decided.

00:41:46.482 --> 00:41:48.401
Have you decided
on Chief Judge Baek Yi-seok

00:41:49.068 --> 00:41:51.487
as the new Justice, then?

00:41:51.571 --> 00:41:54.324
The Justice has the final say
in every case

00:41:54.657 --> 00:41:56.326
but has no appointment power.

00:41:56.409 --> 00:41:59.078
That's where we'll leave
Yi-seok's claws to become dull.

00:41:59.162 --> 00:42:00.997
And he'll just use his dull claws

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.083
to banish all the corrupt ones.

00:42:05.335 --> 00:42:07.503
That might put our people at risk.

00:42:07.587 --> 00:42:08.921
That's not so bad, either.

00:42:10.089 --> 00:42:11.507
The more threatened you feel

00:42:11.591 --> 00:42:13.509
the more desperate you get for a lifeline.

00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:21.184
I sometimes wonder

00:42:21.267 --> 00:42:23.936
how it would've been
if I sided with Yi-seok.

00:42:26.439 --> 00:42:28.524
But no fish can survive in water
that's too clear.

00:42:30.443 --> 00:42:32.195
If the water is too clear

00:42:33.029 --> 00:42:35.323
big fish can't live in it.

00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:39.035
What do you think?

00:42:41.287 --> 00:42:42.288
Sorry?

00:42:44.207 --> 00:42:45.291
Oh...

00:42:45.792 --> 00:42:48.711
Well, I think

00:42:50.546 --> 00:42:51.798
it only takes a second

00:42:52.924 --> 00:42:55.343
for clear water to become polluted.

00:42:56.135 --> 00:42:57.637
I think you should stay put

00:42:58.137 --> 00:43:01.224
and wait for the water to become polluted.

00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:03.810
Interesting.

00:43:05.228 --> 00:43:07.647
I hear there's an interesting judge
at the Chungnam Court.

00:43:07.897 --> 00:43:09.732
Lee Han-young, is it?

00:43:09.816 --> 00:43:11.818
Yes, sir, the one I mentioned.

00:43:16.072 --> 00:43:17.573
We were in the same judge cohort.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.411
We were in law school at the same time,
but went to different schools.

00:43:22.078 --> 00:43:23.162
Judge Lee graduated

00:43:23.496 --> 00:43:25.164
from a smaller law school.

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:32.004
He'll be forgotten pretty soon
without a good leader.

00:43:39.679 --> 00:43:42.265
I've been at the Chungnam District Court
for two years.

00:43:42.932 --> 00:43:45.435
I've been staying there for two years,
counting on you guys

00:43:47.019 --> 00:43:50.106
yet he doesn't even remember my name.

00:43:51.816 --> 00:43:53.693
He was just confused for a second.

00:43:54.277 --> 00:43:57.280
He knows how you feel
and how loyal you are.

00:44:00.867 --> 00:44:02.452
How come he remembers

00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:05.371
Han-young's name, then?

00:44:09.417 --> 00:44:10.418
Why

00:44:11.711 --> 00:44:12.962
do you think so?

00:44:16.215 --> 00:44:17.216
Grandma!

00:44:17.467 --> 00:44:18.634
There you are.

00:44:24.974 --> 00:44:27.727
Grandma, I'm in high school next year

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:28.811
so just hang on.

00:44:28.895 --> 00:44:30.730
I'll get a job as soon as I graduate
from high school.

00:44:30.813 --> 00:44:33.232
Why would you get a job?

00:44:33.316 --> 00:44:36.736
If I don't go to college,
I can save four years' of tuition

00:44:36.819 --> 00:44:38.905
and make money. It's a win-win.

00:44:38.988 --> 00:44:40.865
It's like you want me to get mad.

00:44:42.325 --> 00:44:44.410
You don't need to become a judge

00:44:45.077 --> 00:44:48.581
but I at least need my granddaughter
to graduate from college.

00:44:48.664 --> 00:44:50.500
A judge? That's random.

00:44:51.167 --> 00:44:53.836
The owner of the convenience store
gave these to me.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.755
They expired, so I got them for free.

00:44:56.672 --> 00:44:59.759
Don't drink the junkyard coffee
and call it a dinner. Eat this.

00:44:59.842 --> 00:45:02.678
Do you want me to get food poisoning?

00:45:02.762 --> 00:45:05.181
They're expired, but not rotten.

00:45:05.264 --> 00:45:06.682
You don't know anything.

00:45:06.766 --> 00:45:09.769
Well, here we finally are.

00:45:10.102 --> 00:45:11.354
Just get the door.

00:45:19.278 --> 00:45:21.280
You can drink all the milk.

00:45:59.652 --> 00:46:01.654
Good morning.

00:46:02.154 --> 00:46:03.322
Have a good day.

00:46:25.803 --> 00:46:27.013
My room!

00:46:29.181 --> 00:46:30.683
It's exactly how it was ten years ago!

00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:32.852
Hold up.

00:46:35.771 --> 00:46:36.939
2025.

00:46:38.858 --> 00:46:40.026
I'm still here!

00:46:41.944 --> 00:46:44.113
I can't keep saying
I'll do everything later.

00:46:44.196 --> 00:46:46.198
One day, it'll be too late for anything.

00:46:46.282 --> 00:46:48.117
Since it's the first day

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.202
I prepared breakfast for you.

00:46:50.286 --> 00:46:51.287
"The first day"?

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.456
This was what you eventually wanted to do?

00:46:53.539 --> 00:46:54.624
Why? Is it bad?

00:46:54.707 --> 00:46:57.627
Well, I'll have to taste it first.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.633
I would've really regretted it
if I'd had this later.

00:47:03.716 --> 00:47:05.718
Han-young, please do this more often.

00:47:05.801 --> 00:47:08.971
I also prepared this.

00:47:09.055 --> 00:47:10.222
What is it?

00:47:10.306 --> 00:47:12.308
Oh, I'm really fine. I'm healthy.

00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:15.519
You have to take care of your health
while it's good.

00:47:15.603 --> 00:47:17.146
I'm really fine.

00:47:17.229 --> 00:47:18.230
Really?

00:47:18.314 --> 00:47:20.066
We can't chuck his gift in the trash.

00:47:20.149 --> 00:47:21.817
I guess I'll take it all.

00:47:23.402 --> 00:47:25.071
It's perfect.

00:47:25.154 --> 00:47:27.114
I've been aching after work every day.

00:47:34.497 --> 00:47:35.539
- I...
- Is it good?

00:47:35.623 --> 00:47:36.999
Yeah, it's great.

00:47:37.083 --> 00:47:39.543
My wrists have been a bit sore

00:47:39.627 --> 00:47:41.253
from working and doing chores.

00:47:41.337 --> 00:47:43.923
But you didn't want them.
You said you were fine.

00:47:44.006 --> 00:47:45.758
I wouldn't say I'm perfectly fine.

00:47:45.841 --> 00:47:47.593
I'm aching all over.

00:47:47.677 --> 00:47:48.678
I'm in my menopause.

00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:50.680
- I'm dying here!
- I knew this would happen

00:47:50.763 --> 00:47:52.932
so I got another box
to keep you two from fighting.

00:47:55.935 --> 00:47:57.353
Thank you.

00:47:57.436 --> 00:47:58.437
I'll take two, too.

00:48:00.189 --> 00:48:01.273
Hello?

00:48:02.274 --> 00:48:04.276
Yes, Mr. Lim, is everything okay?

00:48:09.198 --> 00:48:10.366
Did Han-young

00:48:11.617 --> 00:48:13.285
leave this here?

00:48:13.369 --> 00:48:15.538
Yeah, he asked us to make it
for the elders

00:48:15.621 --> 00:48:17.873
instead of instant coffee.

00:48:17.957 --> 00:48:20.376
Some drink the coffee and call it a meal.

00:48:20.793 --> 00:48:22.545
He told me to use two packs per cup.

00:48:22.962 --> 00:48:23.963
Okay.

00:48:24.797 --> 00:48:26.632
Doesn't Han-young seem different?

00:48:26.716 --> 00:48:28.884
He was a bit different this morning, too.

00:48:29.885 --> 00:48:30.886
I know, right?

00:48:31.303 --> 00:48:32.805
He even drank instant coffee.

00:48:32.888 --> 00:48:34.557
He never drank that.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.642
Can I have a cup of this?

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.062
Park Hyeok-jun and the prosecutor's claims

00:48:40.146 --> 00:48:41.814
are both plausible.

00:48:42.481 --> 00:48:43.566
So, as with the saying

00:48:43.649 --> 00:48:45.401
"When in doubt, rule for the accused"

00:48:45.484 --> 00:48:49.071
Park Hyeok-jun was declared innocent
in my previous life.

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.908
But three years later

00:48:52.992 --> 00:48:55.327
it was uncovered
that Park planned the car crash

00:48:55.411 --> 00:48:58.414
to kill his fiancée, Ms. Kim.

00:48:59.498 --> 00:49:00.666
You have a blind date.

00:49:01.042 --> 00:49:02.835
Mr. Yu, the Partner at Haenal Law Firm

00:49:02.918 --> 00:49:04.587
asked Chief Judge to set you up

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:07.089
with his youngest daughter
for solving the murder case.

00:49:07.923 --> 00:49:09.675
It's his youngest daughter.

00:49:09.759 --> 00:49:12.094
Go to the cafe at Ramando Hotel
in Gangnam by 2 p.m.

00:49:19.518 --> 00:49:22.521
I purposely came an hour late,
and he didn't even call.

00:49:23.939 --> 00:49:25.024
I like him already.

00:49:26.025 --> 00:49:28.861
He has to be patient
if he wants to date me.

00:49:38.871 --> 00:49:39.872
What?

00:49:40.122 --> 00:49:41.540
Don't tell me he's not even here.

00:49:49.048 --> 00:49:50.049
Oh.

00:49:50.382 --> 00:49:51.801
Of course.

00:50:03.145 --> 00:50:04.230
Oh, gosh!

00:50:05.481 --> 00:50:06.565
What?

00:50:08.067 --> 00:50:09.110
Huh?

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.239
I'm Lee Han-young. I'm running a bit late.

00:50:13.322 --> 00:50:16.200
He's coming even later?
It's already an hour past.

00:50:16.283 --> 00:50:18.410
What? Me?

00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:20.996
Do you

00:50:21.831 --> 00:50:22.915
know me?

00:50:25.793 --> 00:50:26.919
You think?

00:50:32.675 --> 00:50:35.136
A YOUNG MAN DIES
FROM A SINKHOLE IN NAMMYEON-GU

00:50:37.429 --> 00:50:39.932
Se-hee was an hour late to the date
in my previous life.

00:50:40.683 --> 00:50:42.977
That's how she tames people.

00:50:57.199 --> 00:50:58.617
I might take even longer.

00:50:59.618 --> 00:51:00.870
Are you kidding me?

00:51:03.706 --> 00:51:05.416
Does he realize who I am?

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.055
Sorry!

00:51:23.392 --> 00:51:24.476
You're kidding me.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.979
First, I get stood up by a nobody,
and now, this?

00:51:27.062 --> 00:51:30.399
Sorry, I'll pay for dry-cleaning.

00:51:30.482 --> 00:51:31.984
Shut your face.

00:51:32.651 --> 00:51:34.904
This dress is worthless
as soon as it touches water.

00:51:34.987 --> 00:51:38.157
So, pay for the dress,
not for dry-cleaning.

00:51:39.825 --> 00:51:41.076
You got 12 million won?

00:51:42.286 --> 00:51:44.747
- Sorry?
- The dress was 12 million won.

00:51:46.916 --> 00:51:48.000
No?

00:51:50.586 --> 00:51:52.171
Pay for it with this, then.

00:51:58.761 --> 00:51:59.845
Who the hell are you?

00:52:01.096 --> 00:52:02.848
Why do you keep getting in my way?

00:52:03.265 --> 00:52:04.433
I'm Lee Han-young.

00:52:05.351 --> 00:52:08.103
The nobody who almost stood you up.

00:52:21.033 --> 00:52:22.868
- Whoa.
- Get out.

00:52:23.285 --> 00:52:25.120
How dare you make me wait?

00:52:27.373 --> 00:52:29.959
I'm sorry I made you wait

00:52:30.042 --> 00:52:32.711
but I can sue you for assault.

00:52:33.379 --> 00:52:34.964
We have plenty of witnesses, too.

00:52:35.381 --> 00:52:36.465
Sue me, then.

00:52:36.966 --> 00:52:38.384
You think you can hurt me

00:52:38.467 --> 00:52:40.469
when I've just slapped you once?

00:52:43.806 --> 00:52:45.891
You're just a mere judge.

00:52:46.308 --> 00:52:47.893
If Haenal's youngest daughter

00:52:47.977 --> 00:52:50.312
gets sued by a mere judge

00:52:50.396 --> 00:52:52.481
the press would go wild for it.

00:52:53.148 --> 00:52:54.316
You sure about that?

00:52:57.486 --> 00:52:58.487
What?

00:52:59.655 --> 00:53:02.491
You caused all of this trouble.

00:53:02.992 --> 00:53:03.993
So

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.161
apologize to the server.

00:53:06.245 --> 00:53:09.081
I won't sue you, then.

00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:13.335
In the previous life,
Se-hee tried to take over Haenal

00:53:13.419 --> 00:53:15.421
by beating her older siblings.

00:53:15.504 --> 00:53:18.841
So, there's no way she can do anything

00:53:18.924 --> 00:53:20.092
to bother Mr. Yu.

00:53:20.759 --> 00:53:21.844
Sorry.

00:53:22.428 --> 00:53:24.096
Don't worry about the dress.

00:53:24.179 --> 00:53:26.432
Noblesse Oblige.

00:53:26.515 --> 00:53:28.183
No, I'll do anything to...

00:53:28.267 --> 00:53:29.268
Really?

00:53:31.687 --> 00:53:33.355
Just thank me and go.

00:53:34.648 --> 00:53:35.941
Thank you.

00:53:49.371 --> 00:53:51.623
You think you're the shit now, don't you?

00:54:13.729 --> 00:54:16.315
Or do I look desperate
to catch a rich lady?

00:54:19.318 --> 00:54:20.652
What the hell is he doing?

00:54:23.864 --> 00:54:26.825
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:54:27.117 --> 00:54:28.994
It's about time
you become the Chief Justice.

00:54:30.287 --> 00:54:32.790
You'll get a call
from the President's Office soon.

00:54:36.251 --> 00:54:37.836
Thank you.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.671
I'll protect the Judiciary

00:54:39.755 --> 00:54:41.840
with a love for my nation.

00:54:41.924 --> 00:54:44.009
Make sure you make zero mistakes

00:54:44.093 --> 00:54:46.512
until the day you're appointed.

00:54:46.595 --> 00:54:47.596
In particular

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.599
do not ever forget

00:54:50.682 --> 00:54:52.101
who made this happen.

00:54:53.852 --> 00:54:55.104
This is Kang Sin-jin.

00:54:56.188 --> 00:54:58.273
The President's Office will appoint
Justice Kim Jun-man

00:54:58.357 --> 00:55:00.442
as the next Chief Justice.

00:55:01.443 --> 00:55:03.529
The Congress will pass
the motion for appointment consent

00:55:03.612 --> 00:55:05.280
as soon as it arrives.

00:55:07.032 --> 00:55:08.951
PARTY LEADER CHO HU-HEON

00:55:09.034 --> 00:55:11.120
They've started
an internal investigation on me?

00:55:13.455 --> 00:55:14.456
Okay.

00:55:16.959 --> 00:55:18.794
Doesn't an internal investigation mean

00:55:19.878 --> 00:55:22.131
you've been chosen to become a Justice?

00:55:23.632 --> 00:55:24.633
Well...

00:55:27.136 --> 00:55:28.470
Congratulations on your promotion.

00:55:30.139 --> 00:55:32.641
Don't be so dramatic. Just sit.

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.736
A bride-to-be died in a car accident.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.905
While it seemed like an accident at first

00:55:46.989 --> 00:55:49.992
suspicions around the case are growing

00:55:50.075 --> 00:55:51.827
as more details are revealed.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:55.164
The bride-to-be had signed up
for eight life insurance plans

00:55:55.247 --> 00:55:57.749
worth 1.2 billion won in total.

00:55:57.833 --> 00:55:59.501
The issue is, all her insurances had

00:55:59.585 --> 00:56:02.337
an assigned beneficiary, her fiancé.

00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:05.591
The two were in the same car
at the time of the accident.

00:56:05.674 --> 00:56:07.593
The bride-to-be passed away...

00:56:10.012 --> 00:56:11.180
The case became a big deal

00:56:11.263 --> 00:56:13.515
and Sin-jin was more likely
to notice me now.

00:56:14.183 --> 00:56:17.019
Sin-jin, give me some attention.

00:56:20.647 --> 00:56:22.024
Who are you, really?

00:56:22.274 --> 00:56:24.693
Are you really a judge? Not a detective?

00:56:25.110 --> 00:56:28.071
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

00:56:28.864 --> 00:56:30.782
"The judge-slapping woman"!

00:56:31.366 --> 00:56:33.035
I love the sound of that.

00:56:33.118 --> 00:56:34.119
Shut it.

00:56:34.203 --> 00:56:36.205
I knew my little sister was strong

00:56:36.288 --> 00:56:38.040
but I didn't expect you to slap a judge.

00:56:38.123 --> 00:56:39.708
He was acting cocky.

00:56:39.791 --> 00:56:41.710
How dare he tell me
to apologize to the server?

00:56:41.793 --> 00:56:43.212
She ruined my dress first.

00:56:43.295 --> 00:56:45.214
The video shows me
you're the one at fault.

00:56:45.297 --> 00:56:47.549
That's impossible, Dad.

00:56:48.383 --> 00:56:51.220
In the service industry,
the worker is always in the wrong.

00:56:51.303 --> 00:56:52.638
We provide legal services.

00:56:52.721 --> 00:56:55.140
Are you saying we're in the wrong
in every case, then?

00:56:55.891 --> 00:56:57.059
That mindset is

00:56:57.142 --> 00:56:58.727
why you're not suitable for Haenal.

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:01.230
Why would you say that now?

00:57:03.899 --> 00:57:05.984
You should've left the damn judge
for Ha-na.

00:57:06.068 --> 00:57:07.069
Why set him up with me?

00:57:07.152 --> 00:57:10.072
I don't have time to date and get married.

00:57:11.156 --> 00:57:12.157
Father

00:57:12.407 --> 00:57:14.660
we're taking
the Nammyeon-gu sinkhole case.

00:57:14.743 --> 00:57:17.079
District Mayor Chu Yong-jin
just signed it.

00:57:20.332 --> 00:57:21.333
Good work.

00:57:31.343 --> 00:57:33.595
That bratty judge ruined it all!

00:57:36.682 --> 00:57:38.016
Just wait and see, you two.

00:57:38.684 --> 00:57:41.228
I'll crush you all.

00:57:47.609 --> 00:57:49.278
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:52.990
HAENAL'S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
HAS NOTHING TO FEAR

00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:03.792
Were you in Seoul last weekend?

00:58:04.376 --> 00:58:05.794
Yeah, I stayed at my Mother's.

00:58:07.296 --> 00:58:08.297
I see.

00:58:12.968 --> 00:58:15.679
Did you go to Ramando Hotel,
by any chance?

00:58:17.306 --> 00:58:18.974
I saw a video of a man getting slapped

00:58:19.641 --> 00:58:21.560
and he looks just like you.

00:58:21.643 --> 00:58:22.978
A woman slapped him. Gosh.

00:58:23.979 --> 00:58:25.230
It's not you, is it?

00:58:27.232 --> 00:58:29.192
- You saw the video?
- Yeah.

00:58:30.986 --> 00:58:32.863
Yeah, it's me.

00:58:34.072 --> 00:58:37.159
I couldn't turn it down.
Chief Judge's order.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.536
Haenal Law Firm wanted me

00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:42.164
after hearing
that I arrested a serial killer

00:58:42.247 --> 00:58:43.665
or something.

00:58:46.001 --> 00:58:48.170
Damn, I had no idea back then

00:58:48.253 --> 00:58:50.422
but he's so, so insecure.

00:58:52.424 --> 00:58:53.634
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

00:58:53.717 --> 00:58:55.510
- Hmm?
- What?

00:58:57.179 --> 00:58:58.430
Of course.

00:59:00.098 --> 00:59:01.350
I drank your coffee.

00:59:02.768 --> 00:59:05.020
And don't shake your legs.
That's bad luck.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.108
Everyone, please stand.

00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:20.619
Hello.

00:59:20.702 --> 00:59:22.537
You're a detective, right?

00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:24.539
I've never met such a handsome...

00:59:24.623 --> 00:59:26.625
So, he's really a judge?

00:59:36.551 --> 00:59:37.803
Please be seated.

00:59:40.722 --> 00:59:42.891
I guess other judges are most curious

00:59:42.974 --> 00:59:46.061
about how I'll close this tricky case?

00:59:48.397 --> 00:59:50.065
Big news outlets are here, too?

00:59:51.149 --> 00:59:53.985
Can't believe he got a big case
when he just started sole trials.

00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:55.153
Must feel like torture.

00:59:55.237 --> 00:59:58.073
I'd be more comfortable
in the defendant's seat than there.

00:59:59.157 --> 01:00:01.076
Let's see how he handles it.

01:00:03.245 --> 01:00:06.039
JUDGE

01:00:08.834 --> 01:00:11.503
We will begin the trial

01:00:11.586 --> 01:00:14.256
for Case 2025GD1435,
involving Defendant Park Hyeok-jun.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:20.345
I've been waiting for you.

01:00:26.685 --> 01:00:27.936
You curious, too?

01:00:28.395 --> 01:00:30.188
About my final verdict?

01:00:35.777 --> 01:00:36.945
As requested in the last session

01:00:37.028 --> 01:00:40.198
we will hear from Ms. Kim Ga-yeong,
Ms. Kim's cousin and insurance broker

01:00:40.282 --> 01:00:42.951
who will testify as the witness.

01:00:43.452 --> 01:00:44.453
Please step forward.

01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:57.966
I swear that I will speak the truth

01:00:58.049 --> 01:00:59.801
the whole truth and nothing but the truth
according to my own conscience

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:01.887
and if there is falsehood in my statement

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:04.473
I shall be punished for perjury.

01:01:08.769 --> 01:01:11.229
WITNESS

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:14.983
You may be punished for perjury

01:01:15.066 --> 01:01:16.818
if your statements are false.

01:01:16.902 --> 01:01:19.321
Testifying against your own memory

01:01:19.404 --> 01:01:21.239
can also be prosecuted as perjury.

01:01:23.992 --> 01:01:25.494
Witness, did you know

01:01:26.328 --> 01:01:28.747
Mr. Park Hyeok-jun?

01:01:29.748 --> 01:01:30.749
Yes.

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:33.668
I met him a few times with Seon-hui.

01:01:33.752 --> 01:01:35.545
When the three of you were together

01:01:35.629 --> 01:01:39.257
has Seon-hui ever mentioned anything
about her eight life insurances?

01:01:39.674 --> 01:01:40.759
No.

01:01:40.842 --> 01:01:42.177
Then, did you ever hear

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.678
about Ms. Kim having told Mr. Park

01:01:43.762 --> 01:01:46.306
about her life insurance?

01:01:48.683 --> 01:01:49.768
No.

01:01:57.442 --> 01:01:58.443
If Mr. Park continues

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:01.196
to insist that he didn't know

01:02:01.279 --> 01:02:03.615
he was the beneficiary until the end

01:02:03.698 --> 01:02:05.784
Judge Lee will have no option
but to rule him as innocent.

01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:09.120
Despite everything pointing to Mr. Park
as the murderer.

01:02:11.873 --> 01:02:13.041
Between the questions

01:02:13.124 --> 01:02:16.294
of the Defendant knowing
about Ms. Kim's life insurance

01:02:16.378 --> 01:02:18.964
and why Ms. Kim signed up

01:02:19.047 --> 01:02:20.882
for eight life insurances

01:02:20.966 --> 01:02:22.551
it'll be more critical to determine

01:02:22.634 --> 01:02:24.719
the answer to the first question.

01:02:28.723 --> 01:02:29.724
Prosecutor

01:02:29.975 --> 01:02:31.351
have you checked Ms. Kim's phone?

01:02:31.434 --> 01:02:32.435
DEFENDANT

01:02:37.774 --> 01:02:41.152
No, there was no need to examine
Ms. Kim's phone.

01:02:41.236 --> 01:02:42.654
Even after considering

01:02:43.154 --> 01:02:46.074
that Ms. Kim seems to have been
the only one

01:02:46.157 --> 01:02:48.577
who knew about her life insurance

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.912
and the beneficiary being Mr. Park?

01:02:50.996 --> 01:02:51.997
Your Honor.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.165
Counsel, the Defendant is in court

01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:57.335
for allegedly having killed his fiancée
for insurance money, right?

01:02:57.836 --> 01:03:00.672
If that's the case,
wouldn't checking her phone

01:03:00.755 --> 01:03:02.340
help your client prove his innocence?

01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:05.677
Yes, but this is too unexpected.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.845
I agree.

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:10.932
Counsel

01:03:17.606 --> 01:03:19.858
shall the court seize it by authority?

01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:22.777
No, I agree.

01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:26.406
- Inspector.
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:29.784
Please give me her phone.

01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:32.537
WITNESS

01:03:38.126 --> 01:03:39.127
Wait.

01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:43.965
You have another phone
for private use, right?

01:03:48.053 --> 01:03:49.054
Excuse me?

01:03:54.059 --> 01:03:55.226
Oh, that one.

01:03:56.394 --> 01:03:58.396
I recently lost it.

01:04:20.418 --> 01:04:21.586
You may take the call.

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:34.849
DEFENDANT

01:04:53.493 --> 01:04:54.577
Hello?

01:04:58.707 --> 01:04:59.791
Hello?

01:05:03.044 --> 01:05:04.212
Nice to meet you

01:05:12.512 --> 01:05:13.555
Ms. Kim Ga-yeong.

01:05:21.688 --> 01:05:25.191
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.343
I hope Sin-jin enjoys this trial.

01:05:52.635 --> 01:05:54.345
What did you lose? Say it clearly.

01:05:54.429 --> 01:05:56.139
Do you know whose house was robbed?

01:05:56.222 --> 01:05:57.807
The Director of Hanguk Hospital.

01:05:57.891 --> 01:06:00.143
I need you to find something.
It's an account book.

01:06:00.226 --> 01:06:02.353
I'm Kim Jin-a, a prosecutor
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

01:06:02.437 --> 01:06:03.480
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

01:06:03.563 --> 01:06:06.066
Chairman Jang is under emergency arrest.

01:06:06.149 --> 01:06:07.984
To strike Sin-jin and Tae-sik...

01:06:08.068 --> 01:06:09.652
We need what they have taken.

01:06:09.736 --> 01:06:13.239
Please, just don't kill me!

01:06:13.323 --> 01:06:15.784
I was wondering where it was from,
and it's S Shopping.

01:06:15.867 --> 01:06:18.453
Don't you realize what'll happen
if the world finds out?

01:06:20.997 --> 01:06:22.999
