(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, since you're here,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.440
tell us about it.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.640
About what? Stealing a dog?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.190
It wasn't even a dog.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.760
We were framed.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.670
You've been saying that all along.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.790
Say something new.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.940
There's nothing else.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.800
You sure about that?

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
I said, "nothing else".

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.570
What did you have for dinner?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.440
Dinner? What dinner?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.110
I got dragged here
before my livestream even ended.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.200
Officer,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.640
I had tens of thousands
watching my stream today.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.640
You have no idea how much money I lost.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.110
Besides,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.040
that woman started it.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.120
You should go after her instead.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.840
Don't play dumb with me.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.480
You haven't had dinner?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.560
Good thing you haven't.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.000
Thanks, Tang.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.790
If you hadn't arrived in time,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.790
anything could've happened.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.270
Well…

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.400
Protecting people is our duty anyway.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.840
Just feels like we didn't do well enough.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.710
Don't say that.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.400
If it weren't for you today,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.870
I can't imagine what state I'd be in.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.480
I've heard
those dog shelter folks are rough.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.480
I didn't expect them to be even worse.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.980
Um…

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.840
If something like this happens again,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.590
don't rush in alone.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.230
Call the police first.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.990
Um...

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.280
Let's hope this doesn't happen again.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.310
I just panicked
and didn't think it through.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.640
But still,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.590
I did call the police, didn't I?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.800
Alright, your wound is treated.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.680
CT results would be ready in three hours.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.360
If you feel nauseous or unwell,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.200
come tell us.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.080
Th-thank you.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.520
Hey, Cao, want a bowl?

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.590
I'll pass, Captain Zhao.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.430
I'm on a diet.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.960
Diet? What for?

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.310
It's delicious.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.680
You eat first.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.360
Alright.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.240
Confess and you'll have dinner.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.750
If you've got the skills,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.590
bring the dog back for a match.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.120
Without proof,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.360
at most you'll detain me for 24 hours.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.030
You seem familiar with the process.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.800
Guess you've been here a lot.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.050
By the way,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.840
how did you figure out your lost dog

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.910
was at Hachi Dog Shelter?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.120
I used to watch their livestreams

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.190
and followed their account.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.800
After my dog went missing,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.960
besides calling the police,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.430
I posted a missing dog notice online.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.400
Tonight, when I was scrolling my phone,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.030
I happened to catch their livestream.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.280
I saw Maodou

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.750
right on the screen.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.560
Let's sit here.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.190
When I had a run-in with the shelter,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.750
Maodou got frightened

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.840
and lost control.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.630
He chased one of them and bit hard.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.840
The bite was pretty serious.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.910
Before I could stop it,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.080
someone among them

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.840
deliberately opened all the dog cages.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.430
Several large dogs rushed out

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.870
and knocked me to the ground.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.240
Are you sure?

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.430
When we took everyone away,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.680
I didn't see anyone injured.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.800
Maybe he saw you coming

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.870
and slipped away quietly.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.000
Could they have been dog thieves?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.830
Maodou is very smart.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.040
He's also highly alert.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.630
Since they managed to take him,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.000
they must be skilled.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.160
Maodou only attacks those he resents.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.630
I'll keep following this up.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.000
If it really was the dog thieves,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.870
we won't let them get away with it.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.800
Maodou only hurt someone
because it got scared.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.870
It's usually gentle and well-behaved.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.390
Could you help me look for it again?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.750
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.880
Really?

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.870
Thank you, Tang.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.870
No problem.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.110
Uh…

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.600
This might be a bit forward,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.040
but I want to ask something personal.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.960
What is it?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.680
Did you grow up in a welfare home?

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.800
Welfare home?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.440
Yeah.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.870
When I was little, I had a friend

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.040
who had the exact same birthmark as you.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.560
She stayed in a welfare home?

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.710
Yeah.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.630
We both stayed

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.310
at a welfare home for a while.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.950
She was my best friend

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.310
and the one who treated me best.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.560
She was younger than me,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.800
but way braver than I ever was.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.560
When I first arrived,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.830
many kids picked on me.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.440
Every time,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.720
she was the first to stand up for me.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.720
So, how did you two lose touch?

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.000
She got adopted?

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.110
As for...

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.240
the details,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.630
I'm not really sure.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.430
Anyway, she just left.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.430
Not long after,
I also left the welfare home.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.040
We never met again after that.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.270
If she knew she had a friend like you,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.510
still thinking about her,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.390
she'd be very happy.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.920
So...

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.310
that girl wasn't you.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.560
Yimo.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.510
Dad, I'm over here.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.310
(Fourth Ward)

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.160
Did you get hurt?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.310
Just a little scrape.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.870
Don't worry, I'm fine.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.910
A scrape?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.210
Dad.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.600
This is Officer Tang Tang.
He saved me today.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.600
If it weren't for him,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.270
things could've gone really bad.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.430
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.280
You're too kind, sir.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.630
It's our duty.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.310
Since you're here,
I'll head out first.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.160
Still got work to do.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.480
Tang, I'm counting on you
to look for Maodou.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.440
Don't worry.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.410
I'll go now, sir.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.750
- Thanks, officer.
- No problem.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.870
I'll buy you dinner sometime.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.830
No need to be so polite.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.940
(Emergency Department)

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.120
What did you talk about with that officer?

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.390
Nothing much.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.270
Tang helped me out last time.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.560
We exchanged numbers after that.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.950
This time, I owe him again.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.680
He helped you before?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.510
At the farmers' market, a dog seller

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.120
tried to snatch a mute woman's dog.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.360
I stepped in,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.270
and Tang saved me

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.310
from being beaten up.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.510
Why do you care so much about him?

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.560
I just...

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.830
I think he really cares about you.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I'm getting jealous.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560
Dad.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.630
Yeah, we can run a quick check.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.110
Master.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.490
I went to the dog shelter again.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.750
I brought all the footage back.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.960
How did it go? Did she talk?

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.840
They're all regulars.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.840
Tight-lipped.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.200
They know the rules

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.390
better than you do.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.120
Let's wait for the dogs.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.150
The girl who broke into the dog shelter...

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.600
Her name's Wang Yimo, right?

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.800
How was it?

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.390
She saw her dog

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.870
on a livestream

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.390
and rushed over without thinking.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.360
I checked the patrol officer's report.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.200
It's true.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.550
I mean, how was she?

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.600
Was she hurt?

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.750
Nothing serious, just some scrapes.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.550
But she did mention something else.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.510
When she arrived,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.630
she saw her dog had bitten someone.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.510
But among those we brought in,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.390
none of them are injured.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.720
Focus on the footage from the time

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.030
Wang Yimo arrived at the shelter.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.080
Find the person who got bitten.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.230
I'm on it.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.790
Keep watching, call me if anything's up.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.480
Tang Tang, check this out.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.140
(Wednesday)

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.630
Captain Zhao.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.800
Captain Zhao.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.110
What happened?

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.720
We found that dog.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.130
Really?

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.870
Yeah, there's still blood on the its mouth.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.020
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.590
Take a look at this.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.750
The comparison's done.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.790
You'll have to stay here
for more than a day.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.910
Well, as long as I'm here,

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.550
I'll get paid.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.840
Can't earn as much as you livestreamers,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.240
but at least,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.960
I can afford a meal when I'm hungry.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.560
Captain Zhao.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.240
Have something to eat first.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.750
Look,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.670
speak of the devil and here it is.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.480
Still warm.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.350
Nice, really nice.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.960
We didn't steal that dog.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.790
Someone sold it to us.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.320
See?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.120
There's still something to talk about.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.390
We don't steal dogs.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.240
We just transport them.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.670
Then who sold them to you?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.240
Two men.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.750
Names, build,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.120
appearance, accent.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.750
Our rule is simple:

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.480
Don't ask about who they are

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.870
or where the dogs came from.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.630
They bring the dogs, we bring the cash.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.590
Then we leave.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:31.920
That's it?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:32.840
That's it.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.870
What about the person

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.390
who got bitten by the dog last night?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.600
I don't understand.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.200
Didn't you bring all our people here?

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.790
No one got bitten.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.270
You mean

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.240
someone not from your dog shelter

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.840
was there last night?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.680
Who was that person?

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.390
How would I know?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.630
What if they're sneaking around?

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.390
Officer,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.600
I've told you everything I can.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.630
You can't pin everything on me.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.320
Buying a dog isn't illegal, right?

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.710
I bought my dog fair and square.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.150
Do you think all pretty women are evil?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.120
Did you notice something, bro?

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.600
Yeah, I did.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.390
This isn't normal.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.670
Normally they'd be streaming now.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.200
Did something really happen?

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.110
Dude,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.600
they're not gonna replace

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.510
my favorite female streamer, right?

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.350
Hey,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.550
why do you always miss the point?

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.200
What's with that streamer thing?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.510
That is the point to me.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.640
She's the only one
who's ever said she loves me.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.080
She's my first love.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.230
Bro,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.200
just listen to me for once.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.000
We should focus on making money.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.240
Once we've got cash,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.390
I'll find you

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.630
a good match.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.870
Alright then.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.320
That's more like it.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.680
But right now,

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.360
we do have a problem.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.790
We can't steal dogs anymore.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.630
What, you're gonna deliver food now?

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.840
Deliver food? No way.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.030
The dog shelter's shut down.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.870
Who would we sell dogs to?

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.960
We need to find a way to make money.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.000
You can't sit around like this forever.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.750
Bro,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.390
why don't we open a dog shelter?

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.200
Selling you wouldn't be enough
to open one.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.510
You're full of useless ideas.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.480
If they don't livestream,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.870
we do.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.030
Forget it, I can't dance those moves.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.390
Is it on?

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.910
Should we start?

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.750
Go ahead.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.120
No one's watching.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.510
(Joined)
Someone's here!

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.980
Welcome, welcome.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.080
Welcome, my friend.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.270
Please follow us.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.750
Are you sure?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.910
Testing DNA from the dog's mouth?

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.390
No one does that, Master.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.800
Test it.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.550
Old man,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.540
something's off about you.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.630
You're hiding something from me.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:34.910
Test it first.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.240
We'll talk after the test.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.870
The dog shelter has caught
the police's attention.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.480
Looks like the plan needs to move up.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.270
Here's your favorite pork trotter soup.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.320
These flowers are pretty.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.200
Put them on the windowsill? Saves space.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.080
They're at their best right now.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.270
I bought them to be admired.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.510
Let's just keep them here.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.160
They are beautiful.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.470
We'll do it your way.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.670
Smells amazing.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.360
Here, have a taste.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:04.870
Yimo.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.640
When you graduated,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.400
didn't you plan to study design in Paris?

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.640
That wasn't my plan.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.160
You're the one who insisted I go.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.440
You said with my major,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.270
studying abroad would add value,

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.240
and I could choose
Beijing or Shanghai after.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.720
What is it, Dad?

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.200
Still not giving up?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.440
I just feel

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.160
you should see more of the world.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.240
How about

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.310
you come with me?

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.400
We could explore France together.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.270
Visit some colleges

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.550
and have some fun.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.510
You're always busy with restaurant work,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.200
and we've never traveled together.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.720
I tried to persuade you,
but you wouldn't go.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.680
Why the sudden change of heart today?

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.640
It's not that I didn't want to go.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.030
I just didn't want to leave you alone.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.790
Alright, I'll go with you.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.910
Nice.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.860
(Incoming call)

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.080
Hello?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.680
I gotta get to work.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.590
Didn't you say you'd stay home

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.790
and spend some time with me?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.990
Something urgent came up.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.480
The restaurant needs me.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.240
Take your time.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.590
Come back early, okay?

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.630
Sure.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.380
(Dog Theft Case, Liu Yan Poisoning Case)

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.680
Have you seen him before?

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.080
No, I don't know him.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.040
Time to go.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.070
Move!

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.040
I...

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.070
Why did I lose again?

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.110
Mr. Wang.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:37.350
What is this?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.480
Take it

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.150
and leave.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.440
Last time, I didn't finish what I said,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.550
yet you rushed off in a hurry.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.550
We can talk a bit more this time.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.160
I've got nothing to say to you.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.520
Take this

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.130
and get out of here.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.510
Why the rush?

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.880
I said I just wanted to catch up.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.870
Sorry.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:20.680
I don't have time.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.400
Fifteen years of history.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.720
Nothing to talk about?

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.070
What do you mean?

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.070
That's all the money?

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.440
It's not enough.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.400
I won't make things hard for you.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.920
I've got an idea.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.270
You've lost your mind!

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.740
Still thinking about that?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.240
It's not that I want to.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.830
It's my new crew.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.590
They want to grow the business.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.960
A friend's friend is still a friend.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.270
So we need your help, Mr. Wang.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.720
I'll never do that again.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.590
Never.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.590
You've already had fifteen extra years.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.680
Be grateful for that.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.880
You've had fifteen years of peace.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.960
Seems you've forgotten
what's behind you.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.200
I call you Mr. Wang

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:56.270
and you really think you have a choice?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.720
You need to understand,

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.790
what you're doing

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.790
isn't just paying off your own debt.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.310
It's also for your…

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160
daughter.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.400
Such a young and beautiful girl.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.160
She even loves puppies.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.400
I really want to keep her safe.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.880
If you lay a finger on my daughter,

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.150
you're dead.

Bai is back.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.750
Wasn't he gone for good?

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.880
No way.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.030
He's been back for a while.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.750
He asked us for a favor.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.510
What's he planning?

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.240
The Nude Banquet.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:56.720
Not a chance!

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.960
I don't want in either.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.790
How's your mom doing now?

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:17.870
Not so great.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.910
Qiang.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.640
No one knows what we did back then

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.830
better than you.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.720
She's so young and beautiful.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.160
I really want to protect her.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.160
You know my mom's situation.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.790
She's lying in the hospital.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.350
Every single breath costs money.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.070
If you want to go, go.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.480
Qiang,

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.160
we've worked together for years.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.880
Can't you just give me a hand?

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.590
I'll take less pay.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.640
Just enough for her med.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.200
So all you care about is money?

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.960
I'm not asking for it for myself.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.070
You've got no parents,
so you wouldn't get it.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.480
It's been fifteen years.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.400
You tired of living or what?

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.850
Zhang Ming, be careful

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.070
you don't die before your mom does.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.200
You think you can be off the hook?

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.200
You remember what we did, right?

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.480
You know Bai.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.070
Cross him again

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.270
and none of us will end well.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.390
Even if money's not the issue,

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.510
you don't want anyone here

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.000
to get hurt, do you?

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.510
As early as next week,

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.950

Okay.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.840
Master,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.720
Liu's team finished checking Nan Village.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.510
No leads on the dog thieves mentioned.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.200
Looks like this trail's gone cold.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.680
If we can't confirm
the thieves' identity,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.480
there's no way to link Liu Yan's case

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.270
to the Nude Banquet Case

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.590
from fifteen years ago.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.400
It's alright, Master.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.070
Big cases are always like this.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.960
Whenever we hit a dead end,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.480
we go back to the root of the problem

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.270
and map out a fresh direction.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.750
You're taking it quite well.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.520
Me?

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.830
Just trying to give us
a bit of confidence.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.520
Master,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.480
um… are you tired?

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.440
If not, please tell me more

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.270
about the Nude Banquet Case.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.000
We could treat it
as reviewing the case.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.590
See if we've missed anything.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.800
Liu Yan,

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.640
as one of the last arrested,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.110
was identified only after the tycoon
admitted joining

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.680
the Nude Banquet.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.350
The underage victims were all from

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.350
he welfare home where Liu Yan worked.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.080
She acted as the go-between

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.070
for the welfare home
and the banquet organizers.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.000
When we caught her,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.030
she was about to flee.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.680
An officer pinned her down
at the train station.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.200
From her statement,

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.160
we learned that Bai's already dead.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.750
Back then, she was

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.350
a crucial breakthrough in the case

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.440
and also where the mystery began.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.240
Her testimony connected to Bai.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.790
If she was poisoned to death,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.160
not just an accidental ingestion,

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.680
what was her link to the case

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.920
from fifteen years ago?

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.510
Did she leave something out

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.750
and someone wanted to silence her?

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.110
It's been fifteen years, Master.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.170
She's been out of prison long ago.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.270
Why try to silence her now,
of all times?

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.070
She witnessed Bai's murder.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.830
The one who killed Bai killed her
to cover it up.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:47.880
That's one possibility.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.240
But we can't rule out another.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.680
At the scene where Bai was killed,

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.110
someone else wanted her gone.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.750
Someone else...

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.240
At that crime scene,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.750
besides the murderer

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.720
and her, the only witness,

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.090
the only one left was...

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.910
the body.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.590
Master.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.510
Was Bai's death confirmed back then?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.680
Strictly speaking,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.440
Liu Yan was the only witness.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.750
Is there a chance Bai might be alive?

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.720
If I were Bai,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.110
I survived,

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.070
hid myself,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.160
and even staged the murder

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.830
with my partners,

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.790
then that sole witness

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.240
would become my biggest threat.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.310
Like I said before,

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:08.720
we've got no evidence.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.310
Master,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.680
even though that's true,

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.200
your instincts are always spot-on.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.590
If you think this way too,

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.030
then chances are, it's real.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.160
Once we catch those dog thieves,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.030
everything will come to light.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.560

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.270

the old lady is frugal.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.550

Of course. Over ten years.

It's been open that long?

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.360
Around fifteen years, I'd say.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.360

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.360
He's very kind,

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.840
praising how great your food is.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.030
He was recommending dishes.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.800
He's a long-time customer.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.640
Wow.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:38.590
Have you ordered yet?

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.430
Not yet.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.550
Leave it to me.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.550
I'll get you our best signature dishes.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.500
This meal's on me.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.430
But this doesn't count

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.480
as what I promised before.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.440
I'll properly thank you another day.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.800
No need, really.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.400
I just came for a quick bite today.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.760
I still have to head back to work.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.960
What, you're here on duty or something?

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.670
No, just passing by.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.360
Your place seems to be the busiest.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.000
So I came for a quick lunch.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.840
Next time, when I'm off work,

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.150
I'll have a drink with you.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.150
Go ahead, don't mind me.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.230
I'll just grab a quick bite.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.960
Alright, next time it's on me.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.880
Okay?

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.110
- It's on me.
- Go ahead.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.500
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.070
Have some tea first.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.400
Welcome. Please, come in.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.800
No formalities, we're regulars.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.120
Bro.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.550
Bro.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.510
What are you two doing here?

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.800
Came to grab some food.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.030
We're here to support you.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.590
Eat up, then head out quick.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.360
Not offering a drink?

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.120
In your dreams.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.060
(Cashier)

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.630
Dude, this place really is fancy.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.510
The food is amazing.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.920
Fancy restaurant? You call this one?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.590
You really have low standards.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.400
You've never seen the world.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.840
If we hadn't stolen dogs,

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.000
we'd still be starving.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.550
What? Serving dogs?

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.030
It reeks, man.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.030
You just want

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.480
the whole world to know what we do?

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.710
Can't you eat quietly for once?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.800
Bro,

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.840
I'm gonna criticize you.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.320
You know that... that line

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.510
from that movie?

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.320
"You gotta love the job you're in".

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:40.400
So why don't you have any passion?

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.510
Yeah, yeah, save it.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.260
(Master)

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.960
I followed them all the way here

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.880
but lost them inside a building.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.880
I now suspect

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.480
this might be their hideout.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.360
I checked out the surroundings too.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.550
An old neighborhood.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:36.760
Aside from elderly folks,

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.760
most are people from other areas.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:40.400
The crowd here's pretty mixed.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.070
You sure those two

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.800
are the dog thieves?

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.550
I can't say one hundred percent.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.440
But I'm sure they're involved.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.440
I think right now,

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.160
this spot

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.880
could be our new lead.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.800
It's worth a try.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.120
Alright.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.630
Let's follow this lead.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.900
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.870
And...

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.160
What is it?

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.960
Why stop mid-sentence?

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.320
Who pulled your tongue?

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.600
No one.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.360
Let's follow this lead.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.020
(Dad, what time will you be home?)

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.700
(Welcome to Hongyun Restaurant)

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.030
