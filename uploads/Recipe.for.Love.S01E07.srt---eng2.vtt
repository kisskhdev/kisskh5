00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.320
(Episode 7)

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:29.766
But I'm full.

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:34.676
See you later.

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:50.786
Did you know your wife is cheating on you?

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:55.166
It looks like she left with a man.

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:01.536
She completely stole my heart...

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:06.006
and acted like she'd love me forever.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:08.306
- She could've at least said bye. - Don't look.

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.146
Then all of a sudden, poof.

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:16.786
If she just up and runs away...

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:19.856
How could she do that?

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:40.606
- What are you talking about? - Hui Gyeong cheated on me.

00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:43.506
She had an affair and ran off behind my back.

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:45.946
She was cheating on me.

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:49.316
She just up and left. Just like my father...

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:51.556
- She just... - Dae Han.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:56.456
Seong Mi, wait. Seong Mi...

00:01:57.256 --> 00:01:58.256
I have a favor to ask.

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:03.666
Promise not to tell Mom and Jeong Han. Okay?

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:06.136
If Mom and Jeong Han find out, they'll be heartbroken...

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:12.806
Mom might collapse again, so please just keep it a secret.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:15.346
Collapse over what?

00:02:24.146 --> 00:02:26.216
- Mother. - Mom.

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:27.756
Collapse? Why on earth would I collapse?

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:31.226
In your eyes, do I really seem that weak?

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.196
Mom.

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:41.906
- Mom... - Oh, my.

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:43.706
- Dae Han. - Dae Han!

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:45.506
- Dae Han. - Dae Han, are you okay?

00:02:45.576 --> 00:02:47.006
- Mom, I was so... - Dae Han.

00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:49.076
- Hey. - I'm sorry, Mom...

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:51.546
- Dae Han. - I'm sorry.

00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:54.046
- My gosh. Dae Han. - Mom, Grandma.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:55.846
What's wrong with Uncle?

00:02:56.116 --> 00:02:58.115
- Woo Jae, help me with him. - Yes, let me...

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:59.416
- I'm sorry, Mom. - Here.

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:00.556
Hold him up.

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:02.326
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:04.786
- Here, careful. - I'm sorry.

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.096
I'm sorry.

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:11.296
- I'm sorry, Mom. - Mom, what's wrong with Uncle?

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:13.796
I'm sorry, Mom!

00:03:17.236 --> 00:03:19.836
Uncle, how did you get this drunk?

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:21.436
Woo Jae.

00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:25.216
Sorry, your uncle is such a fool.

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:29.416
Seong Mi, Mom... I'm sorry.

00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:32.786
It's all my fault that Hui Gyeong ran away.

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:35.386
What... What's he saying?

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:37.756
Let's step out, okay?

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:48.206
Mom.

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.846
Yes.

00:03:56.476 --> 00:03:57.646
I'm your mother.

00:03:58.776 --> 00:04:02.146
When things are this hard, you should've come to me first.

00:04:02.886 --> 00:04:05.216
Why are you facing this alone? Why?

00:04:05.456 --> 00:04:07.556
Why are you hurting all by yourself? Why?

00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:09.186
Mom.

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:11.186
What do I do?

00:04:13.956 --> 00:04:15.096
What do I do?

00:04:19.936 --> 00:04:21.196
Mom, what am I going to do?

00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:23.036
What do I do?

00:04:29.246 --> 00:04:30.276
It's okay.

00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:34.616
It's going to be okay.

00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:37.116
Mom.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.416
What do I do, Mom?

00:04:48.926 --> 00:04:52.166
I don't get it. She was packing to move yesterday.

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:55.736
How did Aunt Hui Gyeong run away? What's going on?

00:04:56.206 --> 00:04:57.636
I'm not really sure either.

00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:01.776
Grandma must be so devastated.

00:05:02.576 --> 00:05:04.446
Grandfather left the same way, you know.

00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:07.575
I know. If your dad finds out,

00:05:07.576 --> 00:05:09.316
it'll be hard. It'll bring up the past.

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:12.056
I'll just pretend I didn't hear anything.

00:05:12.556 --> 00:05:13.886
Okay. Go on upstairs.

00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:19.626
- Good night, Grandma. - Okay, you too.

00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:23.066
Just leave him be. He'll be okay.

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:24.966
Okay, Mother.

00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:30.906
What could Dae Han have done wrong?

00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:33.606
Or was it...

00:05:34.706 --> 00:05:36.376
something I did? Did I upset her?

00:05:38.816 --> 00:05:40.016
No.

00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:43.386
Of course not. Don't even think that, Mother.

00:05:45.616 --> 00:05:46.616
Oh, dear.

00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:52.056
I never thought I'd live to see a day like this again.

00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:55.966
I'll try and take care of it.

00:05:56.726 --> 00:05:59.466
Don't be silly. You're too busy for that.

00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:04.266
- Forget it. - I can't let her get away with it.

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:10.446
I'll find her, get the story, get our money and an apology.

00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:12.516
It's the only way we can all move on.

00:06:14.546 --> 00:06:17.186
- I'm home. - You're back?

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:21.616
Is Dae Han back? Mom, how's Hui Gyeong's aunt?

00:06:21.826 --> 00:06:23.185
Your brother's asleep,

00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:25.896
- and they said her aunt is fine. - I see.

00:06:25.956 --> 00:06:27.996
You two go on in. I'll head to bed soon, too.

00:06:28.296 --> 00:06:31.566
But wait, Mom, you look upset. Is something wrong?

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:34.436
Hey, come on. Let's go to our room. Good night, Mother.

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:35.936
Go on. Let's go.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.176
Let's postpone next week's filming.

00:06:44.546 --> 00:06:47.046
- Why? - Something came up at home.

00:06:47.216 --> 00:06:48.216
Something at home?

00:06:48.716 --> 00:06:50.016
Why? What's going on at home?

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:52.286
With your family, that is.

00:06:52.486 --> 00:06:55.486
What is it? Is there something I don't know?

00:06:55.886 --> 00:06:58.356
Of course, there is. There always is.

00:06:59.696 --> 00:07:02.926
You're not interested anyway, so I'll just handle it myself.

00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:07.666
So just stay out of it and focus on your work like always.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:10.436
I'm calling Director Song, okay?

00:07:10.536 --> 00:07:14.736
Hold on, just sit down. I have a really funny story for you.

00:07:14.806 --> 00:07:17.076
Forget it. I'm not in the mood.

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:21.676
No, but you have to hear this. Bucket was so funny today.

00:07:21.746 --> 00:07:24.616
I was laughing so hard I almost died.

00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:28.056
Why? What did he do this time?

00:07:28.116 --> 00:07:32.126
Get this. The guy who begged me on his knees to be Vice President...

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:34.725
is already skipping morning workouts,

00:07:34.726 --> 00:07:36.296
claiming he's sick.

00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:41.096
So I sent him that video of him kneeling.

00:07:41.466 --> 00:07:43.566
And he came running like his life depended on it.

00:07:44.106 --> 00:07:46.836
- It was priceless! - You recorded it?

00:07:46.936 --> 00:07:49.745
No, from the security camera at the clinic.

00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:53.116
- I downloaded the footage. - That guy is something else.

00:07:53.176 --> 00:07:56.716
And that's not all. Check this out.

00:07:57.216 --> 00:08:00.156
Here are the accounting ledgers for the past three years...

00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:04.126
and the event summary reports. Organize them by category.

00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:08.126
- Right now? - Yes. When you're done with that,

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.666
run the night market survey. Get it done this week.

00:08:12.096 --> 00:08:13.236
By the end of this week?

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:18.066
Right. And you need to fill out a daily work log,

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:21.276
report it to me, and then you can clock out.

00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:24.406
A work log? Why can't I just tell you...

00:08:25.676 --> 00:08:28.416
That's not going to work. It's important to keep a record.

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:36.055
Yes, sir.

00:08:36.056 --> 00:08:37.485
(Onjeong Market Merchants' Association)

00:08:37.486 --> 00:08:38.496
Pardon?

00:08:38.796 --> 00:08:41.056
The toilet in Building A's restroom is clogged?

00:08:41.326 --> 00:08:44.996
That's a problem. The maintenance staff have all left.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.596
So there's no one here right now.

00:08:47.496 --> 00:08:50.236
I guess I'll have to do it myself...

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:56.006
Wait. I've got someone right here. Right, yes.

00:08:56.376 --> 00:08:58.516
Yes. I'll send someone right over.

00:08:59.176 --> 00:09:00.915
Don't mention it.

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:03.316
Just doing my job as president. All right.

00:09:05.216 --> 00:09:06.216
You heard that, right?

00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:08.526
Building A's restroom.

00:09:09.126 --> 00:09:10.186
So what?

00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:11.686
Go unclog it.

00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:16.096
Hey! These are a doctor's hands, meant for taking pulses.

00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:19.766
I was awarded "Golden Hands" at the Korean medicine conference!

00:09:19.896 --> 00:09:22.906
Goodness. There's a title for everything, isn't there?

00:09:23.206 --> 00:09:27.936
Who told you to use your bare hands? That's what tools are for.

00:09:28.106 --> 00:09:31.276
Come on, you know I have a weak stomach.

00:09:31.346 --> 00:09:33.346
I know. I hear you can't use public toilets...

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:35.146
and have to run home just to use the bathroom.

00:09:35.246 --> 00:09:36.746
You know that, and you still want me to unclog it?

00:09:37.616 --> 00:09:40.716
Fine, if you don't want to, you don't have to.

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:42.856
Now, where did I put that video?

00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:45.826
Hey, you petty jerk.

00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:48.296
This is so low and dirty. Fine, I'll do it...

00:09:51.396 --> 00:09:54.396
Hey, make sure you get that thing good and clear, okay?

00:09:57.966 --> 00:10:01.606
So? Don't tell me you quit just because you felt...

00:10:01.676 --> 00:10:02.976
it was gross and beneath you.

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:04.646
No.

00:10:18.456 --> 00:10:21.526
Gosh, really. Dr. Gong is going way too far.

00:10:22.566 --> 00:10:24.426
That jerk humiliated me.

00:10:32.706 --> 00:10:33.706
Should I really...

00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:35.946
keep putting up with this humiliation?

00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:39.076
Of course. This is all for your own good,

00:10:39.146 --> 00:10:40.376
so you have to endure it.

00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:42.416
How is any of this for me?

00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:44.316
Look, honey.

00:10:45.086 --> 00:10:48.556
Your valuable labor got that toilet unclogged, right?

00:10:48.626 --> 00:10:50.985
You solved someone's problem,

00:10:50.986 --> 00:10:52.726
and their gratitude will eventually...

00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:54.896
turn into another vote in your favor.

00:10:55.826 --> 00:10:58.666
All this humiliation just for one lousy vote?

00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:02.936
We learned the hard way how precious one vote is, honey.

00:11:03.536 --> 00:11:04.606
Back then...

00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:06.876
If only we'd gotten one more vote...

00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:10.576
Honey, I heard Mr. Hwang...

00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:12.946
was thrilled about you becoming the Vice President.

00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:17.746
Let's get some sun and enjoy a round of golf this weekend, okay?

00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:22.226
Come on, go get cleaned up.

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:24.826
I'll even put your body lotion on for you tonight.

00:11:25.856 --> 00:11:26.926
I love you.

00:11:27.926 --> 00:11:30.326
Hurry. Go on now.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:32.596
You think that'll get rid of the smell?

00:11:36.336 --> 00:11:37.506
Auntie!

00:11:39.206 --> 00:11:40.276
Oh, boy...

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:42.876
He's not there.

00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:45.746
Not at the gaming cafe, not at the pool hall,

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:51.216
- or the sauna, Ji Hu. - Hey, Dong Suk.

00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:53.756
Ji Hu, could you give us a minute?

00:11:55.156 --> 00:11:57.256
It's okay. I know what's going on.

00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:00.256
My dad took your things, didn't he?

00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:02.526
You think that's all he did?

00:12:03.626 --> 00:12:08.096
He stole everything from the store where he worked, too.

00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:11.536
He even cleaned out the bank account...

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.376
where he was saving his paychecks and disappeared.

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:26.186
This is juicy! I must tell Grandpa.

00:12:26.816 --> 00:12:28.786
- Yang Eun Bin! - What?

00:12:29.526 --> 00:12:32.196
If Grandfather finds out about this, he'll call the police.

00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:34.796
- Of course, he should. Grandpa... - Come here.

00:12:34.926 --> 00:12:38.465
Hey! If the neighborhood finds out,

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.566
it'll be a disgrace to our family!

00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:43.106
The market gossip can be so vicious. Forget about your dad's future.

00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:45.366
It could reflect badly on you and your brother, too.

00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:51.376
I'm going to handle this quietly. Nod if you understand.

00:12:56.316 --> 00:12:59.586
Don't you forget that this is a secret.

00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:02.656
Then get me a spa membership!

00:13:04.086 --> 00:13:06.156
- Deal! - Sweet!

00:13:20.476 --> 00:13:21.476
Yes.

00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:26.976
Are you done yet? They say to hurry. We're going to get some good food.

00:13:27.916 --> 00:13:31.386
I'm not sure if I should use this for my presentation.

00:13:34.256 --> 00:13:36.556
What's wrong now? What? Is it something about the Director?

00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:37.926
Yes.

00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:42.426
If I use this, he'll figure out that I know...

00:13:42.496 --> 00:13:45.396
that he's Yang Hyun Bin.

00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:51.736
Isn't it time he knew you know? Please, just tell him already.

00:13:51.866 --> 00:13:54.736
How can I? The Vice President is even here.

00:14:01.616 --> 00:14:03.686
(Seohae Garden)

00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:07.856
I wonder why the Vice President and the Director aren't coming in.

00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:09.786
You don't think they're fighting, do you?

00:14:11.686 --> 00:14:14.056
- This is all your fault. - I know.

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:18.866
- I'm the traitor, the spy. Happy? - Jerk...

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.166
Hey.

00:14:24.636 --> 00:14:28.776
The Director might dump the VP and switch over to you.

00:14:29.146 --> 00:14:32.616
Gosh, you really need to stop watching those dating shows.

00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:37.646
Come on, it's not like the VP isn't allowed to be here.

00:14:43.426 --> 00:14:46.956
If you barge in and ignore my plans, where does that leave me?

00:14:48.256 --> 00:14:51.796
Is treating the employees to a meal really worth getting so angry about?

00:14:52.126 --> 00:14:55.296
And you're making them suffer just to copy some reality show.

00:14:55.366 --> 00:14:59.076
No! This is how they earn a reward and pride that money can't buy. See?

00:14:59.236 --> 00:15:01.776
That's the priceless experience I'm trying to give them.

00:15:02.076 --> 00:15:05.246
As Vice President, I'm also looking out for the staff.

00:15:05.306 --> 00:15:07.146
That is a bold-faced lie.

00:15:08.446 --> 00:15:10.686
Just be honest with me, and I'll forgive you.

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:17.625
The company is suffocating me,

00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:19.656
and caring for my father is too much.

00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:22.396
I can't do anything I want, let alone have a relationship.

00:15:23.026 --> 00:15:24.026
But...

00:15:25.326 --> 00:15:27.966
watching you and Ms. Gong Ju Ah is so exciting and fun,

00:15:28.966 --> 00:15:30.506
so I came here to live vicariously through you two.

00:15:37.546 --> 00:15:40.076
Fine. Then you only get to watch.

00:15:41.476 --> 00:15:45.046
But you have to tell her you're Yang Hyun Bin today.

00:15:45.656 --> 00:15:47.186
Or I'll tell her myself.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:55.556
Unbelievable.

00:16:00.736 --> 00:16:02.936
Please, eat! You must all be starving.

00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:06.276
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy your meal.

00:16:06.676 --> 00:16:07.676
So...

00:16:09.346 --> 00:16:10.906
Am I making everyone uncomfortable?

00:16:12.046 --> 00:16:13.546
- No, not at all. - Of course not.

00:16:13.616 --> 00:16:14.616
Not at all!

00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:17.415
Not at all. You came all this way and are even buying us dinner.

00:16:17.416 --> 00:16:18.986
We're incredibly grateful.

00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:21.616
Thank you. I'm glad you understand, Mr. Park.

00:16:22.526 --> 00:16:25.826
- Everyone, dig in. - Enjoy your meal.

00:16:26.396 --> 00:16:30.766
As you all know, our Taehan Group began in fashion.

00:16:31.796 --> 00:16:36.106
The Chairman has a soft spot for the Fashion Division.

00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:39.636
So I need you all to win this competition...

00:16:40.106 --> 00:16:43.206
and prove your talent and your worth!

00:16:43.276 --> 00:16:44.906
- We'll do our best! - Yes.

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:46.616
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal.

00:16:46.676 --> 00:16:48.216
- Thanks for the food. - Enjoy your meal.

00:16:48.276 --> 00:16:52.216
The Chairman says our designers illuminate our company's future...

00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:53.686
Give it a rest!

00:16:54.416 --> 00:16:55.516
Oh, right.

00:16:55.826 --> 00:16:57.626
Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:16:58.826 --> 00:16:59.826
Goodness...

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:03.326
- Eat up. Please, eat. - Yes, let's eat.

00:17:04.396 --> 00:17:06.696
- Yes, thank you for the food. - Yes, enjoy.

00:17:08.396 --> 00:17:10.066
I told you not to be so obvious, didn't I?

00:17:10.436 --> 00:17:13.936
- What? I didn't do anything. - Whatever! Just hurry up and eat.

00:17:14.536 --> 00:17:15.976
Pacu Nacho.

00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:33.226
Looking at you up close...

00:17:34.256 --> 00:17:36.566
You kind of look like an anteater.

00:17:38.596 --> 00:17:40.536
You look like a sunfish.

00:17:41.466 --> 00:17:42.866
Hey, sunfish are cute.

00:17:43.906 --> 00:17:47.276
- Sure. - Seriously. You just wait.

00:18:34.686 --> 00:18:35.855
It's a good thing I came. Without me,

00:18:35.856 --> 00:18:36.956
the pairs would've been uneven, right?

00:18:37.556 --> 00:18:40.826
You're right. It's an honor to have you draw me, Vice President.

00:18:44.496 --> 00:18:45.936
Don't get your hopes up.

00:18:48.266 --> 00:18:50.166
What's the point of this, Director?

00:18:51.066 --> 00:18:52.166
This is...

00:18:53.536 --> 00:18:56.976
To observe each other's faces to bridge the psychological gap...

00:18:57.076 --> 00:19:01.116
and communicate without words. That's the purpose, Vice President.

00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:06.186
After this, we'll discuss the first creation,

00:19:06.256 --> 00:19:09.486
and we'll share our motivations to build a sense of unity.

00:19:09.856 --> 00:19:11.656
No interruptions are allowed. Got it?

00:19:12.956 --> 00:19:14.026
That sounds boring.

00:19:15.796 --> 00:19:17.526
Maybe we should have switched your partners.

00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:21.896
- Why is that? - Since you two are a couple...

00:19:22.236 --> 00:19:23.766
- Come on! - My gosh!

00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:26.806
Pacu Nacho and I are just friends. That's all.

00:19:27.076 --> 00:19:28.076
Really?

00:19:28.077 --> 00:19:30.576
The rumor going around the office is that you two are a couple.

00:19:30.646 --> 00:19:33.916
The VP has a sick sense of humor, lying to the executives.

00:19:34.516 --> 00:19:35.516
Ms. Gong Ju Ah.

00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:37.346
Do you have a boyfriend, by any chance?

00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:39.685
Excuse me, VP. We're here for the workshop.

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:41.616
- Please save personal questions... - She doesn't have one.

00:19:41.986 --> 00:19:43.086
About three years ago, I think?

00:19:43.756 --> 00:19:45.726
Her last one lasted about 7 to 8 months.

00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:47.396
- What are you doing? - What?

00:19:50.296 --> 00:19:53.436
Come to think of it, why isn't our Pacu Nacho dating?

00:19:53.936 --> 00:19:56.166
Now that I think about it, he never dated in Argentina either.

00:19:57.266 --> 00:20:00.436
Is there an unforgettable first love you're hung up on?

00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:05.406
Maybe a girl you liked before you went abroad?

00:20:06.776 --> 00:20:07.816
Right, Ms. Gong?

00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:13.956
Shoot! How did my eraser fly over there?

00:20:15.156 --> 00:20:16.156
How weird.

00:20:21.896 --> 00:20:22.896
Weird indeed.

00:20:28.236 --> 00:20:29.266
When I was in elementary school,

00:20:29.736 --> 00:20:32.306
I made this apron for my mom, who used to run a restaurant.

00:20:33.776 --> 00:20:36.946
When the nearby shop owners saw it, they placed orders too,

00:20:38.246 --> 00:20:40.316
and as I kept making things,

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:43.546
I ended up becoming the designer, Jo Seong Min.

00:20:46.356 --> 00:20:48.015
This scarf was...

00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:50.386
the first birthday gift I ever gave my dad.

00:20:53.056 --> 00:20:57.566
This is an outfit I made for my dog, Gamja.

00:20:58.226 --> 00:21:01.636
Gamja passed away a while ago,

00:21:03.836 --> 00:21:05.466
but she'll forever be my muse.

00:21:07.536 --> 00:21:10.346
I was born and raised without a father.

00:21:11.346 --> 00:21:12.846
To this day, I still don't know who he is.

00:21:14.146 --> 00:21:17.086
What some might call a child born out of wedlock.

00:21:18.746 --> 00:21:20.116
When I was in high school,

00:21:21.256 --> 00:21:25.126
I didn't know what to do in life, so I was lost for a while.

00:21:26.226 --> 00:21:29.526
But then, my mother told me something.

00:21:30.126 --> 00:21:32.396
She said my father had been a clothing designer.

00:21:33.596 --> 00:21:36.606
So I started studying hard and made this. And with it,

00:21:37.266 --> 00:21:40.036
I won the Taehan Design Contest.

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:43.346
If I ever get to meet my father someday,

00:21:44.006 --> 00:21:47.146
I want him to acknowledge me as a designer in my own right.

00:22:00.726 --> 00:22:02.426
Well, I...

00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:10.266
What is it? Do you recognize that?

00:22:10.706 --> 00:22:11.805
Well...

00:22:11.806 --> 00:22:15.506
This handkerchief. When I was young, a childhood friend was going abroad,

00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:18.646
- so I made it as a farewell gift. - Oh, my!

00:22:24.116 --> 00:22:26.116
Make sure you come back happy.

00:22:26.716 --> 00:22:27.716
Okay?

00:22:43.606 --> 00:22:45.706
You crybaby. It's a farewell gift.

00:22:46.206 --> 00:22:47.206
I made it myself.

00:22:48.506 --> 00:22:49.506
This...

00:22:50.446 --> 00:22:51.646
You really made this?

00:22:52.176 --> 00:22:53.176
Yes.

00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:57.186
Whenever you feel like crying, look at this handkerchief.

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:02.286
Remember me calling you a crybaby, and your tears will stop.

00:23:08.056 --> 00:23:09.056
You know something?

00:23:10.966 --> 00:23:15.036
You have a gift for making people happy.

00:23:28.076 --> 00:23:31.286
But to be honest, I ended up using it more myself.

00:23:32.616 --> 00:23:34.786
While I was in med school, which I had no passion for,

00:23:35.016 --> 00:23:38.386
I felt lost and kept wondering if I was on the right path.

00:23:39.086 --> 00:23:41.196
Every time I felt that way, I cried into this handkerchief.

00:23:42.156 --> 00:23:45.466
And every time I looked at this handkerchief,

00:23:45.796 --> 00:23:49.266
I'd remember my friend's words and his bright smile.

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:54.376
"You have a gift for making people happy."

00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:57.446
So I made up my mind.

00:23:59.006 --> 00:24:00.976
To become someone who creates happiness.

00:24:07.456 --> 00:24:10.326
But wait, why do you have it?

00:24:10.926 --> 00:24:12.756
Did he give it back to you?

00:24:13.496 --> 00:24:14.996
My friend doesn't know this, but...

00:24:15.696 --> 00:24:18.626
I actually made two so we could each have one.

00:24:20.166 --> 00:24:24.536
Wow, so it was a matching set. That's so romantic.

00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:29.976
So was he your first love, by any chance?

00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:37.286
I'd say he means much more to me than that.

00:24:37.646 --> 00:24:41.886
He opened up my world so I could live as a designer.

00:24:56.206 --> 00:24:57.206
Yes.

00:24:58.866 --> 00:24:59.976
The Chairman?

00:25:03.046 --> 00:25:04.776
Sorry, everyone, but I have to leave now.

00:25:04.946 --> 00:25:07.276
Is the Chairman in critical condition?

00:25:07.316 --> 00:25:10.316
I won't know until I get there. I'll call you when I arrive.

00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:11.986
I'm coming with you.

00:25:15.786 --> 00:25:18.986
Sorry, everyone. We'll call you when we get there.

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:21.426
Mr. Park, I'm leaving you in charge.

00:25:21.926 --> 00:25:22.926
Got it.

00:25:26.296 --> 00:25:27.866
All right, then. Let's go.

00:25:40.746 --> 00:25:42.376
What timing.

00:25:43.286 --> 00:25:44.846
Sorry for ruining the moment.

00:25:45.986 --> 00:25:49.216
This isn't my only chance. For today, this is more than enough.

00:25:49.626 --> 00:25:50.686
See? I told you.

00:25:51.226 --> 00:25:54.796
I'm telling you, Ju Ah knew you were Pacu Nacho all along.

00:25:55.726 --> 00:25:56.726
I guess so.

00:25:57.296 --> 00:26:00.936
My head's spinning, wondering when she figured it out.

00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:04.536
You two have a deeper connection than I realized.

00:26:05.466 --> 00:26:06.876
I was a little envious.

00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:10.446
Even though you were apart, your shared memories kept you going.

00:26:13.246 --> 00:26:14.916
That's all in the past.

00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:19.046
The Chairman will be all right, won't he?

00:26:19.616 --> 00:26:20.856
He has to be.

00:26:21.886 --> 00:26:23.456
It's scary being an only child at times like this.

00:26:24.756 --> 00:26:28.096
If I had any siblings, I'd have someone to lean on.

00:26:40.336 --> 00:26:41.936
Why are you so antsy?

00:26:42.776 --> 00:26:44.576
Are you that worried about the Chairman?

00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:46.746
Of course, I am.

00:26:47.416 --> 00:26:51.146
It's natural to worry when you hear an elder is sick, isn't it?

00:26:51.516 --> 00:26:54.156
You're right. I'm worried, too.

00:26:55.456 --> 00:26:57.856
Then why take it out on the fire?

00:26:58.056 --> 00:26:59.956
Are you upset that the Director left?

00:27:00.296 --> 00:27:04.926
Upset? Of course, he had to go. He's an executive, after all.

00:27:05.996 --> 00:27:07.265
Look, if you ask me...

00:27:07.266 --> 00:27:09.666
I think he and the Vice President have already talked about you.

00:27:12.306 --> 00:27:14.976
No matter how you slice it, this was one heck of a workshop.

00:27:15.706 --> 00:27:18.876
One day the Director confesses, the next day you do.

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:22.276
What confession? It's all just ancient history.

00:27:23.286 --> 00:27:26.386
- Still, things will be different. - Different? Whatever.

00:27:27.286 --> 00:27:30.386
Our families are still enemies, you know.

00:27:34.526 --> 00:27:35.596
It's the Director.

00:27:37.766 --> 00:27:38.796
Yes, Director.

00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:43.506
Mr. Park, his breathing was a bit unstable for a moment,

00:27:43.606 --> 00:27:45.606
but I waited until he was stable before I left.

00:27:46.436 --> 00:27:50.906
It'd be awkward to go back, so just carry on without me.

00:27:51.446 --> 00:27:54.216
Understood. I'll send you photos.

00:27:54.676 --> 00:27:56.176
Yes. See you at the office in a couple of days.

00:27:57.116 --> 00:27:58.986
Wait. Hello? Gong Ju Ah is right here...

00:28:02.486 --> 00:28:03.486
He hung up.

00:28:04.486 --> 00:28:06.526
Is the Chairman okay?

00:28:06.896 --> 00:28:08.026
Yes, thankfully.

00:28:08.796 --> 00:28:10.926
But I wonder why he didn't ask about you.

00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:14.366
Why do you always have to make things so weird?

00:28:14.636 --> 00:28:15.996
Gosh, I'm going to bed.

00:28:31.186 --> 00:28:33.085
And every time I looked at this handkerchief,

00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:37.626
I'd remember my friend's words and his bright smile.

00:28:38.226 --> 00:28:39.896
So I made up my mind.

00:28:41.526 --> 00:28:43.566
To become someone who creates happiness.

00:28:50.736 --> 00:28:54.276
So was he your first love, by any chance?

00:28:55.006 --> 00:28:57.906
I'd say he means much more to me than that.

00:28:58.976 --> 00:29:03.086
He opened up my world so I could live as a designer.

00:29:43.326 --> 00:29:46.426
Wow, this pollack soup is great. Dae Han.

00:29:46.856 --> 00:29:49.996
When is your wife getting back? She'll be back before the move?

00:29:52.796 --> 00:29:54.366
She's at her aunt's place.

00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:56.436
She said she's going to stay a few more days.

00:29:56.566 --> 00:30:00.436
So that's why you're so down? Because your wife's away.

00:30:00.506 --> 00:30:01.576
Goodness.

00:30:02.506 --> 00:30:04.606
- I guess so. - Woo Jae.

00:30:05.476 --> 00:30:07.976
Can you order some supplies for the pharmacy later?

00:30:08.246 --> 00:30:10.586
Sure, but I have an online class today,

00:30:10.646 --> 00:30:12.216
so I'll get it done for you tomorrow morning.

00:30:12.586 --> 00:30:15.656
- Hurry up, you said you were late. - What?

00:30:15.716 --> 00:30:16.726
Yes.

00:30:17.056 --> 00:30:18.186
By the way, Dae Han.

00:30:18.456 --> 00:30:20.496
That new place you're moving into, how big is it?

00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:22.325
You should be thinking about when you have kids,

00:30:22.326 --> 00:30:24.126
so you should've looked for something bigger...

00:30:24.196 --> 00:30:26.296
Gosh, what's gotten into you today?

00:30:26.566 --> 00:30:27.966
What? What did I do?

00:30:28.096 --> 00:30:32.436
Why are you asking about family you never cared about before?

00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:36.136
Unbelievable. One minute you're mad I don't care about family matters,

00:30:36.406 --> 00:30:39.506
and the next you're mad that I do. I can't win with you, seriously.

00:30:39.646 --> 00:30:41.946
Gong Dae Han, finish up. We need to go.

00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:45.016
- Let's go. Time for our workout. - Yes.

00:30:45.386 --> 00:30:46.786
Unbelievable.

00:30:50.026 --> 00:30:51.956
So what are we going to do?

00:30:52.556 --> 00:30:55.296
What can we do? We should just wait.

00:30:56.526 --> 00:30:58.796
He'll be back when his money's gone, won't he?

00:30:58.926 --> 00:31:01.336
Are you crazy? You'd really take him back?

00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:06.506
Hello, sir.

00:31:07.136 --> 00:31:08.936
Have you heard from Ji Hu's Dad?

00:31:09.076 --> 00:31:11.776
Heard from him? I should be asking you that.

00:31:11.876 --> 00:31:14.076
He has until the end of the day to return the items or pay for them.

00:31:14.146 --> 00:31:15.176
If he doesn't pay up,

00:31:15.246 --> 00:31:17.486
I'm reporting him to the police for theft.

00:31:17.986 --> 00:31:20.686
Wait, how much is it in total?

00:31:22.556 --> 00:31:23.826
Thirty thousand dollars?

00:31:24.586 --> 00:31:26.926
How are we supposed to come up with that kind of money right now?

00:31:27.226 --> 00:31:28.796
Gosh, I can't deal with this!

00:31:30.696 --> 00:31:32.026
This is driving me crazy!

00:31:32.096 --> 00:31:35.596
What's to go crazy about? Let him get reported and caught.

00:31:36.366 --> 00:31:39.706
I'll give you back the money you gave me,

00:31:39.766 --> 00:31:41.836
so you can pay for the items first.

00:31:42.336 --> 00:31:45.646
But what about the money for your designer rentals?

00:31:45.906 --> 00:31:49.176
That... I'll figure something out.

00:31:49.446 --> 00:31:51.346
And how are you going to do that?

00:31:52.046 --> 00:31:55.185
Exactly. How will you manage without my father's permission...

00:31:55.186 --> 00:31:56.516
to spend money?

00:31:56.656 --> 00:31:59.526
Well, I'm sure there's a way.

00:32:00.356 --> 00:32:03.966
What a waste of that Cabanel bag. I never even got to use it.

00:32:04.226 --> 00:32:06.966
Auntie, why on earth did you marry a guy like that?

00:32:07.566 --> 00:32:10.066
When your dad was pushing me to get married,

00:32:10.306 --> 00:32:12.866
he was the only man who was interested in me.

00:32:13.776 --> 00:32:18.376
- Divorce him. Find a good man. - Hey.

00:32:18.676 --> 00:32:20.176
What decent man would be...

00:32:21.316 --> 00:32:23.046
crazy enough to date me?

00:32:30.656 --> 00:32:33.156
(Pharmacy)

00:32:36.826 --> 00:32:38.196
Mom, it's about Hui Gyeong.

00:32:39.596 --> 00:32:41.496
She got her certification a few months ago.

00:32:43.196 --> 00:32:45.766
So she got it and still went out, saying she was studying?

00:32:46.606 --> 00:32:47.606
Yes.

00:32:48.736 --> 00:32:50.806
It looked like she was checking out properties in Ganghwa,

00:32:51.606 --> 00:32:52.646
so I went to check it out.

00:32:53.076 --> 00:32:55.916
But Ganghwa is so close.

00:32:56.376 --> 00:32:59.146
Unbelievable. She's got some nerve.

00:33:03.286 --> 00:33:04.456
And the fact that she's seeing another man...

00:33:05.086 --> 00:33:06.426
How did you find out?

00:33:07.356 --> 00:33:10.696
I just... I happened to overhear it.

00:33:12.566 --> 00:33:13.836
So, what now?

00:33:15.336 --> 00:33:16.336
Mom.

00:33:17.466 --> 00:33:18.506
What about you?

00:33:19.866 --> 00:33:21.476
Why didn't you ever look for Dad?

00:33:25.546 --> 00:33:28.176
I figured, what good would it do to see that mess with my own eyes?

00:33:31.046 --> 00:33:32.046
But...

00:33:32.716 --> 00:33:34.056
now I regret it.

00:33:35.816 --> 00:33:38.856
If only I had gotten closure back then.

00:33:40.296 --> 00:33:42.796
If I'd seen it for myself and just cut him out of my heart.

00:33:45.226 --> 00:33:46.326
For all those years,

00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:50.106
I wouldn't have spent all that time waiting and hoping he'd come back.

00:33:54.176 --> 00:33:55.806
You need to get a divorce.

00:33:56.606 --> 00:33:58.306
You can't go on living like this.

00:33:59.506 --> 00:34:00.516
Okay.

00:34:04.046 --> 00:34:05.446
It's a number I don't recognize.

00:34:07.656 --> 00:34:08.756
Hello? Who is this?

00:34:12.226 --> 00:34:13.726
It's a friend. Just a friend.

00:34:14.826 --> 00:34:15.826
Bring you what?

00:34:24.466 --> 00:34:25.466
How much is it?

00:34:27.706 --> 00:34:29.036
Hey, forget it.

00:34:29.976 --> 00:34:31.176
Is this why you called?

00:34:31.706 --> 00:34:32.706
Because the other pharmacies are too far?

00:34:32.976 --> 00:34:33.976
No, that's not it.

00:34:35.046 --> 00:34:36.345
I went to the clinic to see you,

00:34:36.346 --> 00:34:37.686
but they said you were at the pharmacy.

00:34:38.816 --> 00:34:39.816
So I got your number.

00:34:40.786 --> 00:34:41.816
So why were you looking for me?

00:34:43.386 --> 00:34:44.756
To tell me not to spread rumors about you?

00:34:45.726 --> 00:34:49.156
That's right. I won't talk if you don't.

00:34:50.666 --> 00:34:51.726
Okay, fine. Deal.

00:34:56.296 --> 00:34:59.236
Everyone at the market knows why I'm living with my family.

00:34:59.906 --> 00:35:02.036
If they find out that jerk is in money trouble again,

00:35:03.706 --> 00:35:05.476
I'll be too humiliated to even show my face.

00:35:10.646 --> 00:35:11.846
How much did he run off with?

00:35:14.056 --> 00:35:15.586
All the money we've saved up,

00:35:16.186 --> 00:35:17.826
plus the stolen designer goods...

00:35:18.986 --> 00:35:20.426
It must be at least 100,000 dollars.

00:35:20.726 --> 00:35:21.726
A hundred thousand dollars?

00:35:22.826 --> 00:35:25.196
I have to go. Thanks for the drink.

00:35:26.866 --> 00:35:27.866
Hey.

00:35:36.706 --> 00:35:37.706
Gosh, you startled me.

00:35:41.516 --> 00:35:42.516
Did you hear all that?

00:35:46.546 --> 00:35:47.756
Please pretend you didn't hear anything.

00:35:49.586 --> 00:35:50.586
I didn't hear a thing.

00:36:03.236 --> 00:36:06.236
(Warm and Reliable Police)

00:36:06.306 --> 00:36:07.676
Thank you so much for your help yesterday.

00:36:08.436 --> 00:36:11.376
I'll be sure to repay this favor.

00:36:11.506 --> 00:36:13.746
Please. It was nothing.

00:36:14.046 --> 00:36:16.076
No, really. You were a huge help.

00:36:18.216 --> 00:36:21.416
Chief, sorry about the other day. I apologize.

00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:22.716
Don't worry about it.

00:36:24.056 --> 00:36:25.056
Well, then.

00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:26.386
Mr. Gong.

00:36:27.126 --> 00:36:28.226
I...

00:36:29.096 --> 00:36:32.296
- I have the license plate number. - Sorry?

00:36:32.426 --> 00:36:36.236
Yes, I saw it on the store's CCTV and jotted down the number.

00:36:36.736 --> 00:36:38.636
- Really? - But...

00:36:38.906 --> 00:36:41.536
we can't give you the number or run a check on it.

00:36:42.206 --> 00:36:44.976
If you file an official report, then we can help.

00:36:45.046 --> 00:36:47.046
- Can't you just tell me the number? - We can't.

00:36:51.886 --> 00:36:52.986
(We're here to help with anything.)

00:36:53.146 --> 00:36:54.156
Right.

00:36:54.916 --> 00:36:55.916
No, that's okay.

00:36:57.726 --> 00:36:58.726
Never mind.

00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:04.466
Oh, wait...

Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:37:38.826 --> 00:37:42.096
Hey, for plastic bottles, peel the label and crush them flat.

00:37:42.366 --> 00:37:43.865
And sort the glass bottles by color.

00:37:43.866 --> 00:37:45.836

Hey, I already stuffed it full!

- Just like this? - Yes, it's open. Now stomp it down!

00:38:45.596 --> 00:38:48.296
- Pack it tight. Yes. - Do we really have to do this?

00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:50.536
Harder! Push down harder! Go on.

Don't say you lost all your patients because of that rumor I started.

Back then...

00:39:56.236 --> 00:40:00.036
I was so terribly sorry. Gosh, I must've been out of my mind.

I appreciate that, but...

00:40:09.876 --> 00:40:12.416
Dr. Gong is just so mean.

00:40:12.746 --> 00:40:16.456
He torments and bullies my husband like a bratty little kid.

00:40:17.556 --> 00:40:18.556
He says it's hard?

00:40:19.286 --> 00:40:22.356
And to think he got on his knees and begged for any work at all.

00:40:22.826 --> 00:40:23.826
Oh, my.

00:40:24.866 --> 00:40:27.536
Dr. Gong must've been bluffing in front of you, Doctor.

00:40:27.696 --> 00:40:29.896
My husband did not get on his knees.

00:40:29.966 --> 00:40:34.036
Oh, come on. Dong Ik must have been embarrassed, so he lied to his wife.

00:40:34.976 --> 00:40:36.106
He got down on his knees.

00:40:38.506 --> 00:40:39.806
That's impossible.

00:40:40.846 --> 00:40:42.646
Do you have proof?

00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:44.346
I do.

00:40:45.146 --> 00:40:47.086
I learned from someone recently.

00:40:47.786 --> 00:40:49.256
The importance of having proof.

00:40:52.086 --> 00:40:53.086
Well, then...

You must get your hands on Dr. Gong's phone.

What good will that do? I don't know the password.

00:41:45.706 --> 00:41:47.746
It's definitely a backwards L.

00:41:48.276 --> 00:41:50.216
Or maybe just an L.

What the...

00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:20.646
Why show your face to the phone like that?

00:42:20.946 --> 00:42:24.686
Oh, this? It's facial recognition. It's easy to use with one hand. Why?

00:42:25.116 --> 00:42:27.816
Oh, I see. I was just curious.

00:42:28.256 --> 00:42:30.786
What's this? Did you text me?

00:42:31.356 --> 00:42:32.356
- What? - Oh, I...

- Oh, no. - What were you doing out there?

Yes.

Quiet! Give that here.

00:48:21.376 --> 00:48:22.506
So should I still pretend I don't know?

00:48:27.076 --> 00:48:28.076
What is going on?

00:48:32.046 --> 00:48:33.046
Yes, Director.

00:48:33.616 --> 00:48:34.616
Gong Ju Ah.

00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:37.956
Gong Ju Ah?

00:48:38.726 --> 00:48:39.726
That's right. Ju Ah.

00:48:40.856 --> 00:48:41.856
It's me.

00:48:42.996 --> 00:48:43.996
Yang Hyun Bin.

00:48:47.636 --> 00:48:48.896
I'm back.

00:48:50.536 --> 00:48:53.036
Yes. Hyun Bin.

00:48:54.136 --> 00:48:55.336
If you have a minute,

00:48:56.306 --> 00:48:57.376
could you come out?

00:48:58.946 --> 00:49:01.216
Right now? Where are you?

00:49:02.846 --> 00:49:05.916
The last place we saw each other.

00:50:49.486 --> 00:50:51.686
So you're really back, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:50:52.786 --> 00:50:53.786
Yes.

00:50:54.656 --> 00:50:55.656
Have you been well?

00:50:56.256 --> 00:50:57.256
Yes.

00:50:59.696 --> 00:51:00.696
What about you?

00:51:01.536 --> 00:51:02.566
Did you find your happiness?

00:51:06.606 --> 00:51:07.976
I made up my mind right then.

00:51:08.406 --> 00:51:11.706
I had to be happy, no matter what, and I would never cry again.

00:51:11.846 --> 00:51:14.446
So that if I ever met her again someday...

00:51:15.916 --> 00:51:18.316
I wanted her to be proud of the life I'd lived.

00:51:19.786 --> 00:51:21.016
You did well.

00:51:22.056 --> 00:51:24.526
You've lived a very good life, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:51:26.486 --> 00:51:27.486
Thanks to you.

00:51:28.696 --> 00:51:30.826
It's good to see you again, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:51:38.206 --> 00:51:39.206
I've missed you,

00:51:40.136 --> 00:51:41.136
Gong Ju Ah.

00:51:57.926 --> 00:52:00.956
I wish we could have met like this from the very beginning.

00:52:01.726 --> 00:52:02.726
Tell me about it.

00:52:03.456 --> 00:52:06.326
We took the long way around to get here.

00:52:09.096 --> 00:52:12.366
I'm sorry I had to leave yesterday without a chance to talk.

00:52:12.806 --> 00:52:14.335
We were at a workshop,

00:52:14.336 --> 00:52:17.576
so it felt wrong to talk in front of the staff.

00:52:18.276 --> 00:52:19.346
Of course, I understand.

00:52:20.306 --> 00:52:22.346
So when did you figure out it was me?

00:52:22.716 --> 00:52:24.176
At that chicken soup restaurant?

00:52:24.986 --> 00:52:29.216
No, Gaetdari Samhap. When you were drunk and sang for me.

00:52:31.786 --> 00:52:35.256
- Why didn't you say anything then? - You're the one who ran off.

00:52:36.026 --> 00:52:39.226
- I did? - And you treated me like a creep.

00:52:41.396 --> 00:52:42.396
Sorry.

00:52:45.536 --> 00:52:48.706
Waiting for you to recognize me was torture.

00:52:49.076 --> 00:52:52.376
How was I supposed to recognize you? You've changed so much.

00:52:52.976 --> 00:52:53.976
That's a relief.

00:52:54.276 --> 00:52:56.846
I worked really hard to change, you know.

00:52:58.086 --> 00:53:00.646
But then why didn't you say anything after you knew it was me?

00:53:01.886 --> 00:53:04.886
I mean, come on. You're the director.

00:53:07.086 --> 00:53:09.226
Let's just be casual outside of work.

00:53:09.956 --> 00:53:10.956
Okay.

00:53:11.566 --> 00:53:14.426
Then you have to treat me like your big sister.

00:53:14.666 --> 00:53:16.266
What? No, thanks.

00:53:18.366 --> 00:53:19.436
My gosh.

00:53:21.206 --> 00:53:22.206
Ju Ah?

00:53:23.976 --> 00:53:25.946
- Hey, brother. - What?

00:53:27.246 --> 00:53:29.216
- Is that your brother? - Yes.

00:53:29.276 --> 00:53:32.346
Woo Jae... You remember the director from my company, right?

00:53:32.486 --> 00:53:33.486
Yang Hyun Bin.

00:53:33.846 --> 00:53:34.856
Hello.

00:53:35.516 --> 00:53:37.016
Hey, Woo Jae. Long time no see.

00:53:37.786 --> 00:53:39.786
I almost wouldn't have recognized you.

00:53:40.686 --> 00:53:42.726
By the way, Eun Bin, what are you doing here?

00:53:44.056 --> 00:53:47.726
We have a date tomorrow, so I gave Woo Jae the matching shirts.

00:53:47.796 --> 00:53:51.096
Then he offered to walk me home, so we were on our way...

00:53:51.736 --> 00:53:56.236
- And then we saw you. - Wait, hang on. What? A date?

00:53:56.476 --> 00:53:57.476
Matching shirts?

00:53:58.106 --> 00:54:00.246
Hey, let's talk at home.

00:54:01.346 --> 00:54:02.846
Right, let's go home, Eun Bin.

00:54:03.146 --> 00:54:05.316
Hey, you'll be in huge trouble if anyone sees you together.

00:54:05.386 --> 00:54:07.646
Right? If my stepmom saw the four of us together,

00:54:07.716 --> 00:54:09.116
she'd totally flip out, wouldn't she?

00:54:09.786 --> 00:54:13.286
I'm so happy. I think my wish is coming true.

00:54:13.986 --> 00:54:16.726
- What wish? - Double in-laws.

00:54:20.566 --> 00:54:22.396
Hey, let's go.

00:54:23.096 --> 00:54:26.606
- Ms. Gong, I'll see you at work. - Yes, Director. Get home safe.

00:54:27.406 --> 00:54:29.406
Woo Jae, see you tomorrow. And I'll see you again!

00:54:29.836 --> 00:54:31.276
Or should I say sister-in-law?

00:54:31.946 --> 00:54:34.306
Hey, let's go. Come on. Bye.

00:54:34.376 --> 00:54:37.446
We're going the same way, so let's go. See you, sister-in-law!

00:54:37.776 --> 00:54:38.786
Why, you...

00:54:42.616 --> 00:54:44.726
I'm telling you, we're not really dating.

00:54:44.956 --> 00:54:47.355
Explain the date and the matching shirts.

00:54:47.356 --> 00:54:49.456
Spit it out. Five, four, three...

00:54:49.526 --> 00:54:51.625
Eun Bin told me it was her stepmom who spread the rumor...

00:54:51.626 --> 00:54:53.396
that our mom was having an affair.

00:54:54.096 --> 00:54:55.166
So?

00:54:55.236 --> 00:54:59.236
She said I owe her. Because of her, our dad won the election.

00:54:59.306 --> 00:55:00.966
So I just agreed to go out with her once.

00:55:01.276 --> 00:55:03.776
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

00:55:04.436 --> 00:55:08.976
You're one to talk. What about you? You said you'd ignore him,

00:55:09.216 --> 00:55:12.186
so why were you so cozy at the cafe? What if our parents find out?

00:55:12.416 --> 00:55:14.586
Who do you think you're talking back to?

00:55:14.786 --> 00:55:15.786
Eyes down!

00:55:15.856 --> 00:55:18.126
I am looking down! You're just shorter than me.

00:55:18.186 --> 00:55:19.886
Quiet! Enough with the constant back talk.

00:55:21.496 --> 00:55:23.996
So, nothing happened at home, right?

00:55:25.326 --> 00:55:26.866
Yes, nothing.

00:55:27.226 --> 00:55:29.096
What was that? You hesitated.

00:55:29.966 --> 00:55:31.366
Something happened, didn't it?

00:55:33.936 --> 00:55:37.336
Eyes front. What is it? Spill it.

00:55:39.446 --> 00:55:42.976
- Hey. Headlock for old time's sake? - No.

00:55:47.486 --> 00:55:50.256
It's about Uncle.

00:55:50.756 --> 00:55:51.826
What about Uncle?

00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:01.066
Uncle.

00:56:02.496 --> 00:56:03.496
Ju Ah.

00:56:04.806 --> 00:56:07.306
- How was your workshop? - It was fine.

00:56:07.766 --> 00:56:09.276
What are you watching, Uncle?

00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:11.306
Just flipping through channels.

00:56:12.506 --> 00:56:14.746
- Can I have a beer? - Of course.

00:56:16.876 --> 00:56:19.516
This is nice. Here, cheers.

00:56:20.586 --> 00:56:21.586
Cheers.

00:56:24.786 --> 00:56:26.256
Goodness.

00:56:32.896 --> 00:56:34.466
Uncle...

00:56:56.686 --> 00:56:58.556
Gong Jeong Han, that jerk.

00:57:00.556 --> 00:57:01.896
Are you that upset, honey?

00:57:02.696 --> 00:57:04.456
Ever since we were kids, they always compared us.

00:57:05.226 --> 00:57:07.126
It was always, "Jeong Han this, Jeong Han that."

00:57:08.066 --> 00:57:10.666
But still. How could he not vote for me?

00:57:12.436 --> 00:57:13.506
Honey.

00:57:18.646 --> 00:57:19.806
This is really depressing.

00:57:36.596 --> 00:57:39.166
Grandpa, you really went too far this time.

00:57:39.826 --> 00:57:42.636
Exactly, Dad. After seeing how hard he worked,

00:57:42.836 --> 00:57:44.066
how could you vote for the other guy?

00:57:45.536 --> 00:57:50.136
Dad's so petty, he'll sulk forever. He's even skipping breakfast.

00:57:53.646 --> 00:57:55.346
You all can go ahead and eat.

00:57:55.846 --> 00:57:57.376
I don't really have an appetite either.

00:57:58.716 --> 00:58:00.386
It was all for Dong Ik's sake.

00:58:02.256 --> 00:58:05.286
Jeong Han has no political ambition,

00:58:05.626 --> 00:58:07.626
so he would do a proper job.

00:58:08.226 --> 00:58:09.226
Dong Ik, on the other hand...

00:58:10.126 --> 00:58:13.726
His only goal was getting elected, so he would've ignored his duties.

00:58:14.396 --> 00:58:16.366
I guess you're right.

00:58:16.836 --> 00:58:19.966
If that happened, he would've lost his run for council.

00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:24.576
He must win people over for votes, just like he's doing now.

00:58:25.606 --> 00:58:29.616
You're absolutely right, Father. Then please, enjoy the food.

00:58:31.176 --> 00:58:32.246
How much do you want?

00:58:35.586 --> 00:58:38.226
I'll give it to you as an apology.

00:58:39.256 --> 00:58:41.256
How much will it take to make things right?

00:58:44.256 --> 00:58:46.066
Forty thousand dollars, Father.

00:58:49.796 --> 00:58:50.796
Done.

00:58:57.636 --> 00:58:58.706
Forty thousand?

00:59:06.886 --> 00:59:09.755
Dad always takes your side.

00:59:09.756 --> 00:59:11.486
Forty thousand dollars, just like that.

00:59:11.886 --> 00:59:14.256
Isn't this what they call a blessing in disguise?

00:59:14.586 --> 00:59:16.396
Such is life.

00:59:17.626 --> 00:59:21.996
I'm going to get ready. Could you do the dishes first?

00:59:22.066 --> 00:59:24.666
Of course. You think I'd only do the dishes?

00:59:24.866 --> 00:59:27.736
I'll do anything. Where are you off to?

00:59:28.206 --> 00:59:31.776
A lady I met in a class at the community center told me...

00:59:32.006 --> 00:59:35.946
about a private detective agency great for finding runaway husbands.

00:59:36.376 --> 00:59:37.576
A private detective agency?

00:59:39.216 --> 00:59:43.756
- A lawyer? - Yes. I know a family lawyer.

00:59:44.186 --> 00:59:46.686
I'm going to go talk to them about our realistic options.

00:59:47.386 --> 00:59:48.926
Okay.

00:59:50.496 --> 00:59:51.766
I thought you were heading out today.

00:59:52.996 --> 00:59:55.196
I'm just going to buy some supplies for the pharmacy before I go.

00:59:56.066 --> 00:59:57.566
By the way, about this laptop...

00:59:58.136 --> 00:59:59.766
Aunt used this sometimes too, right?

01:00:00.136 --> 01:00:02.936
Yes, she did. Why?

01:00:03.076 --> 01:00:05.946
It's automatically logged in to a web portal with her email.

01:00:06.446 --> 01:00:07.446
- What? - What?

01:00:10.416 --> 01:00:14.086
I thought it was my account, but it has a new order and address.

01:00:28.026 --> 01:00:29.966
Wait, Cabanel?

01:00:30.696 --> 01:00:33.836
Cabanel. It's Cabanel. Cabanel... Stepmom.

01:00:36.076 --> 01:00:37.876
Stepmom!

01:00:38.976 --> 01:00:41.406
- The Cabanel bag's been listed. - What?

01:00:41.446 --> 01:00:45.016
I think Uncle listed it on a resale app to sell it!

01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:49.716
- Really? - Yes, really! Where's Aunt?

01:00:51.016 --> 01:00:52.256
Excuse me, Chief.

01:00:53.886 --> 01:00:58.296
By any chance, can you do location or vehicle tracking?

01:00:58.366 --> 01:00:59.826
(Warm and Reliable Police)

01:00:59.896 --> 01:01:04.296
That's a hot request these days. Location and vehicle tracking.

01:01:06.066 --> 01:01:07.706
Is this about a family member?

01:01:08.236 --> 01:01:12.406
If you file a missing person report, we can help you with that.

01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:14.076
No, it's not like that.

01:01:15.376 --> 01:01:18.816
I couldn't just sit around, so I thought I'd come and ask.

01:01:19.916 --> 01:01:21.286
- I see. - Right.

01:01:28.656 --> 01:01:29.796
Excuse me.

01:01:29.956 --> 01:01:33.496
Can't you just run the license plate through the system?

01:01:34.926 --> 01:01:37.266
- Can't you do it for me? - I can't do that.

01:01:41.606 --> 01:01:43.606
- Please, sir. I'm begging you. - What?

01:01:43.936 --> 01:01:48.516
Can't you just find out where he is? The plate is 314 J9542.

01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:50.516
- I can't. - Wait, 314 J9542?

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:52.716
- Chief, please. Just this once. - We can't.

01:01:52.786 --> 01:01:57.656
- Chief, please. Just once... - Auntie! I know where Uncle is!

01:01:57.816 --> 01:02:01.526
- What? - That Cabanel bag! For real! Hurry!

01:02:02.226 --> 01:02:03.826
- Where is he? - Quick!

01:02:03.896 --> 01:02:06.866
- Chief? - What?

01:02:07.396 --> 01:02:08.536
The person that lady is looking for...

01:02:09.066 --> 01:02:10.136
I think it's this guy.

01:02:12.006 --> 01:02:13.006
What?

01:02:19.176 --> 01:02:21.406
Mom, I think that's the place.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.326
Hurry up and come out, honey.

01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:43.436
That's Hui Gyeong.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:48.976
Honey, just a second.

01:02:52.046 --> 01:02:53.746
Hey, that guy.

01:02:55.346 --> 01:02:57.646
Oh, my. Wait.

01:02:58.116 --> 01:02:59.716
Isn't he the son-in-law from the Korean medicine clinic?

01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:01.646
No way.

01:03:02.216 --> 01:03:04.086
- Honey, wait just a second. - Okay.

01:03:05.956 --> 01:03:07.726
- Mom, Grandma. - I can't believe it.

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.326
What is it?

01:03:10.526 --> 01:03:11.526
Look.

01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:17.696
- This is it, right? - Dong Suk, over here!

01:03:20.566 --> 01:03:23.406
- What now? - If you go this way...

01:03:23.876 --> 01:03:24.876
It's close by.

01:03:56.706 --> 01:03:57.936
Are you protesting or something?

01:03:58.806 --> 01:04:02.216
- Gong Ju Ah and I are just friends. - Friends?

01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:03.276
We're old friends.

01:04:03.346 --> 01:04:05.846
Then why the long face? Are you sure you're just friends?

01:04:05.916 --> 01:04:07.546
Men and women can't be just friends.

01:04:07.646 --> 01:04:08.656
Well...

01:04:08.986 --> 01:04:10.556
What about my place?

01:04:10.886 --> 01:04:14.886
But apparently, their parents have also been my patients.

01:04:15.156 --> 01:04:16.195
I wonder who they are.

01:04:16.196 --> 01:04:18.126
How about a blind date with my brother?

01:04:19.066 --> 01:04:20.166
A blind date?

01:04:20.896 --> 01:04:23.235
We truly love each other.

01:04:23.236 --> 01:04:25.505
Loving someone's no crime, is it?

01:04:25.506 --> 01:04:26.506
Hey!
