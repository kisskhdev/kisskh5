=The Truth=

=Episode 18=

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:38.099
Taxi.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.979
Done.

00:02:25.698 --> 00:02:26.379
Alright.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.418
Then it's settled.

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.259
But I can only tell you

00:02:31.858 --> 00:02:33.898
the specifics right before you leave.

00:02:36.298 --> 00:02:38.659
I wish you success.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.618
There won't be any surprises
waiting for us, right?

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.099
It's fine.

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.698
We only hope
that Mr. Bao shows up on time.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.138
Aren't you worried at all?

00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:29.939
Bao Hei's final test

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:31.738
isn't targeting us.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.339
But him.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:38.178
Why do I find it a bit risky?

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.578
Fortune favors the bold.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:43.939
Let's just play it by ear.

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.979
Yes, Alzheimer's.

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.779
No, half a day won't work.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.659
I need 24-hour care.

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:02.539
Nobody?

00:04:03.178 --> 00:04:04.219
Please do your best.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.499
Find me someone.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:07.339
Okay.

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.939
I'll call you back later.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.939
I'm going out
for some late-night snacks.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.018
Should I bring you some?

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:15.659
I'm not hungry.

00:04:18.618 --> 00:04:19.672
It's about the caretaker?

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:21.019
Yeah.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.858
Now we can only find temporary help.

00:04:25.178 --> 00:04:26.539
But temporary workers

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:30.258
don't want to care for the sick elderly.

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.899
Is there any other way?

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:38.019
My father
doesn't want to be hospitalized.

00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:39.779
I understand him.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.459
Think about it.

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:42.818
Even I can't bear

00:04:43.298 --> 00:04:44.699
to put up with others' attitudes.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.899
It's okay.

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:48.058
We'll figure something out.

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:48.659
Yeah.

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:50.459
Take it one day at a time.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.738
Go ahead now.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.378
Nothing else, right?

00:04:56.418 --> 00:04:59.579
Tell me if you need anything.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:01.219
Okay, got it.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:10.818
Hello?

00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:14.818
Yeah, it's me.

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:10.539
Hello?

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.979
Ms. Miao.

00:06:14.418 --> 00:06:17.818
There's something
I need to discuss with you.

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.818
Ms. Miao.

00:06:40.738 --> 00:06:41.899
You're late.

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:43.099
You arrived too early.

00:06:44.178 --> 00:06:46.019
You were late
for the college entrance exams.

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:47.139
But today you're early.

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:50.339
Ms. Miao.

00:06:51.418 --> 00:06:52.539
Let's talk business.

00:06:53.818 --> 00:06:54.818
So?

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:56.979
When will you pay me?

00:06:57.418 --> 00:06:58.738
You're asking too much for it.

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.418
I can't afford it.

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:02.378
Stop kidding me.

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:03.618
Your family's supermarket

00:07:03.618 --> 00:07:04.818
must be raking it in.

00:07:04.818 --> 00:07:06.019
You don't have five million?

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.258
Who are you trying to fool?

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.139
That's the company's asset,

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.258
not mine.

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:15.779
Plus, the supermarket has huge costs
for purchasing and stockpiling goods.

00:07:16.058 --> 00:07:17.378
We don't make that much profit.

00:07:17.858 --> 00:07:18.779
I don't care.

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:20.178
Give me five million.

00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:21.459
Or I'm going to the police.

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.618
You heard that recording too.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:29.019
You egged my mom on
to deal with that woman.

00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:30.378
To be honest,

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:32.579
they're already growing suspicious.

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.938
If I hand over what I have...

00:07:43.618 --> 00:07:44.659
Ms. Miao.

00:07:45.938 --> 00:07:48.858
My mom isn't as smart or capable as you.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:51.418
She hasn't done
as well in life as you have.

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:54.178
But she's not a fool.

00:07:54.858 --> 00:07:56.858
She had to leave herself a way out.

00:07:58.699 --> 00:07:59.378
Right?

00:08:04.738 --> 00:08:06.579
Five million isn't much.

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:08.579
My mom's insurance is worth two million.

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:11.058
What's left in the old man's safe
is worth another two million.

00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:12.618
That's what my mom deserved.

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:14.058
Besides,

00:08:14.058 --> 00:08:16.058
she has served your family
for so many years.

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:18.178
You should at least
show some appreciation, right?

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:19.579
One extra million.

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:34.179
Ms. Miao.

00:08:36.018 --> 00:08:38.018
Even if you don't think about yourself,

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:41.419
think about Hua.

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:44.299
He's a civil servant.

00:08:56.258 --> 00:08:57.738
Your mom did work hard.

00:08:58.778 --> 00:09:01.498
I can give you the money,

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:07.699
but I don't have that much cash on hand.

00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:10.738
The case isn't closed yet.

00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:12.819
Getting money from the company account

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:14.858
will draw the police's attention.

00:09:16.219 --> 00:09:18.699
It may cause more trouble.

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:22.419
You're a smart guy.

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:25.219
You know what I'm saying, right?

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:28.738
Installments work, too.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.219
How much do you have right now?

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:33.219
Too little won't do.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:34.858
It has to be a reasonable amount.

00:09:34.858 --> 00:09:35.658
One million.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:39.459
Come pick it up from my place
at this time tomorrow.

00:09:49.819 --> 00:09:50.898
Miao Xiaolan has left.

00:09:51.819 --> 00:09:52.939
That fast?

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:54.738
Looks like they reached a deal.

00:09:57.819 --> 00:10:00.219
All units, maintain distance.

00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:05.299
If only we could
get approval for wiretapping.

00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:07.858
Otherwise, even if
we catch them on the spot,

00:10:08.538 --> 00:10:11.819
as long as Miao Xiaolan denies
being blackmailed by Geng Tianchou,

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.498
we can't pin her down in this case.

00:10:17.018 --> 00:10:20.819
So, what Geng Tianchou has
in his possession is crucial.

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:23.979
Then it's easy.

00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:26.018
Even if Geng Tianchou

00:10:26.618 --> 00:10:27.778
gets the money,

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:31.339
he most likely won't
hand over the proof as promised.

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:54.819
Why did Miao Xiaolan
tell him to meet her at home?

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:06.898
What a huge chandelier.

00:12:07.299 --> 00:12:08.819
So beautiful.

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:11.099
A big house is better.

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:13.618
This is great, Ms. Miao.

00:12:13.819 --> 00:12:15.138
I haven't been here for years.

00:12:15.138 --> 00:12:16.979
I'm so happy just to be here.

00:12:17.538 --> 00:12:18.819
Big houses are much cozier.

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:20.858
Our place is like a chicken coop.

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:23.498
Have a seat.

00:12:23.858 --> 00:12:26.339
Is the drink for me?

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:39.459
This card is in your name.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.299
Your mom opened the account.

00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:44.538
I've deposited one million.

00:12:45.858 --> 00:12:47.018
Here's the deposit slip.

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:48.738
It's all yours.

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:53.819
You got what you wanted.

00:12:54.939 --> 00:12:55.738
What about me?

00:12:58.179 --> 00:12:59.018
Ms. Miao.

00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:00.819
Don't worry.

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:04.258
I've kept that precious video very safe.

00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:07.939
Once I get all the money you owe me,

00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:11.258
I promise to give it to you right away.

00:13:25.099 --> 00:13:26.299
You don't get to visit often.

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:28.299
I should cook you a meal.

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:29.738
Too bad I can't cook.

00:13:30.579 --> 00:13:32.738
Let's just have a drink.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:34.858
Consider it my treat.

00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:37.459
I hope you don't mind.

00:13:37.459 --> 00:13:38.459
Come on, Ms. Miao.

00:13:38.498 --> 00:13:40.299
You're being too polite.

00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:50.018
I've never had this before.

00:13:52.219 --> 00:13:53.258
This is real.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:55.018
Cheers.

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:56.459
Thanks, Ms. Miao.

00:13:58.538 --> 00:13:59.179
Drink up.

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:10.904
What are you doing?

00:14:16.738 --> 00:14:17.339
You knew

00:14:18.219 --> 00:14:20.219
what happened between your mom,

00:14:20.939 --> 00:14:23.099
Zhao Junxin, and me from the start.

00:14:24.378 --> 00:14:26.258
Nonsense. I didn't know anything.

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:28.459
We are not as smart as you.

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.059
Many ideas actually came from you.

00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:32.059
Call an ambulance.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.419
You're lying! You...

00:14:37.658 --> 00:14:38.258
I...

00:14:58.699 --> 00:14:59.819
That old woman is crazy.

00:14:59.819 --> 00:15:01.138
Don't listen to her nonsense.

00:15:01.138 --> 00:15:02.299
She even tried to kill me.

00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:03.498
You saw it.

00:15:03.939 --> 00:15:05.459
Why did Miao Xiaolan want to kill you?

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:06.378
How should I know?

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:08.299
S-She's insane!

00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:09.858
Then why did you visit her?

00:15:10.258 --> 00:15:13.299
I-It was nothing important.

00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:15.099
S-She was my mom's classmate.

00:15:15.099 --> 00:15:16.898
I went to catch up, but she...

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:20.419
I'm the victim here.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:21.538
She's lying.

00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:23.219
What she did had nothing to do with me.

00:15:23.378 --> 00:15:24.858
You can't wrongfully accuse me.

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:26.018
Wrongfully accuse you?

00:15:26.898 --> 00:15:27.898
If you were irrelevant,

00:15:27.898 --> 00:15:29.419
why would Miao Xiaolan pay you?

00:15:30.219 --> 00:15:31.258
Tell the truth.

00:15:31.538 --> 00:15:34.059
You think we don't know
the role you played in this case?

00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:36.258
We're giving you
another chance, understand?

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:38.138
I swear I wasn't involved.

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:40.179
I saw the video my mom left for me. I...

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.219
Where's the video?

00:15:46.138 --> 00:15:46.939
What?

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:50.898
Planning to keep it
to blackmail Miao Xiaolan again?

00:15:52.538 --> 00:15:55.618
There was no such thing
as a million in that account.

00:15:56.299 --> 00:15:57.538
The deposit slip was fake.

00:15:57.939 --> 00:15:59.538
The balance was less than 20 yuan.

00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:02.778
The poison detected in that liquor

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:06.378
is the same kind that killed
Liao Guangyong and Song Ying.

00:16:08.138 --> 00:16:10.699
It was probably
from your mom Jiang Yuzhen, too.

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:13.459
That old woman tricked me.

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:18.419
Where's the video?

00:16:19.498 --> 00:16:22.419
There's a flash drive
behind the air conditioner

00:16:23.258 --> 00:16:24.138
in my bedroom.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:30.258
Tian.

00:16:31.618 --> 00:16:35.419
I've thought about
what we discussed earlier.

00:16:36.138 --> 00:16:37.419
Just like you said,

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:40.819
it's just a flick of the finger.

00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:42.459
Nothing too serious.

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:45.459
Your dad left us early.

00:16:46.858 --> 00:16:48.419
I've never been capable

00:16:49.018 --> 00:16:51.258
of giving you a better life.

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:57.538
I thought I'd save some money

00:16:58.699 --> 00:16:59.939
to buy a house.

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:02.459
Once you get married,

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:04.899
I could help care for your kids

00:17:05.139 --> 00:17:06.298
and your family.

00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:09.179
But now, it won't happen.

00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:14.419
What's more,

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:16.738
if I become a burden,

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:19.859
that'd be even worse.

00:17:22.899 --> 00:17:24.338
I can't hold you back.

00:17:27.578 --> 00:17:29.258
I'd rather seize this chance

00:17:31.659 --> 00:17:32.699
to end it all.

00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:37.219
If it works, I might even
leave you some money.

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.659
You know
where that insurance contract is kept.

00:17:44.498 --> 00:17:47.338
Take that contract to Ms. Miao.

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:51.459
I've already worked it out with her.

00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:53.419
She agreed

00:17:54.619 --> 00:17:56.219
to look after you.

00:18:01.939 --> 00:18:03.258
If this works,

00:18:04.778 --> 00:18:08.219
buy a house with that money.

00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:12.139
Girls will only consider marrying you
once you have a house.

00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:15.699
If it doesn't work...

00:18:21.738 --> 00:18:22.538
No.

00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:25.018
No matter how useless I am,

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:26.699
I'll make it work.

00:18:30.899 --> 00:18:34.098
The police will come then.

00:18:35.659 --> 00:18:37.058
No matter how they question you,

00:18:38.338 --> 00:18:40.139
you must insist that you knew nothing

00:18:40.338 --> 00:18:41.659
and it was all my doing.

00:18:42.379 --> 00:18:45.538
Also, if there's any issue
with the insurance company,

00:18:47.298 --> 00:18:48.659
find Ms. Miao.

00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:55.219
I poisoned
Mr. Liao and Ms. Song for her.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.018
Anyone can deny this,

00:19:00.298 --> 00:19:01.219
but she can't.

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:06.899
I'm recording this today

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:09.058
as evidence.

00:19:09.778 --> 00:19:11.459
Make sure you keep it safe.

00:19:21.338 --> 00:19:22.139
Tian,

00:19:25.578 --> 00:19:28.058
learn to take care of yourself.

00:19:30.298 --> 00:19:31.498
I won't be here.

00:19:34.219 --> 00:19:40.058
Don't overdo the cold stuff in summer.
Dress warmly in winter.

00:19:41.538 --> 00:19:42.899
Don't always

00:19:42.899 --> 00:19:44.659
eat fast food.

00:19:45.538 --> 00:19:48.659
Eat more fruits, veggies,
and drink plenty of water.

00:19:50.258 --> 00:19:52.058
Don't play on your phone too much.

00:19:52.298 --> 00:19:53.619
Go out more often.

00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:56.219
When you go out,

00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:58.699
stay safe.

00:20:00.738 --> 00:20:03.659
If you're well, I won't worry.

00:20:08.258 --> 00:20:10.139
I'm nagging again.

00:20:14.738 --> 00:20:15.538
I'll stop.

00:20:22.098 --> 00:20:23.058
I have to go.

00:20:35.459 --> 00:20:36.818
Geng Tianchou lied.

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:39.459
According to Jiang Yuzhen,

00:20:40.258 --> 00:20:42.859
he knew about their plan from the start.

00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:46.298
He might even have helped plan it,

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:48.659
as Miao Xiaolan said.

00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:51.778
Geng Tianchou is truly despicable.

00:20:51.778 --> 00:20:53.459
He knew his mother was going to...

00:20:58.859 --> 00:20:59.459
Hello?

00:21:01.258 --> 00:21:01.979
Okay.

00:21:03.379 --> 00:21:04.098
Captain Leng.

00:21:04.738 --> 00:21:06.058
Miao Xiaolan's been saved.

00:21:58.298 --> 00:21:59.098
Hua.

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:02.859
Mom.

00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:12.018
They told you everything?

00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:26.258
Dad wanted a divorce.

00:22:27.058 --> 00:22:28.419
Just divorce him.

00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:32.498
You two had been separated
for so long anyway.

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:34.859
Why suddenly...

00:22:35.498 --> 00:22:37.018
Song Ying was pregnant.

00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:40.258
He wanted to divorce me

00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:46.298
to leave the company and assets
to that child.

00:22:49.979 --> 00:22:53.018
So what?

00:22:53.578 --> 00:22:56.538
What would I do with the company?

00:22:57.699 --> 00:23:00.179
I have a job and a place to stay.

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:02.058
My salary and benefits are decent.

00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:05.738
Besides, I'm no good
at running a business.

00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:07.139
Nor am I interested.

00:23:07.338 --> 00:23:08.538
Mom, you know that.

00:23:08.538 --> 00:23:09.298
No.

00:23:10.058 --> 00:23:11.258
Absolutely not.

00:23:13.018 --> 00:23:17.058
He and I built this company
from the ground up.

00:23:17.058 --> 00:23:19.219
I can't let some outsiders take over.

00:23:19.738 --> 00:23:21.899
But he was my dad.

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:28.338
You don't understand.

00:23:30.379 --> 00:23:31.619
It's fine.

00:23:32.979 --> 00:23:34.899
I did all this for you.

00:23:36.298 --> 00:23:38.258
I did it all for you.

00:23:40.219 --> 00:23:43.018
Now no one can threaten you.

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:46.219
Everything will be yours.

00:23:49.058 --> 00:23:54.498
Even if I die now, I can rest in peace.

00:23:55.058 --> 00:23:57.139
I know about my mom's cancer.

00:23:57.818 --> 00:23:59.818
It really scared me at first.

00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:01.659
I wondered how much money it would cost.

00:24:01.778 --> 00:24:02.859
And she might not

00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:04.379
get cured no matter what.

00:24:05.018 --> 00:24:06.699
Wouldn't that money be wasted?

00:24:07.498 --> 00:24:09.659
With her meager salary and savings,

00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:12.219
we really can't afford it.

00:24:12.699 --> 00:24:15.459
As a grown man, why can't you get a job

00:24:15.459 --> 00:24:17.139
and get her proper treatment?

00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:19.018
Shameless.

00:24:19.939 --> 00:24:22.219
When did you find out
about Miao Xiaolan's plan?

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:30.179
Miao Xiaolan started plotting it
when she realized

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:31.538
that Song Ying was pregnant.

00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:33.538
She kept talking to my mom about it.

00:24:34.258 --> 00:24:37.139
Actually, my mom
told her about the pregnancy.

00:24:37.818 --> 00:24:40.018
My mom said insurance
doesn't pay out for suicide,

00:24:41.058 --> 00:24:42.859
so someone had to stage an accident.

00:24:42.859 --> 00:24:45.859
It just happened that Zhao Junxin

00:24:46.498 --> 00:24:48.899
had been planning
to kill Liao Guangyong for years.

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:50.939
Even creepier than Miao Xiaolan.

00:24:51.379 --> 00:24:53.298
Miao Xiaolan promised my mom money

00:24:53.498 --> 00:24:55.738
to poison her husband and his mistress.

00:24:55.818 --> 00:24:57.699
Miao Xiaolan got the poison.

00:24:58.979 --> 00:25:02.219
They even figured out what to do

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:03.619
if it failed in the end.

00:25:03.818 --> 00:25:05.338
It was Zhao Junxin's idea.

00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:06.859
Her idea was

00:25:07.538 --> 00:25:11.139
that it would be better
to kill Liao Guangyong in person.

00:25:11.939 --> 00:25:13.258
Don't just talk about others.

00:25:14.338 --> 00:25:16.258
You played a big part in this too.

00:25:16.459 --> 00:25:17.419
Confess.

00:25:17.778 --> 00:25:19.338
No, I didn't.

00:25:19.338 --> 00:25:21.818
Why won't you believe me?

00:25:22.258 --> 00:25:25.058
Could I come up
with something this complicated?

00:25:25.058 --> 00:25:27.219
It's just that when my mom
couldn't decide

00:25:27.219 --> 00:25:29.018
whether to go through with it or not,

00:25:29.018 --> 00:25:32.058
I-I gave her some advice.

00:25:32.939 --> 00:25:34.338
You pushed her to commit a crime

00:25:34.338 --> 00:25:35.298
and die?

00:25:35.298 --> 00:25:36.298
Why would I push her?

00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:37.538
She did it willingly.

00:25:37.699 --> 00:25:39.219
I just helped her weigh

00:25:39.219 --> 00:25:40.419
the pros and cons.

00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:42.939
I was afraid Miao Xiaolan
would back out of the deal.

00:25:42.939 --> 00:25:44.298
Wouldn't we lose out big time?

00:25:44.298 --> 00:25:45.379
And look what happened?

00:25:46.058 --> 00:25:47.859
She did back out, didn't she?

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:48.619
So I'm telling you,

00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:51.939
rich people are the worst.

00:25:51.939 --> 00:25:53.498
Isn't that terrifying?

00:25:53.498 --> 00:25:55.058
They had me totally fooled.

00:25:55.058 --> 00:25:56.578
I'm telling you, I'm an idiot.

00:25:56.578 --> 00:25:57.659
What kind of person is she?

00:25:57.659 --> 00:25:59.498
Appearing and disappearing like a ghost.

00:25:59.498 --> 00:26:01.899
What even is this?

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:06.979
I won't

00:26:08.459 --> 00:26:09.738
take over the company.

00:26:11.018 --> 00:26:12.139
And Mom,

00:26:13.659 --> 00:26:14.899
keep the money.

00:26:15.738 --> 00:26:16.659
I don't need it.

00:26:17.179 --> 00:26:20.298
What would I do with it?

00:26:21.459 --> 00:26:23.298
I did all this for you.

00:26:24.699 --> 00:26:25.659
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:26:27.379 --> 00:26:28.659
I really can't accept this.

00:26:30.139 --> 00:26:31.538
It was all for you.

00:26:32.578 --> 00:26:33.538
Hua.

00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:46.899
The doctor said

00:28:48.298 --> 00:28:50.058
metastasis is inevitable.

00:28:51.778 --> 00:28:53.578
I don't have long to live.

00:28:56.699 --> 00:28:58.179
If I die like this,

00:28:59.419 --> 00:29:00.939
what will happen to Tian?

00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:04.338
He can't do anything.

00:29:06.498 --> 00:29:09.058
He's never been away from me.

00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:16.179
I've worked my whole life for my son.

00:29:22.379 --> 00:29:24.058
Anyone who tries to take away

00:29:24.379 --> 00:29:25.939
what rightfully belongs to my son

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:28.419
will have to pay the price.

00:29:57.098 --> 00:29:57.859
What's wrong?

00:30:02.578 --> 00:30:05.018
Don't you always want me
to cook you a special meal?

00:30:06.498 --> 00:30:07.459
I'm in a good mood.

00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:09.659
Special meal?

00:30:10.379 --> 00:30:12.058
You coming or not? Barbecue.

00:30:13.379 --> 00:30:14.699
Barbecue.

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:21.379
What are you doing here?

00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:25.058
I'm cooking something for you.

00:30:25.058 --> 00:30:26.979
Little Qian is making you
a special treat.

00:30:26.979 --> 00:30:28.179
I don't know how to cook.

00:30:28.179 --> 00:30:30.258
So I'm making you some Tangyuan I love.

00:30:31.578 --> 00:30:32.538
I'll go grill.

00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:40.459
How many do you want?

00:30:42.139 --> 00:30:44.258
Five or six will do.

00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:46.018
Alright then.

00:31:08.298 --> 00:31:09.338
Come help me grill.

00:31:10.979 --> 00:31:11.619
Okay.

00:31:13.578 --> 00:31:14.619
Just add some seasoning.

00:31:30.338 --> 00:31:31.139
Little Qian.

00:31:32.298 --> 00:31:35.258
Does this look done yet?

00:31:38.379 --> 00:31:39.298
Where did he go?

00:31:47.018 --> 00:31:47.859
Where did you go?

00:31:48.018 --> 00:31:49.179
See if this is cooked.

00:31:51.058 --> 00:31:51.979
I got you a gift.

00:31:54.699 --> 00:31:55.258
Brand new.

00:31:56.058 --> 00:31:56.899
Happy birthday.

00:32:00.899 --> 00:32:01.939
Happy birthday.

00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:04.459
We know even if you didn't say anything.

00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:08.459
Thanks.

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:11.179
Really, thank you.

00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:13.098
I'll take it.

00:32:17.338 --> 00:32:19.699
- Hurry up. Blow the candles.
- Okay, move your hands.

00:32:19.699 --> 00:32:20.419
Move.

00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:22.379
Yeah.

00:32:22.818 --> 00:32:23.699
Happy birthday.

00:32:23.699 --> 00:32:24.899
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:26.699
Sing me the birthday song.

00:32:26.699 --> 00:32:27.538
Come on.

00:32:29.659 --> 00:32:31.538
In Chinese or English?

00:32:31.619 --> 00:32:33.659
Chinese first, then English. How's that?

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:34.258
Deal.

00:32:34.738 --> 00:32:38.578
♪Happy birthday to you♪

00:32:39.018 --> 00:32:42.699
♪Happy birthday to me♪

00:32:43.179 --> 00:32:45.899
♪Happy birthday to me♪

00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:47.258
Keep digging.

00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:13.379
Come on, step back.

00:33:13.379 --> 00:33:14.298
No pictures.

00:33:15.899 --> 00:33:17.098
Do not take pictures.

00:33:17.098 --> 00:33:17.939
Step back.

00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:19.899
Work with us, please.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.699
(Crime Scene Investigation)

00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:27.338
Stop.

00:33:35.619 --> 00:33:36.459
Ziwu.

00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:38.459
Lei, we found something.

00:33:56.498 --> 00:33:57.778
Alright. Get to work.

00:33:59.098 --> 00:34:00.459
Aren't they building a reservoir?

00:34:00.459 --> 00:34:03.818
According to the plan,
this whole area will be underwater.

00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:07.899
The village committee encouraged us
to relocate to the public cemetery

00:34:09.498 --> 00:34:10.538
and offered subsidies.

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:14.379
By family seniority,
we'd call the person buried here uncle.

00:34:14.658 --> 00:34:15.658
Uncle? Got it.

00:34:15.658 --> 00:34:17.819
His family lives quite far away.

00:34:18.538 --> 00:34:20.899
His children are all overseas.

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:22.859
So he asked us relatives for help.

00:34:23.538 --> 00:34:25.859
Who knew we'd dig up an unclaimed one?

00:34:26.618 --> 00:34:27.498
Officers.

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:31.098
This plot is an old burial ground
with history.

00:34:31.939 --> 00:34:35.339
Back in the day,
we just buried people directly here

00:34:35.698 --> 00:34:37.779
without cremation first.

00:34:37.939 --> 00:34:40.538
But this one doesn't even have a coffin.

00:34:40.698 --> 00:34:42.218
How can we face our ancestors?

00:34:42.498 --> 00:34:44.018
Aren't they afraid of karma?

00:34:44.218 --> 00:34:44.859
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:45.538
Exactly.

00:34:45.538 --> 00:34:46.178
How heartless.

00:34:46.178 --> 00:34:47.419
They ruined the feng shui.

00:34:48.138 --> 00:34:49.299
We rely on this

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:50.459
for prosperity.

00:34:50.459 --> 00:34:51.480
Our good fortune is gone.

00:34:54.098 --> 00:34:54.739
Here.

00:34:54.979 --> 00:34:56.578
The clothing shows pigment fading.

00:34:56.578 --> 00:34:58.018
It tears easily with slight force.

00:35:00.379 --> 00:35:03.819
The corpse is completely skeletonized.
Bones appear pale brownish-yellow.

00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:07.018
Oily residue on bone surfaces
is completely gone.

00:35:07.578 --> 00:35:10.779
The estimated burial time
was two to four years ago.

00:35:13.459 --> 00:35:14.939
Victim height is 1.7 meters.

00:35:15.178 --> 00:35:15.979
Male.

00:35:23.138 --> 00:35:25.739
I can't determine
the cause of the wound yet.

00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:27.459
Any wounds?

00:35:27.459 --> 00:35:28.058
Jiao.

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:28.739
Coming.

00:35:32.578 --> 00:35:33.138
Okay.

00:35:33.538 --> 00:35:36.058
But I don't think it was an accident.

00:35:38.339 --> 00:35:39.339
It should be homicide.

00:35:41.979 --> 00:35:42.779
Lei.

00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:44.538
It's Teresa Teng.

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:46.058
Your and Captain Leng's favorite.

00:35:47.218 --> 00:35:47.739
Really?

00:35:47.939 --> 00:35:48.779
Let me see.

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:49.339
Come on.

00:35:49.339 --> 00:35:50.058
Take a look.

00:35:52.658 --> 00:35:54.259
I actually have this one.

00:35:55.218 --> 00:35:59.178
This must be
about three or four years ago.

00:35:59.859 --> 00:36:01.098
Who buys discs anymore?

00:36:01.098 --> 00:36:02.739
Everything's digital now.

00:36:04.058 --> 00:36:05.339
Let me tell you something.

00:36:05.698 --> 00:36:08.058
This is the deluxe commemorative edition

00:36:08.058 --> 00:36:09.259
with limited release.

00:36:09.939 --> 00:36:11.379
If this is a genuine copy,

00:36:11.779 --> 00:36:13.259
it would fetch a price

00:36:13.259 --> 00:36:14.899
on the secondhand market.

00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:15.939
Here.

00:36:22.178 --> 00:36:23.498
Multi-layered cloth shoes.

00:36:24.939 --> 00:36:27.098
This type of shoe
shows distinct wear patterns.

00:36:27.459 --> 00:36:29.299
The wear on the right shoe

00:36:32.018 --> 00:36:33.859
is much greater than that on the left.

00:36:34.299 --> 00:36:37.018
They're both concentrated
on the forefoot area.

00:36:37.018 --> 00:36:40.498
The victim's forefoot
frequently made contact with something.

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:43.098
I've seen this type
of sole pattern before.

00:36:43.098 --> 00:36:46.138
That person was a driver
operating a manual truck.

00:36:46.419 --> 00:36:48.498
Based on the wear of these shoes,

00:36:48.498 --> 00:36:52.259
the victim very likely
drove a manual car.

00:36:53.098 --> 00:36:57.538
The shoes and the clothes we dug up
are quite cheap.

00:36:57.899 --> 00:36:59.058
The quality isn't great.

00:36:59.379 --> 00:37:01.379
If he were a driver,

00:37:01.859 --> 00:37:08.259
he would probably be driving
something like a ride-share or taxi.

00:38:16.504 --> 00:38:20.339
(No-Name Diner)

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:21.138
Come on.

00:38:23.018 --> 00:38:25.218
Miao Xiaolan and Geng Tianchou
have both confessed.

00:38:25.578 --> 00:38:26.859
So this case is closed, right?

00:38:29.259 --> 00:38:29.979
Want some more?

00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:31.578
I'm good.

00:38:32.459 --> 00:38:35.339
And I heard Miao Xiaolan's son
plans to sell the company

00:38:35.498 --> 00:38:37.098
and donate the money. Is that true?

00:38:37.538 --> 00:38:38.178
Yeah.

00:38:40.259 --> 00:38:41.939
It was Miao Xiaolan's wishful thinking

00:38:42.658 --> 00:38:44.859
for her son to inherit the company.

00:38:46.459 --> 00:38:49.379
If she had respected her son's wishes,

00:38:50.299 --> 00:38:51.819
they wouldn't be like this.

00:38:53.018 --> 00:38:54.459
It was all just an obsession.

00:38:55.658 --> 00:38:56.739
Anyway,

00:38:57.299 --> 00:38:58.739
the case is finally closed.

00:39:04.379 --> 00:39:05.779
How's Ziwu doing?

00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:06.939
Oh, right.

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:09.299
Is Zhang Ziwu
still working overtime today?

00:39:10.459 --> 00:39:11.138
Yeah.

00:39:13.058 --> 00:39:15.578
Which one of you
will go back to the station?

00:39:15.578 --> 00:39:16.819
I'll pack her some food.

00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:18.779
I will.

00:39:25.779 --> 00:39:26.939
Lei, you got customers.

00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:33.419
Just got off work?

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.018
Come on, hurry up.

00:39:35.098 --> 00:39:35.739
Hungry?

00:39:35.739 --> 00:39:37.538
Lei, working the night shift again?

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:38.779
Yeah.

00:40:33.779 --> 00:40:34.339
Come on.

00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:36.779
Have some food.

00:40:37.979 --> 00:40:39.339
You brought this for me?

00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:40.779
Yeah.

00:40:42.098 --> 00:40:43.098
Eat it while it's hot.

00:40:44.098 --> 00:40:45.459
You know what? I could eat.

00:40:51.018 --> 00:40:54.098
How's that skull reconstruction
coming along?

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.218
I knew it.

00:41:02.578 --> 00:41:05.379
There's no way you'd be this nice
just to bring me food.

00:41:06.218 --> 00:41:08.339
Even the hardest-working person
has to eat.

00:41:11.178 --> 00:41:12.018
Almost done.

00:41:12.698 --> 00:41:13.339
Okay.

00:41:14.178 --> 00:41:16.498
If you're almost done, head back early.

00:41:19.098 --> 00:41:20.299
Need a ride?

00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:24.299
Alright, eat up.

00:41:31.299 --> 00:41:32.339
Our investigation shows

00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:36.098
that most taxis and ride-shares
have switched

00:41:36.339 --> 00:41:38.138
to automatic transmissions
in recent years.

00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:40.138
Considering the victim's time of death,

00:41:41.178 --> 00:41:43.498
we contacted
the traffic management authorities

00:41:43.739 --> 00:41:47.819
for the list of drivers who were still
driving manual cars three years ago.

00:41:48.018 --> 00:41:49.178
Through facial comparison,

00:41:49.618 --> 00:41:53.218
the victim looks very much like
someone named Ding Youcai.

00:41:54.058 --> 00:41:54.859
Ding Youcai,

00:41:55.178 --> 00:41:57.259
a native of Dingjia Village,
Tuba Township, Beicheng.

00:41:57.419 --> 00:42:00.018
He was previously an employee
of Longxiang Taxi Company

00:42:00.018 --> 00:42:01.058
and quit three years ago.

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:03.339
The number and address he left
are no longer valid.

00:42:03.939 --> 00:42:06.979
The remains were found in Tuba Township?

00:42:07.779 --> 00:42:09.339
It's about three kilometers away.

00:42:09.339 --> 00:42:10.899
But it's a different village.

00:42:11.259 --> 00:42:13.018
Any relatives or friends?

00:42:14.459 --> 00:42:15.979
His parents passed away long ago.

00:42:16.618 --> 00:42:17.779
He had no other relatives.

00:42:18.259 --> 00:42:20.419
Not many close acquaintances
at the company either.

00:42:20.419 --> 00:42:21.618
We're still investigating.

00:42:21.618 --> 00:42:22.939
Has the COD been determined?
