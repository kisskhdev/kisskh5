=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.200
=Episode 16=

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200
I've been waiting.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.041
Finally, I caught you today.

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:17.920
I'm in a hurry.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.801
You poisoned my dog.

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:21.000
What's going on, Liu?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.840
No idea.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.721
Something about that lady's dog.

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.041
Not sure why it's related
to the delivery guy.

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:26.721
I grabbed you.

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:27.560
Why the fuss?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.681
You're not making any sense.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.521
You two, back to work.
I'll check it out.

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:31.961
Got it.

00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:33.360
You poisoned my dog.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.601
Of course, I have to grab you.

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:35.280
Wait...

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.161
You're lying!

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:38.521
I'm swamped with deliveries.

00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.161
No time to poison your dog.

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.041
Besides, I don't even see your dog.

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:43.041
Stop pretending!

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.560
You kicked my dog before.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.400
Right here.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.881
I...

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:47.681
Don't think I forgot it.

00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:48.961
You're just lying!

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.480
Let me go!

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.241
I'm not letting go!

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.801
You also tossed sausages
in the flowerbeds.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.081
I saw it

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.241
with my own eyes.

00:01:57.241 --> 00:01:57.760
I...

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.441
- I...
- And he hit me.

00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:00.721
- It wasn't me!
- You...

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.120
What...

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.041
Let go!

00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:03.400
Let me go!

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:07.881
You're so mean!

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:08.480
Hold on.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.841
He poisoned my dog!

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:11.680
You get up first.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.480
- Let go!
- You get up first.

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.561
Grab him! He poisoned my dog!

00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:16.360
Mr. Cao?

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:17.920
- Poisoner!
- You...

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.920
We investigated
Zhao Junxin's connections.

00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.281
She'd worked
for this housekeeping company for years,

00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.441
with great reviews.

00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:30.841
She was at the hospital that day,

00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.441
covering a shift for a colleague.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.401
By the way,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.001
the fruit knife she used

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.640
was borrowed from a patient's family.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.800
How did Zhao Junxin learn

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.441
about Liao Guangyong
being at Central Hospital?

00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:49.121
She didn't explain.

00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:52.920
But Liao Guangyong's name
was on the hospital screen,

00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:55.240
visible to everyone passing by.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:56.520
It doesn't prove anything.

00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:03.321
So Zhao Junxin's attack was on impulse?

00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:06.760
That's what evidence suggests.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:10.360
Any other questions?

00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:14.401
This Zhao Junxin...

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.200
Hard to say.

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:21.841
I feel she's hiding something.

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:25.041
Any progress on the poisoning case?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.121
We still can't rule out the possibility
Song Ying committed suicide with poison.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.401
If Song Ying didn't do it...

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.441
Then it's Jiang Yuzhen.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.121
What's her story?

00:03:53.121 --> 00:03:53.960
She doesn't talk.

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:55.721
I heard she's in for murder.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.161
Exactly.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:59.841
I heard two died on the spot.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.321
Two?

00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.200
How horrifying.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.881
Keep it down.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.640
Mr. Cao, sorry

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.960
to cause you trouble.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.960
No problem.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.680
Resolving disputes is part of our duty.

00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:21.721
And you just wanted to help.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.800
Honestly, I assumed
it was really the delivery guy's doing.

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:27.641
Well,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.560
without this commotion today,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.320
we wouldn't have caught the poisoner.

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:33.360
What a wild coincidence.

00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.841
That delivery guy happened
to witness the poisoning.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.041
We retrieved the footage as he said.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.841
It caught him.

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:41.920
Well, I wonder

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.240
what that guy was thinking.

00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:47.560
He bought poison online
to kill dogs after job-hunting fails.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.880
I really don't get it.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.641
Sir, caught the suspect.

00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:54.120
Take him in. I'll be there.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.761
Yes.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.680
This is the poisoner.

00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:04.800
Him?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.560
Jing.

00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:09.120
Then I won't see you out.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.120
Please go ahead.

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:33.800
(Mom, I've applied for a transfer.)

00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:36.761
(It'll be approved soon.)

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.401
(Then I can spend more time with you)

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:40.472
(and eat your cooking.)

00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:48.000
Based on my examination, I can confirm

00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:50.000
the poison found at Jiang Yuzhen's house

00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:52.880
is the same as the one at the scene
and in the victim's body.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.081
Even the impurities mixed
in the chemicals are identical.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.281
That proves they are from
the same manufacturer and batch.

00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:03.521
Only Jiang Yuzhen's fingerprints were
found on both the poison's packaging

00:06:03.521 --> 00:06:05.721
and the inner side
of the suspended ceiling panel.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.240
Additionally, on the key to that safe,

00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:11.641
Jiang Yuzhen's fingerprints
were also detected.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.120
This old lady not only stole things,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.841
but also poisoned people?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.601
I never would've guessed.

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:24.000
Fingerprints alone can only prove
Jiang Yuzhen touched this key.

00:06:24.641 --> 00:06:25.841
Any other evidence?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.641
Well, we...

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.680
Play the video, Lei.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680
Let's watch the video.

00:06:32.521 --> 00:06:33.720
Based on your understanding,

00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:36.401
does Song Ying
seem like the type to commit suicide?

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:38.800
I can't say for sure.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.641
Wait.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.081
Rewind a bit.

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:03.641
Look at her bag.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.480
This is a bank giveaway, right?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.401
I seem to have an identical one.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.401
It's made of canvas,

00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:11.401
quite roomy.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.641
The bag looked different
when she entered and when she left.

00:07:17.761 --> 00:07:18.961
Indeed.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.800
It's not obvious at first glance.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.401
Look at her movements.

00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:25.320
When she entered,
she was carrying groceries.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.800
She carried the bag
on one shoulder with ease.

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:29.761
But when she left,

00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:31.641
her shoulders and movements

00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:32.841
were tense.

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:35.041
The bag had clearly gotten heavier.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.920
Well,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.000
her movements do seem a bit different.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.920
But could it be because of nervousness?

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.240
After all, she just found
a dead body in the house.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.440
She must have put something in it.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.840
We knew that they kept
some cash at home,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.320
like a hundred thousand US dollars
and a hundred thousand RMB.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
She must put that in.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.000
And the watches and diamond rings,

00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:58.041
those are quite heavy.

00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:01.240
This old lady is bold!

00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:06.120
She basically moved the stolen goods
right under your nose.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.841
If Jiang Yuzhen is the one
who poisoned him,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.281
what's the motive?

00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:13.480
Just for the money?

00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:16.641
Jiang Yuzhen's family isn't well off.

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.920
I think the motive of theft
is plausible.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.680
Her son doesn't seem
like a good guy either.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.841
He might be involved too.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:30.961
I can't run anymore.

00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:34.080
Little Qian.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.041
No more running.

00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:37.361
Buy some water.

00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:39.881
No more running.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.281
I won't run anymore.

00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:42.680
What?

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:46.200
Two bottles of water.
Room-temperature. Thanks.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:46.881
Okay.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.881
Here you go.

00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:53.960
Thank you.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.560
Take care.

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:05.281
I had a meal
with Little Zhao the other day.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.560
I had a meal
with Little Zhao the other day.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.840
She was crying so hard.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.361
She was pouring that sake

00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:17.800
into her mouth like crazy.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.960
After that, she dragged me to karaoke

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.960
and sang for two hours.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.361
What a torture.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.761
You two have been friends
for so many years.

00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:26.761
Can't you comfort her?

00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:34.840
Because we've been friends for long,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.521
I have no choice.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.161
The sooner she gives up on me,
the better it is for her.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.041
I know what you mean.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.361
But she is a girl.

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:48.200
It's really hard to see her
like that, you know?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.041
You like her
and want to pursue her, right?

00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:51.361
I have no choice.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.560
Neither do you?

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.001
What are you talking about?

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.401
Do you expect me
to take advantage of this?

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:02.200
Alright, put that aside.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.401
How are you and your crush?

00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:04.361
How far have you gotten?

00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:06.641
When will you let me meet her?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.161
I won't run. I'll wait for you here.

00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:19.761
Sir.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.200
I used all my connections to ask around.

00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:24.960
Turn out that Lin from Provincial

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.960
really is related to Ye Qian.

00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:32.200
With Huo's crew trying
to involve someone like that,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.401
they've planned
to exploit police connections.

00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:39.161
But from their conversation,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.560
I feel they actually don't know

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.680
Ye Qian has this kind of connection.

00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:45.840
Well...

00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:53.001
Do you think someone like him
involving in willingly

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.761
could be a setup or a trap?

00:10:58.041 --> 00:10:59.720
Ye Qian might be an undercover cop?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.281
We should test him.

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:11.600
If he is,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.161
we cut all ties with Huo.

00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:17.161
If he isn't,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.041
then those guys have something
that valuable...

00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:24.161
What a pity!

00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:27.560
I'll arrange it.

00:11:31.401 --> 00:11:32.121
That's great.

(Yunxi Central Hospital)

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.161
She's a regular customer here.

00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:28.440
Works as a nursing aide
at a hospital, I think.

00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:31.361
Does she come often?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.800
Every few days.

00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:35.161
Usually around this hour.

00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:36.800
Because we have discounts now.

00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:38.521
What flowers does she buy?

00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:41.080
Like sunflowers,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.241
carnations, lilies, roses...

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.080
Probably has kids at home.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.281
Why?

00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:48.800
I can tell you don't buy flowers often.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.840
The flowers I mentioned

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.960
are more suitable for children.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.960
Blessings for kids.

00:13:54.361 --> 00:13:56.800
Did she come the night before last?

00:13:57.001 --> 00:13:58.041
The night before last?

00:13:58.761 --> 00:13:59.600
Yes, she did.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.720
And she bought flowers.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.281
But she didn't buy the discounted ones.

00:14:02.481 --> 00:14:04.241
She asked for premium packaging.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.881
Discounted flowers
just get wrapped in newspaper.

00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:08.720
Premium packaging costs extra.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.241
Do you know where she went

00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:12.041
after that?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.641
I really don't know.

00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:17.200
I think she took a taxi.

00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:19.440
Thank you.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.241
No problem.

00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:41.840
It's me.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.024
Get a surveillance footage.

The flower shop's.

00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:48.761
Had dinner yet?

00:14:49.161 --> 00:14:50.361
Ordered takeout again?

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.320
I ate.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.800
It's good. We've got
braised pork chops here.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.560
But not as good as yours.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.361
Cut back on that greasy food.

00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:06.560
By the way, Mr. Cao called today.

00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:08.560
About the little puppy.

00:15:09.281 --> 00:15:12.161
That young guy confessed.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.840
Several families are going
to sue him for damages.

00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.720
Mr. Cao asked if we want to join them.

00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:21.200
What do you think?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.361
It's up to you.

00:15:24.761 --> 00:15:27.241
Mr. Cao said that guy's from
a single-parent home,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.960
not having a well-off family.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.200
He finally got into university,

00:15:31.481 --> 00:15:33.161
but couldn't find a job
after graduation.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.161
Seems like he's had it rough.

00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:38.560
Maybe we should just let him off?

00:15:39.128 --> 00:15:40.664
He was born in the Year of the Dragon,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.560
same age as our Hui.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.320
Okay. Whatever you say.

00:15:45.481 --> 00:15:46.001
I'll get...

00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:47.241
I have to go. Bye then.

00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:21.161
Sorry.

About the poison you mention,

00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:37.160
I know nothing about it.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.080
My mom is the victim.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.080
The way you're acting

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.001
is like we're the criminals.

Why not consider it?

No, can't afford it.

You think my mom is a thief?

00:18:33.281 --> 00:18:34.721
You are slandering her.

have you seen that canvas bag

Zhao Junxin, talk.

00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:47.241
That night, you went to the intersection
of Xing'an Road and Longshan Avenue.

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:50.761
The site of that traffic accident
eight years ago, right?

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.721
You brought a very expensive bouquet
when you went.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.160
Sunflowers.

00:19:56.921 --> 00:19:59.761
And unusually, you asked
the florist for premium packaging,

00:20:00.201 --> 00:20:01.600
and even took a taxi.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.001
After you got there,

00:20:04.001 --> 00:20:06.521
you stayed for about half an hour
before leaving by taxi.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.600
The driver remembers you quite clearly.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.441
Partly because you had him
run the meter while waiting,

00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:14.400
which cost you a lot.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.241
And partly

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.840
because you were quite emotional
on the way back.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.600
The driver even offered you tissues.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.560
You often buy flowers,

00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:30.456
but that was your first time
going to the accident site

00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:33.400
since your divorce, correct?

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.560
We spoke to the colleague
you swapped shifts with.

00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:41.201
According to her,

00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:43.281
she did have a family situation
at the time,

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.201
but she didn't require
an immediate shift swap.

00:20:47.521 --> 00:20:50.840
You volunteered to take her shift.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.080
Additionally, that day you were caring
for a patient in the inpatient ward.

00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:58.320
You didn't pass through the lobby
with the electronic screen.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.400
And no one in the inpatient ward area

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.840
knew Liao Guangyong
was brought in for emergency treatment.

00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:09.160
So did you really kill
Liao Guangyong on impulse?

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.640
Do you have children?

00:21:24.921 --> 00:21:25.560
Hello.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.080
Master.

00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:29.160
Confirmed with the insurance company.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.441
Jiang Yuzhen has a major
accidental death policy in her name.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.600
The policyholder and insured
are Jiang Yuzhen.

00:21:35.721 --> 00:21:37.320
The beneficiary is Geng Tianchou.

00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:39.481
Once the insured passes away,

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.120
the beneficiary gets the principal
plus two million in payout.

00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:45.921
Also, per the insurer's records,

00:21:46.521 --> 00:21:50.320
Geng Tianchou called
the claims hotline that very afternoon.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.201
That was shortly after the crime.

00:21:52.761 --> 00:21:54.400
No news leaked the information yet.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.640
Even before we contacted Geng Tianchou.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.800
So he knew Jiang Yuzhen
would meet her end that day.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.521
Jiang Yuzhen bought this policy
four months ago.

00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.320
The insurer just discovered

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:11.400
that before taking out the policy,

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.360
Jiang Yuzhen had a comprehensive checkup
at a top-tier hospital elsewhere.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.800
The checkup proved Jiang Yuzhen
had late-stage small cell lung cancer,

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.961
and started metastasizing to her brain.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.952
The insurance company refuses to pay,
citing Jiang Yuzhen

00:22:25.336 --> 00:22:28.320
concealed pre-existing conditions
and suspected suicide insurance fraud.

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:30.080
Master.

00:22:32.001 --> 00:22:33.560
I have a wild idea.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.120
Go on.

00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:40.761
Jiang Yuzhen and Zhao Junxin
were likely in cahoots.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.921
Buddy,

00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:01.160
just pour it in.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.441
Here.

00:23:16.921 --> 00:23:17.800
Enjoy.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.840
I do.

00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:07.921
Who are you?

00:24:08.201 --> 00:24:09.481
I'm looking for Han Zhao.

00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:11.160
Alright, I'll call her.

00:24:18.241 --> 00:24:19.521
What took you so long?

00:24:19.961 --> 00:24:21.521
I figured you hadn't eaten,

00:24:21.521 --> 00:24:23.241
so I grabbed you some food on the way.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.080
Who needs food? We're drinking.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.160
Come on, get in here!

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.400
You're having a party?

00:24:29.521 --> 00:24:30.640
I don't know your friends.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.880
I'll give you the food and leave.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:33.921
You chicken out?

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.360
Whatever.

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:36.880
What should we play?

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.721
I'm coming.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.600
Zhao, come play!

00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:46.521
Bottoms up!

00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:47.080
Okay.

00:24:47.576 --> 00:24:48.241
Go find a ma'am.

00:24:48.241 --> 00:24:49.961
I told you I could hold my liquor.

00:24:49.961 --> 00:24:50.600
Come on.

00:24:50.921 --> 00:24:52.201
It's rare we gather together...

00:24:52.721 --> 00:24:54.320
I'm not interested in you.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.761
We really can't hang out together.

00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:56.800
Let's open another bottle.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.961
We can hang out.

00:24:58.961 --> 00:24:59.400
Or...

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.560
I can't anymore.

00:25:03.128 --> 00:25:04.768
(Little Zhaozhao
is throwing a party at home.)

00:25:04.768 --> 00:25:05.521
(Come check.)

00:25:05.521 --> 00:25:06.400
Cheers!

00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:08.961
Hurry!

00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:10.560
What a rare gathering!

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.961
Come on, photographer!

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.041
Here, drink.

00:25:14.281 --> 00:25:15.001
Drink.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.681
You two look good.

00:25:17.201 --> 00:25:17.840
(I'm at work. You guys have fun.)
Come on, bottoms up!

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.481
Bottoms up!

00:25:18.521 --> 00:25:19.961
Finish it!

00:25:21.368 --> 00:25:23.098
(She's quite down. She drank a lot.)

00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:25.681
(Why don't you come over,
or give her a call to talk her down?)

00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:26.400
Okay?

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.640
Everyone, cheers!

00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:45.208
(She knows her limits.
Letting it out is good for her.)

00:25:50.521 --> 00:25:51.600
Zhao, where are you going?

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.640
Hold on a sec.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.281
Got it.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.640
Bored?

00:25:56.241 --> 00:25:57.041
No.

00:25:57.721 --> 00:25:58.961
Then why play on your phone?

00:26:00.001 --> 00:26:01.001
Just browsing.

00:26:02.441 --> 00:26:03.241
What's this?

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.241
Brought you a gift.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.080
A game console.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.600
Quite expensive.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.041
Worth almost a month's salary.

00:26:11.921 --> 00:26:12.961
Come on, let's dance.

00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:14.080
No way.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.201
I'm all left feet.

00:26:16.201 --> 00:26:16.961
Your friends here.

00:26:16.961 --> 00:26:17.961
I'd embarrass you.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.521
You're my friend too.

00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:20.281
Come on.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.400
No.

00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:23.360
Drink less. It's bad for you.

00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:26.241
Then entertain yourself.

00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:26.880
Go have fun.

00:26:27.241 --> 00:26:28.041
How lame.

00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:29.800
I'm coming!

00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:40.560
Cheers!

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.560
Another one!

00:27:13.656 --> 00:27:16.636
(Han Zhao: Transfer)

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.560
Thanks.

00:27:34.761 --> 00:27:36.521
Stop looking. They didn't come.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.721
Have you thought about
what I said last time?

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.681
Do you want my help?

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.921
Want to go to Huashan in a few days?

00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:52.600
What for?

00:27:53.241 --> 00:27:54.400
Just hanging out.

00:27:56.001 --> 00:27:56.840
Just the two of us?

00:27:58.001 --> 00:27:59.721
What? Scared?

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.761
Just the two of us is fine.

00:28:03.521 --> 00:28:05.048
If you're not scared, why would I be?

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.961
Why want to go there?

00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:09.560
Why so many questions?

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.521
I'll call you when I pick a day.

00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:12.041
Here.

00:28:17.241 --> 00:28:18.400
We're partners now.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.481
Won't accept my kindness?

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.320
Nothing else in it today.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.400
I'm allergic to alcohol.

00:28:30.201 --> 00:28:30.921
Did you forget?

00:28:33.201 --> 00:28:34.921
He has an accelerated alcohol allergy.

00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:37.160
It caused laryngeal edema
and breathing difficulties.

00:28:37.201 --> 00:28:39.201
It could even be life-threatening.

00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:43.360
Luckily, he was brought in time.
No major issues.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:45.840
How lame.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.481
Call a designated driver.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.481
Let's go. No rush.

00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:56.080
Be careful. Don't trip here.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.560
Drunk?

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.761
Not at all.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.041
You're drunk.

00:28:59.041 --> 00:28:59.800
Let's go.

00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:00.800
You had so much.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.560
Careful.

00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:03.080
Thank you.

00:29:03.281 --> 00:29:05.001
Bye! Text me when you get home.

00:29:05.001 --> 00:29:06.521
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.521
Go home now.

00:29:07.521 --> 00:29:09.120
- I'll take her home. Don't worry.
- Okay.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.921
Bye.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.640
Bye.

00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:29.080
Why are you still here?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.600
I thought you went home.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.521
No.

00:29:32.441 --> 00:29:33.281
Are you hungry?

00:29:33.281 --> 00:29:34.560
Come to my place for a bite.

00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:35.681
No need.

00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:38.400
I wanted to chat with you.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.001
You had lots of friends around,

00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:41.241
so I waited for you here.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.241
What's there to chat?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.160
Aren't we friends?

00:29:51.201 --> 00:29:53.360
Transferring the money back
feels distant.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.241
Besides,

00:29:54.241 --> 00:29:55.840
you drink whenever you're down.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.721
That's bad for you.

00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:59.961
You can try to play some games instead.

00:30:00.241 --> 00:30:02.640
It'll soothe you.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.600
Or just imagine that guy is Little Qian.

00:30:04.721 --> 00:30:05.640
Vent it out.

00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:10.120
Thank you.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.481
I mean it.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.441
But I'm telling you for the last time,

00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:17.160
it won't work.

00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:18.800
Sorry.

00:31:07.201 --> 00:31:08.160
You're back.

00:31:21.001 --> 00:31:22.360
She finally came back.

00:31:25.001 --> 00:31:27.201
Don't end up getting yourself trapped.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.600
I know what I am doing.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.160
People have feelings.

00:31:34.521 --> 00:31:36.320
And no one can play with feelings.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800
Do you know it?

00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:41.320
What's wrong with you today?

00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:43.800
You should ask
what's been wrong with you all along.

00:31:54.441 --> 00:31:55.441
What do you mean?

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:56.961
Qing.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.400
Don't you see how jealous Huo is?

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.761
Even I can tell.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.761
Fate really plays tricks on people.

00:32:24.721 --> 00:32:27.961
(Yunxi Zhenjiu Wine)
We've avoided each other for years.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.600
Never expected

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.800
we'd still meet.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.160
Ye Qian.

00:32:48.761 --> 00:32:52.001
I know you...

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.640
Remember.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.640
We owe

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.521
nothing to each other.

00:33:22.921 --> 00:33:23.721
Sorry.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.120
Then I'm sorry too.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.001
How lame.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.320
Do you remember when we were kids?

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.241
I said

00:33:49.721 --> 00:33:55.400
if you ever broke your word,

00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:58.400
I'd never talk to you.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.521
But

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.281
today it suddenly hit me.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.200

Master.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.321
I checked Zhao Junxin's phone.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.240
On the night
of the Fuquan Community case,

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.361
she received this promotional text
from this number started with 150.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.841
At first glance, the text
was about selling property.

00:36:30.361 --> 00:36:32.001
"Fully renovated duplex apartments."

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.881
"No purchase limits.
Mortgages available."

00:36:33.881 --> 00:36:36.720
"Contact number: 171..."

00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:38.841
Hold on, what's suspicious about that?

00:36:40.041 --> 00:36:41.881
I called this number.

00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:42.560
Void.

00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:47.080
Could they have just made a mistake

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.640
when typing the number?

00:36:48.801 --> 00:36:51.961
These ads are usually
bulk-sent by software nowadays.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.640
I also tried calling

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.881
the sender number.

00:36:54.881 --> 00:36:55.720
It's switched off.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.481
I checked.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.361
It's an unregistered number.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.841
This number sent Zhao Junxin
multiple texts before.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.720
The first was four months ago.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.240
Then, at regular intervals,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.160
it sent her different ad texts.

00:37:09.521 --> 00:37:11.560
About selling houses, selling cars,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.120
fake receipts, and so on.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.521
But they all listed
this same 171 number.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.921
We haven't found
Jiang Yuzhen's phone yet,

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.001
but checking her call records

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:25.401
showed this 150 number
also texted her multiple times.

00:37:28.361 --> 00:37:29.361
You think

00:37:29.441 --> 00:37:35.560
this is how Jiang Yuzhen
and Zhao Junxin communicated?

00:37:36.041 --> 00:37:36.680
Yes.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.481
Could it just be coincidence?

00:37:40.001 --> 00:37:41.280
I think that's impossible.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.200
Assuming they were connected,

00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:50.600
Zhao Junxin didn't have the opportunity
to poison Liao Guangyong and Song Ying.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.080
Jiang Yuzhen had motive
for insurance fraud.

00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:56.080
Suicide voids the insurance payout.

00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:58.001
To get the high payout,

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.720
she needed an accident.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.521
You think it was a murder swap?

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.321
Like in Strangers on a Train?

00:38:08.921 --> 00:38:10.841
You watched Hitchcock's movies?

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.560
Looking down on me now?

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:17.720
I've watched Hitchcock's and Conan's.

00:38:19.521 --> 00:38:22.841
If your theory holds,

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.041
finding concrete proof
of their communication

00:38:27.521 --> 00:38:30.080
and collusion will be tough.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.441
Conquer them one by one.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.080
If they did it, there will be flaws.

00:38:36.321 --> 00:38:38.071
I've already asked Lei to track

00:38:38.071 --> 00:38:40.001
Geng Tianchou's movements
after the crime.

00:38:40.441 --> 00:38:43.720
Whether Geng Tianchou knows
their connection or not, he must know

00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:45.240
where the stolen goods are.

00:38:48.441 --> 00:38:51.441
You acted first and reported later.

00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:55.881
Don't alert the suspect!

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.160
Don't worry.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.481
Hello, sir.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:07.401
Hello.

00:39:07.401 --> 00:39:09.080
We're from the Yunxi Police Department.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.361
Here are our badges.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.881
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:14.280
Okay.

00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:18.240
Do you recognize
the person in this photo?

00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:22.080
This one seems familiar.
I gave him a ride.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.921
Right.

00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:24.321
When did that happen?

00:39:24.321 --> 00:39:25.240
Let me think.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.481
Three days ago.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.961
Morning, evening, or afternoon?

00:39:28.961 --> 00:39:29.841
Five in the afternoon.

00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:31.680
Took him to Wanda Plaza.

00:39:31.801 --> 00:39:32.921
Yes, Wanda Plaza.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.321
Remember what this person said to you?

00:39:45.841 --> 00:39:48.200
He asked me some questions
about deposits,

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.168
but he didn't conduct
any specific transactions.

00:39:50.881 --> 00:39:51.320
Why?

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.856
Per the new regulations from the bank,

00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:55.161
for cash transactions over 50,000 yuan
at the counter,

00:39:55.161 --> 00:39:56.921
the source and purpose must be reported.

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:59.600
He seemed to not quite understand
this regulation.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.321
He also asked about
foreign currency deposits.

00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:03.841
I told him those also require report.

00:40:03.841 --> 00:40:05.080
Then he left.

00:40:12.001 --> 00:40:13.120
Let me show you some others.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.456
Buildings are too close.

00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:16.640
It's up to you.
I don't have the final say.

00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:18.200
This one.

00:40:19.521 --> 00:40:20.881
Have you seen this person?

00:40:22.401 --> 00:40:23.441
Well...

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.481
I think I have some impression.

00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:28.280
He came here before.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.881
He came by himself.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.160
Yes.

00:40:32.401 --> 00:40:35.321
I remember he asked you
about small units.

00:40:35.841 --> 00:40:37.321
Then he changed to a large unit.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.441
When?

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.240
Last Saturday, in the morning.

00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:43.080
He also asked us for some materials.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.041
We meet again.

00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:05.521
You know why we want to see you, right?

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.560
Let's chat.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.041
Let's chat about the car accident
from that year.

00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:20.080
T-This was many years ago.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.881
Why are you asking about it?

00:41:21.881 --> 00:41:23.041
I know.

00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:24.041
It's been many years.

00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:25.680
So I said let's chat.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.441
Just a casual chat.

00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:31.200
Say whatever you remember.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:31.801
Relax.

00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:33.240
Okay.

00:41:35.401 --> 00:41:37.680
It happened a long time ago.

00:41:38.401 --> 00:41:42.921
As for many details,
I don't remember clearly.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.200
So,

00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:46.720
just say whatever you remember.

00:41:48.961 --> 00:41:53.680
The victim claimed 500,000 yuan.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.961
Seems like Liao Guangyong
paid it for you, right?

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.961
No, I borrowed it.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.041
Borrowed it?

00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:03.280
Did you pay it back?

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.361
No.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.720
And the transfer records.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.521
The money was transferred
several times, right?

00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:14.720
What do you think we do for a living?

00:42:15.881 --> 00:42:18.841
It's easy for us police to find out.
