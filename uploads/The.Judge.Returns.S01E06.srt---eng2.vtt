WEBVTT

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.097
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:38.433
EPISODE 6

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.860
Hello, I'm Lee Han-young.

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:49.278
I'm Yu Seon-cheol.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:51.488
Please, you don't need to be so formal.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:53.490
Seon-cheol

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.411
your life is in my hands now.

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.212
PROSECUTOR GENERAL EOM JUN-HO

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.467
I'll make Prosecutor General Eom

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:15.470
Haenal Law Firm's legal advisor.

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:20.142
What did you say?

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:30.068
Mr. Eom, the Prosecutor General, sir?

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:31.987
You really don't need to be so formal.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.281
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:36.408
Dad! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:47.669
What is this guy doing here?

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.463
Did you invite him?

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:50.923
I'll tell you later.

00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:52.633
- You can head out for now.
- No.

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:55.260
Why should I leave
when my old date is here?

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:56.345
Get out.

00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:57.888
Come on!

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:00.849
Drop by my office before you go.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.601
Okay?

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:04.728
You can join us.

00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:06.355
I'm here to see you, anyway.

00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:08.982
Mr. Eom will become

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.194
Haenal Law Firm's legal advisor,
without a doubt.

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:13.779
What are you saying?

00:02:13.862 --> 00:02:16.531
I wouldn't want anything more than that.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:18.367
But

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:20.369
what's in it for you?

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:22.579
Hire an attorney for Ms. Yu.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:25.624
For our very own Ms. Yu not to have one

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.042
as a Team Manager is

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.254
a little embarrassing, you know?

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:33.215
"Our Ms. Yu"?

00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:36.093
Don't call me that!

00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:38.095
Come with me right now.

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:39.388
Come on!

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:41.306
I need my briefcase!

00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:44.309
My gosh!

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:53.402
Prosecutor General Eom...

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:57.447
Man.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.750
How are you going to make Mr. Eom
work for us?

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:10.919
He's turned down every law firm

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.005
including this one, you know?

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:14.965
Oh

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.134
are you trying to impress me?

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:20.053
Just keep your head down
and come to me when it's time.

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.182
But don't even think
about acting like my husband

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:25.809
physically and emotionally.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:29.813
And going forward...

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.857
Was she always so chatty?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.941
No.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.111
Actually, just don't come again.

00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:38.238
I'll just see you at our wedding.

00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:44.703
Wait, why am I holding this?

00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:46.204
Here.

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:47.456
Get out already, then.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.001
What are you doing?

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:52.127
Huh?

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.630
I need your help

00:03:55.714 --> 00:03:57.341
to get Mr. Eom to join this firm.

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:01.219
- Sorry?
- I'll call you later.

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:13.023
What?

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.028
What the hell?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.601
Huh?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.147
Honey, get me a towel!

00:04:57.317 --> 00:05:00.404
I told you to take one on your way in.

00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:03.615
Stay there! You're getting water all over.

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:05.700
What's the towel doing there?

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:07.285
Maybe it grew legs and ran away.

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:08.370
What?

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:11.123
Let's see.

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:13.375
Where are your legs?

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:14.626
Han-young

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:16.711
do you want to shower or eat first?

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:18.463
I just started making some stew.

00:05:18.797 --> 00:05:20.132
Back then, I had no idea

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:22.342
how much I'd miss

00:05:22.676 --> 00:05:25.011
her precious voice.

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:27.222
I'll eat first.

00:05:37.023 --> 00:05:38.567
Han-young, have you seen the legs

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.569
on our towels?

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:42.320
What legs?

00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:45.490
Your mom said my towel grew legs and ran,
but I couldn't find them.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.493
Where did they go?

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:50.412
- Right there.
- Where?

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:51.496
Right there.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.581
Oh, it's running.

00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:53.665
- Here.
- Huh?

00:05:53.748 --> 00:05:54.749
Han-young

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.169
don't play along with his jokes.

00:05:57.252 --> 00:05:58.420
You're spoiling him.

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:06.553
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:14.811
Sin-jin will want to know

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.063
whether I'll do his homework or not

00:06:17.147 --> 00:06:19.733
now that I don't need his ticket to Seoul.

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:45.008
Hey!

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:47.677
No!

00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:52.974
- I haven't met Ms. Kim yet.
- Who are you?

00:06:58.021 --> 00:06:59.022
Yoon-hyeok!

00:07:07.864 --> 00:07:09.699
Right on! That was smooth.

00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:10.909
Are you in Seoul now?

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:14.120
Yeah, I am. We're in the same office.

00:07:14.204 --> 00:07:15.872
Oh, really?

00:07:15.956 --> 00:07:16.957
What are you doing?

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.709
It's heavy.

00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:25.382
Why don't you just get your own?

00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:26.758
Why? I can just use yours.

00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:28.218
What was that?

00:07:28.843 --> 00:07:30.303
Why was he being so awkward?

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.189
Hello.

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:43.942
You!

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:45.360
Yes, sir.

00:07:45.944 --> 00:07:47.362
I haven't said anything yet.

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:50.532
I won't go after Mr. Jang Tae-sik again

00:07:52.742 --> 00:07:54.202
without definite evidence.

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:00.166
Now, we're talking!

00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:05.922
I'll make sure

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:08.258
to crush Mr. Jang

00:08:08.592 --> 00:08:09.676
with definite evidence.

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:24.608
Give up on arresting Tae-sik?

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:26.651
There's no way.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:31.615
INAUGURATION OF BAEK YI-SEOK
AS THE 20TH CHIEF JUDGE OF THE SEOUL COURT

00:08:31.698 --> 00:08:32.741
Be careful.

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:36.161
- I got it.
- Hold the ladder properly.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.913
Canceling the inauguration ceremony

00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:40.248
for a last-minute meeting
with the presiding judges?

00:08:40.332 --> 00:08:41.583
This is ridiculous.

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:45.170
He's cracking the whip from his first day
to bring the judges to heel.

00:08:45.253 --> 00:08:46.546
You need to take action.

00:08:47.047 --> 00:08:48.048
Watch your mouth.

00:08:48.882 --> 00:08:50.800
The Judiciary is a mess.

00:08:50.884 --> 00:08:52.927
A Chief Justice from Jeju

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:55.555
and a Chief Judge from the Chungnam Court?

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.058
What is this,
the uprising of small-town judges?

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.018
No uprising ever leads to success, anyway.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.698
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:09:26.628 --> 00:09:28.505
Hello, everyone. I'm Baek Yi-seok.

00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:31.216
The Seoul Central District Court

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:35.303
is currently not doing well enough
to celebrate my inauguration.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.847
So, I canceled the ceremony.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.268
The Judiciary exists for the people.

00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:44.104
Therefore, our judicial authority

00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:47.148
must not become a source
of privilege and power.

00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:48.233
Chief Justice.

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.195
Your statement seems to suggest

00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:55.365
that we, as judges,
use our ruling authority in court

00:09:55.448 --> 00:09:56.741
for inappropriate purposes.

00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:04.374
Is that wrong?

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:07.919
- Sorry?
- Is that not true?

00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:24.477
Everyone...

00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:29.399
Please be respectful to each other.

00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:34.028
This is his wise counsel
in lieu of his inaugural speech.

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:48.585
From this day forward

00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:52.714
there will be no judicial favoritism
for former colleagues at this court.

00:10:52.797 --> 00:10:54.841
If such conduct is found

00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:59.471
it will be considered collusion
or inappropriate preferential treatment.

00:11:06.936 --> 00:11:08.563
Congratulations on your inauguration.

00:11:33.505 --> 00:11:35.006
Shouldn't we make a plan?

00:11:37.592 --> 00:11:39.886
He had a good point. No need for a plan.

00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:49.270
How many presiding judges
do you think are on my side?

00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:52.357
There are probably more judges
on Mr. Kang's side.

00:11:56.945 --> 00:11:58.488
Don't you want to know

00:12:00.156 --> 00:12:03.076
where Sin-jin's power comes from?

00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:08.373
It can't just be from his position
as the Senior Presiding Judge.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.250
I'll look into it.

00:12:13.336 --> 00:12:15.547
Is Judge Lee also starting today?

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.631
Yes, sir.

00:12:19.717 --> 00:12:21.511
I'll stop Chairman Woo Gyo-hun

00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:24.764
using Prosecutor General Eom.

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:26.140
How?

00:12:26.224 --> 00:12:27.809
Mr. Eom's son is

00:12:27.892 --> 00:12:29.686
doing drugs in the States.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.149
- So?
- And so is Gyo-hun's daughter.

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.568
Is she also in the States?

00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:37.652
No, she lives in Korea.

00:12:37.735 --> 00:12:40.572
She's a senior at Hancheon University.

00:12:41.322 --> 00:12:42.407
In Korea.

00:12:44.617 --> 00:12:45.952
Yeah, in Korea.

00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:50.290
You got a real good one.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:51.457
How's that?

00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.084
I got a real good one, didn't I?

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:54.377
But you're already in Seoul

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.170
so how should I reciprocate?

00:12:56.254 --> 00:12:57.338
Do you want anything?

00:12:58.047 --> 00:13:00.174
Let me take Prosecutor General Eom.

00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:01.968
What?

00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:05.889
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

00:13:08.224 --> 00:13:11.227
You need to bring a gift
to marry Haenal Law Firm's daughter?

00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.146
I have nothing to offer them.

00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:15.148
So, I plan on making Mr. Eom

00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:17.901
Haenal's legal advisor.

00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:21.362
Okay.

00:13:22.363 --> 00:13:24.324
That'll be my wedding gift for you.

00:13:25.491 --> 00:13:26.492
Congratulations in advance.

00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:27.702
Thank you, sir.

00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:34.626
Kang Sin-jin

00:13:35.043 --> 00:13:37.795
you're not going to a wedding.

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:39.047
You're going to court.

00:13:49.891 --> 00:13:52.226
He knows exactly how to use me

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:54.646
to his advantage.

00:13:55.355 --> 00:13:58.149
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:14:06.866 --> 00:14:07.992
Why is Han-young

00:14:08.952 --> 00:14:09.994
coming out of here?

00:14:12.914 --> 00:14:14.999
Why?

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:18.544
Have they known each other for a while?

00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:21.506
How am I supposed to ask Han-young
about this?

00:14:21.798 --> 00:14:24.050
Well, what's wrong
with asking some questions?

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.551
Just ask him. Go ahead.

00:14:25.635 --> 00:14:26.928
Call him.

00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:28.179
Oh, gosh.

00:14:28.262 --> 00:14:29.639
BAEK YI-SEOK, CHIEF JUDGE

00:14:30.598 --> 00:14:31.808
Yes, Mr. Baek.

00:14:32.934 --> 00:14:33.935
Right now?

00:14:34.852 --> 00:14:36.145
Yes, sir.

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:41.985
Why does he need to see Han-young?

00:14:44.404 --> 00:14:46.072
Maybe he already knows about it.

00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:48.783
Judge Lee.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:51.411
Yes, Mr. Baek.

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:54.956
Take the Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

00:14:55.873 --> 00:14:56.874
Sorry?

00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.334
Why are you surprised?

00:14:59.002 --> 00:15:00.003
Well, you know...

00:15:00.878 --> 00:15:02.880
It's just that people have
so many theories

00:15:02.964 --> 00:15:04.674
about what caused the sinkhole.

00:15:04.757 --> 00:15:06.384
Don't you think it's too big a task

00:15:06.467 --> 00:15:08.386
for Judge Lee?

00:15:08.469 --> 00:15:10.471
The sinkhole in Nammyeon District.

00:15:11.014 --> 00:15:12.348
The victims started blaming

00:15:12.432 --> 00:15:15.059
the Nammyeon District Office

00:15:15.643 --> 00:15:18.271
when the investigation started
going nowhere.

00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:20.523
In particular

00:15:20.773 --> 00:15:23.359
the casualties were the biggest issue.

00:15:23.818 --> 00:15:25.528
The press will attack the court

00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:27.989
if we only consider the technicalities

00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:32.035
letting emotion override the law
in court is

00:15:32.118 --> 00:15:33.244
also very risky.

00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:35.371
Right?

00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:38.082
He doesn't want such a tricky case.

00:15:41.836 --> 00:15:42.837
Hey, Jeong-ho.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.424
I think Woo Gyo-hun is mixed up
with the Nammyeon District Mayor.

00:15:46.507 --> 00:15:49.302
Looks like Taemyeong Construction
paid them off pretty well.

00:15:49.635 --> 00:15:51.971
In return for getting all projects
from Nammyeon District.

00:15:54.474 --> 00:15:56.726
Leave it to me, and I'll do my best.

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:06.819
You brought the case onto yourself

00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:07.987
so you'd better do well.

00:16:08.071 --> 00:16:09.113
Yes, sir.

00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:12.158
By the way

00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:15.161
have you seen her since moving to Seoul?

00:16:15.244 --> 00:16:16.871
- Who?
- Who else?

00:16:16.954 --> 00:16:19.040
Where's my follow-up
after that viral first date?

00:16:19.123 --> 00:16:20.166
Don't leave me hanging.

00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:21.709
You really have no news for me?

00:16:22.043 --> 00:16:24.212
- Don't make me look into it.
- There's nothing.

00:16:24.504 --> 00:16:25.671
Anything else, then?

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.299
You got anything else to tell me?

00:16:28.508 --> 00:16:30.718
Maybe you can look into it yourself.

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:33.429
Bye, then.

00:16:39.352 --> 00:16:42.188
Man!

00:16:43.356 --> 00:16:44.440
Ms. Yu

00:16:44.524 --> 00:16:47.151
I'm calling you to discuss
Prosecutor General Eom.

00:16:57.245 --> 00:16:58.871
The Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

00:17:00.123 --> 00:17:04.335
The truth behind the sinkhole was revealed
only after a change in administration.

00:17:15.972 --> 00:17:19.892
Dad said he was somewhere around here.

00:17:19.976 --> 00:17:22.228
Where is he?

00:17:23.229 --> 00:17:24.522
Maybe there?

00:17:33.072 --> 00:17:34.323
Bamtol!

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.160
Ta-da!

00:17:49.297 --> 00:17:51.132
MY ADORABLE SON MIN-GU

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.885
Hey, Min-gu.

00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:55.136
Hey, Dad.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.804
Where are you?

00:17:56.888 --> 00:17:59.098
Me? Just across the street.

00:17:59.182 --> 00:18:00.600
Across the street?

00:18:00.683 --> 00:18:01.684
I don't see you.

00:18:01.767 --> 00:18:03.227
Do you see me waving?

00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:05.271
Oh, there you are.

00:18:05.354 --> 00:18:06.355
I'll be right over.

00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:07.607
Okay!

00:18:13.237 --> 00:18:14.238
- Oh, no!
- Goodness!

00:18:14.322 --> 00:18:15.448
HAND-PULLED SUJEBI AND KALGUKSU

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:29.212
Sir!

00:18:31.255 --> 00:18:32.423
Are you okay?

00:18:32.506 --> 00:18:34.300
Min-gu!

00:18:34.383 --> 00:18:36.928
- Don't go!
- Stop!

00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:43.643
Bamtol!

00:18:44.227 --> 00:18:45.228
Bamtol!

00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:47.021
Bamtol!

00:18:48.814 --> 00:18:49.941
Please help!

00:18:53.903 --> 00:18:55.446
Min-gu!

00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:13.422
Take anything that can be used
as evidence.

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:14.840
Major Chu Yong-jin of Nammyeon District

00:19:14.924 --> 00:19:17.385
was the head of the Obok gang

00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:21.889
and the head of Taemyeon Construction was
the gang's enforcer.

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:26.352
The investigation revealed

00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:30.398
that the sinkhole was caused
by faulty water and sewer construction.

00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:32.942
But

00:19:33.484 --> 00:19:35.069
in the trial regarding the casualties

00:19:35.152 --> 00:19:37.488
the Nammyeon District Office won
in appeal, too

00:19:37.571 --> 00:19:40.658
and the Supreme Court dismissed
the appeal of the bereaved families.

00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:43.786
MAYOR CHU MUST SPEAK
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE SINKHOLE

00:19:47.164 --> 00:19:49.125
We demand an apology from Mayor Chu!

00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:51.377
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.379
Nammyeon District Office,
take accountability!

00:19:53.462 --> 00:19:55.548
- Take accountability!
- Take accountability!

00:19:55.631 --> 00:19:57.633
We demand an apology from Mayor Chu!

00:19:57.717 --> 00:20:00.011
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

00:20:00.094 --> 00:20:01.679
Let's take a break.

00:20:04.223 --> 00:20:05.599
You must be exhausted.

00:20:05.683 --> 00:20:06.851
Have some water.

00:20:07.393 --> 00:20:08.811
You must be exhausted.

00:20:08.894 --> 00:20:10.271
Have some water.

00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:14.692
Have some...

00:20:20.948 --> 00:20:21.991
Wow.

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:23.993
Where was this?

00:20:24.493 --> 00:20:27.455
I'm guessing this is from a trip
with your son.

00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:32.710
I'm

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:40.634
Song Na-yeon,
a reporter with Daejin Daily.

00:20:41.302 --> 00:20:42.303
I'm not interested.

00:20:51.395 --> 00:20:52.396
Okay.

00:20:52.897 --> 00:20:54.774
Okay, see you later.

00:20:55.733 --> 00:20:56.734
Bye.

00:21:01.572 --> 00:21:02.990
Why did Mr. Lim want to see you?

00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:06.494
Mr. Baek assigned me to a case.

00:21:06.577 --> 00:21:08.829
- Which case?
- The Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

00:21:11.832 --> 00:21:15.086
Damn, everyone's already talking
about how messy it is.

00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:19.548
He's too harsh on you.
You literally just moved here.

00:21:19.632 --> 00:21:20.674
I know.

00:21:28.057 --> 00:21:29.058
What is she doing here?

00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:36.190
Come in.

00:21:51.497 --> 00:21:54.041
What brings you here?

00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:56.210
I'd like to talk to him.

00:22:12.726 --> 00:22:13.727
Oh, hey.

00:22:16.147 --> 00:22:17.940
Had no idea
judge offices looked like this.

00:22:18.566 --> 00:22:19.608
Looks ugly.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.110
Why don't we head out?

00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:30.286
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG
JUDGE KIM YOON-HYEOK

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.707
Unbelievable.

00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:37.918
When did he get himself a girl?

00:22:38.002 --> 00:22:39.253
How does he have time?

00:22:45.843 --> 00:22:47.553
Wait, is that Yu Se-hee from Haenal?

00:22:49.805 --> 00:22:50.806
Should we sit here?

00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:56.896
You're at the Central Court now?

00:22:57.229 --> 00:22:58.772
Yup, this is my first day.

00:22:58.856 --> 00:23:01.567
If you called me to be your lunch buddy,
this is the last time.

00:23:02.026 --> 00:23:04.320
Eating alone is trendy now.
Get used to it.

00:23:04.403 --> 00:23:06.363
I managed to get
Sin-jin and Seon-cheol on my side

00:23:06.447 --> 00:23:08.157
by using Gyo-hun.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.659
But not Jang Tae-sik yet.

00:23:10.743 --> 00:23:13.037
I went after Jang Tae-sik
as soon as I became a prosecutor.

00:23:13.704 --> 00:23:15.414
Do you know Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

00:23:15.498 --> 00:23:16.499
Jin-a?

00:23:16.916 --> 00:23:19.251
Do you need more lunch buddies
to alternate between?

00:23:19.335 --> 00:23:22.171
I'm curious about her.
I hear she's principled.

00:23:22.254 --> 00:23:25.132
I already helped you
on Kim Sang-jin's case for losing the bet.

00:23:25.216 --> 00:23:27.343
As you know, I hate owing anyone anything.

00:23:27.426 --> 00:23:29.720
You moved to Seoul
after busting the draft dodgers, yeah?

00:23:29.803 --> 00:23:30.804
Yeah.

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:33.557
But don't credit yourself for it.
You only read the list.

00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:35.851
What? But I found that list.

00:23:36.894 --> 00:23:37.895
Really?

00:23:44.276 --> 00:23:45.277
Wait, really?

00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:49.156
Are you serious?

00:23:49.782 --> 00:23:51.575
Not letting yourself owe anyone anything

00:23:52.284 --> 00:23:53.577
must be so tiring.

00:23:58.916 --> 00:24:01.252
Ms. Kim joined the prosecution
two years after I did.

00:24:02.545 --> 00:24:03.879
I found Gyo-hun's daughter.

00:24:03.963 --> 00:24:05.714
I'll head in as soon as the club opens.

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:07.883
Let's all have dinner together. My treat.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.618
Hey, everyone.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.121
Excuse me.

00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:40.374
Hello, there.

00:24:40.624 --> 00:24:41.834
Wait, let me see your faces.

00:24:50.092 --> 00:24:51.552
What a mess.

00:24:54.638 --> 00:24:55.639
Who are you?

00:24:55.723 --> 00:24:57.891
Hey, who are you?

00:24:57.975 --> 00:24:59.018
Me?

00:24:59.393 --> 00:25:00.394
An angel.

00:25:21.999 --> 00:25:23.709
- Hello.
- Who are you?

00:25:23.792 --> 00:25:24.960
A new bodyguard?

00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:27.338
Hey, make sure I look pretty in the photo.

00:25:27.421 --> 00:25:29.757
I sure will.

00:25:31.508 --> 00:25:32.509
Hold on.

00:25:33.177 --> 00:25:34.720
Hold this. You'll look prettier.

00:25:36.597 --> 00:25:38.849
Stunning!

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.934
Right on. Look here.

00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:00.913
PROSECUTOR GENERAL EOM JUN-HO

00:26:11.173 --> 00:26:13.759
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:26:14.468 --> 00:26:18.764
PROSECUTOR GENERAL EOM JUN-HO

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.523
The woman in the photo is
the daughter of Woo Gyo-hun

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:29.191
the Ministry of Justice candidate.

00:26:31.902 --> 00:26:34.238
Kids don't always turn out
the way their parents want.

00:26:34.488 --> 00:26:35.489
Whether it be

00:26:36.031 --> 00:26:37.449
a daughter or a son.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.120
Who are you?

00:26:51.338 --> 00:26:53.173
Thank you for hiring me in Seoul.

00:26:53.882 --> 00:26:55.676
I told you I'd do it soon.

00:26:58.804 --> 00:27:00.806
Keep a good eye on Yi-seok here, too.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.308
And Han-young.

00:27:04.601 --> 00:27:06.562
Sure

00:27:07.104 --> 00:27:08.856
but why Han-young, too?

00:27:10.232 --> 00:27:11.692
Because Yi-seok brought him here.

00:27:12.818 --> 00:27:14.319
Keeping an eye on Han-young is

00:27:14.403 --> 00:27:16.196
an extension of keeping an eye on Yi-seok.

00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:18.907
Yes, sir.

00:27:19.783 --> 00:27:20.784
Oh, right.

00:27:21.493 --> 00:27:22.953
Yu Se-hee from Haenal

00:27:23.036 --> 00:27:24.913
visited Han-young today.

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:27.541
- Did she?
- Yes, sir.

00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:30.210
I hear the two might be getting married.

00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:38.093
Good work.

00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:42.806
Hello.

00:27:44.349 --> 00:27:47.311
I'm Yu Se-hee,
the Team Manager at Haenal Law Firm.

00:27:52.775 --> 00:27:55.319
The person you spoke to on the phone
will be here soon.

00:27:56.153 --> 00:27:57.571
He works nearby.

00:27:58.071 --> 00:28:00.032
Is Seon-cheol behind this?

00:28:00.115 --> 00:28:02.826
Do as I say when you meet Mr. Eom, okay?

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.037
No, my father doesn't know about this.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.623
Your father? That means Mr. Yu is...

00:28:07.706 --> 00:28:08.707
Yes.

00:28:11.543 --> 00:28:12.586
Gosh, this is heavy.

00:28:17.508 --> 00:28:18.634
Hello.

00:28:18.884 --> 00:28:21.011
I'm Judge Lee Han-young
at the Seoul Central Court.

00:28:22.721 --> 00:28:24.765
What is a judge
from the Seoul Central Court doing

00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:26.767
with the daughter of Haenal's Partner?

00:28:27.226 --> 00:28:29.019
I'm sure you've seen the photos by now.

00:28:29.937 --> 00:28:32.189
These are all the evidence collected
from the scene.

00:28:32.397 --> 00:28:33.440
This is enough

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.276
to justify an emergency arrest
of Gyo-hun's daughter.

00:28:36.735 --> 00:28:37.736
Why should I do that?

00:28:40.697 --> 00:28:42.074
I've already told you.

00:28:42.699 --> 00:28:44.618
Kids don't always turn out
the way their parents want.

00:28:45.035 --> 00:28:47.287
Whether it be a daughter or a son.

00:28:50.874 --> 00:28:52.918
The fact that Jun-ho is here means

00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:55.838
he understands what's going on
with his son in Washington, DC.

00:28:56.088 --> 00:28:58.173
Stop with this nonsense and go home.

00:28:58.507 --> 00:29:00.133
Cross the line again

00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:02.219
and you'll both pay for it.

00:29:02.594 --> 00:29:03.971
What time is it in Washington, DC?

00:29:05.639 --> 00:29:08.433
It's 8:40 p.m. here

00:29:08.517 --> 00:29:10.978
so it should be 7:40 a.m. there.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.107
Do you think the employees
at Haenal's DC office are at work now?

00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:16.567
Of course.

00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:18.443
Haenal has a branch in the US.

00:29:18.527 --> 00:29:19.862
Do you know anyone there?

00:29:21.071 --> 00:29:22.072
No.

00:29:22.614 --> 00:29:25.284
But everyone there should know who I am.

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:26.451
That should work.

00:29:27.327 --> 00:29:28.745
What the hell are you doing?

00:29:30.664 --> 00:29:32.082
Yes, Ms. Yu.

00:29:32.165 --> 00:29:33.166
You ready?

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.961
Yes, Mr. Eom's son had a party last night

00:29:36.044 --> 00:29:38.213
so we took videos and collected
all evidence of drug use.

00:29:38.297 --> 00:29:40.007
Should I report him to the police now?

00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:42.801
ANDREW CHOI

00:29:42.885 --> 00:29:43.927
Sorry.

00:29:56.356 --> 00:30:00.402
OFFICE FOR MINISTER OF JUSTICE
CONFIRMATION HEARING PREPARATION

00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:06.241
It's just a confirmation hearing.

00:30:06.325 --> 00:30:08.535
I just have to get through one day.

00:30:09.912 --> 00:30:11.830
Don't worry about me, Mr. Kang.

00:30:11.914 --> 00:30:14.791
Just focus on serving His Excellency.

00:30:15.334 --> 00:30:18.253
So you can become a Justice
or even the Chief Justice

00:30:18.337 --> 00:30:19.379
you know?

00:30:19.463 --> 00:30:21.465
I don't know if I have what it takes.

00:30:21.548 --> 00:30:24.885
If it's about your humble upbringing,
don't worry about it.

00:30:25.969 --> 00:30:27.304
The higher you climb

00:30:27.387 --> 00:30:30.098
the better people will make
your story sound.

00:30:33.644 --> 00:30:34.645
I heard

00:30:36.271 --> 00:30:40.776
you grew up at a brothel in Cheongnyangni.

00:30:41.068 --> 00:30:42.152
Is that true?

00:30:42.819 --> 00:30:44.529
I'm just curious.

00:30:45.822 --> 00:30:46.865
No, sir.

00:30:49.368 --> 00:30:51.912
Right. Of course not.

00:30:53.121 --> 00:30:55.123
I knew I didn't need to believe that.

00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:57.709
I grew up in a high-end hostess bar.

00:31:02.172 --> 00:31:03.423
Babe!

00:31:04.216 --> 00:31:05.342
- Oh, gosh.
- Babe.

00:31:05.425 --> 00:31:06.969
- Oh, no.
- Watch your steps.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.017
- Promise you'll be back tomorrow, babe.
- Tomorrow?

00:31:14.101 --> 00:31:16.728
Yeah, I'll come back.

00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:18.689
- Be careful.
- Alright.

00:31:18.772 --> 00:31:19.815
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:31:19.898 --> 00:31:21.608
Can you get home okay?

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:23.276
See you tomorrow.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.904
- See you tomorrow, babe.
- Yeah, see you.

00:31:43.547 --> 00:31:44.923
The food is ready.

00:31:45.007 --> 00:31:46.383
- Eat up.
- Thank you.

00:31:46.466 --> 00:31:48.510
- Thanks for the food.
- Oh, we have jeon, too.

00:32:10.824 --> 00:32:14.369
Oh, I see!

00:32:17.748 --> 00:32:20.333
People really don't know
what they're talking about.

00:32:24.004 --> 00:32:25.422
A high-end hostess bar!

00:32:29.593 --> 00:32:33.096
Let's visit one
after the confirmation hearing.

00:32:33.555 --> 00:32:35.474
You can tell me all about the old times.

00:32:43.398 --> 00:32:47.986
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.822
I don't know.

00:32:52.115 --> 00:32:53.867
Not sure if we'll have time for that.

00:32:54.534 --> 00:32:57.537
We can always make time.

00:33:06.797 --> 00:33:08.757
Whoa, this is crazy!

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.383
I was on a roll!

00:33:13.678 --> 00:33:15.305
Let's celebrate with a drink.

00:33:15.388 --> 00:33:17.390
Next time. Gotta finish this one up.

00:33:17.474 --> 00:33:18.475
You can go home first.

00:33:18.558 --> 00:33:20.644
I knew you were a prick

00:33:20.727 --> 00:33:22.354
but man, you really are a prick.

00:33:22.896 --> 00:33:25.857
Why do you want
Mr. Woo's daughter arrested?

00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:27.359
You want Haenal Law Firm, right?

00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:28.735
What?

00:33:29.152 --> 00:33:30.362
I'll help you

00:33:31.196 --> 00:33:33.657
make Haenal Law Firm yours.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:37.661
Ridiculous.

00:33:46.294 --> 00:33:50.423
Prosecutor General Eom was highly regarded
by the prosecution

00:33:50.507 --> 00:33:52.551
for resisting
the influence of powerful people.

00:33:52.676 --> 00:33:54.678
But he had one issue.

00:33:55.178 --> 00:33:56.888
His son.

00:33:57.764 --> 00:34:00.058
Mr. Woo is full of flaws.

00:34:01.434 --> 00:34:03.436
Not only does he take bribes from everyone

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.564
but he's also used his power
in the Legislation and Judiciary Committee

00:34:05.981 --> 00:34:07.899
to help big companies get their way.

00:34:07.983 --> 00:34:10.068
But as you know, if you bust him for that

00:34:10.652 --> 00:34:13.280
the prosecution will be blamed
for election meddling.

00:34:13.363 --> 00:34:16.116
But you must stop him
from becoming the Minister of Justice.

00:34:17.826 --> 00:34:21.329
Are you also going to use my son
to attack me

00:34:22.372 --> 00:34:24.416
if I terminate my contract
as the legal advisor?

00:34:24.916 --> 00:34:28.211
I know this is a dirty way
of going about it.

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:31.715
But I'll make sure you never get hurt.

00:34:33.884 --> 00:34:35.927
How can you call yourself a judge
and do stuff like this?

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:38.513
You know a judge shouldn't do this.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:40.807
Please remember

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:43.059
judges exist outside of the court, too.

00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:54.529
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

00:34:54.613 --> 00:34:56.740
Who made you this stubborn?

00:34:58.033 --> 00:35:00.076
- Gosh.
- I'm home.

00:35:00.702 --> 00:35:01.703
Hey, Han-young.

00:35:01.786 --> 00:35:02.787
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:06.124
There you are, Your Honor!

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.711
What are you doing? Say hello.

00:35:09.794 --> 00:35:11.588
He's a judge.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.008
Hello.

00:35:18.595 --> 00:35:19.930
Hey.

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:24.142
I'm sorry, Grandma.

00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:27.229
I've caused you so much trouble.

00:35:29.356 --> 00:35:31.524
My baby!

00:35:36.988 --> 00:35:37.989
Do you know me?

00:35:38.073 --> 00:35:39.241
Not at all.

00:35:39.324 --> 00:35:42.369
Don't talk like that to His Honor!
That's rude.

00:35:42.577 --> 00:35:43.787
I didn't say anything bad.

00:35:44.746 --> 00:35:45.747
I'm leaving.

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.252
Where do you think you're going?

00:35:50.585 --> 00:35:51.586
It's perfect.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.338
Now that His Honor is here, too

00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:56.675
let's ask him to make
a righteous judgment.

00:35:59.094 --> 00:36:00.637
Your Honor

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.721
Yes.

00:36:01.805 --> 00:36:04.975
she's in ninth grade this year

00:36:05.058 --> 00:36:07.394
but she wants to get a part-time job.

00:36:07.477 --> 00:36:09.145
Does that sound acceptable to you?

00:36:09.229 --> 00:36:11.690
Students should focus on their studies!

00:36:11.773 --> 00:36:14.734
I can't even afford to get her tutors
like everyone else

00:36:14.818 --> 00:36:17.737
so how can I let her work?

00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:21.032
Yeah, you should be focused on studying
in ninth grade.

00:36:21.116 --> 00:36:22.617
- That's right.
- Indeed.

00:36:22.701 --> 00:36:24.911
Is it acceptable
for a woman in her seventies

00:36:24.995 --> 00:36:27.539
to collect scraps to raise
her granddaughter, then?

00:36:27.872 --> 00:36:30.959
"He who does not work,
neither shall he eat." You know it.

00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:33.878
You have a great point there.

00:36:33.962 --> 00:36:36.464
Who said all that nonsense?

00:36:36.548 --> 00:36:41.219
Your Honor, come on. I'm right, aren't I?

00:36:41.303 --> 00:36:45.265
No! You're turning me
into a bad granddaughter here.

00:36:45.348 --> 00:36:47.142
Cut it out!

00:36:47.225 --> 00:36:51.354
Your Honor, please do something
about my granddaughter.

00:36:51.438 --> 00:36:53.773
Your Honor, please stop my grandma!

00:36:56.735 --> 00:36:59.029
Okay, you two.

00:36:59.904 --> 00:37:02.449
You'll do exactly as I tell you, right?

00:37:02.866 --> 00:37:04.284
You'll only work for four hours per day

00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:06.411
twice after school
and twice over the weekend.

00:37:06.494 --> 00:37:07.495
Got it?

00:37:08.163 --> 00:37:09.581
And this convenience store owner

00:37:09.664 --> 00:37:11.124
knows a tutoring school

00:37:11.207 --> 00:37:13.168
which you'll attend
on the other three days.

00:37:13.251 --> 00:37:15.628
You'll pay for these classes

00:37:15.712 --> 00:37:17.422
with the money you earn from working.

00:37:17.797 --> 00:37:20.884
That way, you can work, study,
and help Grandma.

00:37:21.259 --> 00:37:22.260
Perfect, right?

00:37:25.138 --> 00:37:26.139
Right?

00:37:26.514 --> 00:37:28.016
Fine.

00:37:30.185 --> 00:37:32.228
That's still too much.
How about two hours a day...

00:37:32.312 --> 00:37:33.313
Grandma!

00:37:34.522 --> 00:37:36.232
I'm not deaf!

00:37:36.316 --> 00:37:37.400
I'm hungry.

00:37:37.484 --> 00:37:40.111
You look like you'll eat me
if I wait any longer.

00:37:41.154 --> 00:37:42.155
Let's go.

00:37:46.242 --> 00:37:47.452
Alright, then.

00:37:47.952 --> 00:37:50.205
Please be a good boss to her.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.290
Don't worry.

00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:54.250
Get home safely.

00:37:54.334 --> 00:37:56.836
- Goodnight!
- Bye!

00:38:06.638 --> 00:38:07.972
I know that girl.

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:11.393
She visits my store every few days

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.813
and takes
all the expired samgak gimbap and milk.

00:38:16.856 --> 00:38:19.401
I've always wanted to give her more
but couldn't

00:38:20.151 --> 00:38:21.986
because I didn't want to offend her.

00:38:23.571 --> 00:38:25.448
But you came to the rescue and helped her

00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:28.076
in a way I never could.

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:33.206
- You crying?
- I need a drink.

00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:36.751
Mr and Mrs. Lee, I'm leaving!

00:38:36.835 --> 00:38:38.962
- Sure, good work today.
- Okay.

00:38:39.045 --> 00:38:40.255
Get home safe!

00:38:44.592 --> 00:38:47.971
A poet who died before 30 once said

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.641
he'd kept looking for what he'd lost

00:38:52.058 --> 00:38:54.144
without knowing what he'd lost and where.

00:38:56.062 --> 00:38:57.772
But I know

00:38:59.149 --> 00:39:00.525
what I'd lost

00:39:01.192 --> 00:39:04.237
in my previous life.

00:39:08.366 --> 00:39:11.035
Na-yeong, dinnertime.

00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:12.912
You said you were hungry.

00:39:12.996 --> 00:39:14.080
Okay.

00:39:19.711 --> 00:39:21.045
Grandma, can I have some milk?

00:39:21.129 --> 00:39:23.006
But we're having dinner now.

00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:24.090
I want it now.

00:39:25.133 --> 00:39:26.593
My gosh.

00:39:31.222 --> 00:39:32.223
Here you go.

00:39:32.307 --> 00:39:33.475
You know how I bring

00:39:33.558 --> 00:39:35.310
expired samgak gimbap and milk

00:39:35.393 --> 00:39:37.604
- from the convenience store?
- Yeah.

00:39:37.687 --> 00:39:39.105
The store owner you just met

00:39:39.189 --> 00:39:42.400
always slips in a few things
that aren't expired.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:43.651
Really?

00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:45.695
See? This isn't expired, either.

00:39:46.029 --> 00:39:47.363
Oh, my.

00:39:48.198 --> 00:39:50.867
But I play along.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:51.951
Why?

00:39:52.494 --> 00:39:54.537
You should thank him.

00:39:54.621 --> 00:39:57.415
I just feel
like that's the right thing to do.

00:39:58.458 --> 00:39:59.751
You don't need to know why.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.631
Han-young

00:40:05.673 --> 00:40:09.928
remember how my mom ran a fish shop
at the market when I was a kid?

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.554
Go home. You're drunk.

00:40:11.638 --> 00:40:13.473
Hey, hey!

00:40:14.182 --> 00:40:15.183
I'm not drunk.

00:40:15.266 --> 00:40:17.602
You always talk about the fish shop
when you're drunk.

00:40:17.977 --> 00:40:19.479
I just feel bad.

00:40:21.439 --> 00:40:23.316
I feel like I owe Mom an apology.

00:40:23.691 --> 00:40:26.319
She was just a young lady, too.

00:40:26.402 --> 00:40:30.448
She couldn't have enjoyed
handling fish all day.

00:40:31.783 --> 00:40:34.410
But I always threw the money she gave me

00:40:34.494 --> 00:40:37.664
saying her money reeked
of that fishy smell.

00:40:37.747 --> 00:40:40.041
What a little brat.

00:40:40.124 --> 00:40:41.876
I don't deserve to be called her son.

00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:50.969
Han-young

00:40:53.596 --> 00:40:55.348
if I could turn back time

00:40:57.642 --> 00:41:00.103
I'd go back to then
and handle all the fish myself.

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:03.189
I'd tell Mom

00:41:04.482 --> 00:41:06.234
to wear all the makeup she wants

00:41:06.609 --> 00:41:08.111
and only work as a cashier.

00:41:10.029 --> 00:41:13.241
You got her makeup for her birthday,
remember?

00:41:16.077 --> 00:41:17.495
You know

00:41:21.666 --> 00:41:24.627
that was because all the other moms
smelled good.

00:41:26.546 --> 00:41:27.755
That was why.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:31.009
I wanted her to stop smelling like fish.

00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:33.720
Hey

00:41:34.721 --> 00:41:38.182
but the kids were so kind
not to tease me, huh?

00:41:38.766 --> 00:41:41.019
No, they just didn't want to get
their asses kicked.

00:41:43.855 --> 00:41:46.816
They covered their noses and teased you
when you weren't around.

00:41:46.899 --> 00:41:48.693
I know!

00:41:52.322 --> 00:41:54.115
But you didn't.

00:41:56.159 --> 00:41:57.201
Because

00:42:00.246 --> 00:42:02.123
I liked fish.

00:42:09.631 --> 00:42:10.632
Han-young

00:42:18.723 --> 00:42:19.807
I'm so glad

00:42:22.977 --> 00:42:25.313
that such a good man has become a judge.

00:42:28.441 --> 00:42:29.525
I'm so glad.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.447
What a relief.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.407
It sure is.

00:42:40.578 --> 00:42:41.746
What a relief...

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.092
No, Jeong-ho.

00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:56.344
I was a terrible judge.

00:42:56.427 --> 00:42:58.179
The 25-year-old lady with leukemia waited

00:42:58.262 --> 00:43:01.099
for the law to save her
from her workplace injury.

00:43:01.182 --> 00:43:03.768
However, the court ruled
her proof to be insufficient

00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:05.770
excusing the corporate
of responsibilities.

00:43:05.853 --> 00:43:07.563
That afternoon

00:43:07.647 --> 00:43:09.273
the woman jumped
from her hospital building.

00:43:09.357 --> 00:43:10.900
The court hereby orders
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:43:10.983 --> 00:43:14.112
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:22.870
You know it too, Jeong-ho.

00:43:24.414 --> 00:43:27.291
That I'm a total scumbag

00:43:28.084 --> 00:43:29.585
who abandoned his father, twice.

00:43:55.153 --> 00:43:56.154
EOM JUN-HO

00:43:56.237 --> 00:43:57.238
What?

00:43:57.321 --> 00:44:00.616
You blackmailed the Prosecutor General
using his drug addict son?

00:44:01.075 --> 00:44:04.328
I'll help you make Haenal Law Firm yours.

00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:07.915
And you know,
I don't even smoke cigarettes.

00:44:09.667 --> 00:44:10.668
Good girl.

00:44:11.586 --> 00:44:13.045
You're the best daughter ever.

00:44:18.301 --> 00:44:21.554
Did I just choose the perfect son-in-law

00:44:22.889 --> 00:44:25.224
or bring myself future trouble?

00:44:26.517 --> 00:44:28.603
You're so strong for being back again.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.149
You're not holding
photos of your son today?

00:44:33.232 --> 00:44:35.193
His tablet PC ran out of battery.

00:44:35.276 --> 00:44:37.779
There's nowhere to charge it
because we're outside.

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:45.620
Here.

00:44:52.293 --> 00:44:53.878
Wow.

00:44:53.961 --> 00:44:55.338
Where was this?

00:44:56.631 --> 00:44:58.257
This was when he was in sixth grade.

00:44:59.592 --> 00:45:01.093
We were hiking the Jiri Mountain.

00:45:05.848 --> 00:45:08.142
PLEASE HELP ME GET MY LOST SON BACK

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:15.691
Sir

00:45:17.568 --> 00:45:18.569
I'm here

00:45:20.196 --> 00:45:22.156
to help you.

00:45:24.784 --> 00:45:26.410
Sorry about yesterday.

00:45:28.538 --> 00:45:30.331
I thought
you were from the District Office.

00:45:31.207 --> 00:45:32.208
No, right?

00:45:32.792 --> 00:45:34.877
Oh, not at all.

00:45:39.298 --> 00:45:40.424
Stop here.

00:45:43.636 --> 00:45:46.097
WE DEMAND AN APOLOGY FROM MAYOR CHU

00:45:46.806 --> 00:45:49.642
Why are they always pestering us here?

00:45:53.646 --> 00:45:56.190
She doesn't look like one of them.

00:45:57.191 --> 00:45:58.609
She looks like a news reporter.

00:45:59.527 --> 00:46:02.071
Aren't there
more important stories to cover?

00:46:04.866 --> 00:46:05.867
It's Chu Yong-jin!

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.410
Mayor!

00:46:07.493 --> 00:46:08.870
Hey!

00:46:19.922 --> 00:46:21.257
Hey, call Haenal.

00:46:26.095 --> 00:46:27.138
Here you go, sir.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.681
Okay.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:31.851
Hello?

00:46:32.143 --> 00:46:33.144
Hey

00:46:33.644 --> 00:46:35.897
what are you going to do
about those pests outside?

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.733
I thought Haenal was
the best firm in the nation.

00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:41.152
Do I need to hire the world's best now?

00:46:41.235 --> 00:46:43.613
There's a delay in the settlement
with the bereaved families.

00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:45.156
Please be patient...

00:46:45.239 --> 00:46:47.575
Had it not been for Congressman Kang
introducing you to me

00:46:47.658 --> 00:46:49.577
I would've sorted this out myself already.

00:46:50.202 --> 00:46:52.288
You can keep what I've paid you

00:46:52.371 --> 00:46:53.831
but you're off this case!

00:46:57.335 --> 00:46:58.419
What the hell was that?

00:47:11.474 --> 00:47:12.475
Hey.

00:47:12.892 --> 00:47:15.144
Hurry and deal with the guys
who died in the sinkhole first.

00:47:15.227 --> 00:47:16.812
- Get on it.
- Yes, sir.

00:47:27.782 --> 00:47:30.826
What the hell did you do to the sewers
to cause a sinkhole like that?

00:47:31.243 --> 00:47:32.328
Seriously!

00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:34.997
Did you file paperwork
without doing the actual construction?

00:47:35.915 --> 00:47:37.625
You crazy idiot!

00:47:37.708 --> 00:47:39.752
Burn all records!

00:47:43.089 --> 00:47:46.384
TAEMYEONG

00:47:47.551 --> 00:47:49.637
It's too hot for this bullshit.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.431
PROJECT OUTLINE FOR SEWER MAINTENANCE WORK
IN NAMMYEON DISTRICT

00:47:52.515 --> 00:47:54.517
We demand an apology from Mayor Chu!

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.811
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

00:47:56.894 --> 00:47:58.813
Nammyeon District Office,
take accountability!

00:47:58.896 --> 00:48:00.898
- Take accountability!
- Take accountability!

00:48:00.982 --> 00:48:03.526
Mr. Lee, I hear you work in Seoul now.

00:48:05.277 --> 00:48:07.822
Are you still "Six and Done,"
even at your new job?

00:48:10.282 --> 00:48:12.952
Do you want to see me after work, then?

00:48:13.035 --> 00:48:14.245
Is something wrong?

00:48:15.121 --> 00:48:17.206
It's about the sinkhole
in Nammyeon District.

00:48:18.082 --> 00:48:20.292
Hear me out later.

00:48:20.376 --> 00:48:22.795
Oh, sure. See you after work.

00:48:26.215 --> 00:48:29.719
What does Ms. Song have to do
with the sinkhole case?

00:48:33.347 --> 00:48:36.434
The public won't receive it well
if you step up to speak.

00:48:37.893 --> 00:48:40.646
Don't you already see
the public hating on me?

00:48:41.939 --> 00:48:43.649
Didn't you see the protesters outside?

00:48:45.192 --> 00:48:46.819
It's not easy to reach a settlement.

00:48:46.902 --> 00:48:49.238
You should focus on the trial instead.

00:48:51.032 --> 00:48:53.325
And what? Let the case drag on in court

00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:55.411
without even a settlement?

00:48:59.457 --> 00:49:01.333
I'll work on the settlement.

00:49:02.418 --> 00:49:03.419
Maybe you can help me

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.755
by being my golf buddy?

00:49:08.424 --> 00:49:11.635
I did some research after hearing
some questionable things about Mayor Chu

00:49:11.719 --> 00:49:13.804
and he's a part of the Obok gang.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.516
Nammyeon District's representative is
Kang Jeong-tae in the majority party

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.560
and Chu helped Kang
since his first term in office

00:49:19.643 --> 00:49:21.812
eventually being nominated
as the District Mayor.

00:49:23.522 --> 00:49:25.524
He better not force a settlement
using violence.

00:49:30.404 --> 00:49:32.031
Any updates?

00:49:34.116 --> 00:49:36.202
Judge Lee Han-young is taking the case?

00:49:38.245 --> 00:49:40.081
Okay, got it.

00:49:45.961 --> 00:49:46.962
Next.

00:49:50.049 --> 00:49:51.050
Next.

00:49:52.635 --> 00:49:53.636
Next.

00:49:53.969 --> 00:49:56.764
Next!

00:49:58.265 --> 00:49:59.767
Let's celebrate with a drink.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.477
Next time. Gotta finish this one up.

00:50:01.894 --> 00:50:03.395
So, when's the next time?

00:50:06.232 --> 00:50:08.192
Why isn't he calling me
about that next time?

00:50:17.326 --> 00:50:18.661
Of course.

00:50:18.744 --> 00:50:20.121
He can't resist me.

00:50:21.539 --> 00:50:22.915
Damn it.

00:50:23.541 --> 00:50:24.875
What a damn prick.

00:50:26.669 --> 00:50:27.837
PRICK

00:50:29.213 --> 00:50:30.214
What?

00:50:30.297 --> 00:50:31.298
Hey, my Se-hee.

00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:33.342
You sound upset. Are you shopping?

00:50:33.425 --> 00:50:34.426
You want to fight me?

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.179
Judge Lee is taking
the Nammyeon District sinkhole case.

00:50:37.263 --> 00:50:39.431
Shouldn't your new beau
try to impress me, too?

00:50:39.515 --> 00:50:41.225
I could become his future sister-in-law.

00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:44.061
Who says you'll become his sister-in-law?

00:50:44.145 --> 00:50:45.354
Is it so hard

00:50:45.437 --> 00:50:47.606
to tell him
that Haenal is representing this case?

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:49.441
He's on the case. Why wouldn't he know?

00:50:49.525 --> 00:50:52.653
Still, it's different when you tell him.

00:50:54.488 --> 00:50:55.614
I'll give you

00:50:56.699 --> 00:50:57.825
my D. Mario purse.

00:50:58.617 --> 00:51:01.203
It's a limited edition.
You can't buy it with money alone.

00:51:02.454 --> 00:51:03.455
I don't know.

00:51:03.956 --> 00:51:05.249
Let me think about it.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.255
Hey!

00:51:12.298 --> 00:51:13.299
My gosh.

00:51:13.591 --> 00:51:15.426
You've been real busy

00:51:15.509 --> 00:51:16.886
since moving to Seoul, huh?

00:51:17.386 --> 00:51:19.972
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:51:23.475 --> 00:51:25.394
You seem full of worries.

00:51:25.477 --> 00:51:26.645
And who's causing them all?

00:51:26.729 --> 00:51:29.481
I told you to stop arguing with your wife.
Let her win.

00:51:29.565 --> 00:51:31.734
Why keep arguing when you can't even win?

00:51:31.817 --> 00:51:34.486
Just go with whatever keeps the peace,
okay?

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:37.364
I'm not losing. I'm letting her win.

00:51:39.366 --> 00:51:40.409
See you tomorrow, then.

00:51:42.328 --> 00:51:44.121
Seriously.

00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:45.372
Huh?

00:51:45.581 --> 00:51:46.707
What a coincidence.

00:51:47.917 --> 00:51:49.501
What brings you here?

00:51:50.169 --> 00:51:52.129
You don't think I've come all the way

00:51:52.213 --> 00:51:53.297
to see you, right?

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.506
Oh!

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:56.383
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

00:51:56.467 --> 00:51:59.303
We said we'd meet next time, anyway.

00:51:59.386 --> 00:52:00.930
Yeah, see you next time, then.

00:52:01.931 --> 00:52:03.307
When next time?

00:52:03.849 --> 00:52:05.351
When's that next time?

00:52:06.143 --> 00:52:08.103
Why are you always in such a rush?

00:52:08.395 --> 00:52:09.438
Are you busy tonight?

00:52:09.521 --> 00:52:11.523
If you are, change your plans.

00:52:11.607 --> 00:52:12.983
Have dinner with me instead.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:14.526
Let's go. It's on me.

00:52:17.196 --> 00:52:18.405
Mr. Lee!

00:52:19.698 --> 00:52:21.825
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic on the way.

00:52:22.076 --> 00:52:23.911
Oh, it's dinnertime.

00:52:23.994 --> 00:52:26.747
I'm starving. Can we talk over dinner?

00:52:29.833 --> 00:52:32.836
Excuse me, I got here first.

00:52:33.712 --> 00:52:36.548
Oh, did you have dinner plans already?

00:52:36.632 --> 00:52:37.633
No.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:44.014
I heard you were taking
Nammyeon District's case.

00:52:44.098 --> 00:52:46.600
Wow, you're definitely from Haenal.

00:52:46.684 --> 00:52:47.726
You're quick.

00:52:48.894 --> 00:52:50.437
Haenal Law Firm?

00:52:51.647 --> 00:52:53.774
We're defending Nammyeon District Office.

00:52:53.857 --> 00:52:55.859
Let's go. We should talk.

00:52:58.529 --> 00:52:59.530
Hold on.

00:53:00.406 --> 00:53:01.991
Get lost!

00:53:02.074 --> 00:53:03.742
Don't you guys have parents?

00:53:05.703 --> 00:53:07.246
Hey, this is precious.

00:53:07.329 --> 00:53:09.164
Don't forget to pick up every bill.

00:53:09.748 --> 00:53:10.916
Damn you!

00:53:11.208 --> 00:53:12.584
No, I don't have parents.

00:53:12.668 --> 00:53:15.170
And I didn't get married.
I didn't want kids like me.

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:19.591
Look at that.

00:53:19.967 --> 00:53:21.719
What a handsome kid.

00:53:21.802 --> 00:53:24.179
You know,
people kill their parents for money.

00:53:24.263 --> 00:53:25.723
But you don't need to worry now.

00:53:26.098 --> 00:53:28.350
Just think of your son's passing
as bad luck

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.601
and settle.

00:53:29.977 --> 00:53:31.603
How can you call yourself human?

00:53:31.687 --> 00:53:34.315
You need to apologize
for what you've done!

00:53:34.398 --> 00:53:35.607
Of course, I'm human.

00:53:35.691 --> 00:53:37.359
I have eyes, nose

00:53:37.818 --> 00:53:38.861
and lips.

00:53:39.403 --> 00:53:40.487
Wow

00:53:40.571 --> 00:53:42.281
your kid was smart, huh?

00:53:43.282 --> 00:53:46.243
You know, even with a college degree

00:53:46.327 --> 00:53:47.953
kids these days can't find a job.

00:53:48.037 --> 00:53:49.788
That's so burdensome for their parents

00:53:52.624 --> 00:53:54.001
so it's good that yours died.

00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:00.466
Shut up!

00:54:01.216 --> 00:54:02.426
Honey!

00:54:04.303 --> 00:54:05.637
What a joke.

00:54:06.805 --> 00:54:08.223
You're holding the knife wrong.

00:54:09.016 --> 00:54:10.351
Can you even stab me?

00:54:11.894 --> 00:54:12.895
Go ahead.

00:54:13.395 --> 00:54:14.396
Honey!

00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:16.482
Stab me.

00:54:18.567 --> 00:54:19.610
Go right ahead.

00:54:19.985 --> 00:54:20.986
Go ahead!

00:54:21.195 --> 00:54:22.279
Stab me!

00:54:22.363 --> 00:54:23.447
Get out!

00:54:37.795 --> 00:54:41.590
Are you really taking
the Nammyeon District trial?

00:54:41.673 --> 00:54:43.384
- Yeah.
- What?

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.306
Why is that such an easy decision for you?

00:54:50.057 --> 00:54:51.642
Can't believe I expected better from you!

00:54:52.559 --> 00:54:53.602
What's going on?

00:54:56.605 --> 00:54:58.315
You two are in bed together.

00:54:58.399 --> 00:55:00.651
It's over
when a judge joins hands with a law firm.

00:55:06.949 --> 00:55:07.991
Yes, hello?

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.536
Ms. Song, please help me.

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:11.995
Okay.

00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:13.705
I'll be right over.

00:55:17.876 --> 00:55:19.086
I thought you were better.

00:55:19.962 --> 00:55:21.797
Didn't you come to tell me something?

00:55:23.257 --> 00:55:24.466
You two...

00:55:27.219 --> 00:55:28.303
Forget it.

00:55:33.725 --> 00:55:35.310
Did your sister send you here?

00:55:36.812 --> 00:55:38.814
You must be quite interested in Haenal.

00:55:38.897 --> 00:55:40.691
Tell Ms. Yu that the talk went well.

00:55:40.774 --> 00:55:42.943
Does that mean you're teaming up with us?

00:55:43.026 --> 00:55:44.027
Nope.

00:55:44.111 --> 00:55:45.279
Come on.

00:55:45.362 --> 00:55:46.864
What's your plan, then?

00:55:46.947 --> 00:55:48.031
The trial will lead

00:55:48.115 --> 00:55:50.242
to Mayor Chu and Assemblyman Kang

00:55:50.325 --> 00:55:51.326
to be arrested.

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:54.037
So, tell your sister what I just said

00:55:54.413 --> 00:55:55.581
and stay out of this.

00:55:58.125 --> 00:55:59.543
Stay out...

00:56:02.379 --> 00:56:05.591
What was that?
Why is he talking like we're friends?

00:56:09.678 --> 00:56:10.679
Whatever.

00:56:12.014 --> 00:56:13.432
I did my part and told him.

00:56:15.809 --> 00:56:18.437
ATTORNEY YU HA-NA

00:56:22.816 --> 00:56:24.526
I told Judge Lee about the case.

00:56:28.155 --> 00:56:29.281
Okay.

00:56:31.492 --> 00:56:32.659
Ms. Song!

00:56:33.952 --> 00:56:35.454
Where are you going?

00:56:35.537 --> 00:56:37.206
I'm visiting the house of the parents

00:56:37.289 --> 00:56:39.082
who lost their son to the sinkhole.

00:56:39.166 --> 00:56:42.044
The District Mayor is now threatening them
for a settlement.

00:56:42.127 --> 00:56:44.338
How much have you looked into Mayor Chu?

00:56:44.421 --> 00:56:45.881
A whole lot.

00:56:45.964 --> 00:56:49.468
Up to how corrupt he is, making deals
with a bogus construction company.

00:56:50.469 --> 00:56:51.637
But that's not all.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.056
Mayor Chu is associated with a gang.

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:57.392
- What?
- Be careful.

00:57:00.187 --> 00:57:01.772
Mind your own business.

00:57:10.364 --> 00:57:11.782
Seriously, be careful.

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:16.828
Whatever.

00:57:24.419 --> 00:57:26.463
I remember a reporter getting beaten

00:57:26.547 --> 00:57:28.173
when she visited a bereaved family.

00:57:30.926 --> 00:57:33.929
Should I have stopped her from going?

00:57:34.555 --> 00:57:36.974
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:57:37.057 --> 00:57:39.685
Why is he calling?
He's on Haenal's side, anyway.

00:57:43.272 --> 00:57:45.482
The call cannot be completed.
You will be taken...

00:57:45.649 --> 00:57:47.109
CALL HISTORY

00:57:47.192 --> 00:57:48.735
STONE JEONG-HO

00:57:54.866 --> 00:57:55.993
Let's get it started.

00:57:57.327 --> 00:57:59.371
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:57:59.454 --> 00:58:01.081
Get them to sign
the agreement before I arrive.

00:58:01.164 --> 00:58:02.791
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

00:58:04.585 --> 00:58:07.879
Let's settle on your son's case

00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:09.464
and my torn forehead at once.

00:58:10.924 --> 00:58:11.925
Hey

00:58:13.176 --> 00:58:15.637
you've never been in jail, have you?
It's tough in there.

00:58:16.805 --> 00:58:17.806
Just hurry...

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:31.111
Who are you?

00:58:31.778 --> 00:58:32.904
That's dangerous.

00:58:34.615 --> 00:58:37.200
Me? The hand of justice!

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.581
Goodnight.

00:58:45.042 --> 00:58:46.126
Hello.

00:58:53.592 --> 00:58:56.720
Excuse me.

00:58:56.803 --> 00:58:57.804
Oh, hello.

00:58:57.888 --> 00:58:59.389
Hello.

00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:02.392
Is Mr. Heo Dong-gi here?

00:59:03.143 --> 00:59:04.353
Oh

00:59:04.436 --> 00:59:07.397
he had to go somewhere.

00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:15.238
What happened here?

00:59:15.322 --> 00:59:16.865
It's nothing.

01:01:25.827 --> 01:01:26.828
Stop right there!

01:01:26.912 --> 01:01:28.914
Hey! Stop!

01:01:35.003 --> 01:01:36.379
Stop!

01:01:40.258 --> 01:01:41.343
No!

01:02:02.322 --> 01:02:03.323
Goodbye.

01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:49.536
I'm the District Mayor
of the Nammyeon District!

01:02:50.412 --> 01:02:53.790
There seems to be a misunderstanding!

01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:55.792
Just spare my life

01:02:55.876 --> 01:02:59.296
and I'll become a new man...

01:03:00.338 --> 01:03:01.965
Please don't kill me.

01:03:06.803 --> 01:03:07.929
Please!

01:03:17.105 --> 01:03:18.732
HAN-YOUNG

01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:20.650
When someone dies in an accident

01:03:21.526 --> 01:03:24.029
someone must take accountability
and apologize.

01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:25.739
My son isn't dirt

01:03:26.656 --> 01:03:29.200
rolling around on the ground.

01:03:30.035 --> 01:03:31.077
Whatever you choose

01:03:31.161 --> 01:03:33.997
you won't need to be responsible
for anything, Mr. Heo.

01:03:37.876 --> 01:03:39.085
Do you see me waving?

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.380
Oh, there you are. I'll be right over.

01:03:42.464 --> 01:03:43.673
Okay!

01:03:51.139 --> 01:03:53.141
I want him to die.

01:03:55.518 --> 01:03:56.686
What did you say?

01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:59.022
I can't hear you. Louder!

01:03:59.689 --> 01:04:00.857
I want him

01:04:02.275 --> 01:04:04.110
to die.

01:04:05.403 --> 01:04:06.738
Kill him.

01:04:07.405 --> 01:04:08.782
Kill him!

01:04:10.909 --> 01:04:12.160
I can finally hear you.

01:04:30.261 --> 01:04:31.346
No!

01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:36.518
Help!

01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:49.948
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:52.993
the court hereby sentences you to death.

01:05:05.463 --> 01:05:08.508
No!

01:05:10.885 --> 01:05:14.472
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:05:38.663 --> 01:05:41.750
Still no movement
from Prosecutor General Eom.

01:05:41.916 --> 01:05:43.835
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a
from the Central District Office.

01:05:43.918 --> 01:05:45.295
She won't hesitate.

01:05:45.378 --> 01:05:47.297
Judge Lee requested
the prosecution to investigate.

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.631
We've met before.

01:05:48.715 --> 01:05:50.133
This isn't a coincidence, is it?

01:05:50.216 --> 01:05:51.926
It's Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:53.970
who helped catch
a serial killer with Judge Lee.

01:05:54.054 --> 01:05:56.806
Contact Kang Jeong-tae to cut off
all ties with Chu Yong-jin.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.058
And erase all traces.

01:05:58.141 --> 01:06:00.268
What are you going to do
with Judge Lee Han-young?

01:06:00.393 --> 01:06:02.312
You've lived
in a redevelopment zone, right?

01:06:02.479 --> 01:06:04.689
There could have been an accident.

01:06:04.773 --> 01:06:06.691
Kang Sin-jin knows about what happened.

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:12.072
