WEBVTT

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.400
President Li

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.299
It's President Li

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.580
You're new here

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.099
and don't know your way around

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.520
What?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.219
Did you get lost?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.099
I'm looking for...

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.580
Liu...

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.860
Stroll...

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.439
Just strolling around

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.939
Just strolling around, right?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.500
Alright

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.219
I'll head to the rec room then

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.840
Teacher Liu and the others are playing cards there

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.979
Please, go ahead

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.580
What did you say?

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:26.740
Wait a minute

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.460
I'll also...

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.699
Grandpa

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.259
Grandpa

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.419
Who's a grandpa?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.379
Am I a grandpa?

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.740
Then you're our grandpa

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.180
Um

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.219
Excuse me, how do we get to the Director's office?

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:39.620
What do you do?

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.620
We're seniors in the Sociology Department

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.180
Grandpa

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.620
We're here to do field research

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.479
Field?

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.860
You think this is the countryside?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.699
No

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.340
It's a social survey

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.300
An internship

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.699
Volunteering

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:55.180
Right

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.740
Grandpa

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.460
I'm the team leader

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.259
My name is Ji Yusheng

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:58.099
Our captain

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.900
My surname is Li

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:00.300
My name is Li Jianguo

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:01.620
Call me President Li

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.340
From now on

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:03.960
Stop calling me grandpa all the time

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.379
Hello, President Li

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.180
Personally, I think

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.620
Young people should do more social surveys

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.979
Don't just get lost in book knowledge

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:15.740
Our country has entered an aging society

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.460
The issue of caring for the elderly's needs

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.460
is especially important

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.659
He's a leader here, right?

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.379
Definitely

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.300
Listen to that tone

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.340
At least a Director

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:25.460
I think

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.819
Our university president doesn't speak this well

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.020
Could be a Minister

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.560
A leader sent down to give guidance

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.300
President Li

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.219
Where exactly is the administration office?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.259
Good question

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.379
Where is it?

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.699
Aren't you...

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:38.219
No...

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.699
Aren't you the Director?

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:41.080
Who said I was the Director?

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.719
But the Director here used to work under me

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.860
So he's not the Director

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.939
Your work is very meaningful

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.539
I personally express my full support

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:49.259
President Li

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.300
Look at that door with people going in and out

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.259
Is that the rec room you're looking for?

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:55.500
Where?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.120
There

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.020
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.520
Should we go there too?

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.180
Grandpa

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.900
No, President Li

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.860
If you buy, buy the kind that only makes a profit

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.819
Where can you find stocks like that?

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.900
Trading stocks is dangerous

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.099
That's called risk

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:15.300
That livestream channel

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.060
said the mango farm was hit by a disaster.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.579
Oh my, so I placed an order right away.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.660
I just bought them.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.060
But when they arrived and I looked,

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:26.339
you saw it yourself.

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:28.060
They were this tiny.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.459
I thought they were dates.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.540
Later, I checked online.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:33.660
Not at all.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.939
There was no disaster at the mango farm.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.019
Nowhere in the whole country.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.180
Isn't that just tricking a big fool like me?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.379
Teacher Liu, you're not a fool.

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:41.939
You are just kind-hearted.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:44.180
Professor Fan, you're right about that.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.379
Our Teacher Liu is especially kind.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.339
Never mind people,

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:49.540
usually even an ant,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.300
she wouldn't

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.459
bear to step on.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.579
I live with her in "fratricidal strife."

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:55.779
That's not exactly accurate,

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.100
but that's the idea anyway.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.980
You just arrived, so you don't know her well.

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.860
He doesn't know, but I do.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.379
I grew up watching the movies starring Teacher Liu.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.019
That color feature film,

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.180
"Flowers of the Motherland".

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:08.180
It left such a deep impression.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.019
I wouldn't say I starred in it.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:12.060
I just had a cameo appearance.

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:13.300
For our generation,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.939
is there anyone who hasn't seen this movie?

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:16.779
Is there anyone not deeply impressed by it?

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:17.660
No one.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.040
I can even recite the lines from memory.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.920
Teacher Liu portrayed the character Honghong's

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.100
innocence and cuteness

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.339
most vividly and thoroughly.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.420
You really are a great professor.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.779
You speak so eloquently.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.819
This isn't just an ordinary fan.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:32.420
This is

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.500
a die-hard fan.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.459
How does that saying go?

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.459
"Fate brings people together from a thousand miles away."

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:40.259
I am also...

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:42.860
"Without fate, one can be opposite and not know each other."

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:45.819
This is just wonderful.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.139
An old professor,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.300
who is a master of calculation.

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.459
A great artist,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.779
who is good at singing and dancing.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.040
A perfect match!

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.819
If these two good people come together...

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.259
I say, this auntie here.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.459
Who are you calling auntie?

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.060
I'm younger than you.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.060
You should call me Xiao Cai.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.699
Auntie Xiao Cai.

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:04.399
I need to have a talk with you.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.259
When a leader wants to talk, it's never good news.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.980
It is good news.

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:10.199
There are too many people here.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:11.660
Let's find somewhere quiet.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:14.720
Come on

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.860
I'll play a round with you

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.800
Alright

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:18.319
Director Chang

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.860
We...

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.040
Could you please...

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.060
address me by my academic degree

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.220
and not by my job title?

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:25.379
Doctor

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.819
Director

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:28.560
We have a few questions for you

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:29.160
Ask away

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.019
In this retirement community of ours...

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:32.759
how many seniors have been admitted in total?

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.300
What is the current occupancy rate of Yangliu Xincheng...

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.060
roughly? And how did they find out about this place?

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.019
Recommendations from friends

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:38.620
Saw advertisements

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.139
Right

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:39.459
All of the above

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:40.620
Did they come voluntarily

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.420
or did their children send them here?

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.019
First of all, we...

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:43.819
How much are the fees?

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:45.620
Do the seniors pay themselves or do their children pay?

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.800
What happens if they run out of money while living here?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.759
I also have...

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:49.819
Hold it

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:52.660
Students, ask your questions one by one

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.420
Here, let me ask you first

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:56.180
Why did you young people...

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.740
think of coming to a retirement community

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.819
to take care of the elderly?

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:02.660
We are sociology majors

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.379
We wanted to use the last semester of university

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:05.279
to do volunteer work

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.180
and understand the elderly and their needs

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.660
The topic of my graduation thesis

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.740
is exploring the psychological issues of the elderly

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.220
I was raised by my grandmother

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.420
so I have affection for the elderly

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.500
My goal in coming to this place is to...

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.779
work more and eat less

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:18.939
I'll definitely lose weight

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.100
I am...

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.860
That's enough

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.100
Students, I think I know enough

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.819
How about this

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.899
I will organize a small symposium

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:27.259
and invite a few seniors over

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:27.939
Whatever questions you have

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:28.779
you can chat with them personally

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:29.339
Is that okay?

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:30.100
Good, sure

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:31.300
Alright then, follow me

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.060
Can I ask you a few more questions?

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:36.819
I'm currently... I...

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.339
What are you doing? Pulling and tugging in broad daylight

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:42.339
It looks bad if people see us

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.899
I say, Ma'am...

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.220
Little Cai

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.980
Cai...

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.300
Little Cai

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.579
I am a straightforward person

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.540
I don't beat around the bush

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:57.660
I'll just tell you the truth

00:07:59.019 --> 00:07:59.819
Do you know...

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:02.639
what my real purpose for coming to Yangliu Xincheng...

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:03.620
is?

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.379
How would I know that?

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.060
What is it?

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:09.459
It's...

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:11.100
Liu...

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.019
To stay

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.639
Wait, haven't you already stayed?

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.740
You're used to living here, right?

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.560
No, who said anything about staying?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.459
If you're not staying

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:18.339
are you thinking of leaving again?

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:19.660
Oh my, President Li

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.019
I have to remind you

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:22.339
Seniors shouldn't act like this

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:23.579
One moment thinking one thing

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:24.459
the next moment another idea

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:24.779
No...

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:26.620
Who's changing their mind all the time?

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.100
Who said I was leaving?

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.579
Didn't you just say that?

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.980
With you blocking my words like this

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.620
I really don't know what to say

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.340
This...

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.740
To make a long story short...

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:39.500
My wife...

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.059
passed away over five years ago.

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:43.519
I live alone now.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.659
It's not that I can't manage.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.740
It just feels a bit off.

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:50.940
I just want to find someone...

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.419
of a similar age,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.460
with similar interests,

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:56.919
a like-minded female comrade.

00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:58.700
To walk the rest of life's path together.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.299
Say no more.

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:01.899
You're making me blush.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.639
What's there to be shy about?

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.279
You...

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:07.220
Since you've put it that way...

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.259
well, President Li...

00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:09.460
I'll also briefly...

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.039
introduce my situation.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.860
My name is Cai Xiaoying.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.620
I'm sixty-four this year.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.080
My husband...

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:17.440
passed away early.

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:19.860
I raised a son named Chen Dabao.

00:09:20.299 --> 00:09:22.539
He married a wife, a little vixen.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.779
Hu Xiaoli.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.899
I...

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.659
He listens to that vixen for everything.

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:29.860
She's got him bewitched.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.740
My son...

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.879
My grandson is good.

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:33.100
Doudou.

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:34.659
He's not like his mom.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.580
He's like our Chen family.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:35.980
Stop.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.259
We...

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:36.940
Stop.

00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:40.320
Why are you telling me all this mess?

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.379
Is there any point?

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.740
Is all this...

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.419
important?

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.220
Of course it's important!

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.220
No...

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.980
this is a major life event.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.220
Shouldn't the two of us be cautious?

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.259
The two of us?

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:55.740
Wait, what does this have to do with you?

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.159
You just said it and now you deny it?

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:58.600
This...

00:09:58.879 --> 00:09:59.940
Really, this...

00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:02.139
What did I say?

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:02.980
You said...

00:10:03.259 --> 00:10:03.980
what...

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.340
similar age,

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.539
similar interests,

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.100
like-minded and all that.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.700
I wasn't talking about you!

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.679
I was talking about...

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.500
Ms. Liu.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.620
Ms. Liu?

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:15.379
Keep it down.

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:16.700
You're interested in Ms. Liu?

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.460
Yes.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.259
That's not really suitable, is it?

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.860
That new Professor Fan...

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.700
seems to have a thing with Ms. Liu...

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:25.220
Not suitable.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:26.600
They're the ones who aren't suitable!

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:28.580
They aren't suitable?

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:30.220
Then who is?

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:31.460
You mean...

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:33.580
you and Ms. Liu are suitable?

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.419
Exactly.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:35.940
You can see it, right?

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:38.179
Just imagine...

00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:40.019
Ms. Liu and I...

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.059
walking arm in arm down the street.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.899
Enough.

00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:45.659
I can't imagine it.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.419
It doesn't matter if you can't.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.980
Just help introduce us.

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:53.659
You mean...

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:54.820
you want me...

00:10:55.299 --> 00:10:56.340
to be the matchmaker?

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.259
To play Cupid? Do some matchmaking?

00:10:58.379 --> 00:10:59.240
What do you think?

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:02.519
Isn't this right up my alley?

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.100
It's an act of charity

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.379
Leave it to me

00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:09.340
Just wait and see

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.980
Good

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:13.100
I'm going now

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:14.919
Speaking of me

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.120
why I came to this retirement community

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:18.440
I must

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.639
start with a student of mine

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:21.679
As for me

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.580
having taught for so many years

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:25.879
the one who truly inherited my mantle

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.740
is this one disciple

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.980
Is this disciple of yours male or female

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:31.700
Of course it's a male

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:33.919
I thought it was a teacher-student romance

00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:35.620
I didn't catch that

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.399
What does this have to do with him coming here

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.779
Professor Fan

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:40.539
Well, students

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.980
mainly want to know

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.460
why you came to Yangliu Xincheng

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:45.500
Right

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.860
Don't rush

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.139
Don't rush me

00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:49.259
I'm getting to the main point

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:51.700
If you ask why I came here

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.779
I have to mention my daughter

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.840
You all know my daughter, right

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.539
No

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.639
Who is she

00:11:58.659 --> 00:11:59.940
She's very famous

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.419
You definitely know her

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:02.259
Right, Little Cai

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:03.340
You tell them

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.399
Guo Jingjing

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.460
I know Guo Jingjing

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.419
The diving queen

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:09.120
So you are Guo Jingjing's father

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.019
What? What Guo Jingjing

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:12.299
Bai Jingjing

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.419
Bai Jingjing

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.620
A star in film, TV, and music

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.700
She's acted in many movies

00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:19.980
That recent reality show

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:22.620
where they lock a few women in a room to tear each other apart

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.279
That one

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:25.620
I remember now, I remember

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.940
Bai Jingjing, right

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:28.179
In that show

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:29.139
she kept saying

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:30.820
that she thanks her mother

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.019
for raising her through all the hardships

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.899
Yes

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.860
She didn't thank her dad at all

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:38.860
That's because I didn't let her mention me

00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:39.960
Keep a low profile

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.240
This student of mine

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.600
after following me for so many years

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:47.620
can basically stand on his own now

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.480
Therefore

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.600
I had the idea to step back

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.860
and enjoy my golden years

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.580
She also said in the show

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.059
that in her early years

00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:58.899
she grew up in a single-parent family

00:12:58.899 --> 00:12:59.980
Her dad, very early on

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.940
abandoned her and her mom

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.460
Why do you have so much gossip

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.259
As for me

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:05.500
I've never been married

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.860
I have no children

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.059
Didn't I just accidentally

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:09.779
divorce her mother

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:10.500
Understood

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.820
My dad is the same as you

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.500
However

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.740
there is a difference between you two

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.559
My dad

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.820
cheated during marriage

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.620
As if anyone isn't 'in a marriage'

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.139
No, I mean when we were young

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:21.480
who hasn't made mistakes

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:23.620
And so, I came here

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:25.340
This student of mine

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:27.799
Professor Fan

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:29.159
Thank you very much for sharing

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:29.779
Thank you

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:31.259
My... uh...

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.779
Uh, Teacher Liu

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.500
Why don't you tell us your story

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.580
I'll tell you

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.179
My name is Liu Minzhi.

00:13:41.179 --> 00:13:43.820
Why did I come to our retirement community?

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.500
I have to start with my personality...

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.620
No.

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:49.580
I have to start with my profession...

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.379
I have to start with my age.

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:50.399
My profession...

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.320
Profession.

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:52.519
Profession.

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.320
With your elegance,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.759
one can tell you're no ordinary person.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.600
You are very, very beautiful.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.059
Just like a movie star.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:03.080
You guessed right.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.279
She *is* a movie star.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:08.039
Not really a star anymore.

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:08.940
I'm just an ordinary performer.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.759
I'm just an ordinary performer.

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:12.840
Serving the grassroots audience.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:14.279
You're being modest.

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:16.120
Back in the day, Ms. Liu...

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.840
was much more popular than today's viral stars.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.360
She was truly a household name.

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:21.559
Back then,

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:24.360
I even wrote fan letters to Ms. Liu.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.879
There were fans back then?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.720
Not just ordinary fandom.

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:31.120
As you young people say,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.919
a die-hard fan.

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.279
Not really.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.659
You're exaggerating.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.399
I'm not exaggerating.

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:37.679
Professor Fan.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.840
Wait, why are you winking?

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:42.340
You're making me embarrassed.

00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:47.100
As for my family,

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:49.200
it was ruined by that little vixen.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.419
Vixen?

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:51.960
Is that the farmed kind?

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.799
My family raises chickens professionally.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.059
She's talking about her daughter-in-law.

00:14:58.379 --> 00:14:59.500
But then again,

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:01.779
if my son hadn't been so disappointing,

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:02.820
it wouldn't have come to this.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.820
So, boys,

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.580
just because she looks like a vixen...

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.259
you can't walk straight when you see a pretty girl.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.960
Inner beauty is most important.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.700
Understand?

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.539
I think outer beauty is more important.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.539
Out of all these kids,

00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:19.340
I'm telling you, you don't seem reliable.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.419
You...

00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:22.779
sooner or later you'll find a vixen like my son did.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.620
Really?

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.659
That's too...

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.100
I'm so scared.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.580
Where did you find that vixen for your family?

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.419
What do you mean, where?

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.700
I introduced her myself!

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:38.379
Speaking of my old profession...

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.980
What is your old profession?

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.740
You couldn't tell?

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.620
Accumulating virtue and doing good deeds.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.779
Matchmaking.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.539
Does the matchmaking industry still exist?

00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:48.419
Of course.

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:49.659
There's a demand.

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:52.799
I won't say who it is,

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.139
but he's far away in the sky...

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:55.139
yet right before your eyes.

00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:00.259
Yes, it's me.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.340
In my life,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.299
I never hide my personal views.

00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:05.980
Let me tell you,

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.000
the reason I came to Yangliu Xincheng Retirement Community...

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.940
my main purpose...

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.259
is to pursue love.

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.519
What I mean is...

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:19.840
President Li is really a catch.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.399
He doesn't drink, gamble, or womanize.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.600
He's completely honest and trustworthy.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.840
Men like that these days...

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.860
are hard to come by.

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:32.000
Why does that sound so familiar?

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.639
Oh right, I remember.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:35.200
Last time you praised Professor Fan,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.720
you used the exact same words.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.440
Did I?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.559
I guess I need some new lines.

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:40.559
That Fan...

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:43.799
Professor Fan is a decent guy.

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.759
But he's an intellectual.

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:48.039
He's too calculating and shrewd.

00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:49.919
He can't compare to President Li.

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:52.919
President Li is clearly honest and kind.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.259
If it were up to me...

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:55.720
I get it now.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.879
You want to get together with him yourself.

00:16:57.879 --> 00:16:58.480
Yes.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.200
What?

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.259
No! What do you mean "yes"?

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.399
Even if I were interested,

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:04.000
he wouldn't be interested in me.

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:04.720
He's interested in...

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.759
Fine, whatever.

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:07.599
I'd better hurry to the singing class.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.500
I've got to go.

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:09.559
See you later.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.759
Don't just say "whatever."

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.920
The one he's interested in is you!

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.519
No, I... I didn't mean...

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:18.819
I'm going to singing class!

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.880
*Our lives are full of sunshine*

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:38.980
*Full of sunshine*

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.900
Good.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.640
That was excellent.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.759
That's all for today's class.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.160
If you have any questions,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.279
feel free to ask me afterwards.

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:47.940
Class dismissed.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.740
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.279
You're welcome, you're welcome.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:51.279
Teacher Liu.

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:52.599
I have a question.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.160
Regarding the vocalization...

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.279
especially the breathing.

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.599
I still can't quite get the feel of it.

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:58.279
Professor Fan, you...

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.400
You're doing great.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.640
Singing really requires breath support.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.039
Otherwise, you can't hit the high notes.

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:04.640
Look here.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.079
Follow my breathing while you sing.

00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:07.039
Like this.

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:08.059
*Ahem*

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:09.059
Stand straight.

00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:10.799
Look at Yusheng and Yingzi.

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:12.519
Seems like there's a spark there.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.420
You think so?

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.099
Aunt Cai,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.359
Yingzi is going abroad to study.

00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:19.440
How could things work out with Yusheng?

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.380
As long as there's chemistry,

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.359
anything is possible.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.319
With my sharp eyes,

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:29.200
I never miss a thing.

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:31.000
Aunt Cai, stop gossiping.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.839
Look at the match right in front of you.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.000
Just align your placement and breath for now.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.200
What do you think you're doing?

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:37.319
Nothing.

00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:39.059
Still wailing like monkeys on the riverbank?

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.759
Don't you know men and women shouldn't touch?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.759
Old Li,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.759
what are you doing?

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:47.880
I'm asking Teacher Liu for advice

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.839
on vocalization techniques

00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:50.759
and breath control.

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:51.920
You're tone-deaf.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.079
Lessons won't help you.

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:54.759
It's precisely because I'm tone-deaf

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:56.440
that I'm practicing vocalization!

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.480
Tone-deaf means

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.240
you have zero artistic talent.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.759
Don't think I don't know.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.400
You have ulterior motives.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.359
Don't judge a gentleman's heart

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:06.160
with your own petty mind.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.599
My petty mind?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.740
You were hugging Teacher Liu's belly!

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:11.519
It was strictly professional!

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:13.240
I am announcing right now:

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.640
I am pursuing...

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:17.440
Teacher Liu!

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:21.079
Anyway

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:22.759
I declare right now

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.920
I am pursuing Ms. Liu

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.279
Do you dare?

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:27.839
Don't you goad me

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.980
Why wouldn't I dare?

00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:30.799
I'm a single old bachelor

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.160
Even if you were an "Old Six," it wouldn't work

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:34.519
Stay away from Ms. Liu from now on

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.119
On what grounds?

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:38.079
Ms. Liu isn't yours

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:39.240
Is it any of your business?

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.740
It is

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:40.819
It is

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.480
It is

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.299
You can't control it

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:43.599
Can't control it

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.119
Gentlemen

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:45.759
What's going on here?

00:19:45.759 --> 00:19:47.160
Why are you fighting?

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:48.720
Kids, kids, don't you fight

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.319
I get scared when I see blood

00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:52.359
We aren't fighting

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.119
If we got physical

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.359
He wouldn't be my match

00:19:54.759 --> 00:19:55.880
Right, a gentleman

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.720
Uses his words, not his fists

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.359
Of course, he's no gentleman either

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.440
Let's not be at each other's throats, okay?

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:03.440
Regarding this matter

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.519
Neither of you has the final say

00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:06.119
All in all

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:07.799
It's up to Ms. Liu to decide

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:08.640
Rest assured

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.640
Ms. Liu will definitely choose me

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.839
Rest assured, Ms. Liu will certainly fancy me

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:13.240
Look

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.720
Let's do this

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.079
Tonight

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.359
On a dark and windy night

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.319
I'll help you ask Ms. Liu out

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:24.319
For a three-way confrontation

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.039
Face to face, gongs and drums

00:20:27.079 --> 00:20:29.079
Clear things up completely

00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:31.559
Whoever Ms. Liu chooses in the end

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:32.880
The other person

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.000
Must accept the loss gracefully

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:35.200
No more pestering

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:35.880
Do you agree?

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.519
Good

00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:37.319
No problem

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:49.640
Ms. Liu

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:51.220
Here's the situation

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.079
Ms. Liu, listen to me first

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:53.920
Why should she listen to you?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.880
You two

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.839
Both of you stop talking for a moment

00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.960
What you want to say

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.400
Xiao Cai has already told me

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.880
The reason I came over

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.279
Is because I also feel

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.440
I should, in front of you both

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.700
Give you a clear answer

00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:17.579
There's already a clear answer?

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:19.660
Shouldn't you consider it carefully?

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:23.720
Wait a moment

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.099
You're making me really nervous

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.680
I forgot to bring my nitroglycerin

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.660
First of all

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:32.880
To be able to receive

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:34.700
The deep affection of you two big brothers

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.519
I feel extremely honored

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.420
For someone like me, Liu

00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:42.039
My youth has passed

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:43.119
My prime is gone

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:47.039
How can I be worthy of such an honor?

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:53.079
However

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.799
How am I to choose?

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.420
Just like

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.200
Back when we were young

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.880
In the "200 Foreign Folk Songs"

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.720
As sung in the song "The Hawthorn Tree"

00:22:16.819 --> 00:22:20.900
The stars in the summer night

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.819
Keep watching the two of them

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.039
It's a bit high

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.680
But they won't tell me clearly

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.160
Which of the two is dearer

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:38.579
The bravest and the dearest

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.380
Which one is it really

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:46.920
My dear hawthorn tree

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.799
Which of the two is dearer

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:50.779
Teacher Liu

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.680
Please stop singing

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.279
Your high notes might attract wolves

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.599
We didn't come here to hear you sing

00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:55.559
I... Old Li

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.700
Watch your mouth

00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:58.119
Teacher Liu's singing...

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:00.500
It's probably best not to sing

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.200
Two big brothers

00:23:07.019 --> 00:23:07.839
Right... no

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.279
Two little brothers

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.640
You are both my mentors and friends

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:17.119
We have a long future ahead

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:20.099
There's plenty of time to get to know each other

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.799
I think that

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.599
We should cherish this friendship

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.299
Respect and love each other

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:28.480
And share our golden years together

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.119
Do you think I'm right?

00:23:44.599 --> 00:23:45.240
Brilliant

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:46.839
Brilliant

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.400
Truly brilliant

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.279
What Teacher Liu means is

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.859
You both understand now, right?

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:53.759
Understood

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.279
She didn't choose him

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:56.279
And she didn't choose you either

00:23:56.279 --> 00:23:57.119
I have a chance

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:58.440
My chance is bigger than yours

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.339
Definitely not as big as mine

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.599
Fine

00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:07.160
I misjudged this

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.579
Yusheng, Yingzi

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:11.940
Let me have a chat with you two
