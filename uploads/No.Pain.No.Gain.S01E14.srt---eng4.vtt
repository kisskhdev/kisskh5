00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
=Episode 14=
(This story is purely fictional.)

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.390
You wanted to see me, Mr. Zhou?

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.910
Come in.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.950
I read the Returning to Shore
research report.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.860
Very thorough.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.860
The headquarters isn't happy
with Bullet Mark.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.110
This new project

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.180
needs to show progress fast.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.270
I'm sure you know

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.180
what to do.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.700
You mean

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.020
reskin Returning to Shore?

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.900
That's your word,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.300
not mine.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.102
We previously drew on

00:02:35.213 --> 00:02:36.990
successful overseas games.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.270
But going straight after Tengda,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.460
isn't that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.140
a bit risky?

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.110
Learn the essence.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.740
Adapt it creatively.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.740
Understood.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.300
Mr. Zhou,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.700
something interesting.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.950
We asked a headhunting firm

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.420
to find experienced planners.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.510
They found one.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.180
But you'll never guess

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.670
who they recommended.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140
Pei Qian.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.390
What?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.460
Same name?

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.020
No.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.110
It's Pei Qian from Tengda.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.830
The headhunter

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.670
probably didn't know who he really is.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.950
He thought he was just
an ex-employee from Tengda

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.740
and contacted him.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.350
I was wondering,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.180
could Pei Qian have bribed them

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.670
and is putting on a show for us?

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.390
What would he gain from that?

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.990
Are you sure about this?

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.300
Maybe he's here

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:33.070
to talk about cooperation with Sky Fire.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.140
No.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.550
I checked.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.860
He's here to apply for the job.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.350
To be honest,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.620
I also find this strange.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.350
But whatever his motive is,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.020
he must be up to no good.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.070
I'll kick him out.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.620
Wait.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.140
I didn't tell you to brew tea.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.620
Go with the flow.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.070
Let him come.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.180
Go with the flow.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.300
Use the situation.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.860
Give him a few days' probation

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.180
and see what he's

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.910
really up to.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.620
Also,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.420
we might even learn
some of Tengda's secrets.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.500
Brilliant!

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.740
That's wise, Mr. Zhou.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.790
I'll arrange it right away.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.710
All he knows is brewing tea.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.380
(Special Assistant's Office)

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.740
Ms. Xin.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.380
How long have you been here?

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.380
Just arrived.

00:04:53.413 --> 00:04:55.060
He's been standing there
for five minutes.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.110
Put your hand down, please.

00:04:58.235 --> 00:04:59.940
Have you seen Mr. Pei
these past two days?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.740
He hasn't been at the office,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.740
hasn't gone home,

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.300
and doesn't reply to messages.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.620
He called me two days ago

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.030
to borrow money.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.740
Come on.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.260
Where did you hide him?

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.940
I can pay the ransom.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.620
Ms. Xin,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.110
I can really pay the ransom.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.380
Ms. Xin.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.860
Guys,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.740
Mr. Pei is out

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.150
handling a major project

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.620
and can't stay in touch.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.500
Continue your work as usual.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.500
He'll be back in a few days.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.060
Mr. Pei is indeed

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.550
mysterious.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.060
A major project, huh?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.670
Is he on vacation behind our backs?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.500
With him as my role model,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.110
I'll definitely do well.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.835
(The Divine Mountains and Seas
Project Proposal)

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.790
What major project?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.350
Why didn't he take me?

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.500
To think Mr. Pei actually comes here
to work.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.470
And you dressed

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.300
so casually.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.470
You must be kidding, Mr. Zhou.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.550
I'm not

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.860
Tengda's CEO anymore.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.990
I'm just a planner at Sky Fire.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.860
It's been a while.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.820
You're still such a joker, Mr. Pei.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.470
I'm not joking.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.420
I'm serious.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.860
Since you're so sincere...

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.550
Well,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.835
I'll take it seriously, Pei.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.300
Pei.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.710
Mr. Zhou,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.860
is your neck stiff or what?

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.030
Pour the tea.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.030
I'm so sorry, Mr. Zhou.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.550
I'm not familiar with these yet.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.420
But don't worry.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.150
I'll improve.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.820
You must think

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.230
I come to Sky Fire

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.180
with ulterior motives.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.990
No worries.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.230
I swear on my character.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.350
I'll never do anything

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.060
to harm Sky Fire.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.300
I really need the money.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.420
Pei.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.030
Your character is well known.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.420
Since you've decided to work here,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.030
I won't ask more.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.470
But Pei,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.740
now that you're at Sky Fire,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.110
you must follow company rules.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.060
During probation,

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.380
do your job well.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.030
Don't bring

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.350
Tengda's bad habits here.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.470
Okay, Pei?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.470
Say, Mr. Zhou.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.030
Could you please do me a favor?

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.860
Could you not tell others

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.180
that I'm working here?

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.180
Sure.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.740
Go get busy.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.860
Darn that Pei.

00:08:04.298 --> 00:08:07.578
(Planning Department)

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.300
Pei, this is the Planning Department.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:12.990
During probation,

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.860
you'll follow me

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.180
and work on game design.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.060
Ask me if you have questions.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.710
This is your desk.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.790
That's mine.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.860
Easier for communication.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.300
Easier for communication?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.030
More like easier to monitor me.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.350
Sky Fire and Mr. Zhou

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.020
value you highly.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.860
Your workstation

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.470
takes up more shared office space

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.190
than others.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.310
But that cost will be counted.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.310
Once you're a permanent employee,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.860
if the profit you create exceeds

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.540
your allocated office shared space,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.830
the company will reward you.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.540
I'm just here to work.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.835
What does the shared office space
have anything to do with me?

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.260
Sit.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.860
Let me introduce you

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.950
to our new colleague,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.710
Pei Qian.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.950
He's on probation.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.070
Please look out for him.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.540
Sky Fire isn't as loose

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.540
as Tengda.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.620
You don't need a cap in the office.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.710
Isn't that Mr. Pei from Tengda?

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.190
Yeah.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.430
Why is he working here?

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.070
No idea.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.380
What's going on?

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.924
Maybe just someone with the same name.

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:29.190
How could it be?

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.500
I've seen him

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.500
when he came here before.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.950
Stop chatting.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.070
Get back to work.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.540
Pei.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.620
Here.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.660
Your ID badge.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.310
And this

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.830
is the employee handbook.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.950
Read it.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.430
I'll assign work later.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.140
You're Mr. Pei from Tengda, right?

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.470
No.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.710
Just the same name.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.900
But last time

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.140
you visited here,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.380
I saw you.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.620
You're Mr. Pei.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.430
We should work together
and boost the game industry.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.140
Well said!

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.500
Mister,

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.020
how could I possibly be
Mr. Pei from Tengda?

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.350
If I were,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.990
would I be here as a planner?

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.140
Would Mr. Zhou allow that?

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.140
We just look similar.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.780
Also,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.830
you've been kneeling. Get up.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.540
When did I knell?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.860
Huang, ask Pei Qian to come over.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.900
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.900
Hello?

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.540
Is this Yu from the Planning Department?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.710
Mr. Zhou wants Pei Qian
to come to his office.

00:11:08.013 --> 00:11:10.620
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Zhou's secretary
says Pei Qian from our department

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.780
should see Mr. Zhou.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.830
Alright, noted.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.380
Hello?

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.140
Wei,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.260
where's Pei?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.457
Mr. Zhou is looking for him.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.710
Got it.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.380
I...

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.500
Mr. Pei, Mr. Zhao just called.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.190
Mr. Zhou wants to see you.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.780
Are you going?

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.190
What choice do I have?

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.710
One moment.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:32.830
Mr. Zhou,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.740
Pei can go now.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.540
Alright, noted.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.830
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.620
Yes, Yu.

00:11:40.724 --> 00:11:41.539
Pei is free now.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.260
Could you ask
if Mr. Zhou is available now?

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.660
Okay, I'll confirm.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.260
Mr. Zhou, Pei Qian can come over now.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.470
Is this a good time?

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.540
Yes, send him in.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.310
Okay.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.430
Mr. Zhou,

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.070
your company's efficiency is too low.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.070
I waited outside for five minutes.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.190
Pei,

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.470
write a report

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.830
and share your experience

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.070
making games at Tengda.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.470
No problem, Mr. Zhou.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.380
I've even thought of a title.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.470
Let's call it

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.380
"Strengths and Weaknesses
of Tengda Games".

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.990
Analyze every game

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.190
you worked on.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.900
Why it succeeded
and where it fell short.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.140
The more detailed, the better.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.190
When do you need it?

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.070
Tomorrow.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.020
We need to be more efficient, right?

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.500
Two minutes have passed.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.230
Strengths and Weaknesses
of Tengda Games, seriously?

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.230
Might as well call it
My Crime and Punishment.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.740
How to Deal with Sub-Health?

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.900
Compensation for Sudden Death.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.780
Wow, this computer
sure has a rich history.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.500
Before you took this seat,

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.860
I used to sit here.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.340
(Strengths and Weaknesses
of Tengda Games)

00:13:16.524 --> 00:13:17.470
Good morning, Mr. Zhou.

00:13:17.502 --> 00:13:18.380
Good morning, Mr. Zhao.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.660
Today I'll be presenting

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.013
on the history of Tengda Games.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.190
Wait.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.070
Where are your slides?

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.710
I didn't have time for that.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:29.900
Pei just joined.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.070
He's not used to Sky Fire's

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.350
strict and efficient style yet.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.070
We'll make an exception this time. Come.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.500
Let me see the report.

00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:49.900
Did you book the meeting room?

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:50.710
I...

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.780
I booked from 2 PM to 3 PM.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.500
Did you book it

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.620
through the OA system?

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.070
I... I did....

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.540
Just go.
Didn't you see Mr. Zhou is here?

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.660
Rebook it.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.430
Okay.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.710
Pei,

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.380
since the slides aren't ready,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.380
the report

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.500
should be at least 50,000 words, right?

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.310
Fifty thousand?

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.930
The NCEE essay
is even shorter than this.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.620
Forget it.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:15.950
I have another meeting soon.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:16.740
Hurry up.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.540
Just

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.900
give a verbal report.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.140
I'll begin.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.950
First, let's analyze

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.950
The Lonely Road.

00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:25.368
Honestly, the fact that it went viral

00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:26.430
was already ridiculous.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.746
It was just one of many projects

00:14:27.746 --> 00:14:28.900
that got rejected

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.620
back then.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.660
In terms of production,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.110
it was incredibly rough.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.500
In terms of game mechanics,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.500
it was torture for players.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.230
It only became popular

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.830
because players these days
have extreme tastes.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.430
Pei, you said you sincerely

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.900
(Sky Fire)
came to work here.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.190
Is this your sincerity?

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.900
I'm telling the truth.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.540
Pei,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.740
talk about the Divine General Pact.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.620
I knew it.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.830
Mr. Pei came to train them.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.310
I actually picked

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.140
an outdated card game.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.430
Ma Yang designed it.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.020
He read

00:15:08.035 --> 00:15:09.457
some pirated Greek mythology book.

00:15:09.457 --> 00:15:10.190
The character

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.260
didn't match at all.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.260
He even did weird edits.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.190
The art was by Ruan Guangjian.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.660
He also just rushed it.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.213
I really don't understand

00:15:17.257 --> 00:15:18.740
how a game like that had players.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.230
Wrong.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.020
From what I know,

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.470
the key to its success

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.260
is abandoning

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.950
the usual pay-to-win card game model.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.950
You give benefits

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.260
and treat all players equally.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.380
If the player purchases
a basic ten-yuan membership,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.500
they could draw 100 times a day
for free.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.070
They can enjoy drawing SSRs

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.430
without spending much.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.140
Mr. Zhou,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.190
did you play it, too?

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.780
Pei,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.540
if you keep rambling like this,

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.070
how can Mr. Zhou feel your sincerity?

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:52.710
I mean,

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.710
how do you want me to show my sincerity?

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.950
- I sincerely...
- Pei,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.780
I have a meeting.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.660
Well,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.190
think it through
before you give your presentation.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.260
Mr. Zhou.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.540
(Sky Fire)

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:27.900
Dongli.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.140
Try mine.

00:16:29.191 --> 00:16:30.190
It really packs a punch.

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.140
Alright. Thank you.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.310
Dongli, you got a minute?

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.230
Can you take a look

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.140
at my slides?

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.900
Thanks for the opportunity.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.710
This template won't work.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:46.500
What?

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.190
I used this at Fuhui before.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.900
Isn't it universal?

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.830
This style

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.380
may work there,

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.710
but absolutely not at Sky Fire.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.540
Too plain.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.070
Not presentable.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.020
Try this.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.020
Go check the VIP templates.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.020
Find something clean and classy.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.780
Seriously?

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.150
I have to pay

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.300
just to make slides?

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.430
I'm paying to do my job?

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.190
Of course.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.390
If you use it every day,
of course, you pay.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.150
I'm already VIP Level 8.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.500
You know what?

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.870
Your layout

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.910
is messy.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:18.910
Not clean.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.390
The colors are dull.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.500
Not eye-catching.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.910
Dull?

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:28.990
Not eye-catching?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.390
I've left Fuhui for too long.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.100
My skills are rusty.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.390
Mr. Pei.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.260
I knew it! I knew you were Mr. Pei.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.540
Stop pretending.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.470
You've got some plan, right?

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.470
My lips are sealed.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.630
I won't tell a soul. Not even Lin Wan.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.159
I'll buy you a meal if there's a chance.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.260
Mr. Pei, you see,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.390
I'm helping you sincerely.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.230
So, when the day comes
that you acquire Sky Fire,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.230
could you not fire me?

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.390
I'm almost 35.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.990
You're only 35?

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.168
Yeah, but I'm exposed to
computer radiation every day,

00:18:04.191 --> 00:18:05.230
of course, I look older.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.390
My gray hair is genetic.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.430
My dad's the same.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:11.190
Mr. Zhou,

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.100
have some meat.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.740
Pei Qian

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.390
is now working on his slides.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.190
He's pretty good at pretending.

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:22.300
When we asked him earlier

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.910
to share his experience at Tengda,

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.991
he fobbed us off
with a bunch of useless fluff.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.430
Whatever he's plotting,

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.740
as long as he's at Sky Fire,

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.990
he has to hand over
whatever you ask for.

00:18:32.724 --> 00:18:34.430
Let's see how long he can keep acting.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.150
Mr. Zhou. Mr. Zhao.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.910
You may start.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.319
(Analysis of the Strengths
and Weaknesses of Tengda Games)

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.150
Based on Sky Fire's work style,

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.870
I reorganized

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.820
several games previously released
by Tengda.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.500
First,

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.580
we'll analyze the first game,

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.710
The Lonely Road,

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:03.870
from four dimensions.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.340
The reason this game succeeded

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.100
is that, firstly,

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.060
we need to break down

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.100
its core logic.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.190
During the design phase,

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.630
we enhanced user cognition

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.235
and defined clear target user profiles.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.100
And through promotion
and strategic positioning,

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.150
we expanded into
broader audience circles

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.060
to achieve conversion.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.580
The second game,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:39.710
Divine General Pact.

00:19:40.568 --> 00:19:42.190
What was its core gameplay approach?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.100
That's to understand player psychology.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.100
What was the entry point?

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.580
To interpret the player's mindset.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.910
And the core competitive edge?

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.099
To align with player needs.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.699
By the time we developed
Returning to Shore,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.524
we had completely mastered
player preferences.

00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:53.780
Through self-learning design,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.820
we iterated on Soulslike content,
upgraded the gameplay,

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.168
opened up multi-dimensional markets,

00:19:57.213 --> 00:19:58.150
and systematically

00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:59.710
built a three-dimensional IP matrix.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.435
That's how it reached
a broader public acceptance,

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:03.010
converting countless players into links

00:20:03.013 --> 00:20:04.480
in a socially driven growth network.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.060
Pei.

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.150
Do you have any other instructions,
Mr. Zhou?

00:20:15.235 --> 00:20:16.710
This presentation is an improvement.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.500
But the part about marketing strategy

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.190
could be a bit more detailed.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.740
Well, Mr. Zhou.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.470
The slides were limited in length,

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.150
so I prepared more detailed

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.580
written reports as well.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.300
Good.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.260
Very good.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.780
We have another meeting soon.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.230
Pei, you can get back to your work.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.324
Mr. Zhou, is there anything else
you need from me?

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.390
You've worked on

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.430
many hit games.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.060
The company needs

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.820
your rich experience.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.020
And I

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.820
trust you very much.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:51.820
How about this?

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:52.820
Make a proposal

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.020
for a new game

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.670
and show me.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.470
Okay.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.910
Given his work attitude,

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.580
for those who don't know him,

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:08.950
they'd really think

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.500
he came here just to earn a salary.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.500
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.870
You chose this road yourself.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.910
Slides are easy.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:28.500
Just add some made-up business jargon.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.670
It's all meaningless anyway
once translated.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.500
My old memories at Fuhui
are coming back.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.990
If I want to pass the probation,

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.910
I need to write this proposal well.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.670
Even though the games I made at Tengda

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.540
all ended up succeeding,

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.740
my original goal was always

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.060
to lose money.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.910
Guys,

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.100
if I want to write a good proposal now,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.470
should I aim to lose money

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.580
or make money?

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.190
Obviously, make money.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.924
If it's clearly going to lose money,
how would Zhou Muyan approve it?

00:21:56.924 --> 00:21:57.910
You have to aim for losses.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.546
You made money before precisely
because the underlying logic was built

00:22:00.568 --> 00:22:01.340
around losing money.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.990
That's how you succeeded
by going against the grain.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.870
If you put it that way,

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.100
does that mean I succeeded

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.190
because I actually had some real talent?

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.870
That was just weird luck.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.020
But Tengda got to where it is today

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.340
because those employees

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.568
really carried out your ideas.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.340
You're always calling them backstabbers.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.780
Maybe you wronged them instead.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.820
Yeah.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.820
Actually,

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.430
I share a lot of the blame.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.540
I shouldn't put it all on them.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.020
I wonder what they're doing now.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.060
- Happy!
- Happy!

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.150
What's wrong?

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.950
Look, doesn't that person
look like Ms. Xin?

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.430
No way.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.870
Look. Isn't that her?

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.990
That pink hair.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.060
She does look a little like Ms. Xin,

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.470
but with that makeup,
she looks more like Cleopatra,

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.813
whom I saw at the Egyptian museum.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.302
I'm going to grab a drink with her.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.390
Let's not disturb her.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.502
She probably doesn't want to
run into colleagues

00:23:17.502 --> 00:23:18.260
on her day off.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:18.990
Yeah.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.150
She's usually so uptight.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.740
Rare chance for her to relax.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.230
Mr. Pei isn't around.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.990
Isn't it kind of bad

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.391
for us to come out and have fun?

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.260
Huang, loosen up.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.190
It's after work.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.190
Life is about work and life,

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.150
life, life, life, life

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.500
balance.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.950
Speaking for Mr. Pei,

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.430
we haven't seen him in a long time.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.780
What do you think

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.740
he's doing right now?

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.190
Probably the same as us.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.910
He's enjoying himself.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.430
Come on.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.430
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.190
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.700
(Sky Fire Tower)

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.100
(The Underdog's Rise Project Proposal)

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.390
Hey.

00:23:58.635 --> 00:23:59.500
What are you doing?

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.950
I didn't tell you to pour tea.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.060
Explain this to me.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.710
Are you designing games

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.710
to make the company money?

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.430
Here's the situation, Mr. Zhou.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.740
This is Plan A.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.990
It's more aggressive

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.710
and unconventional.

00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:15.990
I know it'd be hard to execute,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.020
so I made

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.740
Plan B.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:18.990
It's much safer.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.950
It fits our current style

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.260
and your company's needs.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.710
I looked at Plan B, too.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.100
It's easy to execute.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.190
But it's too conventional

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.540
and not innovative enough.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.910
It's hard to create emotional resonance

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.150
with players.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.060
Also, it doesn't feel like
your usual style.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.780
Be honest with me.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.190
Do you have concerns?

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.820
I don't.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.910
If there's any difference

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.035
between the games I made

00:24:45.057 --> 00:24:46.870
before and now,

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.670
it's that before,

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.910
I used reverse thinking in my design,

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.990
which might not fit
your company's style.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.580
That's why I prepared two plans.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.710
So he does have concerns.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.910
I... I really don't.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.710
If you insist there's something,

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.124
then maybe because the games before

00:25:05.124 --> 00:25:06.090
weren't made by me alone.

00:25:06.257 --> 00:25:07.260
They were the result

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.260
of Tengda's whole team.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.430
Mr. Zhou,

00:25:19.613 --> 00:25:20.670
please have some tea.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.670
Pei,

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:24.740
how about this?

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.190
Try to figure something out.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.500
Our new project needs people anyway.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.230
Why don't you bring

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.340
your old teammates over?

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.150
You can join forces again

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.150
and shine here at Sky Fire.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.740
Well,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.340
they might not be willing to come.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.150
Why not?

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:44.990
Because...

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.710
Because they're flowers raised
in a greenhouse.

00:25:50.168 --> 00:25:52.500
They wouldn't be able to handle
this harsh environment.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.190
Guys, let me tell you a joke.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.820
Someone actually called just now,

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.500
trying to poach me to Sky Fire.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.710
Sky Fire?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.470
Are they insane?

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.260
Bao, did you get the call too?

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.500
Me too.

00:26:18.546 --> 00:26:19.857
They said they were headhunters.

00:26:19.968 --> 00:26:22.060
And that Sky Fire
specifically asked for me by name.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.500
What kind of new scam is this?

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.740
(What's going on?)

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.100
(Unknown Number)

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.020
Hello?

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.710
Hello,

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.100
is this Ms. Lin Wan?

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.710
I heard you've been asking around lately

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.540
about moving from Tengda to Sky Fire.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.300
Both Tengda and Sky Fire
are well-known game companies.

00:26:47.413 --> 00:26:49.302
It's normal for them
to poach from each other.

00:26:49.524 --> 00:26:50.430
Take you, for example,

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.780
as far as I'm concerned,

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.740
weren't you at Sky Fire
before joining Tengda?

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.230
Tengha has great benefits.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.780
Still, you can't treat perks like
they're your daily bread.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.020
Well, we can.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.990
Our boss runs a private kitchen

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.780
just for employees.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.670
We can eat there for free anytime.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.990
Tengda also gives us

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.990
free gym memberships,
company apartments,

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.500
and lots of vacation days.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.500
How could Sky Fire
possibly offer benefits

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.580
and paid leave that good?

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.670
Ms. Lin,

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.260
those perks

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.300
are minor things.

00:27:17.524 --> 00:27:19.600
What really matters in a job
is value for your effort.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.740
You need your own career planning.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.990
You're still young.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.990
You can't just coast at Tengda.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.230
Think about it.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.630
You just joined.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.990
How many years would it take

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:31.368
before you become a lead planner?

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.740
Mr. Wu,

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.780
you don't look that old either.

00:27:36.102 --> 00:27:37.870
How long will it take you
to get promoted

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.470
from headhunter to manager?

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:41.540
At Tengda,

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.390
we have a lot of creative freedom.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.020
As long as you have good ideas,

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.300
the boss will support you.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.990
Ms. Lin,

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.190
I'll be straightforward.

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:51.546
Sky Fire promises

00:27:51.657 --> 00:27:53.020
that if you're willing to come back,

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.340
they'll offer you double

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.630
your current salary.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.020
Do they even know

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.300
how much I make at Tengda?

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.340
Of course.

00:28:02.391 --> 00:28:04.546
We have years of experience
in the gaming industry.

00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.780
We have a good idea
of the average salary in the field.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.340
Yes,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.740
your pay is high.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.260
What if Sky Fire offers double?

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.150
That figure

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.060
is way below the industry average.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.740
That's the monthly salary.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.990
Monthly?

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:27.340
Ms. Lin,

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.540
I've been a headhunter for many years.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.430
I've never seen anything like this.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.060
Never.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.910
This makes zero sense.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.260
Our boss

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.150
really is different from everyone else.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.340
Ms. Lin,

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.020
may I ask,

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.430
does Tengda still have openings?

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.190
I made it clear to the headhunter.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.950
No matter how much people make
at Tengda,

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.430
we'll double it.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:55.430
But not a single person accepted.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.190
It must be Pei Qian.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.470
He has to be pulling strings
behind the scenes.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.150
Otherwise, how could this happen?

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.470
What did Pei Qian say?

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.260
I confronted him directly.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.910
He was

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.502
completely speechless and ashamed.

00:29:08.502 --> 00:29:10.520
He can't even produce
a single solid game proposal.

00:29:10.524 --> 00:29:12.260
And none of his people are coming.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.990
He's clearly determined to oppose us.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.630
There's no way he'll reveal
his true intentions.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.300
It won't be easy for us
to figure him out either.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.100
Anyway, we've obtained

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.670
Tengda's previous game marketing plans.

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:27.430
It's a little of a pity,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.910
but keeping him around
might cause even more trouble.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.190
We must think of a way

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.740
to send him away.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.190
His probation period is almost over.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.300
I'll make sure

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.060
to send him off properly.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.140
(Sky Fire)

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.710
Pei.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.230
Mr. Zhao.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.340
Good morning.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.230
Good morning.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.990
Have you eaten?

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:06.820
Not yet.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.740
What time is it now?

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.580
8 AM.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.150
You're late.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.500
You're late.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.670
Late. Late. Late.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.740
What time is it now?

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.580
8:01 AM.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.260
Company rules say no being late.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.540
One minute late
means half a day's pay is deducted.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.630
Zhao Xuming?

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.580
Mr. Zhao, this is your full name?

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:45.670
What about you?

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.630
Pei Qian.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.500
I'm asking,

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.870
where is your badge?

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.670
All employees must wear
their badges at work.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.740
Forget it once
means half a day's pay deducted.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.820
So I came to work for nothing today?

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.700
(Men's restroom)

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.430
Thank you.

00:31:13.924 --> 00:31:15.389
All employees may not use the restroom

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.591
for more than ten minutes.

00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:18.630
Every extra minute means
half a day's pay deducted.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.910
Half a day?

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.180
(Zhou Muyan)

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.740
Pei,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.300
Xuming has told me about

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.820
some of your recent behavior.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.670
HR has also given

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:44.990
a lot of feedback.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.430
I know you've got personality.

00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:48.710
If you want to keep
your current attitude,

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.910
that's fine.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:50.820
However,

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.190
you need to understand this.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.910
You choose your own path,

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.820
and you bear the consequences.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.160
Excuse me.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.670
All employees must reply
within ten minutes

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.430
of receiving a message
from their superiors.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.230
Each delay
means half a day's pay deducted.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.430
No playing with phones
during work hours.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.990
Caught on camera once

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:12.413
means half a day's pay deducted.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.710
All employees must submit
a daily work report

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.260
before 10 PM.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.190
Missing it once
means half a day's pay deducted.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.820
No talking about non-work topics
during office hours.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.150
Caught once
means half a day's pay deducted.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.340
Employees must strictly follow

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.670
the company dress code daily.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.100
Violating once
means half a day's pay deducted.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.870
No signing during work hours.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.260
Do not spread negative emotions.

Heavens!

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.630
I can't earn money as fast
as they deduct my pay.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.260
I'm basically paying to come to work.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.780
They won't let me use my phone,

and they don't assign me work.

00:32:50.013 --> 00:32:51.540
I can't even write a work report.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.580
Everyone to the meeting room now.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.413
Project meeting
for Eternal Reincarnation.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.630
New project!

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.710
This task is urgent.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.300
Making a game on such a short timeline

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.430
is completely unrealistic.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.230
Tell me about it.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.670
You can't go yet.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.870
How can I help?

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.470
Go buy coffee.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.190
Half lattes,

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.020
half Americanos.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.190
One Americano hot,

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.740
the rest iced.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.500
Three with less ice,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.190
the rest normal.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.230
Two iced lattes,

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.910
the rest hot.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.230
One iced latte at 30% sugar,

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.899
one extra shot.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.190
For the hot ones, one with oat milk,

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.968
the rest regular milk.

00:33:33.991 --> 00:33:35.190
Two at 30% sugar, one at 50%,

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.302
the rest standard sweetness.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.230
Got it?

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.820
Mr. Zhao,

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.968
can you repeat that again?

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.540
No.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.420
(Stay true to our mission,
succeed for the greater good.)

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.020
In most novels,

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.020
should it be Mr. Pei's wife
who runs away?

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.430
Why is it the male lead this time?

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.910
He's been gone for so long.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.980
(Tengda Games

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:15.790
Lin Wan, you came today.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.540
Mr. Pei still hasn't come in today?

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.700
Yintang,

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.830
are you upset, too?

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.270
Missing Mr. Pei?

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.020
(Mr. Pei...)

Why is he making another post like that

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:49.180
(at the moon in a long time.)
to show how overworked he is?

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:51.180

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.270

Mr. Pei!

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.660
Heavens!

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.580
You're really here.

Stop calling heaven.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.390
Just tell me

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:29.620
why you are here.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.750
Bao Xu!

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:33.830
Mr. Pei,

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.830
don't run!

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:35.950
I've found you.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.060
You have to explain

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.430
why you're here.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.100
Mr. Pei.

When I saw that post on Moments,

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.660
I couldn't believe it.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.620
Why on earth did you come to Sky Fire?

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.100
What are you doing here?

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.100
Well...

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.540
You see,

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.580
it's a long story.

00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:31.280
(Coffee on tap is my lifelong dream)
Why are you carrying all that?

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.319
We just started a new project.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.810
Everyone's been working overtime
every day, so I bought them

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.060
some coffee and snacks.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.430
You're buying these

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.430
for Sky Fire employees?

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.660
You know what?

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.950
I'd heard Sky Fire was intense before,

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.700
but now I've seen it for myself.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.100
Compared to Fuhui,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.500
this is on another level.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.910
Yeah. Typical Sky Fire.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.990
They're not just unethical
with their games,

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.140
and they treat their
employees terribly, too.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.350
I never got off work

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.100
before midnight.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.700
Exactly.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.500
At two or three in the morning,

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.480
we still have to reply
to messages from our superiors.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.959
You know what? They force us
to clock in at eight in the morning.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.140
It's all overtime

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.990
with no overtime pay.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.013
That so-called compensatory time-off
is a total scam.

00:37:14.035 --> 00:37:15.390
You can't get leave approved.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.020
Let me tell you.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.660
Just this badge alone,

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.620
I've forgotten to bring it three times.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.310
Every single time,

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:23.620
they dock half a day's pay.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.502
I've been staying up so late
these past few days,

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.413
my brain's all foggy.
I can't remember anything.

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.750
I've got an idea.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.540
Go to HR and get a few extra badges.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.990
They're fifty each.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:35.540
Keep one with every set of clothes.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.790
That way, no matter
what you wear to work,

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.790
you won't forget.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.580
You really are a veteran.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.470
Look,

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.060
there are still so many people
working at this late hour.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.020
I should go.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.390
I need to get this coffee to them.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.620
Alright, go ahead.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.700
Wait a second.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.950
