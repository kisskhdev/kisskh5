[The Blood of Youth: Quest of Heroic Hearts]

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.980
[Episode 23]

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.710
It seems like

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.800
you overcame your inner demon.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.800
The Corridor Keeper told me what to do.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.870
I merely followed his instructions.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.630
Revisiting the trauma can temporarily suppress the inner demon.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.280
Only by facing death

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.470
can one overcome their inner demon completely.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.400
Your sword

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.240
was only half an inch away from my vitals.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.190
If your hands trembled,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.240
then I would really be dead

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.590
in a coffin.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.150
I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.150
never miss.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.470
I don't usually miss.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.080
I'm fine now.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400
Let's head to the inner room.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.680
No need to rush.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.310
Ye Zhixin is injured.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.000
She won't find this place this soon.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.590
Just rest up and recuperate.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.000
Is this

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.430
what you mean

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.800
by training?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.750
I concocted this remedy specially for you.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.280
It can repair the body of a martial arts user.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.400
Did you follow a prescription?

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.310
Show me.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.470
Prescription?

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.630
You don't believe me at all?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.190
I'm just curious

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.120
what kind of remedy

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.080
requires that many flowers.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.520
Oh, the flowers.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.240
When I was foraging for herbs in the mountains,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.800
I saw some beautiful flowers

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.680
and plucked them.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.710
Why?

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.750
Are you shy?

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.360
Just soak in it.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.280
I'll let you be.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.160
Weigui.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.430
Let me know if there isn't enough water.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.190
Got it.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.360
Weigui.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.190
What manner of poison is it this time?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.000
Is it for my medicine?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.310
It's not for your bath.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.800
A girl next door asked me to give it to you.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.000
Why? Because she asked?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.070
Of course.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.630
You are popular with women.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.680
Must we be tied together like this?

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.040
I'm just thinking ahead.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.870
What if you wander off subconsciously again?

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.390
I'll have to find you.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.510
But I told you I'm already cured.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.240
Let's go.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.510
Lunch is served!

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.870
Come.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.480
Try my cooking.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.040
Previously,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.270
you were wounded by Ye Zhixin.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.750
How are you now?

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.070
I will be the strongest swordsman.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.120
This small injury

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.240
is nothing.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.430
Come.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.070
Try this.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.120
Eat.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.720
Have some vegetables.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.310
Thank you.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.160
Try it.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.480
Too much salt.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.310
I'm full.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.190
I...

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.310
Actually, I'm not hungry either.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.390
What?

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.560
You look

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600
better now

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.240
and want to train?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.000
Unfortunately,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.750
I feel weak.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.310
I can't even swing my sword,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.120
let alone

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.310
practice any techniques.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.750
The Corridor Keeper told me

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.920
to let go of my past.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.240
I didn't listen to him,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.800
so I pushed myself

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.720
into this predicament.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.600
Right now,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.040
I can't even unsheathe my sword.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.070
I might as well let go of everything.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.120
Living like this

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.040
isn't that bad either.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.070
What do you think?

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.120
I agree.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.160
Living like this

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.830
isn't that bad.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.360
Then put down the sword.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.040
But that also means

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.600
you must first be able

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.070
to pick up the sword.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.320
I see. You've read a lot

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.000
while I was distraught.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.910
Of course.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.270
I'm your leader.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.510
You're my sidekick.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.320
You know what?

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.720
If you don't mind,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.910
I can teach you

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.390
the sword technique my master

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.120
taught me.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.320
Forget it.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.750
Are you sure a scabbard is enough to unleash

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.080
the sword technique your master taught you?

00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.840
Weigui,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.840
have you forgotten

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.910
our trip in the Corridor?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.550
The Corridor Keeper told us

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.360
that the lack of a sword can triumph over a sword,

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.200
for a sword is not the be-all and end-all.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:11.960
A sword

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.270
is just

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.840
a weapon.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.200

Why not be my sidekick?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.840

lack strength?

Perhaps life has been

too thrilling lately.

Not only

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.960
did you help me overcome my inner demon,

but you're planning to sacrifice your life force to save me.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.440
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.720

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.630
For

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.320
our friendship, you know?

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:53.720
What about me?

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.080
If you die,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.840
can I even live happily?

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.390
I cannot lose another friend.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.270
Weigui.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.910
Weigui, you're crazy.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.600
You're going against the way of nature.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.600
If you can sacrifice your life for mine,

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.960
then I can defy the rules for you.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:21.630
No.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.630
I owe it to you.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.630
No.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.440
Weigui.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.480
No.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.360
No, Weigui.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.320
Stop it.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.320
I sealed your pressure points with my inner force.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.440
You will recover in 12 hours.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.720
Lei Lingze.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.750
I did view you as my good friend

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:54.960
but

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.150
it ends here.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.240
We all have our journey.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.120
Let's

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.790
not meet again.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.960
You finally found this place.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:09.840
However, you are too late.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.630
Why do you have white hair already?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:20.960
You...

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.790
Your inner force is all gone.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.200
It has nothing to do with you.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.790
Where is the Skysplitter?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.910
No one in this world

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.790
will know where it is.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:56.720
Do whatever you want

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.840
with me.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.600
I won't let you die like this.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.910
If you won't tell me where it is,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.600
I'll hold a Demon-hunting Summit

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.120
to lure Lei Lingze out.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.000
Sect Leader,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.440
your ailment is acting up more and more frequently.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.550
I must get the Skysplitter

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.240
during the Demon-hunting Summit.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.240
Weigui!

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.440
Come out, Weigui!

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:53.910
Weigui!

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.720
Where did you go?

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.200
Are you

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.600
leaving me for real?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.790
At the hour of Shen tomorrow,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.840
outside Pingchuan Town,

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.790
The Demon-hunting Summit begins.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.200
Exchange the Skysplitter for Weigui.
