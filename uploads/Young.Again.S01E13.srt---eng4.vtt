WEBVTT

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:56.219
Here

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.359
Have a taste

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.680
This is my son-in-law

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.439
brought back from a business trip to Dandong

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.159
Kiwi berries

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.040
Are they sweet?

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:03.060
Of course, very sweet

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.819
I can't eat them

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.560
Old Liang

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.640
No, I have diabetes

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.760
Rudy

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:07.379
Type 2

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.240
diabetes

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.080
Xiao Cai

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.199
I also... well

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.500
Look at this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.319
Fine

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.759
I'll show some support

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:14.240
Right

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.719
Let me

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.539
pick a soft one

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.280
Okay

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.340
A specialty

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:20.860
Really good

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.280
Boss Li

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.020
Your son-in-law is really nice

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.659
Thinking of his father-in-law first with good food

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.979
Honest and family-oriented

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.060
Spends his earnings on his wife

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.520
If you want a good life

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.259
the woman must run the house

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.900
This son-in-law of mine

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.580
was personally promoted by me

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.000
His main strengths are

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.180
proactive and hardworking

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.060
honest and obedient

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:46.879
I think

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.699
in a marriage, living together

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.719
two people must respect each other

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.060
understand each other

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.979
and give each other some space

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.500
Uncles and Aunties

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.460
don't you agree?

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.879
Speak up

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.300
How do you explain this?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.439
I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.319
I might have slipped

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.280
An accidental operation

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.340
Make it up

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.319
You're making things up again

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.500
How is it so coincidental?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.699
With this female friend of yours

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:10.759
this Qianqian

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.860
you deleted all the chat logs with her

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.639
But the chat logs with President Ma

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.620
why weren't those deleted?

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.340
And "Follow President Ma's lead"

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.199
President Ma is my direct supervisor

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.960
Don't change the subject on me

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.780
Tell me what's going on with this Qianqian

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.060
There's nothing going on between us

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.740
We are completely innocent

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.580
Your college sweetheart, right?

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.919
She always kept you as a backup, right?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.719
I'm aware of all these details.

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.159
Didn't I voluntarily confess before we got married?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.360
What are you mumbling about?

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:42.939
Listen here, Wu Yuntang.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.180
She's already married.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.479
Her second kid is already running errands.

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.060
Why are you still so obsessed with her?

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.520
There's one more thing.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.560
That you aren't aware of.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.319
She just recently got divorced.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.039
Because of you?

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.419
No.

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.560
It has nothing to do with me.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.080
It was her French husband.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.020
He had an affair.

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.199
He found a mistress from Belgium.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.159
I heard she's even a fashion model.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.819
A model?

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.280
That's right.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.219
Pfft.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.539
Who cares about her messy business?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.340
Let me tell you, Wu Yuntang.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.900
You better behave yourself.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.580
Did you hear she got divorced...

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.100
...and decide you want to be her backup again?

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.759
Confess honestly.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.300
Aren't I honest enough?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.899
In your Li family...

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.579
I never hit back or talk back.

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:24.480
I hand over my salary and do all the housework.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.839
Isn't that exactly what you should do?

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.259
Why should I have to do that?

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:29.420
When have you ever cared about my feelings?

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.040
Have you ever respected me?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.459
Respect you for what?

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:34.160
Respect you for flirting with other people?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.959
If you're going to put it that way...

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.399
Then let me tell you something.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:38.139
A few days ago...

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.379
I actually met up with Qianqian.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.540
You— But nothing happened!

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.620
But seeing how you're acting now...

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.920
I'm actually starting to regret that.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.360
You're hurting me!

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:49.240
Regret?

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.019
You regret it?

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.579
If you regret it, go find her then!

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:52.540
Get out!

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.259
You're telling me to get out?

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.339
This is my home too.

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:56.339
What do you mean "your home"?

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:57.699
My dad bought this house!

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.500
You...

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.120
You... I...

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.279
What are you doing?

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.439
Are you going to hit me?

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.800
I...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.139
I want a divorce.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:05.279
What did you say?

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.399
Say that again.

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:07.500
I...

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.980
Want a divorce.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.139
You're bringing up divorce with me?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.839
You are ridiculous.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.120
This Little Wu...

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:23.920
He is a wolf of Zhongshan,

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:25.699
Ruthless once he gets his way.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:29.660
I'm usually very good at judging character.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.779
How did I miss the mark this time?

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.500
You, good at judging character?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.420
You were the one who introduced Little Wu, right?

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.639
I saw that at work, he was...

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:40.319
Proactive and hardworking,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.620
Honest and simple,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.459
Dutiful,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.639
And bore burdens without complaint.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.600
It was an act.

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.139
He just wanted to suck up to you.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.319
Looking at the situation now,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.899
When Little Wu pursued Jiajia back then,

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.259
His motives were impure.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.519
It was your nepotism.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.879
You gave him an exceptional promotion.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.100
Of course.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:59.259
Actually, no.

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:02.519
It was my subordinates doing it out of respect for me.

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.180
It's all your fault.

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:07.040
Think about how many people pursued me back then.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.019
Zhang Xiao.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.000
Cao Yang.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.600
Yi Zan.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.300
Ying Di.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:11.839
Who wasn't better than him?

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:12.500
Honestly.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.339
Yeah.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:14.720
Didn't every single one of them...

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.399
Get driven away by you?

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:19.759
I just saw that Little Wu was wimpy,

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:21.439
Honest and simple,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.459
And could stand your temper.

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:25.420
It was an act.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.459
He was faking it all.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.519
No way.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.920
I won't let him get away with this.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.600
Honey,

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.779
Let's calm down first, okay?

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:33.519
Yes.

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.199
I think Little Wu just spoke out of anger.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:38.560
How about this.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.500
I'll call him over personally.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.860
I'll talk to him face to face.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.399
It's no use what anyone says.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.819
I am definitely getting this divorce.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.079
No.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:50.300
I am very calm.

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:52.279
It is absolutely not an impulse.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.259
Let me tell you,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.500
If Jiajia wasn't so...

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.100
Obedient to me,

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.060
Making it hard for me to speak up.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.620
Qianqian,

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.339
It was your divorce

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.720
That gave me courage.

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:10.459
I've decided to go crazy for love once.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:13.399
Qianqian,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.699
I have so much to tell you.

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:19.899
When do you have time for us to meet?

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.519
You do your thing.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:23.959
I'm available whenever you call.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.300
Little Zhang.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.319
What's my schedule for today?

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.980
Let me take a look.

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.740
This morning,

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.339
Lunch with President Zhang of 2B1.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.199
And the subsequent itinerary,

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.579
Is with this President Zhang,

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:45.180
The two of you,

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.379
Will go for a site visit together.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.740
After this visit,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.180
Let me see...

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.480
Hello? Who is this?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.040
Dad.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.079
Boss Li.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:07:59.920
Old Li.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:01.220
What is it?

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:03.980
About this matter...

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.920
I've really been a bit busy lately.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.779
How about this,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.000
I'll have my secretary schedule a time.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.160
I'll make an appointment with you another day.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.620
Okay.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.019
Okay, bye-bye.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:20.759
See?

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.199
Overestimated yourself, didn't you?

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:24.420
Here, call Uncle Ma directly.

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.759
And have him fired.

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:27.639
I bet that'll fix him.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:28.740
Child,

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:30.420
if you do that,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.759
your divorce will be set in stone.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.860
There's no room for reconciliation.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.440
So be it.

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:38.220
I don't want to be with him anyway.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.159
Your Uncle Fan makes sense.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.480
Don't be impulsive.

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:48.820
Let's hear what the folks think.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.500
How dare you, Wu Yuntang.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.019
You don't know how good you have it.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.340
Marrying such a good wife like Jiajia.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.720
And you're still not satisfied.

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:58.580
Let me tell you,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.779
you deserve to be stuck with my awful daughter-in-law.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.220
I'm telling you,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.159
that daughter-in-law of mine...

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.919
I say, Auntie Cai,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.519
you mean,

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:11.679
you agree Jiajia should divorce?

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:13.639
Well, I...

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:15.340
I didn't say that.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:15.820
Didn't you...

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.559
Doesn't the old saying go,

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:19.919
Better to destroy ten temples

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:21.519
than one marriage.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.779
If you can make do, make do.

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:24.919
But if worst comes to worst...

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.080
You said nothing at all.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.779
Old Li,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.299
I understand you.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.200
We both have daughters.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.919
Yes, right?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.980
And I'm a bit better off than you.

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:35.580
I've been divorced.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.179
You call being divorced "better off"?

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:40.039
No, I have experience.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.659
Experience makes an expert.

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:43.620
Divorce,

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:44.960
is really no fun.

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.720
Don't do it if you can avoid it.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.240
Of course,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.259
if you absolutely must divorce,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.139
then you must.

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:55.419
That's also like saying nothing.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.100
No,

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.700
I've always believed,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.120
that an unhappy marriage

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.779
is not worth maintaining.

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:04.679
Since Little Wu has had a change of heart,

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:06.320
you can't force love.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.960
Listen to what Teacher Liu said.

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:08.919
Of course,

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:12.519
if Little Wu changes his mind back,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.779
You also said nothing.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.919
My suggestion,

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:17.519
if there is no love left,

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:19.740
then why not let go?

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:21.399
This is very normal.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.480
Every man and woman

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.100
has the right to love or not to love.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.480
Just say whether to divorce or not.

00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:29.559
My suggestion is,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.639
you can divorce,

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:32.019
or you can not divorce.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.860
Divorce.

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:34.500
You must divorce.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
You must make a clean break with that Wu Yuntang.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.100
Dad,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.700
I have just one request now.

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:41.340
Call that President Ma.

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.399
Have him strip that ungrateful Wu Yuntang

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:44.299
of all his titles.

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:46.539
This...

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:47.940
Here, use my phone.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.500
You call.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:49.559
Call right now.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:51.519
Tell him right now.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.919
Jiajia

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:00.000
President Ma and I...

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.320
used to have

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.639
many disagreements on decisions.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.860
Now that I'm no longer in office,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.340
making this phone call

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.600
might not work.

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:13.059
It...

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:15.019
It's really hard to say.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.639
It might even

00:11:20.539 --> 00:11:21.940
be counterproductive

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.019
and humiliating.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.799
Don't you think?

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:25.340
So what should we do?

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.179
Just watch that ungrateful wolf Wu Yuntang

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:28.419
and not be able to do anything?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.220
Sit down first.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.279
Listen to Dad.

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:32.620
Listen to me.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.559
Here's what I think.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.179
Let's take this opportunity

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.960
to reflect on ourselves first.

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:41.580
Little Wu

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:43.700
was introduced to you by me.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.779
I'll start with a self-criticism.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:47.940
Furthermore,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.860
well,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.559
shouldn't you

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:51.759
also examine yourself?

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.379
Don't you think

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:55.419
that in many ways,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.139
you could have done better?

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.759
For the situation today,

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.340
don't you bear some responsibility too?

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:20.940
No way.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.299
Let me drink it. I'll drink it.

00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:23.299
I'm drinking it. No.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.120
Sister Li Jia, do you want a cappuccino or a latte?

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:27.340
I'm not drinking.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.159
Then I'll drink it.

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:31.039
I'll drink that latte.

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:32.000
I still want to drink that latte.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.960
I want to drink it. We agreed yesterday.

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:36.460
Can you two care about me for a second?

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.919
We care.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.399
If we didn't care about your business,

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.519
why would we come here?

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.580
Sister Jia.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.480
When I first met your husband, I said...

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.120
You can't marry an engineering guy.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.840
Did I say that or not?

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.279
I said that too.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.779
Give me a break. When did you two say that?

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.919
I just remember you saying...

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.460
Brother Wu is a really nice guy.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.820
Honest and reliable.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.159
He looks like a hidden gem.

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:58.460
"Hidden gem," she said that.

00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:00.960
I want to marry someone like that in the future.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.759
Didn't we say that just to make you happy?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.539
Besides...

00:13:05.539 --> 00:13:07.759
How could you believe what us kids say?

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:10.139
I actually believed what you kids said.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.139
Sister Jia, you're Type A blood, right?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.240
That means you're gullible.

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:14.679
And a Virgo.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:16.899
A typical lovesick mind.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.299
And my dad insisted on telling me...

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.139
How great Little Wu is...

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:22.220
Boundless future.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.419
Arranged marriages cause so much harm.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.759
And Wu Yuntang was chasing me relentlessly.

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:28.879
A moment of confusion.

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:30.220
Blinded.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.480
Are you two making fun of me?

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.820
Or helping me come up with ideas?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.259
And you call yourselves volunteers.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:37.980
Helping you.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.980
We're definitely on your side, sister.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.340
Right.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.179
Just tell us.

00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:42.039
How to help.

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:44.759
How about this.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:45.879
I have an idea.

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:47.500
I'll go find him tomorrow.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.639
I'll give him a good scolding.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.960
It's not appropriate for us to scold him, is it?

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:51.899
Besides...

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:54.039
What's the use of just scolding him?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.159
That makes sense.

00:13:55.159 --> 00:13:56.580
We still need to criticize and educate him.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.960
Make him pull back from the brink.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.159
Turn back to the shore.

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:02.159
I'll call Wu Yuntang right now.

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:03.460
You...

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:12.340
Hello.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.240
Yes, I'm President Wu.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:14.899
Who is this?

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:17.940
Xie Yingzi.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.519
It's the beautiful Yingzi.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.080
Why did you think of calling me?

00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:27.500
Li Jia made you call, right?

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.740
That's fine.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.000
Then send me a location, okay?

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.559
What kind of romantic luck have I stumbled into?

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:51.039
The beautiful Yingzi.

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.980
What made you think of summoning me alone?

00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:53.440
Sit.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.259
As you command.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.100
The reason I invited you here today...

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.519
...is mainly to talk to you.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.440
What is going on with you and Sister Li Jia?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.500
You see?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.659
It was Li Jia who sent you to meet me, right?

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:04.720
Where is she hiding?

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:05.860
Is she eavesdropping somewhere?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.519
No.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.600
No one sent me.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.820
I wanted to ask you myself.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.159
It's no big deal.

00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:15.259
Why must you get a divorce?

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.440
You ask why?

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.899
You have no idea.

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:19.799
Being with her...

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.080
I swallow insults and act submissive all day.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.440
Driving, running errands, cooking, washing dishes.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.919
I might even have to kneel on the washboard.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:28.980
Really.

00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:31.360
So what?

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.039
Isn't it said that once married...

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:34.679
...every husband is like this?

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.139
But I've had enough!

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.460
I, Wu Yuntang...

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.440
...even if I were an AI robot...

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.139
...would have reached the moment of developing self-awareness...

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:43.360
...and awakening by now.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.080
Nonsense!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.460
You're talking nonsense!

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:47.360
Who are you?

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:49.360
Keke, right?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.820
You were eavesdropping inside just now, weren't you?

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.759
What "had enough," what "awakening"?

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:54.879
Let me tell you.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.080
That's called being fickle and having an affair.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.100
Do you admit it or not?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.299
Do you think we don't know about Qianqian?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.360
Oh, you're talking about that.

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:06.120
I am indeed considering that aspect.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.179
I admit it.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.820
What can you do to me?

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.240
I...

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.779
I really can't do anything to him.

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.059
Brother Wu.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.379
You have to have some conscience.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.259
Think about it.

00:16:17.539 --> 00:16:19.580
If you hadn't latched onto Li Jia back then...

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.840
...would you be where you are today?

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:22.600
President Wu?

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:25.820
That's not necessarily true.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.200
I, Wu Yuntang...

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.080
Peking University, Tsinghua...

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.019
...I've attended them all.

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:31.159
Or rather, I haven't.

00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:32.679
Why mention them if you haven't?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.460
But I believe...

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.700
...gold will eventually be spent.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.139
Huh?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.220
No, eventually panic.

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.299
Shine.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.879
Shouldn't you thank Grandpa Li for that?

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.519
For letting you shine?

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:47.759
You don't know Li Jia's temper.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.440
Compared to our Qianqian's gentleness and care...

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.080
...and understanding nature...

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.700
...she is miles behind.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.440
Nonsense!

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:56.679
Shut up!

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.860
We are criticizing you here!

00:16:57.899 --> 00:16:59.379
You're not allowed to badmouth our Sister Li Jia!

00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:00.320
What's wrong?

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.700
Can't I talk about her many flaws?

00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:03.799
I insist on saying it.

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:04.700
To tell the truth...

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.299
...Li Jia...

00:17:06.299 --> 00:17:09.059
...is just a tigress sleeping beside me.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:10.000
No.

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:12.000
Fiercer than a tigress.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.720
She's simply a devil, a demoness!

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.500
Wu Yuntang, you big jerk!

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:19.539
You

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.619
Fine

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.579
You were eavesdropping inside the whole time, right?

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.720
All right, all right, you two

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.619
I cannot win an argument with you

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.500
I am leaving

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.720
See you at the Marriage Registration Office

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.700
Fine, see you there

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.819
Whoever does not go is a little dog

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:32.599
Sister, sister

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:36.339
Jiajia, what are you doing?

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:37.400
Exactly, sis

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.220
There is really no room to turn back like this

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.240
Then so be it

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:41.480
I am definitely divorcing

00:17:43.099 --> 00:17:44.220
Calm down

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.220
That is enough

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:50.119
Qianqian

00:18:51.619 --> 00:18:53.039
What are you doing here?

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:57.519
Look at this

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.299
Back to being free

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.339
Congrats

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:05.460
I came straight from the Marriage Registration Office

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.259
You sure are decisive

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:08.619
How is it so fast?

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:11.420
It is not because of me, is it?

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.559
Of course it is because of you

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:13.940
Of course

00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:16.539
My marriage with Li Jia

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:17.420
at its core

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.559
also had irreconcilable problems

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.819
That explains it

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.700
As long as it is not my fault, good

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.720
I really do not want to be a homewrecker

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.240
You know my happy marriage with my ex husband

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.299
was ruined by that Belgian mistress

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:32.559
I hate mistresses so much

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:33.640
I absolutely despise mistresses

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.259
Right

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:35.599
Mistresses are awful

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:36.259
Mistresses are really darn it

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:36.819
Darn it

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.599
Seriously

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.759
But Qianqian

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.940
I just think

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.279
you should let go of your worries

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.259
Look

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.420
In a flash we are already past thirty

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.160
If we do not chase our own happiness now

00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:53.720
it will be too late

00:19:56.299 --> 00:19:58.240
What you are saying really makes sense

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:58.839
Right?

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.099
But

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.980
if you marry me

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.859
will our marriage definitely be happy?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.579
Since Little Wu's heart

00:20:18.579 --> 00:20:19.940
is no longer with you,

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.099
I think it's better to let him go.

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:25.579
On this matter,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.819
Dad is responsible.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:28.859
Dad,

00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:30.940
this has nothing to do with you.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.579
Growing up,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.660
schools had to be top-tier,

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.819
choosing a college major,

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:39.259
jobs had to be easy and respectable,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.420
and a partner...

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.279
Isn't this just...

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:45.380
my fault?

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:47.859
Dad,

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:49.640
actually, these past couple of days,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.759
I've been thinking too.

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:53.380
Wu Yuntang and that female classmate of his,

00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:55.660
it was a bit less than love,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.220
but a bit more than friendship.

00:20:57.519 --> 00:20:59.400
If I hadn't kept such a close watch,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.220
and been a bit more oblivious,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.140
maybe it wouldn't have come to this.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.019
True.

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:06.400
I'm exactly the same way.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.359
Wanting to win every battle,

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:10.220
only to lose the entire war.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.559
Daughter, you take after me.

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:13.480
Is that a good thing?

00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:14.539
Jiajia,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.140
here to see your dad again?

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:16.880
Uncle.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.720
Why isn't that...

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:21.099
Old Liang, you...

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:22.819
why do you...

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:25.019
always have to touch a sore spot?

00:21:27.059 --> 00:21:29.160
Can't I mention it if it's sore?

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:31.700
I'm welcoming our Jiajia

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.039
to join me and Rudy's divorce club.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.160
What are you saying?

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.539
What are you talking about?

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:38.720
Jiajia, don't listen to Uncle Liang.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.660
It's good that Little Wu is gone.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.099
We'll find someone even better.

00:21:42.539 --> 00:21:44.700
Leave finding a partner to Auntie Cai.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.299
Okay.

00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:47.640
Jiajia.

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:48.779
Little Wu?

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:51.460
He has a few words to say to you.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.539
Jiajia,

00:21:55.019 --> 00:21:56.740
I was wrong.

00:21:57.799 --> 00:21:59.099
That Qianqian, she said I...

00:21:59.099 --> 00:21:59.599
She...

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.940
Will you give me another chance?

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:03.359
How dare you, Wu Yuntang!

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.140
You have the nerve to come see me?

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.000
Right!

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.339
There's no going back for us!

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.140
Get out!

00:22:10.279 --> 00:22:10.779
Get out!

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:13.880
Leave the century egg behind!
