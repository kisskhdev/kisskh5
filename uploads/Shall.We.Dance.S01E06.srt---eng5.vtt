The throne will be your doom!

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.000
Who is it?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.120
It's me.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.239
Thunder gave me nightmares.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.400
I'm scared.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.520
I'm scared too.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.439
Does the thunder still scare you?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.840
Not anymore.

The throne will be your doom!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.480
Who's there?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.719
Shush.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.840
It's me.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.240
Thunder roars outside.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.600
It gave me nightmares.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.639
I'm scared.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.000
Do mind your manners.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.920
What you do here
is out of place.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.559
I won't tell anyone.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.959
This is our secret.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.360
Just like when we were kids.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.400
This goes against propriety.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm sleeping here tonight.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.280
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.160
Forget it.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.799
This is your room.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.080
You take the bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600
Xiao Man,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.520
your pillow smells great,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.760
like a young lady's.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.160
Your Majesty,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.840
I should escort you back.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.440
Why, Xiao Man?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.800
Xiao Man...

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.000
Xiao Man...

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.839
Can we not

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.400
go back to
how we were as kids?

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.519
Are you still afraid of thunder now?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.960
I'm not afraid anymore.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.599
Ten years have passed.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.440
We're no longer children.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.560
We can't go back.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.000
Never ever?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.280
I don't believe that.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.840
There must be a way for us to go back.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.360
Look.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.879
These are all my private clothes.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.160
Pick one and change into it.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.799
What for?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.639
It's a secret for now.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.520
Come on.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.999
What are you doing?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.239
Your Majesty can choose for me.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.600
Anything will do.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.200
Wait there.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.960
How about these two?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.360
We'll look like brothers in them.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.040
Very well, little brother.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.439
I'm taller than you now.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.280
You should be calling me big brother.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.120
I'll go change inside.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.160
Why so bashful?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.600
You're acting like a lady.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.439
What a graceful, handsome youth.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.079
Come,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.279
I'll take you somewhere.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.400
Where to?

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.880
(Yanbo Parlor.)

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.600
That was beautifully danced.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.319
The performers here
are masters of their craft.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.840
There are many skilled artists.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.440
The music hall has its rules.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.679
Honoured guests

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.279
may go to the private rooms upstairs

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.480
and invite a performer
for a solo display.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.959
There are watchful eyes.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.320
We must stay alert.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.720
Do not lose yourself
in the stage performance.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.559
I've truly broadened my horizons today.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.439
When I return,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.159
I shall build

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.559
a Yanbo Parlor of my own,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.920
and gather artists from
across the land to entertain

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.920
and dance with me.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.839
If you are pleased,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.159
you may go to the upper floor

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.600
and invite that performer
to entertain you alone.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.760
Very well.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.000
Let's have a look.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.999
Xiao Man,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.359
let's go see for ourselves.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.839
Come.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.560
This way, please.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.239
They say there is much
to enjoy within Yanbo Parlor.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.560
Xiao Man, you must
make the most of it tonight.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.680
I am Liu Mengmei, Young Master.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.359
Your performance was truly splendid.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.479
Any other specialty act?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.120
My specialty is sword dancing.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.639
Excellent.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640
I...

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.959
I would like to see a sword dance.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.079
Please.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.200
Then, forgive my humble display.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.639
Excellent.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.280
Your skill is indeed remarkable.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.600
(He knows martial arts.)

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.080
Have you studied combat?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.680
Only the bare basics.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.560
(Test his skills.)

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.120
How about sparring with him?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.360
I'm not a fighter.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.520
Do not be alarmed, Young Master.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.600
I am not Jing Ke the assassin,

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.520
nor am I Xiang Zhuang the warrior.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.679
This young gentleman is
quite the handsome one.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.240
You seem rather familiar.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.040
Have you visited Yanbo Parlor before?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.559
You do know how to flatter, sir.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.680
No wonder so many are fond of you.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.719
But I fear you've
mistaken me for someone else.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.640
I have never been to Yanbo Parlor.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.559
(He denies ever coming.)

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.079
This place is where many nobles

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.319
meet in secret.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.960
Much has happened here.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.280
Is that so?

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.360
Who, for instance?

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.319
For example,
the Imperial Prince Consort.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.480
My uncle-in-law?

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.039
Well now...

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.799
Sneaking off to
amuse yourself behind Aunt's back.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.000
Despicable.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.679
There was also someone
who seemed a palace noble.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.919
Others addressed him as

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.800
Director Jia.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.360
Watch your tongue.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.920
You are...

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.080
You too...

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.279
Splendid.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.440
Utterly splendid.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.160
What should we do next?

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.039
I've prepared a special game,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.159
one only the two of us can play.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.280
Alright.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.720
Come with me.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.120
You took me for Big Flower?

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.119
Stop following us.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.480
We will be fine alone.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.040
Slow down.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.240
Xiao Man, slow down.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.600
What exactly are we playing?

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.200
Slow down.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.479
Play and fun.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.439
That's all you think about!

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.439
Stand still.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.880
I have something to tell you.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.479
My swordsmanship outside
the palace was never perfected,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.680
but I did master the ability
to remember anything at a glance.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.120
And so?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.280
So what exactly are we playing?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.760
Dancing?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.320
We'll play...

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.039
memorial recitation.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.519
I can read the memorials submitted

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.359
to the Directorate of Ceremonial

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.560
before Director Jia takes them
and remember every word.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.919
Now,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.799
I'll recite them to you one by one.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.359
Any loyal counsel or worthy advice,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.519
you may take note of yourself,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.520
so you may better grasp court affairs.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.399
No!

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.319
I won't.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.559
If you won't dance with me, fine,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.799
but now you want me to work.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.600
What if Director Jia scolds you?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.279
Changes stir along the border.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.880
Heavy troops must be deployed at once.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.479
Guard against foreign powers,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.160
whose ambitions are wolfish at heart.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.880
(No need to test further.)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.240
(Xiao Man is on my side.)

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.040
I'm glad.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.759
I'm not saying this to please you.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.119
But I am glad to hear that.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.880
You're still my Xiao Man.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.520
Xiao Man,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.360
shall we dance?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.839
Xiao Man.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.040
Xiao Man?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.479
Come on, Xiao Man.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.680
Dance with me.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.320
Xiao Man realised you're a woman?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.520
And she still...

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.720
I won't spare her.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.520
Sit down.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.639
What's the hurry?

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.360
I haven't finished speaking.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.479
So,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.080
it would be one thing
if a fool like you failed to notice,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.480
but don't tell me...

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.760
His Majesty didn't realise it either?

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.720
Realise what?

00:12:04.145 --> 00:12:08.065
♪I wanted to ask you
the meaning of forever♪

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.590
