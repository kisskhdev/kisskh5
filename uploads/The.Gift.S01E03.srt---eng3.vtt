WEBVTT

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.000
That woman has to be
connected to me somehow.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.080
That's why we need her help.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.160
As for helping Sin like Mrs. Wanee asked,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.360
I'll have to find a way
to turn it down again.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.520
No. You have to keep working for me.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.840
Maybe Ms. Mysterious

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.880
has been waiting for both of you.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.840
Mom, this is Aunt Anong,
my biological aunt.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.920
And this is Uncle Sarut,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.520
my uncle-in-law.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.880
Hello, ma'am.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.360
Jirasin's important guest?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.400
I think there's definitely
something hidden,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.000
some ulterior motive.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.080
That's why he brings strangers
into an event like this.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.320
I think we shouldn't
get involved with them.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.880
If they really intend
to make a scene here,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.200
they might actually be satisfied
if they succeed.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040
I think we should just stay out of it.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.080
I'm not good at putting on an act.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720
Please trust me just once.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.280
Don't get involved with them.
Let's stay here.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.280
Hey.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.760
Prae, listen to me. Prae.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.800
Prae, Prae. Come on, Prae. Don't do this.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.480
Don't be mad at me, please. Don't be mad.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.080
Prae?

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.360
This is way beyond just being mad.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.560
You deliberately deceived me.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.600
I never deceived you.
And I never intended to deceive you, Prae.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.520
I love you.
But I told you from the beginning

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
that I'm already with someone.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.760
That's not true.
You never told me directly.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.720
Prae, calm down.
Please listen to me first.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.560
I love you so much. I really love you.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.680
You deceived me.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.440
The baby in my womb,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.600
I won't keep it.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.040
And I'll kill you too!

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.480
-Prae!
-Do you understand?!

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.480
Why would you do this to me?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.000
Why did you deceive me like this?

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.720
-Prae!
-Stop it, Sarut.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.840
Ms. Mysterious?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.280
If you touch Prae one more time,
I'll tell Wichan everything.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.680
Shut up, you low-class woman.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280
You think you can do
anything to me, Ampha?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.840
Get away from here. Prae.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.640
Of course I can.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.280
But I've never thought
of harassing anyone the way you did.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.440
Your actions are lower than low.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.040
Hey! Let go!

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.800
-So mouthy, aren't you?
-Let go!

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.120
Kluay. Kluay.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.720
Kluay.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.600
Kluay.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.440
-Mr. Warat.
-What did you see?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.560
I… I can't explain it properly.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.280
So you saw something.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.680
If you're not feeling well, wanna go rest?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.080
I'll have someone take you home, okay?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.120
Okay.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.920
Hello.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.600
Are you Warat?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.560
I'm Sarut, a friend of your dad's.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.080
Thank you for coming.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.120
Wait a moment.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.240
I didn't see you around much.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.720
I thought maybe
you studied abroad for many years.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.680
Well, I don't recall
my dad ever mentioning you.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.920
Maybe that's because…

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.320
I was ill.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.760
I couldn't go anywhere,
so I drifted apart from your dad.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.480
What illness do you have, sir?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.120
Maybe wait until we're closer
before talking about that?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.560
Uh, I choose who I'm close with.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.080
It's nothing, sir. I only asked because

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.640
if you were truly close to my dad,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.160
I'd like to know

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.920
any information related to him.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.720
-So I could ask.
-Mm.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.360
If there's nothing, then sorry about that.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.440
Why be sorry? There's no need.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.240
It's just an illness.
I can talk about it. It's no secret.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.400
I'm like this…

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.040
because I was in a car accident.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.800
So this is how I am now.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.280
We'll excuse ourselves now, because

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.240
he's very talkative.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.840
Otherwise, the conversation
will drift all over the place,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.800
and you won't get to greet the guests.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.560
But it's nice to meet you.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.680
Likewise. Please.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.120
I'm sure we'll meet again soon.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.640
Keep a close eye on Jirasin.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.760
Why did he never tell me

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.680
that he has both an aunt
and an uncle-in-law like that?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.040
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.720
But if she is Mr. Jirasin's aunt,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.040
then that means she's Ms. Naree's sister.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.600
Naree, Jirasin's mother?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.160
Yes, ma'am.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.640
She drove herself to death.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.320
It's all my fault.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.560
Perhaps you should
get in the car first, ma'am.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.040
I'll report back about those two later.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.720
This matter will probably haunt me
until the day I die.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.720
With the utmost respect, ma'am,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.640
from the past until now,
you've already paid more than enough.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.640
But there must be something

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.360
that made those two
choose to appear at today's ceremony.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.480
Please come inside first.
I'll go get some water.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.080
It's alright.
I just wanted to see you safely home,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.200
for my own peace of mind.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.240
If this were before,
your words might have shocked me.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880
But now,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.960
I'm used to them.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.880
Why? Did I say something wrong?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.000
If there's nothing else,
please go back and rest.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.360
You've been exhausted from work all day.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.000
Mmm.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.800
And you had to drive me home.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.320
Thank you so much.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.840
I'm not going back yet.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.280
I'll stay until you're feeling better.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.200
Oh.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.560
You don't need to worry
about me that much.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.120
I'd say it's more like guilt.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.520
Because you worked for me,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.360
that's why you get sick like this.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.160
Oh.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.520
So you're not actually worried about me.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.520
But the main reason I'm staying

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.200
is because I want to ask you what you saw.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.160
The way you're looking right now

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.960
means you really saw something.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040
You deliberately deceived me.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.760
Well,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.080
I saw a woman named Praewilai.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.920
Mom?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.720
Yes.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920
Did you see my dad too?

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.080
But I told you from the beginning
that I'm already with someone.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.680
The baby in my womb,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.240
I won't keep it.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.040
I'll kill it, and then I'll kill you too!

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120
Mr. Warat,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.640
about your father…

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.000
Mr. Sarut,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.840
my dad, and my mom.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.960
They all know each other?

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.720
It seems that way.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.880
But I didn't see your dad.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.760
I only saw Mr. Sarut and Ms. Praewilai.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.640
Mr. Sarut…

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.360
Jirasin's uncle-in-law.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.880
He and my mom were…

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.640
Oh, I also saw Ms. Mysterious.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.200
She seemed to love your mom very much.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800
That woman loved my mom so much,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.360
yet she married my dad?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.680
Uh…

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.840
That's something
we'll have to find the answer to.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.960
But I saw that
Ms. Praewilai and Mr. Sarut were arguing.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.040
And Ms. Mysterious
stepped in to stop them.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.360
What were they arguing about?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.040
I…

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.040
I couldn't really piece it all together,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.560
so I didn't quite understand.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.080
Are you going to tell me the truth,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.480
or are you going to make me
find out the truth myself

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.080
and we never see each other again?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.800
Hey, you can't do that.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.520
What about Ms. Mysterious?

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.200
I already promised her that I'd help her.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.200
If you won't help,
how am I supposed to help her?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.480
What were they arguing about?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.160
I'm sorry, everyone.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.880
If I'm wrong about anything,
you don't have to tell me.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.840
Kluay.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.200
Alright, fine. I'll tell you.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.840
Ms. Praewilai and Mr. Sarut

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.080
were arguing about a baby.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.640
-About a baby?
-Yes.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.240
Ms. Praewilai was pregnant.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.360
I don't think
we can talk about this anymore.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.520
Is she here?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.600
Not yet. But she will be
if we don't stop talking about this.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.320
I think Ms. Mysterious doesn't want us
to talk about this.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.760
Otherwise,
I would've told you a long time ago.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.440
Then how am I
supposed to know who you are,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.240
and what really happened to my mom?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.040
So what exactly do you want?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.720
Oh. Uh…

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.000
Mr. Warat, don't talk to her like that.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.760
I'm asking. What do you want?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880
Are you asking me?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.400
Aren't you going to take a shower?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.480
Kids grow up so fast these days.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.280
Look at Warat, so handsome.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.680
All grown up.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.320
Praising him won't change anything.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.960
-He doesn't care about you at all.
-Oh.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.880
Well, he doesn't know me.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.760
You can't really blame him.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.280
I've waited for him for over ten years.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.400
Maybe I'll need some time
to get to know him.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.400
It's not that hard. I can wait.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.600
I'll be supporting you.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.080
And you're right, time really does fly.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.600
In the blink of an eye,
the kids have grown up.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.760
Now Sin and Mr. Warat are close by.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.840
Sooner or later,
they'll probably grow close too.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.640
Yeah.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.720
Who said I'd ever get close
to someone like Warat?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.360
Sin.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.120
Don't talk about Warat like that.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.800
What's the big deal?
I'm about to lose my patience.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.120
Why should I have to cater to him?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.760
Sin, what do you gain
from arguing with him?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.360
We're family.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.800
I don't consider Uncle Rut family.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.920
How can you say that?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.480
He raised you since you were little.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.400
Then you should know this, Aunt Anong.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.240
I've endured Uncle Rut long enough.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.480
Before, I could tolerate it.
But not anymore.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.360
Now that Warat is back,
Uncle Narut keeps talking about him.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.000
I can't take it. I'm disgusted.
I'm going to throw up.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.160
I'm still upset.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.120
I don't know why the flight
had to be delayed today.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.280
That's why

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.360
I couldn't make it
to Uncle Wichan's 100-day merit ceremony.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.960
I'm really sorry, Grandma.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.560
It's alright.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.480
You and your father already came
to the wake and the cremation.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.080
That's more than enough for me.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.120
Oh, Warat.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.360
You're back already?

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.360
I've been waiting for you.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.120
She really wanted to come
to your dad's 100-day merit ceremony,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.720
but she didn't make it in time.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.560
Thank you.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.320
Stay and talk for a bit.
I still have some work to finish.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.320
Goodbye, Grandma.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.040
-Alright. Take care.
-Yes.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.720
You should go home. I'm tired.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.920
If you're tired,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.120
how about I take you somewhere
to listen to some relaxing music?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.960
If you want to talk business
with my grandmother,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.480
you can come to the office,
or come to the house and talk.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.120
But don't drag me into it. It's pointless.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.720
Are you still mad at me?

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.480
Come on, Warat.
It's been almost ten years.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.160
Isn't that what they say

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.800
the angrier you are, the more you care?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.440
You should go.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.680
If you stay, I might say something rude.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.920
Stay arrogant as long as you like.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.600
As if I'd ever date that nerd Warat?

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.440
Ugh, that gives me chills.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.240
Then why are you walking
around his Vanich Mall?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.400
I thought you were supporting
your future family business.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.880
Hey. My dad forced me.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.200
Ever heard of connections?
Oh, you wouldn't.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.320
Why didn't Grandma cut off the deal
with Ameena's Grand Mall Group?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480
Arnon.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.680
Are you listening?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.520
Yes, I'm listening.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.920
I'll give you an update tomorrow.
You should get some sleep.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.400
I don't want to see that woman again.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.120
Do whatever it takes to keep
the Grand Mall Group away from Vanich.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.560
It's not that simple.
They're about to merge.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.160
And you're just letting that happen?

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.360
Legal matters
are in your hands, aren't they?

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.960
Go deal with it.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.960
Hey, I'm a lawyer. I'm not the mall owner.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.000
You are. You deal with it.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.320
I don't want to work with my grandmother.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.080
But you have to.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.200
Listen to me.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.280
If you're going to handle this,
I'll back you up all the way.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.200
But it's late now, so

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.920
go to bed. We'll talk tomorrow. Mwah.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.360
Hey, Arnon. Arnon!

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.480
The number you dialed…

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.360
Didn't you sleep enough, Rat?
You look exhausted.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.080
Yes, Grandma.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.840
I had another strange dream last night.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.920
Again? What was it about this time?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.800
If you think it's nonsense,
you don't need to know

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.960
what it was about.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.000
That's good then.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.640
You can stop paying attention to it.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.640
You're an adult now, Rat.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.640
An executive.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.320
A boss.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.040
Stop paying attention
to this kind of nonsense already.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.920
-Yes, Grandma.
-Good. I'm glad you understand.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Thank you, dear.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.960
-Grandma.
-Hm?

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.400
If I were to ask to use Dad's office,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.440
what would you say?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.280
Why would I object?

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.800
You already have
so much work at Vanich as it is.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.880
If it helps make things more convenient,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.240
you can decide for yourself, dear.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.440
-Thank you.
-Of course.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.520
So when do you plan to use the room?

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.560
I'll have someone go in
and tidy up your father's belongings.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.600
That won't be necessary.
I want everything to stay where it is,

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.520
as if Dad were still here with me.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.280
What did you say?
You want to replace the large trees

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.000
with an open lawn and a rock garden?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.200
Yes.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.000
You have any objections, Mr. Supol?

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.480
Uh, none at all. But today,
Ms. Kluay has to hand over the work.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.880
That's fine.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.840
I can

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.400
keep assigning additional work.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.160
Yes, additional work is no problem.
I'll report this to Mrs. Wanee.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.600
With the utmost respect.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.640
-Yes?
-There's no need to report it.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.680
I have full authority now,

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.280
the same as your Mrs. Wanee, okay?

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.200
-Okay, sir.
-Okay.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.360
Mr. Supol, hello. Mr. Warat, hello.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.920
About the rock garden, please finalize
the budget for me urgently.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.560
I need to present it
to Accounting, Ms. Kluay.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.040
Ah, that's alright.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.080
I've already had her handle it.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.640
Excuse me? What did you say?

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.720
Let's talk inside. Come on.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.320
With the utmost respect,

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.200
no one is allowed inside,
especially outsiders. Mrs. Wanee's orders.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.760
She's not an outsider.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.520
She's my girlfriend.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.680
Huh?

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.760
She's my girlfriend.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.760
Why did you tell Mr. Supol that?

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.840
What if Mrs. Wanee finds out?

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.720
It doesn't matter.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.800
That's good.
You'll help us uncover the truth

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.680
about my mom, as my Grandma's
future granddaughter-in-law. Okay?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.840
Ugh, why are you so selfish?

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.760
Ever think about
whether I'm okay with this?

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.760
Or maybe I already have a boyfriend?

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.520
You? A boyfriend?

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.760
Why? What's so surprising about that?

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.880
I just don't want a boyfriend.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.880
That doesn't mean
no one's interested in me.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.920
That's your answer.
You don't have a boyfriend.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.480
Oh, Mr. Warat.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.760
You're impossible.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.640
Come on. Just get through this job.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.520
Once it's over,
everything goes back to normal.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.880
If I hadn't promised Ms. Mysterious,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.720
I would've run away from you already.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.200
What kind of man are you?
Do you have friends?

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.040
Same goes for you.
Do you even have any friends?

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.160
Mr. Warat.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.200
Okay, okay, enough. If we get any louder,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.480
Mr. Supol will hear us
and everything will be exposed.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.360
Then it'll all fall apart.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.760
Let's just tolerate it
until this mission is over.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.200
Who could ever tolerate someone like you?

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.480
You're sure?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.560
Last night,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.800
I dreamed about Ms. Mysterious again.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.680
She took me into the office.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.000
And then…

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.480
There were documents
flying everywhere, right?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.440
Hey.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.320
How did you know?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.640
This morning, I was half-asleep,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720
and I saw it.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.880
I saw what looked like an office,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.120
with documents scattered everywhere.
Then suddenly, things went blank.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.440
Yes, Mr. Arnon?

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.000
You actually believe that?

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.160
Mr. Arnon called.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.280
He believes Dad's death…

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.240
was intentional, that someone caused it.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.600
What?

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.240
Aren't you going to apologize?

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.040
You're the one who should apologize.
You're lucky it didn't stain.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.440
Didn't stain? Are you blind? Look.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.480
You messed yourself up
and still have the nerve to yell?

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.840
You and your sister…

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.480
are still the same.
Always wrong, never admitting it.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.840
What? How did your parents teach you?

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.120
-Or did they never teach you anything?
-Hey!

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.520
Dragging parents into this now?

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.800
Stay out of my life.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.360
Do you understand?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.080
If you still want to work here.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.440
Go ahead. What are you going to do to me?
I'm not afraid of you.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.040
Barking like a little dog.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.000
You…

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.080
You… Jirasin!

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.440
Kluay Boonsita,

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.520
my architect, is dating Warat?

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.240
Yes, ma'am.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.920
How is that even possible?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.840
They've only met a few times.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.280
And a woman like Kluay,

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.480
I can tell she's not the flirtatious type.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.280
And Rat? Oh my.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.400
In all these years, I've never
seen him interested in any woman.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.280
With the utmost respect,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.760
I find it strange too, ma'am.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.560
But let them be.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.920
Let them date for now.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.080
Kluay doesn't seem like a bad woman.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.480
Besides, how long could it possibly last?

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.840
Kids these days
get together and break up in a flash.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.840
But maybe it's not such a bad thing.
If they're dating,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.480
we can persuade her
to stay and work with us at Vanich.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.160
Would that be a good idea, ma'am?

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.800
Do you remember

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.880
when you asked me
to investigate Ms. Kluay's work history?

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.200
Oh yes, I remember.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.760
But when I decided
not to hire her long-term,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.120
I lost interest.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.760
Her work history looks rather odd, ma'am.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.680
She never stays at one place for long.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.440
Why? What happened?

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.640
People say she's kind of strange.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.400
That she dabbles in things,
white magic, black magic, ma'am.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.800
Is that all?

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.120
That doesn't sound true.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.200
Probably just gossip.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.040
In this day and age,
how could things like that even exist?

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.080
With the utmost respect, if it is true,

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.720
it plays right into Mr. Warat's situation.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.520
It would help him find out
why he keeps dreaming about Ms. Ampha.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.800
Sorry, ma'am.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.440
I'm worried about Mr. Warat,
so I slipped that name out.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.360
Don't ever mention this in front of Warat.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.000
Yes, ma'am.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.240
But still,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.720
thank you, Supol, for looking out for Rat.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.280
Yes, ma'am

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.880
But as for Warat and Kluay,

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.920
if I try to stop them
from seeing each other now,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.800
it'll look like
I'm getting overly defensive.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.160
Let's keep an eye on them
from a distance for now.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.520
Yes, ma'am.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.400
And those photos of that woman

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.240
at the rose arbor house,
you've taken care of all of them, right?

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.000
I've handled everything, ma'am.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.000
Then,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.480
tomorrow, take me to pay respects
to the monk at the temple.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.880
Yes, ma'am.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.320
I don't know

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.840
when all these terrible things
will finally let go of my life.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.200
Ampha…

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.600
What do you want from me?

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.840
Our people went to collect

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.080
Mr. Wichan's insurance documents
at the hospital.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.600
And how are these photos related
to my Dad's death? I don't understand.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.160
My style has always been

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.040
to act first, prepare in advance,
because you never know what might happen.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.560
So, I checked the hospital's CCTV footage.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.080
Every camera, every angle, I got them all.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.200
And I took screenshots.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.160
There were many people who went to visit
Mr. Wichan at the hospital,

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.400
until I came across one person

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.400
and I kept this photo.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.360
Mr. Sarut?

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.960
Why did he never tell me
that he went to visit my dad?

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.200
That's exactly what we're questioning.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.240
Why he went to the hospital,

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.280
why he avoided every CCTV camera,

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.960
and why he didn't tell you.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.280
Why… Why are you two looking at me?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.880
Is this what Ms. Mysterious warned you
not to talk about?

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.160
Not at all.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.320
I never saw anything at the hospital.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.360
And like I said, I never saw
your father in any of my visions.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.360
If it were serious enough to be murder,
why would we just let it slide?

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.840
Let's stay calm first.
We're only suspicious at this point.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.600
There's something I want to tell you.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.600
Before Mr. Sarut visited Mr. Wichan,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.680
Mr. Wichan's condition was stable,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.320
slowly improving.
But after Mr. Sarut visited,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.360
just one night later,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.280
Mr. Wichan went into shock
and passed away.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.880
I'm going to go see him.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.080
Uh, Mr. Warat, calm down.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.760
Shouldn't we think this through
carefully together?

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.120
There's nothing to think about.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.560
People like that, if they're lying,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.440
you can tell just by talking to them.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.360
Maybe we should slow down.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.680
Like I said, we're only suspicious.
He's not a murderer yet,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.040
it just smells strange, that's all.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.080
Why wait?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.200
-Come on, Kluay. Come with me.
-Where to?

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.840
To his house.
We'll use your visions to catch him lying.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.160
But Sin is staying at Mr. Sarut's house.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.400
How many times have I told you
not to be afraid of Jirasin?

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.680
Even better, everyone's there together.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.320
We'll catch them all lying at once.
Let's go.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.040
Help…

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.600
Hey…

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.720
Jirasin, you bastard.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.440
Look. I had to spend money
buying all new clothes.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.200
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.600
Um, there's no hook in the restroom.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.000
Could you pass me my clothes, please?

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.720
-Oh, sure.
-Thank you.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.720
Look at this. It's all stained.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.720
Ugh.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.160
Will this even wash out?

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.720
Excuse me, could you pass me my clothes?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.080
My clothes please.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.000
Of course, dear.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.600
You want new clothes, right?

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.960
What the hell are you doing, Ameena?

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.560
Give me my clothes back right now.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.920
Oh wow, you even recognized my voice.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.800
How adorable, little rotten Som.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.920
Don't let me get out there. You're dead.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.480
So good at threatening, huh?

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.040
Then feel free to stay inside
as long as you like.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.400
You foul-mouthed brat.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.640
You're the crazy old hag.
If you're so tough, fight me face-to-face.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.080
You're always acting like a sneaky dog.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.800
Give me my clothes back right now.
Give them back.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.680
Why don't you go pray
to whatever spirits your sister keeps,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.120
maybe they'll help you.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.680
Ameena, give me my clothes back right now.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.160
Why are you doing this?

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.960
So you really do keep spirits, huh?
How did you even get here?

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.840
Good that you know. When are you
going to stop picking fights?

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.400
Because I hate you.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.120
Why should I have to study
with a freak like this?

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.240
So annoying, right? No tuition fees,

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.600
yet she lives comfortably
like the rest of us.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.560
-Wanna have some fun?
-Sure.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.880
Kluay, the Asian Math results are out.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.400
You've made it to the final round.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.920
Really, teacher?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.840
Thank you so much.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.800
Being around you is good.
I end up going to the library often too.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.120
You're already good, you know.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.240
You got into this college on your own.
It has nothing to do with me at all.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.160
Can you hold my bag for a sec?

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.240
My hands are full of books, Na.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.400
It's okay, I'll carry them myself.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.760
Oops, sorry.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.560
Sorry, didn't see it there.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.120
Here, take it. Stop talking to her.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.320
You crazy bitch!

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.960
-That's enough.
-Let go. I'm gonna kill her.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.960
Why are you taking so long
in the restroom? Oh.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.640
Hello.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.960
You ran into each other in there?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480
Let's go.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.320
You're dead!

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.040
Nothing happened, huh?

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.520
Stop it. Don't do anything here.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.320
This isn't fair at all.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.360
Didn't you see what I went through?

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.880
These two sisters
didn't only splash water on me,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.200
they even locked me in the restroom.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.640
Good thing someone came to help.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.200
Oh…

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.320
Poor thing.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.680
You started it.
Why don't you tell Mr. Warat that too?

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.720
Enough.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.000
Have some shame.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.680
If my mall's reputation is damaged,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.880
I'll sue both of you.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.560
I will press charges against them as well.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.320
If you do anything to Kluay,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.600
it's the same as doing it to me.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.560
Because right now, we're dating.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.080
This girl?

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.560
It should be around here, right?

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:15.800
According to Mr. Arnon's location,
yes, around here.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.239
Uh, Mr. Warat,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.000
can we not go to Mr. Sarut's house today?

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.719
I'm worried about Som.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.239
I already asked Arnon to look after her.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.480
You asked the Head of Legal, Mr. Arnon,

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.920
to look after someone like Som?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.280
He's busy enough already. You can just

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.719
drop me off here. I'll call a taxi
and go back to my sister myself.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.080
I chose Mr. Arnon.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.159
Try trusting other people for once.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.639
Fine. Then I'm not worried
about Som anymore.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.480
Now I'm worried about Mr. Arnon.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.640
What are you doing?

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:08.040
Hatred is appeased by vengeance.
You're done for, you crazy Ameena.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.440
Hey, hey!

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.680
Arnon.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.640
What are you doing?

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.880
What should I be doing?

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.440
I asked what you're doing.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.520
Nothing.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.560
You want me to call security?

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.240
Well, uh… Alright.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.480
Hey.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.080
Are you puncturing her tires?

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:36.160
If you knew what Ameena did to Kluay,
and how she keeps harassing us non-stop,

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.000
this would still be too mild.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.400
There are so many other ways
to get back at her. Why use this method?

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.640
Show me your other hand.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.160
Security.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.720
Ugh.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.840
Here.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.800
Are you going to puncture three tires?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.880
Not this car.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.120
It's the Head of Technical's car.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.240
Jirasin?

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.000
That guy's the real problem. Everything
that happened today is because of him.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.840
Listen to me.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.920
If he gets back at you,
what are you going to do then?

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.080
I'll drive you home. Give it here.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.280
-Enough. Stop.
-Where are you taking it, Arnon?

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.720
-Go home.
-But

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.440
-Come. I'll take you.
-I still… I had everything

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.240
-planned out already.
-I'll take you home.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.600
How do you feel? Better?

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.680
Yes.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.040
Your sister is something else. I like her.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.320
Oh.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.280
If you live like that all the time,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.560
how can you ever find peace?

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.520
Mmm.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.840
What about people who keep
running away from problems

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.120
like someone around here?

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.560
In the end, you have to deal with
the same problems anyway.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.840
You're right. I admit it.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.400
But we don't have to respond
with violence.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.640
If they come at us hard,

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.560
we just hit back hard. That's fair.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.120
Right.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.560
So,

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.000
you're determined
to go to Mr. Sarut's house?

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.640
-Sin.
-Shall we go in?

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.560
Uh… Can we not go in today?
I don't want to see Sin.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.040
Even if you wait
for Mr. Sarut and his wife,

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.520
you'll still run into Sin anyway.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.320
Then, can we come another day?
A day when Sin isn't home?

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.640
Kluay, what are you so afraid of?

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.880
I'm not afraid, but,

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.280
I'm really exhausted today.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.120
And if I have to see Sin,

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.560
and then use my energy to see my vision,

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.360
aren't you afraid I might die?

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.160
Oh, Mr. Warat?

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.440
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.440
Please come in. Come inside.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.560
Kluay ran into Jirasin
at Mr. Sarut's house.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.320
What did he do to her?

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.560
From now on,
we have to be much more careful.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.520
NEXT EPISODE

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.760
Don't let Mrs. Wanee feel like we're
on the opposite side from her grandson.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.680
I hate secrets. I hate lies.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.520
I think the person
who can give you the best answers

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.040
is Mrs. Wanee.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.720
You don't love me anymore.
I don't love you either.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.920
Why keep holding on?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.880
So you won't go back to Kluay.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.480
