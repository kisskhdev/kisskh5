00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.620
You haven't rested well lately.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.250
Today,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.740
you should rest easy.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.460
You usually do housework?

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.260
Just some small chores.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.460
I thought the Young Master
of the demon sect

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.850
lived in luxury,

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.890
with servants

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.660
at his beck and call.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.993
You read it in a storybook?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.820
Father doesn't like noise.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.690
He told me

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.660
that cleaning every inch

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.380
of his room

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.890
and organizing every book

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.100
he's read

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.570
was immensely joyful.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.820
Your father is

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.220
not quite the man

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.060
I imagined.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.170
In the stories,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.060
all the Mus

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.820
are bloodthirsty villains.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.850
Where's Qian Xueshen?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.030
Don't worry.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.400
He has a whole group serving him.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.130
Right now,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.540
it should be quite lively.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.690
We're both guests.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.260
Why is the treatment so different?

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.620
Mu,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.540
how can you treat me like this?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.983
The journey through the snow

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:11.820
is not as simple
as walking down the street

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.260
to buy a box of rouge.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.940
This lawless land

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.450
has fierce customs.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.850
It's very dangerous.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.940
One misstep could lead to a trap.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.380
This place is so dangerous.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.570
I think

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.540
I should go with you.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.780
Lately,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.730
you've risked enough for me.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.380
Besides,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.850
isn't Nie Zhe clearing out
the Mu remnants?

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.340
You'd better stay out of sight.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.890
Zhao, are you worried

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.730
about me?

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.100
I just think Nie Zhe is detestable.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.130
By the way,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.540
why did your Li Sect end up

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.410
with the Nie clan?

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.380
My great-grandfather
adopted Nie Hengcheng.

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:00.260
He later assisted my grandfather.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.493
Grandfather died young.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.660
At that time, Father was not yet ten,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.130
so Nie Hengcheng took over the sect

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.610
until Father came of age.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.130
But Father had no interest in power,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.540
so Nie Hengcheng kept running the sect,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.340
eventually taking it as his own.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.370
What kind of person is Nie Hengcheng

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.290
that my aunt

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.460
would risk her life to kill him?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.290
Nie Hengcheng is talented

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.379
and rare in the world.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.610
To the Six Sects,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.810
he's a demon.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.460
But in our sect,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.730
he is a pillar of the world,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.490
an unshakable anchor.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.460
Then why did he

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.930
go against all rules,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.046
killing without restraint?

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.780
That's because later

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.540
he mastered a supreme skill

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.250
that was called the Ziwei Method

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.930
and was created by the Mu ancestors.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.700
This method

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.730
was powerful

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.780
and invincible,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.700
but long lost.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.259
Later, Nie Hengcheng somehow acquired

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.490
its cultivation method,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.540
and it became the root of all disasters.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.250
Father told me about this skill.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.020
He said such a defiant skill

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.410
must have hidden dangers;

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:06.799
better not to practice at all.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.580
Your father is
truly a man of detachment.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.300
I've always wondered:

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.930
If Father weren't so detached

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.220
and hadn't handed over
the Chief position,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.310
how many lives

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.340
would have changed?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.460
Wu Yuanying wouldn't have suffered

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.580
for ten years.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.100
Ms. Cai Pingshu

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.850
wouldn't have died so early.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.410
It's not his fault.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.810
He simply didn't want to go
against his heart.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.540
My aunt was like that, too.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.250
She was bold and fearless

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.410
but afraid of being trapped at home.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.930
Perhaps the same applies

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.380
to your father.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.380
Your father

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.050
must be a very good man.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:54.780
Otherwise, Uncle Chang

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.206
wouldn't trust you so easily
after a single act of kindness.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.276
It must be because of your father

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.810
that he believes

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.776
you're not a bad person.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.820
Zhao...

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.090
What's wrong?

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.060
Thank you.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.133
(Uncle Cheng, Li Sect)
Young Master,

00:06:58.144 --> 00:06:59.889
you weren't affected
by the sleeping powder,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.050
so why let Miss Cai go?

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.580
To cheer her up.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.610
What a worthless bird.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.266
It probably follows its master.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.100
It's about to snow.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.900
This place is so remote.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.250
Is there somewhere to stay?

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:41.610
Ma'am,

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.700
we're here to stay.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.130
Miss,

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.700
may I ask your name?

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.490
I'm Feng Xiaohan.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.100
This is my...

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.450
Well.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.980
My fiancé,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.490
Wan Dazhuang.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.490
Wan...

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.580
Since you two are a couple,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.580
Blooming Flowers

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.340
is our best room.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.850
It has a soft animal-skin bed

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.700
and fine bedding,

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.670
and the back door leads to hot springs.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.730
Very romantic.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.420
Payment

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.180
can be settled later

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.220
at checkout.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.300
I didn't expect such attentive service

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.340
(Blooming Flowers)
in this harsh, cold land.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.060
Right, Dazhuang?

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.010
I'll bring your meal first.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.060
You two look young

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.300
and delicate.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.340
Why come to this freezing place?

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.250
To see the snowy scenery.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.420
See the scenery?

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.420
This blizzard

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.890
is hardly a good time to sightsee.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.820
Is that so?

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.580
I'll set the dishes for you.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:53.770
Thanks, ma'am.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.530
It's too hot!

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.730
Sorry.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.570
I'm sorry.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.770
Sorry to disturb you.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.220
Sorry.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.090
I'm sorry.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.330
Sorry.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.460
Sorry to disturb you.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.220
I'm too clumsy.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.100
(Qinong)
Are you also here for the saliva?

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.100
What saliva?

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.940
The saliva of the Snow-Scale Beast.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.730
It's said the long-lost Snow-Scale Beast

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.060
is about to appear.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.610
Its saliva can repair internal energy

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.530
and grant longevity.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.180
My master is weak,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.370
so we're hoping for some luck.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.980
Qinong.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.730
I need to go back.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:45.610
Slow down.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.660
Wan Dazhuang?

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.460
Eyes frozen

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.340
on the beauty?

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.250
Miss,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.610
this place isn't safe.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.490
Do you want us

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.850
to scout the path?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.180
Go away!

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.370
You...

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.300
It wasn't me.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.900
It was me.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.530
I've looked for you for so long.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.850
Why betray me

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.250
and elope with this pretty boy?

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.460
Sir,

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.610
your attack is so cruel.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.980
Though their behavior was wrong,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.340
they didn't deserve death.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.660
You...

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.730
Everyone,

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.850
those two are notorious rapists
in the northwest,

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.193
killing dozens of women.

00:12:54.204 --> 00:12:55.369
(Zhou Zhiqin, Peiqiong Manor)

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.490
They deserved

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.580
such deaths.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.770
This is Uncle Zhou's cousin.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.490
I saw him as a child.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.460
Are you from Peiqiong Manor?

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.850
I'm Zhou Zhiqin.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.300
May I ask

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.100
your name?

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.420
I am

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:17.940
Yan Ning.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.610
Thanks for your help, Mr. Zhou.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.980
You're my fiancée,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.490
yet you ran off with my heirloom

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.820
and this pretty boy.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.220
Surely, I'd look for you.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.370
Who took your heirloom?

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.180
Wait. Who is your fiancée?

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.010
I'm not the pretty boy either.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.250
Isn't this my heirloom,

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.940
the scale of the Snow-Scale Beast?

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.700
What a pity.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.890
The pretty boy defiled it.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.546
I don't want it anymore.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:59.540
I want it.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.910
Give it to me!

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.190
Mine!

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.550
Mine!

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.850
Played enough?

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.250
Just some Jianghu punks.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.730
They can hardly fight.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.250
Except for Mr. Zhou,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.700
they're nothing.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.530
Those three haven't acted yet.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.820
Why did your Uncle Zhou
also want the scale?

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.580
I don't know.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.370
This is enough.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.340
No wonder it's a family heirloom.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.730
I heard the Snow-Scale Beast
can sense this scale.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.700
Losing it would be a shame.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.340
Why not lend it to me?

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.980
Dazhuang has been weak since childhood.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.759
I want to secure the saliva for him.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.890
So, it is for the pretty boy.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.820
Mr. Yan,

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.180
my son had an accident here last year.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:10.850
The guards who escaped said

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.420
he encountered the Snow-Scale Beast

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.540
and died.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.180
I just want to retrieve his body

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.420
for a proper burial.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:20.700
Please, Mr. Yan,

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.250
lend me the scale.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.190
Give it to me.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.690
- Give it to me.
- Mr. Yan.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:26.690
Give it to me.

00:15:27.373 --> 00:15:28.748
- Give it to me.
- I need it, too.

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:29.540
Mr. Yan.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.540
Good.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.130
Once we find the saliva,

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.250
you'll come back with me.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.010
Tomorrow morning,

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.650
let's set off

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.820
to find the saliva.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.220
Okay.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.300
Where did you get the scale?

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.220
The Jiuzhou Archive.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.220
Does it have slime?

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.580
That kind of substance

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.956
does not congeal in the cold

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:58.980
and melts when heated.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.460
The archive
hasn't been cleaned for ages.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.843
So, it couldn't be preserved.

00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:05.089
Are we really going up the mountain

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.370
with those people tomorrow?

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.973
The enemy is better in the open

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.180
than in the dark.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.490
Why did you chase after us?

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.940
You stole my Peng.

00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:20.010
Of course, I had to get it back.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:25.570
Sleeping powder?

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.010
The landlady?

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.650
Why sneak in

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.060
at night?

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.560
The snow mountains have spirits.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.370
Trespassers won't fare well.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.700
I advise you two

00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:59.890
to return the way you came

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.100
to save your lives.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.373
You must be very familiar

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.290
with the snowy mountains.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.740
Better stay

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.140
and guide us.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.700
Hidden elites.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.460
Interesting.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.220
You're still sick.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.730
Why come here?

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.366
Are you worried about that Cai girl?

00:18:01.232 --> 00:18:02.702
If not for fearing I'd slow her down,

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.620
I would go with her.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.810
Zhao is not simple.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.900
She might bring back the antidote.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.060
Yuzhi,

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.490
you've never seemed to care
so much about Lingbo.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.810
Master is in danger;

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.530
the sect is in peril.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.460
Yet you still have time for jokes?

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.290
Don't worry.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.500
With me here,

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.530
Qingque Sect won't fall into chaos.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.940
I'm still here.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.420
There's not even a direction.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.090
Where do we start looking?

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.460
Elder Tianji,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.330
let's find a place to rest.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.570
Alright.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.290
Everyone, rest up ahead.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.540
Let's go.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.370
Qian Xueshen,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.050
why so quiet today?

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.010
That's unusual.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.140
Where's Mr. Zhang trailing us?

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.460
Who saw him?

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.540
Something's wrong.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.570
We just came this way.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.090
I've seen this stone.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.730
We're back here again.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.460
A ghost maze?

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.140
What a mess.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.220
When we first came here,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.260
we went straight...

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.500
It's a maze.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.930
Everyone, line up,

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.850
one after another.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.220
Try not to get separated.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.860
This...

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.710
It's getting dark.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.420
With a ghost maze, we'll never get out.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.700
We'll either freeze

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.810
or starve to death here.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.719
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.730
As long as we follow it,

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:34.900
we can escape the maze.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.930
Move.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.060
Come on.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.010
Unordinary fingers.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.140
He knows palm kills

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.900
and can break the ice with inner power

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.250
to break the maze.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.700
Who is he?

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.220
There's a house.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.239
Everyone, get inside to avoid the snow.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.090
Let's go.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.220
Hurry.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.260
Come on.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.890
Follow closely.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.940
This place has been abandoned for years.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.900
Shu?

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.770
You two,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.940
find a place to sleep.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.380
Time to eat.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.620
He's truly exhausted.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.180
He won't get cold.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.330
This trip

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.220
is undoubtedly perilous.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.660
Are you really going to accompany me?

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.660
Though you're heartless toward me,

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.900
I can't do the same to you.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.810
That old servant

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.620
reminds me of someone.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.460
Who?

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.596
Another adopted son
of my great-grandfather,

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.380
Elder Tianji,

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.610
Duan Jiuxiu.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.530
He and Nie Hengcheng were both adopted.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.980
Why was Nie Hengcheng the Chief,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.813
while he was just an elder?

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.460
So, he couldn't accept it.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.250
16 years ago,
the Lord of Qingfeng Temple

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.980
mocked him as the eternal second.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.140
He slaughtered the entire temple

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.660
and even turned young novices under ten

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.620
into human fodder.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.420
Later, your aunt issued a Death Warrant.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.810
It's said

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.620
he died in a ruined temple.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.660
The footprint of the Snow-Scale Beast.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.900
Congratulations, Master.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.100
Move, move!

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.020
Let's go!

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.250
It's the Jade Statue.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.810
The flowers on the base look

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.730
like the tri-colored peach blossoms
unique to Luoying Valley.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.620
Could she be Gu Qingkong?

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.900
In the wilderness,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.810
who put this statue here?

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.730
All dead.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.490
Dead for over six months.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.500
There's a hole here.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.720
A hole?

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:34.930
Wait.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.610
There's something inside.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.810
A snake!

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.050
A huge snake!

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.180
Qian Xueshen!

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.700
The Red-Eyed Crystal Python,

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.740
an ancient beast.

00:28:29.036 --> 00:28:30.632
Its breath can connect to the underworld

00:28:30.643 --> 00:28:31.530
and freeze everything.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.550
Zhao,

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.410
stay close to me.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.780
Alright.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.090
Run!

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.220
Qian Xueshen!

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.020
Go!

00:29:46.456 --> 00:29:47.460
I thought you'd care less

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.730
about life and death

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.620
after the Qingque Sect massacre.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.700
Qian Xueshen came with me.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.530
He's not evil.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.330
If he falls into the hands

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.220
of the Demonic Camp,

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.460
after they use him,

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.140
he'll be dead anyway.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:05.980
Jianghu is like this.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.980
Only ruthlessness ensures survival.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.290
If you're not ruthless,

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.700
you'll end up like Qian Xueshen.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.260
Yulin,

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.380
I'm here.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.050
I'll take you home.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.290
That's Zhou Zhiqin's son, Zhou Yulin.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.170
Yulin...

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.330
- Mr. Zhou found his son.
- Yulin.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.700
That is...

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.940
(Mr. Zhou wants the saliva for himself.)

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.890
Jiu,

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.460
go help Mr. Zhou.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.300
Yes.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.300
Don't come near.

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.380
I don't need your help.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.490
I'll take Yulin back myself.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.530
Better let me help you.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.140
Is this the Snow-Scale Beast's saliva?

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.090
Return it.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:10.890
Mr. Zhou.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.260
Mr. Zhou.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.530
That belongs to Yulin.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.330
Don't give it to him.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.050
Take Mr. Zhou away.

00:32:21.719 --> 00:32:23.252
We'll meet at the foot of the mountain.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.140
I'll wait there for you.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:40.490
Elder Tianji.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.290
Kid.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.260
(Duan Jiuxiu, Elder Tianji)
Sharp eyes.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.050
You recognized me.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.140
You were once Elder Tianji,

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.810
but now you're reduced

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.900
to following behind,

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.090
acting as a servant.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.570
Truly tragic.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.860
You're asking for death.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.380
I heard that one is the weakest

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.730
among Nie Hengcheng's

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.490
four disciples.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.900
He survived only

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.700
by flattering Nie Zhe daily.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:20.610
I think

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.810
it must be you, Chen Shu.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.810
(Chen Shu, Li Sect)

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.940
You know too much.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.810
I think you've grown tired of living.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.140
Who are you?

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.700
Who am I?

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.050
I'm your ancestor.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.620
Wudu Palm.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.180
You recognize it.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.700
You're of the Li Sect?

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.220
As a Li Sect member,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.730
how dare you covet the Ziwei Method,

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:49.620
wanting to practice it?

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:52.620
If Nie Zhe knew,

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.483
your bones would be gouged out,

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.810
and you'd be beheaded.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.420
How arrogant

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.900
before death.

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.333
(His skills are so strong.)

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.820
(He should be able to escape.)

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:19.970
No.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.940
I must help him.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.050
Miss Feng.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:26.940
Miss Feng.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.490
Mr. Zhou,

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.660
how are you?

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.170
Thanks to your medicine,

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.580
I'm much better.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.700
Thank you.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.130
Then rest a bit.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.260
We'll leave first.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.610
I, as a father, have failed.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.650
I can't take my son home

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.490
and have to leave him alone

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:55.210
in this snow-covered mountain.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:59.010
You must protect the saliva.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.980
It's my son's last item for me.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.980
Mr. Zhou, young lady,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.820
you two are here.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.133
We've looked for a long time.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.180
Where are they?

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.420
Your lover

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:16.620
stubbornly refused

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.700
to leave

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.420
and was swallowed

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.010
by the python

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.900
with Jiu.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.650
He's dead?

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.210
The python was too fierce.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.460
Its icy breath killed him instantly.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.050
What a pity for the cute young man.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.780
My condolences.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.450
Young lady,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.090
you still have the saliva, right?

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.170
Jiu was wrong to take it,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.380
but this saliva is vital to our master.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.460
Now, it's useless for you.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:59.753
Why not sell it to us?

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.100
Set a price.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:02.740
A thousand gold?

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.430
Miss Feng, don't listen to them.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.300
They are bad people.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.940
Once we restrain them,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.636
we'll go find your companion.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.940
Sunshine Blade...

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:34.530
You are Cai Zhao?

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:35.930
Uncle Zhou,

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.650
long time no see

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.010
since childhood.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.780
How have you been?

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.210
Kid,

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.050
why attack me?

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.260
My aunt grew up in Peiqiong Manor

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.410
and could recognize

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.213
the Zhous' swordsmanship blindfolded.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.090
I don't have eyes on my back,

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.130
but I saw your shadow.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.300
Your sword

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.780
is in the Moonlight Drinking stance,

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:00.530
a close combat technique.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.260
They were so far apart.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.780
Uncle Zhou,

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.490
who exactly are you trying to kill?

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.210
Actually, I...

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.170
I felt it was strange

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.980
in the ice cave.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.460
Seeing the corpse of your kin,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:14.980
you kept digging in his hands.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.170
You didn't come

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.010
for your son

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:25.570
but for the saliva.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.690
That is Yulin's item.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.740
Zhao, if I wanted to harm you,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.090
why did I risk my life to protect you?

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.490
That was the reason

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.650
that I dismissed my doubts.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.780
That's why I healed you.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.860
Now, I see.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.940
It was just a ruse.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:42.410
Zhao,

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.340
we are both from the Six Sects.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.690
I was friends with your aunt.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.570
Why say this?

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:47.860
That's exactly why

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.300
I didn't want to believe it,

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.130
but just now,

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.340
I had no choice but to confirm.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.420
You schemed for the saliva.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.650
What exactly do you want with it?

00:38:04.193 --> 00:38:05.460
Young lady, what are you doing?

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.940
I heard saliva melts in fire.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.420
If Uncle Zhou

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:09.780
doesn't explain today,

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.260
I'll destroy it

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.130
to keep it from falling into evil hands.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.900
Zhou Zhiqin, tell her!

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.420
I did it for Jianghu's safety,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.050
bearing humiliation,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.050
mingling with these demon sect people,

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.736
to prevent them
from practicing evil arts

00:38:26.376 --> 00:38:27.380
and endangering everyone.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.820
Evil arts?

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.940
It's called the Ziwei Method.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.650
This method

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.570
was powerful

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:35.570
and invincible.

00:38:36.095 --> 00:38:37.562
Later, Nie Hengcheng somehow acquired

00:38:37.573 --> 00:38:38.940
its cultivation method,

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.090
and it became the root of all disasters.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:45.420
So, practicing the Ziwei Method
needs the saliva.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.010
What Ziwei Method?

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.370
I don't know.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.130
Careful!

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.980
Did Zhou Zhiqin work with you

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.260
for the Ziwei Method?

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.140
Correct.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.980
My master Nie Hengcheng

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.610
only reached the third layer

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.130
and was already invincible.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.610
Mr. Zhou wants to practice it,

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.090
obviously to become
the Lord of Peiqiong Manor,

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.780
so he worked with Elder Tianji and me.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.050
Is that right,

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.610
Mr. Zhou?

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.900
Duan Jiuxiu, Elder Tianji

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.690
was already killed by my aunt.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.490
Why is he still alive?

00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:46.901
