00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:46.505
Hello.

00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:47.738
- Hello.
- You're here.

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:49.438
Hello.

00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.605
Welcome.

00:00:57.438 --> 00:00:59.605
Taxi!

00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:04.938
I'll explain later.

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:05.972
Please sit.

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:07.905
You don't need to explain.

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:12.438
I'm sorry, but I wasn't informed
about this blind date today.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.805
I said I'll explain everything.

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:17.172
Please, have a seat first.

00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:21.672
No, I think this happened because
my mother doesn't know who I'm seeing.

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:24.305
I apologize for what happened today.

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:26.972
Let's just pretend this never happened.

00:01:29.972 --> 00:01:31.372
Hey!

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:33.072
Hey!

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:50.538
Jang Hui Won?

00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:08.038
What? Why are you here, Hui Won?

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:10.738
Well, I...

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:24.738
Don't do this blind date.

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:32.905
I like you.

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.305
This is me.

00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:32.072
Oh, that was quick.

00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:33.072
Indeed.

00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:36.272
If you have any questions
about the blind date...

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:40.105
You didn't know it was a blind date,
and your mother arranged it on her own.

00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:42.772
I've almost memorized it.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.472
It's late. You should go.

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:53.638
Wow, seeing this place like this,
it looks really beautiful.

00:03:53.638 --> 00:03:55.672
What time are you going to work tomorrow?

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:57.705
- Why do you ask?
- I was thinking we could go together.

00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:01.772
Huh? We mustn't let it show at work. Okay?

00:04:01.772 --> 00:04:03.205
I know that much.

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:05.238
But just in case.

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:10.338
Shall we just take one more
quick walk around here?

00:04:10.338 --> 00:04:13.805
So we ended up walking two more laps.

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:15.605
You should go now.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:17.705
We'll see each other at work anyway.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.438
Got it.

00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:23.905
But

00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:25.772
is what you said earlier for real?

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:29.938
You know, all that stuff about being clingy
and that we should go our separate ways.

00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:31.572
I'm not sure if I really believe this.

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:35.472
I'm also worried you might
change your mind again.

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:37.172
It's a bit...

00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:39.605
I mean, it's just...

00:04:48.172 --> 00:04:49.872
Ugh, whatever.

00:04:51.438 --> 00:04:54.472
Wow, such a clear answer.

00:04:55.972 --> 00:04:59.205
Oh dear, oh dear.

00:04:59.205 --> 00:05:01.505
What an embarrassment!

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:03.538
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes.

00:05:03.538 --> 00:05:07.005
Did you know Du Jun is seeing someone?

00:05:07.005 --> 00:05:09.872
Is the young master dating someone?

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:14.372
I need to know if it's true
or if he's just making excuses.

00:05:14.372 --> 00:05:18.405
And besides, that Mi Ran.
I don't think she's the one I'm looking for.

00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:22.938
Her tone and voice are different, I'm sure.

00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:26.672
I should have seen her face
back then somehow.

00:05:26.672 --> 00:05:28.472
Anyway,

00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:31.272
please see

00:05:31.272 --> 00:05:33.172
if you can find her.

00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:34.672
Yes, understood.

00:05:34.672 --> 00:05:41.238
Oh dear.

00:05:57.205 --> 00:06:00.072
Ugh, jeez.

00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:02.972
Ah, I'm being so foolish.

00:06:15.572 --> 00:06:17.705
Yes, hello?

00:06:17.705 --> 00:06:18.738
Did you sleep well?

00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:19.972
Yes.

00:06:19.972 --> 00:06:22.238
Did you sleep well, President?

00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:23.505
Yeah, I also slept well.

00:06:23.505 --> 00:06:24.772
President, didn't you say

00:06:24.772 --> 00:06:28.972
you usually can't sleep well
because of insomnia or something?

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.238
That's right. I usually can't sleep well.

00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:33.705
But thanks to someone, I slept like a baby.

00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:37.938
Not because of the blind date, right?

00:06:37.938 --> 00:06:40.372
Ah... well, I was pretty
wiped out from it after all.

00:06:40.372 --> 00:06:42.272
What?

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:46.205
Ah, I...

00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:47.538
already miss you.

00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:50.538
I kind of miss you too.

00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:52.305
Today's Kang Du Jun.

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:54.005
What did you just say?

00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:55.505
Did you call me by my name?

00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:56.705
Say it again.

00:06:56.705 --> 00:06:58.672
Huh? Say what?

00:06:58.672 --> 00:07:00.538
You just said my name.

00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:02.405
Just say it one more time.

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:03.405
No.

00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:06.505
Why? It felt friendly and nice. Just once.

00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:07.672
I'm hungry.

00:07:07.672 --> 00:07:09.705
Aren't you hungry, President?

00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:10.705
Why are you changing the subject?

00:07:10.705 --> 00:07:12.238
I usually don't eat breakfast.

00:07:12.238 --> 00:07:15.705
But if someone asked me
to eat together, I might gladly join.

00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:19.672
It's not like I'm saying
we have to eat together right now.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:23.372
Jang Hui Won, you know,
you're really good at torturing people.

00:07:23.372 --> 00:07:25.405
Hope torture.

00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:28.072
Well, I guess that's my charm.

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:29.805
Jeez.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:34.181
I'm in a rush and need to get ready.

00:07:34.181 --> 00:07:35.717
We'll

00:07:35.717 --> 00:07:39.538
have a meal together soon.

00:07:39.538 --> 00:07:41.238
I'll hang up now.

00:07:42.938 --> 00:07:44.672
[Jang Hui Won]

00:07:46.672 --> 00:07:48.905
We.

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:51.038
Right, 'we.'

00:07:54.638 --> 00:07:55.638
Good morning.

00:07:55.638 --> 00:07:58.438
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.

00:07:58.438 --> 00:08:00.005
Manager Jang, anything good happening lately?

00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:02.172
Right, you're looking
especially bright today.

00:08:02.172 --> 00:08:04.438
Oh, this... it's just...

00:08:04.438 --> 00:08:05.838
- Just what?
- What is it?

00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:07.705
Oh, well...

00:08:07.705 --> 00:08:09.438
It's a dress to cover my belly.

00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:11.872
I've gained some weight recently, you see.

00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:14.172
Just pretend you don't notice.

00:08:14.172 --> 00:08:15.938
Sorry.

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:20.872
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:50.572
You look pretty today.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.372
[Jang Hui Won]
Makes me want to ask you out.

00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:56.105
What?

00:08:56.105 --> 00:09:00.305
[President Kang Du Jun]
Why don't you try kidnapping me then?

00:09:18.205 --> 00:09:22.038
Secretary Go, please set your phone
to vibrate in public places.

00:09:22.038 --> 00:09:24.305
Ah, just a moment.

00:09:28.272 --> 00:09:29.438
I'm sorry.

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:31.672
If you're going to apologize,
do it properly, okay?

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:40.197
Ugh.

00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:42.772
- Now.
- What's now?

00:09:42.772 --> 00:09:43.838
- What?
- What is it?

00:09:43.838 --> 00:09:46.772
Now's the perfect time
to have a snack before lunch.

00:09:46.772 --> 00:09:48.172
- So it's now.
- Manager.

00:09:48.172 --> 00:09:49.672
Do you still feel bitter about
not getting any snacks?

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:53.672
You ate all the madeleines Se Hyeon
brought from France last time,

00:09:53.672 --> 00:09:54.705
and I didn't get any.

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:56.272
- Me neither.
- What a shame.

00:09:56.272 --> 00:09:58.605
- But the two of us ate them.
- We did?

00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:01.038
- It's because of his three kids.
- You didn't get any back then?

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:02.038
What?

00:10:02.038 --> 00:10:05.838
I'll bring something more delicious
for everyone next time, except Manager Nah.

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:08.613
Fine, I'll go on a trip too
and buy for everyone except Se Hyeon.

00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:10.538
Oh, my.

00:10:10.538 --> 00:10:12.038
Team Leader!

00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:13.738
To boost work efficiency,
how about a snack break?

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:18.272
In my opinion, work efficiency would
skyrocket if you would just stop talking.

00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:20.972
Everyone, dismissed!

00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:22.905
The snack delivery is here!

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:25.672
Oh my goodness.

00:10:25.672 --> 00:10:28.572
It seemed like the perfect snack time.

00:10:28.572 --> 00:10:29.638
As expected of our president!

00:10:29.638 --> 00:10:31.238
President, I respect and love you.

00:10:31.238 --> 00:10:33.838
How did you even think
to get snacks for us too?

00:10:33.838 --> 00:10:35.538
Because it's pretty.

00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:40.405
The desserts looked so pretty,

00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:42.705
so I thought it'd be nice
if we all shared them.

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:45.605
They say beautiful things taste good too,
and this is completely delicious.

00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:48.305
I know, it's completely sweet and refreshing.

00:10:48.305 --> 00:10:51.938
I wonder who they're for?

00:10:51.938 --> 00:10:54.338
Here, have some drinks too.

00:10:58.272 --> 00:11:00.805
We have a meeting, so we'll head out first.

00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:02.472
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:11:02.472 --> 00:11:06.372
I made it super tangy, with lots of ice.

00:11:06.372 --> 00:11:08.472
- Secretary Go.
- Oh, jeez.

00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:11.438
- Secretary Go.
- Oh, that startled me.

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:12.572
Yes, I'm going.

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:15.105
Ah, then I'll take my leave too.

00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:16.838
Yes.

00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:22.705
[I Love U]

00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:24.438
Team Leader, you said you weren't
going to have any snacks?

00:11:24.438 --> 00:11:26.705
Oh, I have to try this one.

00:11:26.705 --> 00:11:28.638
It's really tasty.

00:11:28.638 --> 00:11:31.972
I don't know why I get
so tired after just eating lunch.

00:11:31.972 --> 00:11:34.172
It's a food coma, total food coma.

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:35.472
- Yeah.
- Want to grab coffee?

00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:37.305
Sure, where to?

00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:39.072
That cafe you mentioned back then.

00:11:39.072 --> 00:11:40.805
- Cute!
- Let's try it.

00:11:40.805 --> 00:11:43.772
That cafe in front of
the company you mentioned.

00:11:43.772 --> 00:11:45.672
Then let's go to the cafe
in front of that company.

00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:46.705
Manager.

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:47.738
- Huh?
- Are you hot?

00:11:47.738 --> 00:11:50.885
Right, why is your face so red?

00:11:50.885 --> 00:11:52.272
Oh.

00:11:52.272 --> 00:11:53.872
It suddenly got hot.

00:11:53.872 --> 00:11:55.872
Aren't you feeling hot?

00:11:56.505 --> 00:11:57.972
Am I the only one feeling this hot?

00:11:57.972 --> 00:11:59.038
Assistant Manager, are you hot?

00:11:59.038 --> 00:12:00.738
I'm cold.

00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:03.605
- What?
- What?

00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:04.905
What?

00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:05.972
So you do all kinds of things, huh?

00:12:05.972 --> 00:12:07.405
Darn it, stop copying me.

00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:09.272
What did you say? What did you say?

00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:11.005
What did you say?

00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:13.972
Oh dear.

00:12:13.972 --> 00:12:16.738
You're making such a scene
just to show it off. Totally losing it, huh?

00:12:16.738 --> 00:12:17.905
Did it show?

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:18.938
Yeah, totally.

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:22.738
Why are you just openly walking around
like it's Day 1 of dating?

00:12:22.738 --> 00:12:25.472
Hui Won said we absolutely
shouldn't let it show.

00:12:25.472 --> 00:12:27.738
But if even her yawns are that cute,
what am I supposed to do?

00:12:27.738 --> 00:12:30.005
What are you supposed to do?

00:12:32.772 --> 00:12:35.438
But she did look tired.

00:12:35.438 --> 00:12:36.572
Si Hyeong, aren't you tired?

00:12:36.572 --> 00:12:37.938
No, I'm not tired.

00:12:37.938 --> 00:12:39.738
All of this is because
I've been keeping myself in shape.

00:12:39.738 --> 00:12:41.638
No, you must be tired, Si Hyeong.

00:12:41.638 --> 00:12:43.438
Especially after going out
to buy dessert earlier.

00:12:43.438 --> 00:12:45.438
I drove, so I'm not tired at all.

00:12:45.438 --> 00:12:48.738
No, Si Hyeong, you're clearly
exhausted right now.

00:12:48.738 --> 00:12:51.372
Look at your face,
dark circles and dull skin.

00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:52.572
- You didn't sleep last night, did you?
- No.

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:53.605
I said I'm not tired.

00:12:53.605 --> 00:12:54.638
No.

00:12:54.638 --> 00:12:57.405
You're exactly in need of a break right now.

00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:07.105
We have an urgent announcement.

00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:10.805
For the next two hours,
to help our staff recharge,

00:13:10.805 --> 00:13:12.272
the President has initiated nap time...

00:13:12.272 --> 00:13:13.405
Nap time?

00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:14.672
This is the first time, right?

00:13:14.672 --> 00:13:17.738
So, does that mean every employee
is being forced to rest for two hours?

00:13:17.738 --> 00:13:20.772
More than forced, isn't it considerate?

00:13:20.772 --> 00:13:22.172
Wow, as expected of our president.

00:13:22.172 --> 00:13:24.472
The perks are amazing.

00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:28.672
No more yawning in front of colleagues.

00:13:28.672 --> 00:13:30.338
It's way too dangerously charming.

00:13:30.338 --> 00:13:32.838
What? Is he allowed to do this?

00:13:32.838 --> 00:13:33.972
Oh, jeez.

00:13:33.972 --> 00:13:35.805
What?

00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:36.805
Is that your boyfriend?

00:13:36.805 --> 00:13:38.805
Pardon?

00:13:38.805 --> 00:13:39.838
Why are you so happy?

00:13:39.838 --> 00:13:40.872
Manager, do you have a boyfriend?

00:13:40.872 --> 00:13:42.105
What, you didn't even tell us?

00:13:42.105 --> 00:13:45.172
What boyfriend? He's just a friend.

00:13:45.172 --> 00:13:47.438
I mean, when would I have time to date?

00:13:47.438 --> 00:13:49.872
True, she's always all about work.

00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:51.505
When would she even have time to see a guy?

00:13:51.505 --> 00:13:52.872
That's true.

00:13:52.872 --> 00:13:55.172
Exactly, I'm working even now.

00:13:55.172 --> 00:13:56.372
Se Hyeon.

00:13:56.372 --> 00:13:59.472
Can you send me the file
you were supposed to send?

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:01.205
Yes.

00:14:08.805 --> 00:14:11.238
Manager, could it be that
she really has a boyfriend?

00:14:11.238 --> 00:14:13.272
Right?

00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:15.872
Manager Jang does seem different today.

00:14:15.872 --> 00:14:17.505
I totally get the vibe of being in love.

00:14:17.505 --> 00:14:21.205
No, really. Why is everyone
suddenly so interested in me today?

00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:22.572
I really don't have a boyfriend.

00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:23.572
So drop this now.

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:26.105
Come on, if you have one, just tell us.

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:27.138
Your skin looks different though?

00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:29.505
Don't tell me yesterday...

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:31.305
- It changed?
- Yeah.

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:36.772
Jeez.

00:14:36.772 --> 00:14:37.772
Manager.

00:14:37.772 --> 00:14:39.205
Here for the contest meeting?

00:14:39.205 --> 00:14:40.772
Isn't that scheduled for the afternoon?

00:14:40.772 --> 00:14:42.738
No.

00:14:42.738 --> 00:14:45.638
Ah, yes, correct.

00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:47.472
- But...
- So you came to see Manager Jang?

00:14:47.472 --> 00:14:48.805
I'll call Manager Jang for you.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.538
No need.

00:14:52.421 --> 00:14:54.053
I just told you...

00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:01.138
Oh, I didn't come to see Hui Won.

00:15:01.138 --> 00:15:04.438
Ah, the meeting is this afternoon.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:07.005
That should be in the group chat notice.

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:10.638
I'll double-check and then...

00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:12.005
Yeah? Then I'll tell Manager Jang.

00:15:12.005 --> 00:15:14.338
- No.
- Fine, go ahead.

00:15:14.338 --> 00:15:15.938
- I'll go ahead.
- Yeah.

00:15:15.938 --> 00:15:19.005
Manager, I'll confirm it
and come back this afternoon.

00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:21.138
Sure, Assistant Manager Cha.

00:15:21.138 --> 00:15:23.138
- Take care.
- Yes.

00:15:26.172 --> 00:15:28.238
President, on the office floor,

00:15:28.238 --> 00:15:30.038
Mr. Lee is here.

00:15:30.038 --> 00:15:32.005
Who?

00:15:32.005 --> 00:15:33.338
How dare he come here?

00:15:33.338 --> 00:15:34.938
Then I'll send him back.

00:15:34.938 --> 00:15:37.772
No, send him in.

00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:39.472
Yes.

00:15:45.005 --> 00:15:47.738
I've committed an unforgivable sin.

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:50.272
Please forgive me just this once.

00:15:50.272 --> 00:15:51.905
How predictable.

00:15:51.905 --> 00:15:54.272
If you betrayed me for this,
I'm disappointed.

00:15:54.272 --> 00:15:55.305
I'll do anything.

00:15:55.305 --> 00:15:57.038
If you just let me redo the sculpture...

00:15:57.038 --> 00:15:58.672
A dog that bites its owner

00:15:58.672 --> 00:16:01.905
will bite again when cornered.

00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:03.605
Why should I give

00:16:03.605 --> 00:16:06.605
someone like you another chance?

00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:11.805
A dog only does what it's told, doesn't it?

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:15.305
I'll prove I'm more than that.

00:16:15.305 --> 00:16:18.905
Now you sound like an artist. Interesting.

00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:24.672
Wait for my call.

00:16:24.672 --> 00:16:27.038
Go take a bath.

00:16:39.272 --> 00:16:42.272
Is it really right to keep going with this?

00:16:42.272 --> 00:16:43.305
Manager Jang.

00:16:43.305 --> 00:16:45.772
About next year's new product line...

00:16:50.338 --> 00:16:51.405
Manager.

00:16:51.405 --> 00:16:52.972
- What?
- Do you happen to have

00:16:52.972 --> 00:16:56.138
the file that summarizes the new product
lineup for the first half of next year?

00:16:56.138 --> 00:16:59.238
The team leader is looking for it,
but I haven't...

00:16:59.238 --> 00:17:01.305
- finished organizing it yet.
- Oh, that one?

00:17:01.305 --> 00:17:03.738
One moment.

00:17:03.738 --> 00:17:05.805
Here, this one.

00:17:05.805 --> 00:17:07.538
Thank you.

00:17:10.438 --> 00:17:12.205
Is something bothering you?

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:14.838
You've been sighing nonstop since earlier.

00:17:14.838 --> 00:17:19.072
I'm just worried whether non-alcoholic beer
has real commercialization potential.

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:21.872
Oh, because of the contest?

00:17:22.805 --> 00:17:24.005
It is challenging.

00:17:24.005 --> 00:17:26.805
Since it's non-alcoholic, it's hard
to be sure there'll be enough demand.

00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:30.138
So I'm seriously wondering
if I should switch to a different idea.

00:17:30.138 --> 00:17:34.138
But I tend to trust your instincts.

00:17:34.138 --> 00:17:36.293
- Pardon?
- Everything you've planned so far

00:17:36.293 --> 00:17:37.905
has been good.

00:17:37.905 --> 00:17:41.972
I think good products usually
start with wanting to solve

00:17:41.972 --> 00:17:44.172
someone's inconvenience.

00:17:44.172 --> 00:17:46.238
Like the Try Golden Ratio Glass.

00:17:46.238 --> 00:17:49.672
It was made for people
who struggle with mixing ratios.

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:51.372
Right.

00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:53.905
- Wasn't it?
- And besides,

00:17:53.905 --> 00:17:57.772
isn't it your style to just go for it first?

00:17:57.772 --> 00:17:59.505
Assistant Manager Choi.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:01.705
Thank you.

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:03.738
I really appreciate it too.

00:18:07.372 --> 00:18:11.572
The idea of wanting to solve
an inconvenience,

00:18:12.872 --> 00:18:17.305
and a beer people can enjoy
together in a healthy way.

00:18:18.738 --> 00:18:19.938
Huh? Non-alcoholic?

00:18:19.938 --> 00:18:23.605
So you're going for
non-alcoholic beer for the contest?

00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:25.305
Manager Nah's high-proof beer

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:27.105
versus Manager Jang's non-alcoholic beer.

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.938
You two are on total
opposite ends of the spectrum.

00:18:28.938 --> 00:18:31.072
Don't you know non-alcoholic
has limited market potential?

00:18:31.072 --> 00:18:32.938
Marketability is part
of the judging criteria.

00:18:32.938 --> 00:18:34.705
The global non-alcoholic beer market

00:18:34.705 --> 00:18:37.372
is growing 8 to 10% annually.

00:18:37.372 --> 00:18:40.905
Now's the chance to capture
the emerging market early.

00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:43.405
Come on, why drink if you
don't want to get drunk?

00:18:43.405 --> 00:18:47.738
Come on, so many young people
prioritize health nowadays.

00:18:47.738 --> 00:18:51.338
Thinking people drink just to get drunk
is such an old-school mindset.

00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:53.172
- Old-school.
- Among American youth,

00:18:53.172 --> 00:18:56.605
they say sober curious has become
a real social phenomenon.

00:18:56.605 --> 00:18:58.938
The culture of enjoying alcohol
without getting drunk is growing...

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:00.905
Sober Mercury or whatever, I'm against it.

00:19:00.905 --> 00:19:02.138
Go ask around college campuses.

00:19:02.138 --> 00:19:04.005
Who prefers non-alcoholic over high-proof?

00:19:04.005 --> 00:19:05.872
Right, Assistant Manager Cha?

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:10.138
What do you think?

00:19:10.138 --> 00:19:11.638
Well,

00:19:11.638 --> 00:19:14.005
from selling to various stores,

00:19:14.005 --> 00:19:16.605
both feasibility and marketability

00:19:16.605 --> 00:19:19.238
are far superior for high-proof beer.

00:19:20.005 --> 00:19:21.805
See?

00:19:22.572 --> 00:19:26.505
But if we were just going to go
with familiar, safe ideas,

00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:29.438
I don't think they'd bother
holding a contest like this.

00:19:29.438 --> 00:19:32.205
The whole point is
innovation and fresh ideas,

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:33.805
so this is when we need
a differentiated perspective.

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:36.538
No, innovation doesn't
mean unprofitable ideas.

00:19:36.538 --> 00:19:39.005
We won't know profitability until we try.

00:19:39.005 --> 00:19:40.905
I'll do market research by next week.

00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:42.238
All I need to do is prove

00:19:42.238 --> 00:19:44.572
whether non-alcoholic beer will resonate

00:19:44.572 --> 00:19:46.905
with young people or not, right?

00:19:52.605 --> 00:19:53.805
Would that be okay?

00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:58.405
I'm on your side, Manager, but my friends
might think differently, so...

00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:00.072
Then that's exactly what we need.

00:20:00.072 --> 00:20:01.772
Pardon?

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:04.738
Manager Nah has a point.

00:20:04.738 --> 00:20:06.472
I acknowledge that somewhat.

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:10.005
I've always heard 'it's impossible,'
now I'll show it works.

00:20:10.005 --> 00:20:11.438
The real question for me is

00:20:11.438 --> 00:20:13.538
what kind of non-alcoholic beer

00:20:13.538 --> 00:20:16.005
could actually change the market.

00:20:16.005 --> 00:20:18.472
Oh, Manager.

00:20:21.072 --> 00:20:22.772
Um, would you mind heading in first?

00:20:22.772 --> 00:20:25.138
I need to talk with Assistant Manager Cha.

00:20:25.138 --> 00:20:27.338
Oh, sure.

00:20:31.905 --> 00:20:35.572
Well, shall we talk for a moment?

00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:46.138
I have something to tell you.

00:20:48.105 --> 00:20:50.872
Can I go first?

00:20:50.872 --> 00:20:56.038
Have you talked with the President?
About the blind date.

00:20:56.038 --> 00:20:57.172
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:58.805
Min Uk, you're so thoughtful.

00:20:58.805 --> 00:21:01.505
You're always kind to me.

00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:03.405
What's that mean? Of course I'd...

00:21:03.405 --> 00:21:05.038
It's not a given.

00:21:05.038 --> 00:21:09.538
Putting others before yourself
is incredibly hard.

00:21:11.072 --> 00:21:13.338
I think

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.672
that might be why I liked you.

00:21:15.672 --> 00:21:16.772
Huh?

00:21:16.772 --> 00:21:18.405
But thinking back,

00:21:18.405 --> 00:21:23.438
I confused gratitude with romantic feelings.

00:21:23.438 --> 00:21:25.605
Actually,

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:27.438
I went to his blind date.

00:21:27.438 --> 00:21:29.305
You went there?

00:21:29.305 --> 00:21:31.238
There was a misunderstanding.

00:21:31.238 --> 00:21:33.438
Before your call,

00:21:33.438 --> 00:21:36.605
I wasn't sure about my feelings.

00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:39.838
But once I heard about the blind date,
that's when I realized it.

00:21:42.905 --> 00:21:45.672
I like the President.

00:21:45.672 --> 00:21:49.038
Sorry, I can't give the answer you want.

00:21:52.905 --> 00:21:55.038
- I knew it.
- Huh?

00:21:55.038 --> 00:21:57.238
I've known you for years.

00:21:57.238 --> 00:22:01.072
I didn't confess to you
without being prepared for this much.

00:22:01.072 --> 00:22:03.538
And I don't think this is over yet.

00:22:03.538 --> 00:22:07.038
- Min Uk.
- I want to see this through.

00:22:07.038 --> 00:22:10.905
So please don't cut it off so decisively.

00:22:13.638 --> 00:22:15.372
I'll go ahead.

00:22:39.397 --> 00:22:41.061
Oh.

00:22:42.277 --> 00:22:45.538
It seems you basically handles
all the work around here.

00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:47.338
President.

00:22:47.338 --> 00:22:48.905
Why? Is something wrong?

00:22:48.905 --> 00:22:50.738
You don't look well.

00:22:50.738 --> 00:22:54.638
No, it's just that I have a lot on my plate,
and my belly keeps growing.

00:22:54.638 --> 00:22:56.472
I'm starting to feel a bit pressed.

00:22:56.472 --> 00:22:57.972
Even when handing things over,

00:22:57.972 --> 00:23:01.238
I want to make it easy
for the next person to follow.

00:23:01.238 --> 00:23:02.438
- That's cool.
- Huh?

00:23:02.438 --> 00:23:03.572
I mean, you are cool.

00:23:03.572 --> 00:23:06.438
Your passion for work, and the way
you think about your coworkers.

00:23:06.438 --> 00:23:09.405
Wait, you just realized that now?

00:23:09.405 --> 00:23:11.205
I guess so.

00:23:13.405 --> 00:23:15.905
If I wanted to know more, what should I do?

00:23:24.005 --> 00:23:25.372
What? Is someone there?

00:23:25.372 --> 00:23:26.672
There shouldn't be anyone here.

00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:28.805
Quick, hide!

00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:30.572
Over there, over there.

00:23:31.905 --> 00:23:35.505
But if any employee is here at this hour...
There shouldn't be anyone.

00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:38.338
Don't worry. I've confirmed everyone left.

00:23:38.338 --> 00:23:41.572
Then, would you like to eat in my office?

00:23:41.572 --> 00:23:42.605
Shall we?

Team Leader Bang and Secretary Go?

00:23:45.372 --> 00:23:47.072
Hold on.

00:23:47.072 --> 00:23:50.605
What's this smell? Smells delicious.

00:23:53.772 --> 00:23:55.272
What smell could it be?

00:23:55.272 --> 00:23:57.772
It's the smell of my heart burning.

00:23:57.772 --> 00:24:00.505
I'm hungry. Let's go in and eat.

00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:02.205
Noona.

Oh, noona.

00:24:09.338 --> 00:24:11.438
So he's dating Team Leader Bang?
Just the two of them?

00:24:11.438 --> 00:24:12.672
He's finally gone crazy.

00:24:12.672 --> 00:24:14.372
Oh my, oh my.

00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:18.072
It's now. Get out quickly.

I can't get one on the app either.

00:24:30.072 --> 00:24:32.538
I should've just gone to get the car keys.

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:35.638
Even so, they seem to be on a date.
Let's not get in the way.

Jeez.

00:24:36.972 --> 00:24:38.772
Still, if you catch a cold...

00:24:38.772 --> 00:24:40.772
This won't do. I'll just call
Secretary Go to bring the car now.

No, please don't.

Oh, a taxi's here.

- Get in.
- Should I go?

Okay.

- I'll call Secretary Go to bring the car.
- No, please don't.

Am I being too sensitive?

Ugh.

Of all people, a blind date

Does Hui Won know about this too?

Should I tell her, or not?

I shouldn't have stepped aside.

Is something wrong?

00:26:40.405 --> 00:26:41.538
You've been acting strange lately.

Did she dump you?

00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:57.272
You reminded me of myself, the way
I used to drink after I broke up.

00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:01.105
- Why are you here?
- The owner called me.

00:27:01.105 --> 00:27:04.238
She said my friend is here, moping alone.

00:27:05.505 --> 00:27:07.638
Just kidding. She told me
to come take care of you.

She asked why the three of us
haven't been hanging out lately.

Are you disappointed it's not Hui Won?

It's not that.

I just feel like I had so many chances,
and I let them all slip away.

00:27:33.505 --> 00:27:37.105
I thought courage was only
needed to confess your feelings.

But it turns out,

You just realized that now?

Maybe I'm just being stupidly naive.

00:32:11.605 --> 00:32:12.938
Mother and Father,

00:32:12.938 --> 00:32:15.972
if they hear you are the person
he is marrying, they'd be delighted.

00:32:15.972 --> 00:32:17.405
We'll handle that ourselves.

00:32:17.405 --> 00:32:19.805
Why, if she's a woman you brought,

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:23.338
even my late husband would have liked her.

00:32:24.372 --> 00:32:27.738
Oh, can you actually hold hands now?

00:32:27.738 --> 00:32:29.438
Jeong Eum.

00:32:30.838 --> 00:32:32.872
Stop this.

00:32:32.872 --> 00:32:34.505
We'll head out first.

00:32:34.505 --> 00:32:36.305
Let's go.

00:32:46.738 --> 00:32:50.138
Does he even realize his wallet's missing?

00:32:51.372 --> 00:32:55.405
Not a single call, and making me
wait all the time.

00:32:57.605 --> 00:32:58.672
Oh, Dad.

00:32:58.672 --> 00:33:00.238
You're getting off work soon, right?

00:33:00.238 --> 00:33:01.472
Yeah, a little later.

00:33:01.472 --> 00:33:03.472
Did you call to ask about that?

00:33:03.472 --> 00:33:05.105
Oh no, that's not it.

00:33:05.105 --> 00:33:08.138
Hey, are you free tomorrow?

00:33:08.138 --> 00:33:11.238
Huh? What is it? This feels really familiar.

00:33:11.238 --> 00:33:14.005
I've arranged an absolutely
amazing blind date.

00:33:14.005 --> 00:33:15.538
Just go for it once.

00:33:15.538 --> 00:33:17.805
Just do it. No questions.

00:33:18.472 --> 00:33:22.405
Dad, after what happened
last time, another blind date?

00:33:22.405 --> 00:33:24.305
I'm not doing it, really not doing it.

00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:27.405
Come on, you know last time
doesn't count, right?

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:30.138
This time it's not just good conditions.

00:33:30.138 --> 00:33:34.372
Good conditions plus a really nice person.

00:33:34.372 --> 00:33:36.672
You know your dad has
high standards for people, right?

00:33:36.672 --> 00:33:40.605
Enough. If you keep talking like that,
I'm hanging up. I'm busy. Goodbye.

00:33:41.338 --> 00:33:43.972
Ah, enough with the blind dates.

00:33:43.972 --> 00:33:46.338
I prefer to meet people naturally.

00:33:49.072 --> 00:33:50.172
Alright.

00:33:50.172 --> 00:33:53.472
I'll find someone who likes me for me.

00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:01.605
Is something going on between those two?

00:34:01.605 --> 00:34:05.072
Her late husband, that would be
the President's brother?

00:34:05.072 --> 00:34:08.238
But what does that have to do
with the hand-holding?

00:34:10.538 --> 00:34:12.172
Wow, I...

00:34:12.172 --> 00:34:16.505
I truly never imagined you two were family.

00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:20.472
So that means she's Se Hyeon's mom?

00:34:20.472 --> 00:34:23.505
Ah, what a small world.

00:34:23.505 --> 00:34:26.805
Now that you mention it
they do resemble each other a bit.

00:34:31.205 --> 00:34:33.238
President.

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.972
- Yes?
- Are you okay?

00:34:35.972 --> 00:34:38.272
What? I'm fine.

00:34:38.272 --> 00:34:40.172
Eat quickly, it's getting cold.

00:34:40.172 --> 00:34:41.938
Yes.

00:34:45.238 --> 00:34:48.672
So when did you first meet my sister-in-law?

00:34:48.672 --> 00:34:50.872
The first time?

00:34:50.872 --> 00:34:52.705
Uh...

00:34:52.705 --> 00:34:53.838
Well...

00:34:53.838 --> 00:34:55.338
Ah! That day.

00:34:55.338 --> 00:34:57.905
The day I confirmed my pregnancy
at that hospital.

00:34:57.905 --> 00:35:00.672
Then how many times have you met?

00:35:00.672 --> 00:35:02.238
When and where?

00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:05.072
Why are you asking?

00:35:05.072 --> 00:35:06.538
Just curious.

00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:08.705
Don't overthink it, just eat.

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:26.272
The date ended so quick.

00:35:26.272 --> 00:35:28.372
What's your purpose
in approaching Jang Hui Won?

00:35:28.372 --> 00:35:31.205
Didn't I already say I'd give
Taehan Group to Se Hyeon?

00:35:31.205 --> 00:35:33.105
Purpose?

00:35:33.105 --> 00:35:35.205
I already said it was a coincidence earlier.

00:35:35.205 --> 00:35:38.305
If you touch Jang Hui Won,
I won't hold back anymore.

00:35:38.305 --> 00:35:41.405
Is that how someone who promised
Taehan Group behaves?

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:43.538
You're still acting like this.

00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:46.038
How can I trust you?

00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:53.472
Do you still blame me for my brother's death?

00:35:53.472 --> 00:35:56.872
Because of the guilt I felt,
I've lived the way you wanted.

00:35:56.872 --> 00:36:01.105
I just did the basics without greed,
taking over what my brother wanted to do.

00:36:01.105 --> 00:36:04.238
Even so, what are you so afraid of?

00:36:04.238 --> 00:36:06.205
You were the one who crossed the line.

00:36:06.205 --> 00:36:09.872
Now I'll protect my loved ones too.

00:36:10.872 --> 00:36:12.705
I'm curious.

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:16.338
I'll be looking forward to it.

00:36:16.338 --> 00:36:19.772
You'll have to do your best to protect them.

00:36:27.272 --> 00:36:29.738
Oh, Professor Lee, nice to see you.

00:36:29.738 --> 00:36:33.205
Professor Lee, why is it so hard
to have one meal together?

00:36:33.205 --> 00:36:35.272
- Well...
- Let's meet more often.

00:36:35.272 --> 00:36:38.872
We're not going to put up walls
just because you're a lecturer.

00:36:38.872 --> 00:36:40.272
Yes.

00:36:40.272 --> 00:36:43.838
Well, my eldest son
is getting married this time.

00:36:43.838 --> 00:36:45.672
So I wanted to treat you to a meal.

00:36:45.672 --> 00:36:46.838
Make some time.

00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:49.438
Oh, Professor, congratulations.

00:36:49.438 --> 00:36:51.572
People these days
aren't getting married much.

00:36:51.572 --> 00:36:52.672
Exactly.

00:36:52.672 --> 00:36:55.738
We've been worried about
non-marriage and stuff,

00:36:55.738 --> 00:36:57.905
and now he's finally getting married.

00:36:57.905 --> 00:36:59.672
Not marrying is a problem,

00:36:59.672 --> 00:37:02.972
but meeting people and breaking up
too easily is also a big issue.

00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:06.372
They divorce like it's nothing.

00:37:06.372 --> 00:37:08.938
And what about those
who have shotgun weddings?

00:37:08.938 --> 00:37:12.338
These days, they don't even
consider that a big deal.

00:37:12.338 --> 00:37:14.472
What is the world coming to?

00:37:14.472 --> 00:37:17.705
We need to keep a close eye on the kids.

00:37:17.705 --> 00:37:21.372
But is that really that bad?

00:37:23.705 --> 00:37:26.205
If they don't take responsibility, then yes.

00:37:29.338 --> 00:37:30.672
That's right, but...

00:37:30.672 --> 00:37:33.738
Whether it's shotgun weddings or divorce,
they're paths people choose.

00:37:33.738 --> 00:37:38.272
Having others judge that recklessly feels

00:37:38.272 --> 00:37:39.372
not right, I think.

00:37:39.372 --> 00:37:42.472
Well, Professor Lee has a point.

00:37:42.472 --> 00:37:43.572
Right?

00:37:43.572 --> 00:37:46.005
Professor, I'm really looking forward to it.

00:37:46.005 --> 00:37:48.338
Where are we going this time?

00:37:57.405 --> 00:38:01.438
Seriously, just looking at the steak,
and now ramyeon?

00:38:08.205 --> 00:38:11.338
I don't think he even got to eat much.

00:38:13.472 --> 00:38:17.005
[President Kang Du Jun]

00:38:25.072 --> 00:38:26.105
Yes, President.

00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:28.638
- What are you doing?
- Well...

00:38:29.305 --> 00:38:31.638
[Growing Hops Malts]
Rea... reading.

00:38:31.638 --> 00:38:32.638
Reading?

00:38:32.638 --> 00:38:34.505
Yes, as a hobby.

00:38:34.505 --> 00:38:39.238
When I find parts I like while reading,
I scrapbook them.

00:38:40.505 --> 00:38:42.872
Anyway, sorry for
sending you home so suddenly.

00:38:42.872 --> 00:38:44.672
Something urgent came up.

00:38:44.672 --> 00:38:46.638
It's okay, don't worry about it.

00:38:46.638 --> 00:38:48.305
I just felt bad, that's why.

00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:50.905
It was our first date
since we started dating.

00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:55.938
President, are you the type to read
too much into things like that?

00:38:55.938 --> 00:38:57.872
Absolutely, I really read
too much into things.

00:38:57.872 --> 00:38:59.572
So let's just void this one.

00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:01.738
- Void?
- Just name anywhere you want to go.

00:39:01.738 --> 00:39:03.472
I'll prepare properly next time.

00:39:03.472 --> 00:39:05.805
You mean

00:39:05.805 --> 00:39:06.905
anywhere?

00:39:06.905 --> 00:39:08.372
Hurry up!

00:39:08.372 --> 00:39:09.905
- No, this place is...
- Quickly.

00:39:09.905 --> 00:39:12.472
I said hurry up.

00:39:12.472 --> 00:39:13.938
Ta-da!

00:39:13.938 --> 00:39:17.005
I told you to pick wherever you want,
but why an amusement park?

00:39:17.005 --> 00:39:18.372
You probably can't even ride properly.

00:39:18.372 --> 00:39:20.705
I only come here for the churros, you know?

00:39:20.705 --> 00:39:22.438
No time. Let's go, quick.

00:39:22.438 --> 00:39:25.472
- Quick, quick!
- Why eat churros here?

00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:28.072
Hey!

00:39:28.072 --> 00:39:29.205
I don't wear headbands like this.

00:39:29.205 --> 00:39:31.238
This one, this one.

00:39:31.238 --> 00:39:32.938
This is better.

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:36.505
But isn't this so exciting?

00:39:36.505 --> 00:39:38.905
The weather's perfect too.

00:39:38.905 --> 00:39:40.838
Do you like it that much?

00:39:40.838 --> 00:39:42.572
Yes.

00:39:44.472 --> 00:39:46.205
Crazy.

00:39:46.205 --> 00:39:47.438
You really can't ride that.

00:39:47.438 --> 00:39:50.372
I know. Who even rides that?

00:39:51.038 --> 00:39:52.972
Wow.

00:39:52.972 --> 00:39:55.538
Then I'll take this one.

00:39:58.505 --> 00:40:00.405
Why am I riding this?

00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:02.538
President! President!

00:40:02.538 --> 00:40:03.838
Look here!

00:40:03.838 --> 00:40:05.205
President!

00:40:05.205 --> 00:40:08.072
Look here, over here!

00:40:23.772 --> 00:40:25.572
Thank you.

00:40:27.838 --> 00:40:29.272
- Yum.
- Is it delicious?

00:40:29.272 --> 00:40:30.672
Yes.

00:40:30.672 --> 00:40:32.838
Slow down, you'll get indigestion.

00:40:34.072 --> 00:40:36.238
You got it all over your lips.

00:41:00.605 --> 00:41:03.072
Wow, there's something
really pretty over there.

00:41:03.072 --> 00:41:05.072
Let's go.

00:41:16.772 --> 00:41:19.372
- I don't have to ride.
- It's fun to ride together.

00:41:19.372 --> 00:41:22.572
This is actually my first time on a carousel.

00:41:22.572 --> 00:41:26.672
I never went to amusement parks
with my family as a kid.

00:41:26.672 --> 00:41:29.938
Later with friends,
I mostly rode extreme rides.

00:41:29.938 --> 00:41:33.638
Ah, thanks to our Yeol Mu,
I finally get to ride this.

00:41:33.638 --> 00:41:36.138
Wow, this is fun.

00:41:38.772 --> 00:41:40.038
Why are you waving your hand?

00:41:40.038 --> 00:41:42.338
It's customary to wave
when you're on a carousel.

00:41:42.338 --> 00:41:44.638
People take pictures, you know.

00:41:52.072 --> 00:41:53.872
Get off carefully.

00:42:04.938 --> 00:42:07.172
Why won't you hold my hand?

00:42:09.029 --> 00:42:10.605
Oh.

00:42:10.605 --> 00:42:14.238
- Well...
- Please exit safely.

00:42:16.038 --> 00:42:17.772
They're telling us to exit.

00:42:26.738 --> 00:42:28.872
I've heard a lot about you from the director.

00:42:28.872 --> 00:42:30.772
At the company, he constantly
brags about you, Mi Ran.

00:42:30.772 --> 00:42:32.672
He says you're such a kind daughter.

00:42:34.605 --> 00:42:35.738
Here, use this.

00:42:35.738 --> 00:42:38.238
Yes, thank you.

00:42:39.205 --> 00:42:41.138
Did my dad really say that?

00:42:41.138 --> 00:42:42.772
- Yes.
- That doesn't sound like him.

00:42:42.772 --> 00:42:45.138
I asked the director first

00:42:45.138 --> 00:42:46.538
if I could meet you, Mi Ran.

00:42:46.538 --> 00:42:49.005
Thank you so much for coming again.

00:42:49.005 --> 00:42:50.738
Not at all.

00:42:50.738 --> 00:42:52.705
Now, I too,

00:42:52.705 --> 00:42:56.805
want to meet someone who likes me.

00:43:03.738 --> 00:43:05.872
Use this.

00:43:05.872 --> 00:43:08.372
Have some cake too.

00:43:08.372 --> 00:43:12.772
What? He's so considerate and sweet.

00:43:12.772 --> 00:43:14.538
Just like Cha Min Uk.

00:43:14.538 --> 00:43:17.238
Mi Ran, enjoy your meal.

00:43:20.738 --> 00:43:23.972
Mi Ran! Mi Ran!

00:43:26.572 --> 00:43:29.005
- Mi Ran?
- Yes?

00:43:29.005 --> 00:43:30.738
Ah, I'm sorry. What did you say?

00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:32.838
Please tell me everything you like, Mi Ran.

00:43:32.838 --> 00:43:34.972
Favorite foods, hobbies.

00:43:34.972 --> 00:43:37.172
I want to know it all.

00:43:37.172 --> 00:43:38.872
What you enjoy.

00:43:38.872 --> 00:43:40.538
Oh, me?

00:43:40.538 --> 00:43:43.205
I like a lot of things.

00:43:43.205 --> 00:43:44.938
I like shopping,

00:43:44.938 --> 00:43:48.238
and I love eating delicious food.

00:43:51.605 --> 00:43:53.172
I'll walk you home.

00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:55.072
If that's uncomfortable, at least nearby.

00:43:55.072 --> 00:43:56.072
No need.

00:43:56.072 --> 00:43:58.405
It looked like something
urgent came up at work.

00:43:58.405 --> 00:43:59.405
You should go check quickly.

00:43:59.405 --> 00:44:02.505
It's not as urgent as walking you home.

00:44:02.505 --> 00:44:03.638
I'm really fine.

00:44:03.638 --> 00:44:05.838
I'll get home quickly if I take a taxi.

00:44:08.672 --> 00:44:10.805
Then let's go shopping together next time.

00:44:10.805 --> 00:44:14.572
I'll definitely walk you home then.

00:44:15.338 --> 00:44:16.838
Take care.

00:44:16.838 --> 00:44:18.538
Yes.

00:44:28.672 --> 00:44:30.338
He's a really good person.

00:44:30.338 --> 00:44:33.338
Wow, everything about him is great.
But he's not Cha Min Uk.

00:44:33.338 --> 00:44:36.038
I guess I just like Cha Min Uk.

00:44:37.572 --> 00:44:39.772
If it's not Cha Min Uk,

00:44:40.538 --> 00:44:42.638
it just doesn't work.

00:44:55.038 --> 00:44:57.405
And what about those
who have shotgun weddings?

00:44:57.405 --> 00:45:00.238
These days, they don't even
consider that a big deal.

00:45:00.238 --> 00:45:02.205
What is the world coming to?

00:45:02.205 --> 00:45:05.738
We need to keep a close eye on the kids.

00:45:08.197 --> 00:45:10.021
Jeez.

00:45:16.305 --> 00:45:18.693
[Hui Won]

00:45:21.072 --> 00:45:23.005
The subscriber you are calling
is not available.

00:45:23.005 --> 00:45:26.205
What could she be doing at this hour?

00:45:26.205 --> 00:45:27.505
And she's with child.

00:45:27.505 --> 00:45:28.901
[Hui Won]

00:45:30.838 --> 00:45:32.838
The subscriber you are calling
is not available.

00:45:32.838 --> 00:45:35.805
She doesn't even realize
I said that for her own good.

00:45:38.105 --> 00:45:41.272
Now she won't even talk to me? What is this?

00:45:53.305 --> 00:45:55.238
But your hand...

00:45:55.238 --> 00:45:57.138
Aren't you tired?

00:45:58.005 --> 00:45:59.405
I'm okay.

00:45:59.405 --> 00:46:01.805
It was fun getting some fresh air
after a while.

00:46:01.805 --> 00:46:04.938
- But President...
- The food there wasn't great earlier.

00:46:04.938 --> 00:46:07.238
I wanted to treat you to something delicious.

00:46:07.972 --> 00:46:10.305
It was fine.

00:46:13.038 --> 00:46:15.338
I'm getting tired now.

00:46:15.338 --> 00:46:16.838
I should go home and rest.

00:46:16.838 --> 00:46:18.638
Oh? Then get some rest now.

00:46:18.638 --> 00:46:20.772
I'll wake you when we get there.

00:46:50.638 --> 00:46:52.838
Why do you keep avoiding my hand?

00:46:52.838 --> 00:46:54.805
- Huh?
- My hand.

00:46:54.805 --> 00:46:57.272
You keep avoiding it.

00:46:57.272 --> 00:46:59.438
- It's not...
- I'm not saying this to you in a bad way.

00:46:59.438 --> 00:47:00.772
I just don't want to get the wrong idea.

00:47:00.772 --> 00:47:04.038
I need to know so I can help or understand.

00:47:04.038 --> 00:47:06.038
Is there a reason?

00:47:06.838 --> 00:47:09.172
A reason why you can't hold hands?

00:47:10.838 --> 00:47:12.272
President!

00:47:12.272 --> 00:47:14.605
Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:47:14.605 --> 00:47:16.538
Oh, Mom.

00:47:16.538 --> 00:47:19.272
And you said 'President'?

00:47:20.072 --> 00:47:22.738
Nice to meet you. My name is Kang Du Jun.

00:47:22.738 --> 00:47:25.572
This is the person I mentioned.

00:47:27.572 --> 00:47:30.638
Wait, so the man who got you pregnant

00:47:30.638 --> 00:47:31.905
is the President at your company?

00:47:31.905 --> 00:47:33.738
I was just about to tell you.

00:47:33.738 --> 00:47:35.272
What do you expect to do now?

00:47:35.272 --> 00:47:36.872
Are you just playing around with an employee?

00:47:36.872 --> 00:47:40.405
Surely you're not thinking of
just throwing money at this later, right?

00:47:40.405 --> 00:47:41.705
Just because you're the President,
does that make it okay?

00:47:41.705 --> 00:47:42.872
Mother, first of all, I'm truly sorry.

00:47:42.872 --> 00:47:44.105
Don't call me that!

00:47:44.105 --> 00:47:46.438
Mom, please calm down.

00:47:46.438 --> 00:47:47.605
You're just the same.

00:47:47.605 --> 00:47:49.238
Do you even have a plan?

00:47:49.238 --> 00:47:52.805
If people find out,
how are you going to deal with it?

00:47:52.805 --> 00:47:54.638
Is that why you said you won't get married?

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:57.438
Because it's obvious
his family would oppose it?

00:47:57.438 --> 00:48:01.172
Why did you let things
get this far, you idiot!

00:48:01.172 --> 00:48:02.538
Please stop.

00:48:02.538 --> 00:48:04.572
How far are you going to embarrass me?

00:48:04.572 --> 00:48:06.405
You told me it's my life
and to live it my way,

00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:08.605
regret it, cry myself sick, whatever!

00:48:08.605 --> 00:48:10.072
You said you'd keep it no matter what.

00:48:10.072 --> 00:48:11.372
You said you won't get married!

00:48:11.372 --> 00:48:14.372
Then what on earth are you going to do?

00:48:14.372 --> 00:48:16.372
Do you think raising a child alone is easy?

00:48:16.372 --> 00:48:18.038
- Is raising a child a joke?
- I also...

00:48:18.038 --> 00:48:19.605
I also want to get married.

00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:21.472
Do you know why I said
I wouldn't get married?

00:48:21.472 --> 00:48:25.672
Do you think I don't want
a normal family like everyone else?

00:48:25.672 --> 00:48:27.572
It's all because of you, Mom.

00:48:27.572 --> 00:48:30.872
You never showed me a single day
of happiness after you got married.

00:48:30.872 --> 00:48:33.738
How could I follow that path when I saw that?

00:48:46.272 --> 00:48:47.272
I...

00:48:47.272 --> 00:48:49.438
I completely understand your concerns.

00:48:49.438 --> 00:48:51.405
I will do my utmost to protect Hui Won
and the child from getting hurt.

00:48:51.405 --> 00:48:53.338
I'll protect them with everything I have.

00:48:53.338 --> 00:48:55.472
So,

00:48:55.472 --> 00:48:58.172
please trust me a little

00:48:58.172 --> 00:49:00.038
and watch over us.

00:49:00.038 --> 00:49:01.738
I'm sorry.

00:49:20.438 --> 00:49:22.138
Here.

00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:28.338
I'm sorry. This is embarrassing.

00:49:28.338 --> 00:49:29.405
What's embarrassing?

00:49:29.405 --> 00:49:31.672
It's not your fault.

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.672
Actually, I was also

00:49:38.305 --> 00:49:41.338
born before my parents got married.

00:49:42.938 --> 00:49:44.705
My mom and dad

00:49:44.705 --> 00:49:48.938
really liked each other even though
they were young, so that part was fine.

00:49:48.938 --> 00:49:54.238
But soon after I was born,
my dad started cheating constantly.

00:49:56.005 --> 00:49:58.005
Because of that,

00:49:58.005 --> 00:50:02.938
my mom suffered raising me,

00:50:02.938 --> 00:50:05.038
and they ended up divorcing

00:50:05.038 --> 00:50:08.805
before I even started elementary school.

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:14.272
Now, whenever she sees me,
I guess she thinks of my dad.

00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:17.805
Well,

00:50:17.805 --> 00:50:19.638
I grew up without receiving love.

00:50:19.638 --> 00:50:21.772
That's why

00:50:21.772 --> 00:50:24.772
I didn't want to get married either,

00:50:25.705 --> 00:50:29.272
and I resent my mom
so much for making me this way,

00:50:30.338 --> 00:50:34.305
but I feel like such a fool
because I can't bring myself to leave her.

00:50:34.305 --> 00:50:39.738
Anyway, my mom has always been
unfinished homework for me.

00:50:41.605 --> 00:50:43.572
I understand completely.

00:50:43.572 --> 00:50:46.172
Everyone's got some
unfinished homework in their life.

00:50:46.172 --> 00:50:47.905
And mine

00:50:51.005 --> 00:50:54.438
is in my hands, my homework.

00:51:05.509 --> 00:51:07.685
Uh!

00:51:08.572 --> 00:51:10.305
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:51:26.172 --> 00:51:27.938
Han Jun, pull yourself together!

00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:33.105
Hurry, Han Jun!

00:51:39.705 --> 00:51:41.238
If this keeps up, you'll be in danger too.

00:51:41.238 --> 00:51:42.338
- Don't!
- Let go.

00:51:42.338 --> 00:51:44.072
No, I can't.

00:51:44.072 --> 00:51:45.938
- Just let go!
- I can't.

00:51:45.938 --> 00:51:48.072
Du Jun.

00:51:48.072 --> 00:51:49.872
Let go of my hand.

00:51:50.738 --> 00:51:52.038
It's my last request.

00:51:52.038 --> 00:51:53.672
Don't let go.

00:51:53.672 --> 00:51:56.072
Don't give up, please.

00:51:56.072 --> 00:51:58.338
Han Jun, no! Han Jun!

00:51:58.338 --> 00:52:00.038
Han Jun!

00:52:10.372 --> 00:52:14.305
Han Jun! Han Jun!

00:52:16.572 --> 00:52:21.072
After that day, whenever someone
touched my hand, even slightly,

00:52:21.072 --> 00:52:23.838
my body would freeze automatically.

00:52:23.838 --> 00:52:25.938
I'm sorry. I didn't know any of that.

00:52:25.938 --> 00:52:27.672
No,

00:52:27.672 --> 00:52:29.472
I'm the one who's sorry for
all the misunderstandings.

00:52:29.472 --> 00:52:31.338
Everyone has different circumstances,

00:52:31.338 --> 00:52:34.438
even if size or weight is different.

00:52:34.438 --> 00:52:37.572
So, you don't need to make yourself small.

00:52:37.572 --> 00:52:40.738
Don't apologize either, okay?

00:52:49.705 --> 00:52:52.172
It must have been terrifying.

00:52:53.805 --> 00:52:57.838
Sometimes, no matter how much
you want to prevent it,

00:52:57.838 --> 00:53:01.305
there are things beyond your control.

00:53:01.972 --> 00:53:04.005
Your brother probably knew it too.

00:53:04.005 --> 00:53:08.205
How desperate you were to save him then,

00:53:08.205 --> 00:53:13.138
and how much you long for him now.

00:53:34.838 --> 00:53:37.038
Thank you for making time.

00:53:37.038 --> 00:53:38.805
I can assume that your presence here

00:53:38.805 --> 00:53:43.005
means we share the same intentions, right?

00:53:44.772 --> 00:53:46.338
Our intentions might align,

00:53:46.338 --> 00:53:48.072
but given the high risk,

00:53:48.072 --> 00:53:52.472
the executives deserve proper compensation.

00:53:54.172 --> 00:53:55.205
Of course.

00:53:55.205 --> 00:53:57.872
Early next year, we're launching
the Taehan Hotel chain.

00:53:57.872 --> 00:54:03.005
We're planning a total of five branches
in Gangnam, Busan, and Jeju.

00:54:04.905 --> 00:54:09.372
If you help us out this time, you'll get
a seven percent stake in each hotel.

00:54:09.372 --> 00:54:11.105
Seven percent?

00:54:14.472 --> 00:54:18.872
Once I give the signal,
just do your part as planned.

00:54:18.872 --> 00:54:22.272
Shall we discuss this in private,
Vice Chairman?

00:54:22.272 --> 00:54:24.505
Ah, shall we?

00:54:28.005 --> 00:54:30.038
Big news! Big news!

00:54:30.038 --> 00:54:31.038
Big news!

00:54:31.038 --> 00:54:33.172
- What is it?
- Haven't you all seen the Office Talk chat?

00:54:33.172 --> 00:54:34.738
Something interesting?

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:37.072
Ugh, probably just someone complaining
about the company again.

00:54:37.072 --> 00:54:38.372
No, that's not it.

00:54:38.372 --> 00:54:39.372
At our company,

00:54:39.372 --> 00:54:43.838
there's an employee pregnant
with the President's baby!

00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:47.672
Is that true?

00:54:47.672 --> 00:54:48.672
President's baby?

00:54:48.672 --> 00:54:50.038
No, that's just a rumor.

00:54:50.038 --> 00:54:51.772
Better make a good impression
on the female employees.

00:54:51.772 --> 00:54:53.705
Come on, that can't be true.

00:54:56.613 --> 00:54:58.501
It can't be, right?

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:12.869
[Anonymous board]

00:55:15.038 --> 00:55:17.272
Whoa, she seduced the President?

00:55:17.272 --> 00:55:19.372
With so many eyes on her
at work, she's quite bold!

00:55:19.372 --> 00:55:20.505
More like she has two hearts?

00:55:20.505 --> 00:55:23.505
Congrats on making your dream of
a successful marriage come true!

00:55:23.505 --> 00:55:25.772
Why blame just the employee?
The President could have seduced her.

00:55:25.772 --> 00:55:28.638
No way. Gotta admit we've got
literal goddesses at our company though.

00:55:28.638 --> 00:55:31.305
Pregnant with the President's kid,
promotion is basically automatic. So jealous.

00:55:31.305 --> 00:55:32.305
Why bother with promotion?

00:55:32.305 --> 00:55:33.672
She can just quit and live off
his money raising the kid.

00:55:33.672 --> 00:55:34.972
The wild part is

00:55:34.972 --> 00:55:38.238
that recliner sofa recently
probably is for her?

00:55:49.538 --> 00:55:50.805
What? What happened?

00:55:50.805 --> 00:55:52.572
- Who was it?
- No idea.

00:55:52.572 --> 00:55:56.172
Office Talk is anonymous by nature.

00:55:57.205 --> 00:55:58.805
What are you going to do?

00:55:58.805 --> 00:56:01.372
I should check on Hui Won.
She must be worried.

00:56:01.372 --> 00:56:02.938
Huh? Are you kidding?

00:56:02.938 --> 00:56:05.272
Don't you realize all the employees
are watching you right now?

00:56:05.272 --> 00:56:06.572
They're all on fire,

00:56:06.572 --> 00:56:10.238
trying to see who you talk to
and who you meet.

00:56:14.405 --> 00:56:15.905
I'm dying to know who it is.

00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:18.538
Seriously, if it were me,
I couldn't come to work.

00:56:18.538 --> 00:56:19.538
Is there a way to figure out who she is?

00:56:19.538 --> 00:56:21.438
Come on, I think it's just a rumor.

00:56:21.438 --> 00:56:25.172
Pregnant women can't drink,
so won't she get caught pretty fast?

00:56:25.172 --> 00:56:26.172
Manager Jang.

00:56:26.172 --> 00:56:27.672
Do you have anyone in mind as suspicious?

00:56:27.672 --> 00:56:30.072
Ah, well...

00:56:30.072 --> 00:56:31.838
I'm not sure.

00:56:34.672 --> 00:56:38.138
The test batch
of the domestic hop ale beer is ready.

00:56:38.138 --> 00:56:40.438
- Test batch?
- It was made based on Manager Jang's idea,

00:56:40.438 --> 00:56:42.172
so I want you to try it first.

00:56:42.172 --> 00:56:44.672
Here, have a taste.

00:56:45.505 --> 00:56:49.738
Oh, Team Leader Bang! What's the occasion?

00:56:53.005 --> 00:56:54.905
Manager Jang?

00:56:54.905 --> 00:56:58.005
If she's got a boyfriend,
she could just say so.

00:57:09.872 --> 00:57:11.772
Can't you see everyone's waiting?

00:57:33.738 --> 00:57:34.805
Manager Jang.

00:57:34.805 --> 00:57:36.538
Try it.

00:57:37.538 --> 00:57:39.772
Are you not drinking or...

00:57:39.772 --> 00:57:41.905
Can't you drink?

00:57:41.905 --> 00:57:43.505
Well, I...

00:57:43.505 --> 00:57:47.138
I think I know why you can't drink.

00:57:47.138 --> 00:57:49.038
Manager Jang,

00:57:50.272 --> 00:57:52.072
are you pregnant?

00:58:02.905 --> 00:58:05.005
What are you doing right now?

00:58:17.405 --> 00:58:20.305
[Epilogue]

00:58:20.305 --> 00:58:22.705
But you know, when I look at you,
you're really thoughtful.

00:58:22.705 --> 00:58:25.405
I have always been a sensitive guy.

00:58:25.405 --> 00:58:27.805
Must have scored points with women that way.

00:58:27.805 --> 00:58:29.072
Points?

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:33.205
Taking good care of people and treating
them like royalty is my specialty.

00:58:33.205 --> 00:58:34.772
I used to be really popular back in the day.

00:58:34.772 --> 00:58:36.138
Wow, that brings back memories.

00:58:36.138 --> 00:58:38.238
Thanks to you, I really remember now.

00:58:38.238 --> 00:58:39.272
I see.

00:58:39.272 --> 00:58:41.005
Then yesterday must have been quite fun too.

00:58:41.005 --> 00:58:43.738
Yesterday? What was special about yesterday?

00:58:44.872 --> 00:58:47.038
Oh, noona.

00:58:47.805 --> 00:58:49.505
Huh?

00:58:51.705 --> 00:58:53.405
Si Hyeong.

00:58:55.172 --> 00:58:59.638
Stop pretending you
don't know and just spill it.

00:58:59.638 --> 00:59:01.972
I'm all ready to listen.

00:59:03.272 --> 00:59:04.472
Not talking?

00:59:04.472 --> 00:59:06.172
About what?

00:59:06.905 --> 00:59:09.905
Why are you like this? Just say it.

00:59:09.905 --> 00:59:12.372
What is this, some new torture?

00:59:12.372 --> 00:59:15.705
Torture? If anyone heard,
they'd think I'm bullying you.

00:59:15.705 --> 00:59:17.538
- You've been
- Huh?

00:59:17.538 --> 00:59:18.905
- having
- Yeah.

00:59:18.905 --> 00:59:20.105
- quite a good time
- Yeah.

00:59:20.105 --> 00:59:22.572
behind my back lately, haven't you?

00:59:22.572 --> 00:59:24.172
Me?

00:59:24.172 --> 00:59:25.638
Si Hyeong.

00:59:25.638 --> 00:59:28.238
You're really not going to tell me, huh?

00:59:28.238 --> 00:59:30.438
You took my car yesterday,
and I even let you have it.

00:59:30.438 --> 00:59:32.138
Didn't you leave work right away yesterday?

00:59:32.138 --> 00:59:33.772
- I didn't.
- What?

00:59:33.772 --> 00:59:35.238
If you needed a car, you should've called me.

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.772
I was at the office until late.

00:59:36.772 --> 00:59:38.305
I know, you even had late-night snacks.

00:59:38.305 --> 00:59:41.572
Yeah, the late-night snacks were delicious.

00:59:45.672 --> 00:59:47.505
How did you know?

00:59:50.105 --> 00:59:52.105
Who...

00:59:54.272 --> 00:59:56.005
- Never mind.
- Oh, you scared me.

00:59:56.005 --> 00:59:57.005
Keep doing what you were doing.

00:59:57.005 --> 00:59:58.872
I'll handle it myself.

01:00:02.605 --> 01:00:04.305
Jeez.

01:00:09.338 --> 01:00:12.605
I know exactly what he's up to.

01:00:45.005 --> 01:00:46.772
What's the real reason you can't drink?

01:00:46.772 --> 01:00:49.305
Has anyone seen Manager Jang
drinking recently?

01:00:49.305 --> 01:00:50.305
Pregnant?

01:00:50.305 --> 01:00:51.372
Then the person
at the center of that rumor is...

01:00:51.372 --> 01:00:53.438
Taehan Liquor's President Kang Du Jun...

01:00:53.438 --> 01:00:54.605
Du Jun, we're in big trouble.

01:00:54.605 --> 01:00:57.072
There's no woman or child involved.

01:00:57.072 --> 01:01:00.405
Before you get more hurt,
break up with him and run away.

01:01:00.405 --> 01:01:01.605
[Kang Du Jun Out!]
Thousands of people's livelihoods

01:01:01.605 --> 01:01:04.572
- depend on your one word.
- Out!

01:01:04.572 --> 01:01:05.705
Big news!

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:07.805
They're holding a press conference
at 3 PM today.

01:01:07.805 --> 01:01:09.772
So, are they going to say
who the woman in the rumor is?

01:01:09.772 --> 01:01:12.772
From now on, there's nothing Hui Won can do.

01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:16.905
How about we just pretend
we don't know each other?
