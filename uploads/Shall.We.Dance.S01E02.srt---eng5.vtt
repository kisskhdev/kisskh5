(Zhen Residence)

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:12.620
(20 years ago,
12th year of Chengshun Reign)

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:19.095
(Xiao Congrong,
Defender-General of the State)

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.420
Xiao Congrong, hear the decree!

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.979
By the Mandate of Heaven,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.900
the Emperor proclaims,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.219
Xiao Congrong
and her husband, Zhen Xiujin,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.900
are charged with treason.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.380
You are hereby ordered to
surrender your military authority

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.460
and await judgment.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.580
That's impossible.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.020
The Zhen family has always
been loyal to the nation.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.979
Someone must be
scheming behind the scenes,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.659
sowing discord between
Xiujin and His Majesty.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.819
Do not be hasty.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.539
His Majesty has a second decree.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.539
His Majesty said

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.779
should General Xiao refuse
to obey the imperial order,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.059
it will be construed as rebellion.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.599
And she, along with the hundred
thousand soldiers of the Xiao Army,

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.260
will be executed.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.619
I don't believe this.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.540
I want to see the decree myself.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.179
My words

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.140
are the decree.

=Episode 2=

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:10.739
(10 years ago,
22nd year of Chengshun Reign)

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.019
Xiao Man, you know,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.979
His Majesty's accession
today was so scary!

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.139
The hall was full of bad people.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.099
But His Majesty was
so tall and majestic,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.339
so handsome and dashing.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.700
He just...

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.900
Have you...

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.300
Have you been crying?

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.499
I'm leaving.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.939
A master has summoned me to serve them.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.539
I don't even know
which palace I'll be sent to.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.220
I won't be able to come here anymore.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.740
Then who's going to take care
of Little Flower's and my dinner?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.419
I've saved up

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.019
these little pastries over a long time.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.899
They're all for you and Little Flower.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.419
Eat more.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.700
That's a lot.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.699
I carved this for a long time.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.299
It's for you.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.300
We might not see each other again.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.459
So let it keep you company

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.179
when I can't.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.299
It really looks like you.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.820
And this one will stand in for you,
to keep me company.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.819
Don't worry.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.860
We'll meet again someday.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.540
I don't want to leave you.

00:03:40.712 --> 00:03:42.820
(Jia Yi, Chief Eunuch)

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.259
Are you Xiao Man?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.340
Yes.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.140
Can you dance?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.299
Huh?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.499
Huh what?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.540
Dance now.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.300
Please be careful.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.700
What are you doing here, Big Flower?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.419
Oh,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.419
I know.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.140
We've been assigned to the same master.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.859
No.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.459
I'm your

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.700
new master.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.219
So you knew Xiao Man, Your Majesty?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.179
No wonder you
specifically requested him.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.859
You're the Emperor?

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.379
I am the Emperor!

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.219
Are you surprised?

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.660
Didn't see this coming, did you?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.539
Long live

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.740
Your Majesty.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.500
We're friends.
You don't have to do that.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.379
How could someone like me

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.939
ever be friends with Your Majesty?

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.059
I want to be friends with you.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.619
If you don't agree,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.179
I'll...

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.300
I'll...

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.779
Careful, Your Majesty!

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.140
I'm not getting up until you agree.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.299
I should've told you earlier.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.419
I'm sorry

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.579
that I scared you.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.659
I won't do that again.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.219
Didn't you say the Emperor
was tall and imposing,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.979
handsome and dashing?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.179
Xiao Man, we'll grow up together.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.499
One day, I'll be tall and imposing,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.699
handsome and commanding.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.180
Are you happy now?

00:05:33.862 --> 00:05:35.419
(Six Months Later,
1st year of Hongzheng Reign)

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.179
Big Flower,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.059
I'm scared.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.179
Leave the kite.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.779
I'll make you another one.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.899
No way.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.260
We made that kite together.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.740
Big Flower!

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.099
Big Flower!

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.779
Big Flower!

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.900
Big Flower!

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.420
These useless servants
failed to protect their master.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.219
Flog them all to death.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.340
Yes, Your Highness.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.819
Your Highness,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.979
please spare the child's life.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.660
Just banish him from the palace.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.540
Disobedient servants

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.620
should be taught a lesson.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.300
Mercy, Your Highness!

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.939
Your Highness,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.299
he's still young.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.700
Please show mercy, Your Highness!

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.460

I'm begging you,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.779
please tell them to stop.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.140
Aunt...

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.300
You care about him?

Stop.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.619
Issue my order,

from the palace.

it's time to attend court.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.180

His Majesty has now reached adulthood.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.579
According to ancestral law,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.619
the Grand Princess
should return authority

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.019
and the Tiger Tally of
the military to His Majesty.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.419
With the border regions unstable

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.739
and the tribes growing restless,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.939
I stationed the army
to protect His Majesty.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.660
What's wrong with that?

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.280
His Majesty has only just taken
personal control of governance.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.819
He hasn't rushed this,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.860
Director Jia hasn't rushed this,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.540
yet you, Minister He,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.459
you seem awfully eager.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.619
Your Highness,

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.499
you are but a woman,

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.780
yet who has held the reins of court for years,
this already runs contrary to propriety.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.099
Now that

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.299
His Majesty has assumed personal rule,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.179
I advise you

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.099
not to defy

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.580
the ancestral precepts.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.179
Minister He,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.539
loyalty to the throne

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.299
knows no distinction
between man and woman.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.899
Such a view is rather
narrow-minded, is it not?

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.580
And it's equally improper for a prince consort
to meddle in state affairs.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.899
You two have been

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.139
backing each other at court

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.619
these days.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.820
Doesn't that

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.819
raise questions about your intentions?

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.579
How impressive, Minister He.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.659
So quick to make baseless accusations.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.660
That is hardly the conduct
of a gentleman.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.420
Your Majesty, please judge clearly.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.120
Since entering public service,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.120
my principle has always been
to side with reason, not kinship.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.339
And in this matter,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.180
reason undeniably
lies with Her Highness.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.099
A well-reasoned argument.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.420
Well-reasoned indeed.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.139
Your Majesty,

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.860
in my humble opinion,

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.040
Her Highness should indeed
return command of the army.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.059
She may then continue to
govern from behind the screen,

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.339
guiding you, Your Majesty.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.059
Wouldn't that

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.140
satisfy all parties?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.800
The Directorate of Ceremonial has
held sway over court affairs for years,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.779
with eyes and ears everywhere.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.859
If I were to hand the command
of the army over to you now,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.020
one wonders, would those soldiers

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.900
pledge loyalty to the name Chu,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.220
or to the name Jia?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.300
Director Jia,

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.099
tell me,

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.340
am I right?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.659
I would never dare.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.339
I only

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.100
wish to spare His Majesty
from petty burdens.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.979
Your Highness, if you act
in this manner,

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.420
I fear the entire court

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.860
will call you a tyrant.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.340
Since you think I'm a tyrant,

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.820
then a tyrant I shall be today.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.660
And as a tyrant,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.180
I am even more convinced now is
not the ideal time to return power.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.420
How wonderful!

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.500
With Aunt to my left,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.379
Director Jia to my right,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.660
and Minister He protecting me
from the front,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.500
it's like being nestled within
a ring of protective mountains.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.739
I do so adore this feeling

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.580
of being utterly sheltered.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.019
His Majesty is an adult now.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.539
Yet he's dancing in the court.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.619
This is utterly improper.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.299
What are

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.019
we to do?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.179
Such childish behavior.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.620
I'm afraid our nation is...

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.139
Mind your tongue!

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.300
Are we just going to say
nothing to His Majesty?

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:07.579
Xiao Man,

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.099
it's time you return to the palace.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.819
Yes,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:10.900
Godfather.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.370
