(Suspect Profile: Liu Yan)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.990
Master.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.310
You already had Liu Yan's info.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.590
Why didn't you tell me?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.430
Are you the captain?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.310
Do I have to report to you?

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.760
You're my captain.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.640
You're my master.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.920
I'm your partner.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.150
You hid it from me on purpose

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.350
just to pin me to the dog theft case, right?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.090
You don't want me in this case.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.950
The dog theft case has huge social impact.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.790
How is that not a major case?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.200
Master, Liu Yan's case is a homicide.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.510
I can't ignore it.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.840
She was clearly poisoned.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.920
Her background is special.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.760
Maybe it's tied

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.520
to the Nude Banquet Case 15 years ago.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.040
You say it's tied, so it is?

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.120
There's zero evidence

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.470
linking the two cases.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.840
Don't let your ego run wild

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.710
or force connections.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.710
I force it?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.630
You even hid

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.750
her info from me.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.870
What choice did I have?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.080
Captain Zhao.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.960
If you don't want the trouble,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.120
I'll take it on myself.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.520
Captain Zhao.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.520
We've heard

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.750
about Liu Yan's case.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.710
The victim's linked to the Nude Banquet Case.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.360
That case is currently under Team One.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.960
We'll take over Liu Yan's case as well.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.960
Why should you?

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.590
Did you follow procedure and file a report?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.870
We'll file it.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.080
We still need

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.190
to add some details.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.120
Once it's done,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.520
I'll have Liu send it over.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.960
Thank you, Captain Zhao.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.470
Master,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.280
you just let them

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.360
take the case?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.080
Wasting your life for 15 years.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.240
What did you say?

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.560
I said, you've been slacking for 15 years.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.270
I heard about it.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.870
After the Nude Banquet Case,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.910
you became like this.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.680
If you fall, get back up.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.430
That's what you taught me.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.270
But

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.030
you fell and just stayed down.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.430
I don't want to deal

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.590
with petty cases anymore.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.870
I've followed you for years.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.910
I just want to work major cases.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.840
I held you back, huh?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.520
Come.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.390
You think only homicides matter.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.350
That cracking one is what gives you face.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.620
Everyone's waiting

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.480
for those dog thieves to be caught.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.240
You think that doesn't matter?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.560
Go explain it to them yourself.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.510
Thanks for the like, Xiaohu.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.600
Thank you.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.240
Thanks for the gift, Xiaohu.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.680
- Thanks, boss.
- You're welcome.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.870
Love you, Xiaohu.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.750
Love you too.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.320
Thank you.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.800
I love you.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.190
You've been on a roll lately.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.040
Here every day.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040
Dropping gifts every day.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.870
Bro, send me 500 yuan.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.710
I'm short.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.720
What do you need that much for?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.080
Bro.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.670
Bro.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.590
Look.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.590
Look.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.110
Do we look good together?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.690
Do we look like a couple?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.130
Look how many people are watching.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.310
She says she loves me.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.110
(Tips)
I think she means it.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.270
You think you two match?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.240
What's wrong with you?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.950
We stake out day and night,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.630
steal dogs and sell them to shelters.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.560
Then you use the money to gift a dog shelter.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.800
Wasn't that stealing for nothing?

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.150
Bro,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.320
what's wrong?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.080
You feeling off?

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.630
Bad stomach?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.560
I told you not to eat so spicy last night.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.210
Hey.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.160
You ordered the food.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.000
Right.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.720
Your phone. I'll leave a bad review.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.480
I'll scare him straight.

Bro.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.630
I know these years haven't been easy.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.640
Look.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.800
Delivery jobs.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.630
Too many bad reviews.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.070
Internet cafes.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.270
Pay was trash.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.320
Finally,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.240
we found

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.720
the right path of dog theft.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.190
Big money's

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.600

I really do.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.840
But,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.630
one thing I don't get.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.430
Why think of my mom?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.160
I just wonder

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.560
how she gave birth to a jerk like you.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.760
I...

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.360
How did she give birth to you?

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.080
Bro, come on.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.960

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.480
Girl, you're really smart.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.750
These days, you gotta raise a dog.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.910
Look.

Other than our parents,

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.680
who truly cares about you?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.190
Who only has eyes for you?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.800
Who waits for you every day?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.120
Who's loyal to you with no doubt?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.600
It's dogs.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.120
Dating these days?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.580
You're better off having a dog.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.110
Right?

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.870
If men were reliable,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.950
dogs would climb trees.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.430
Your dogs are vaccinated, right?

With inspection papers?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.430
Of course.

Rest assured.

I guarantee it.

I don't really know breeds.

I just want to see for myself.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.750
Find one that feels right.

Sure.

Alright, wait here.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.040
I'll go pick one for you.

What are you doing here?

I've picked one for you.

Come take a look.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.720
I don't like this kind.

This one's a Pomeranian.

Girls get prettier raising Poms.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.440
Three months old. Easy to raise.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.160
I like that one.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.750
Didn't expect that.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.550
You're into aggressive breeds.

Just a small one.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.270
Can you pull

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.440
the Nude Banquet Case files?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.600
Let me take a look.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.390
So you're planning
to work behind your master's back?

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.320
You just won't let this go?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.200
Don't say it like that.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.360
I'm not going solo.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.470
Okay?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.390
I can't give you the files.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.680
But

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.000
some details just came back to me.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.200
I will confess.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.840
Bai was already dead.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.390
A... A...

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.240
A stick this thick...

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.320
Two hits to the head.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.480
He dropped on the spot.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.630
I was terrified.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.200
I didn't even

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.510
see who did it

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.630
and I ran.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240
But I'm sure

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.550
Bai was beaten to death.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.910
Liu Yan was tough.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.790
She resisted the whole time.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.440
After several interrogators,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.480
she still wouldn't talk.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.550
In the end, your master stepped in

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.120
under pressure

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.030
and got her confession.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.150
In that case,

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.270
my master knew her well.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.840
He worked hard

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.840
to get that statement.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.440
Now Liu Yan's dead,

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.150
and he doesn't react at all.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.870
Something's off.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.080
Maybe your master isn't wrong.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.320
Your theory on the cases

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.150
is still just a guess.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.670
And the case is with Team One now.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.120
Letting them handle it makes sense.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.720
I know what to do.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.870
We have to support each other.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.870
I'll head back.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.630
Where to?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.840
To see the Chief.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.480
Get the case back.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.390
You're not done, are you?

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.300
You really have to push it?

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.840
I'm not pushing.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.030
We've already started working this case.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.360
We've put in real effort.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.100
I won't just hand it to Team One.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.790
Every problem, you run to the chief.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.670
Forgot police discipline?

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.350
Go back.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.670
You want to talk discipline?

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.720
You lecture me on this and that.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.630
Then talk about this.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.750
You interrogated Liu Yan back then.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.840
She was tied to the Nude Banquet Case.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.440
You got her confession.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.960
Isn't that a little too coincidental?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.910
No matter what,

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.390
you are not going to the Chief.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.600
That's overstepping.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.720
Then I'm overstepping.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.390
They buried this case years ago.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.270
Now new links show up,

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.000
and we ignore it again?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.040
Is that right?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.360
You're retiring.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.720
Not retired yet.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.270
You're still wearing the badge.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.030
I'm getting it today.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.200
You...

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.030
I made you some chamomile tea.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.200
Good for the heat.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.750
Not bad.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.300
(Unknown Number:
Meet up on Dongshan Road.)

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.280
What's up?

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.420
I'm heading out for a bit.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.110
For what?

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.870
Meeting a supplier.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.710
Yimo,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.350
don't overwork yourself.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.320
Go home early.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.680
Long time no see.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.480
You're still punctual.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.920
That's good.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.030
Please transfer

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.150
the Nude Banquet Case to Team Two.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.480
Several cold cases are already with Team One.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.770
Their workload's too heavy.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.670
We should help share the burden.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.840
Liu Yan's case

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.030
was first handled by us.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.630
There's a possibility she was poisoned.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.360
She's also an ex-con

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.120
from the Naked Banquet Case 15 years ago.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.670
The two cases may be linked.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.110
So I believe

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.840
we should handle the Nude Banquet Case

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.150
and consider consolidating the cases.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.630
Your master sent you?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.440
No.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.230
He didn't agree.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.720
He's close to retirement

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.240
and has other thoughts about assignments.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.140
But I'm willing to take responsibility.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.560
What?

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.750
So in your eyes,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600
your master is someone who avoids hard cases?

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.550
That's not what I meant, Chief.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.550
He's not that kind of person.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.920
Why did I

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:58.900
single him out at the meeting?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.200
Back then,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.910
he poured everything into that case.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.880
When it was shelved,

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.320
it weighed on him deeply.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.880
He never let it go.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.880
I just don't know

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.270
what concerns he has this time

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.140
that made him stay silent.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.750
You're young and driven.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.110
That's good.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.270
But don't let your head get too big.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.880
When he was cracking major cases,

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:27.510
you hadn't even grown teeth.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.720
Go talk to him properly.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.880
Find out what he's really worried about.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.590
Understood.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.590
Chief, about the case...

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.110
Team One does have a lot

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.240
on their plate.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.680
You can give it a try first.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.320
Thank you, Chief.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.390
Long time no see.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.720
You're still punctual.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.110
That's good.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.520
Recognize this?

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.750
You gave it to me 15 years ago.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.830
I've kept it carefully ever since.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.640
All these years,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
I haven't forgotten

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.400
anything you gave me.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.310
Get to the point.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.630
One million.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.110
Once the money's in,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.880
I won't take up any more of your time.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.510
One million?

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.320
Why?

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.910
Why?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.240
Buddy,

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.240
I know you're busy.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.830
When Wang Yimo was in Xinjing,

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.550
I can look after her.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.560
Bai,

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.180
if you dare hurt my daughter...

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.910
Swipe right.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.160
Yimo's back and you didn't tell me?

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.240
She's very pretty.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.880
A big girl now.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.320
Bai,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.000
if you hurt my daughter,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.590
I'll turn myself in.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.720
You'll have to go down with me.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.630
Fine.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.840
Anyway,

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.790
I've already died once,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.430
haven't I?

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.790
If Caicai and I don't make it back today,

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.080
take care

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.910
of Wang Yimo.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.540
(Master)

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.750
What's this old man up to?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.680
Liu Yan was released five years ago.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.510
I didn't like her much.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.410
But since we were from the same town,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.350
we'd chat sometimes.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.110
Once she met me, all excited,

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.440
said she was about to have money.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.310
She was so smug.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.390
What money?

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.870
Did she say who it was?

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.480
She didn't say much.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.510
Just mentioned someone from the past.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.880
I didn't press her.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.790
Five years out of prison.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.750
Why silence her now?

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.960
Maodou.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.950
Officer Tang.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.160
You didn't forget my name, did you?

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.920
Aren't cops supposed to have good memories?

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.200
My name's Wang Yimo.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.160
Don't forget it.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.640
Okay. Wang Yimo.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.590
Got it.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.110
You here checking

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.680
on the dog thief again?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.750
I was passing by.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.790
Stopped to eat.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.240
Do you live nearby?

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.960
Our old place is in this neighborhood.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.960
I came to walk the dog.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.210
New one?

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.080
Yeah.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.590
Just got it a few days ago.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.030
My dad's not used to it.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.000
If it barks at night, he can't sleep.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.110
I was thinking of leaving it

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.790
with my bestie for a few days,

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.880
but she's allergic.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.440
So I keep it at the old house

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.590
and come walk it every day.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.640
This area's had a lot of dog thefts.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:13.790
Not safe at night.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:14.680
I'll walk you back.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.040
Okay.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.220
Can I take the leash?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.320
Sure.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.310
Let's go, Maodou.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.590
Why did you move away

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.590
if you used to live here?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.200
For middle school.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.110
My dad used the restaurant money

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.540
to buy a school-district place.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.680
Your parents planned well.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.400
My mom passed away

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.720
when I was little.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.680
It's just my dad and me.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.760
I'm sorry.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.030
It's fine. I barely remember her.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.880
So you went to elementary school nearby too?

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.590
Right there. Huacai Elementary.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.190
Officer Tang,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.960
are you interrogating me?

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.000
Just casual questions.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.110
Don't overthink it.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.310
But honestly,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.400
you look really familiar to me.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.160
Then I'd better be careful.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.160
What if

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.680
you saw me on a wanted poster?

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.110
Baozi's ready.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.750
Just me, Mr. Li.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.150
Where's Zhao?

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.950
Busy.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440
You look upset.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.760
Had a fight?

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.540
(Bagong Dog Shelter)

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.240
Your brain's rebooting?

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.720
Bro.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.400
I have an idea.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.830
That brand-new brain of yours

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.400
finally working?

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.720
Say it.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.550
See that building up ahead?

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:01.680
The brown one?

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:03.590
No.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.720
The one with all glass.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.510
That gray one, right?

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.150
So?

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.790
If that building were mine,

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.830
I'd give you one unit.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.920
The biggest one.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.350
Just one?

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.440
You ungrateful brat.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.350
It's all yours and you only give me one?

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.690
How could you...

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.560
I'm telling you,

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.870
with your kind,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.550
when I'm rich, you won't get a cent.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.630
Hello?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.000
Yes.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.680
Bro, you called.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.160
Got a job for me or what?

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.140
(Bagong Dog Shelter)

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.500
(Bagong Dog Shelter)

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.440
Sir, what kind of dog are you looking for?

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.440
I want the kind

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.680
that's obedient and easy to take care of.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.440
Alright, take a look.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.640
I think this one looks good.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.200
Can you feed it?

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.590
I wanna check its teeth, appetite,

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.000
see how lively it is.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.190
Sure.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.350
No dog food.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.000
Just sausage.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.830
I can't handle anything fancy.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.590
Alright, I'll grab some.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.430
One moment.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.920
Sir,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.480
how about this?

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.750
This sausage, right?

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.310
Yeah, yeah. Feed it.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.320
Alright.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.270
Sir, what do you think?

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.110
Satisfied?

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.000
Good, good. Very satisfied.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.840
It's nice.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.480
Hurry up. No one's around.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.440
I'll keep watch.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.510
Can you be calm?

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.310
Bro, we're just scaring ourselves.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.550
This dog's very obedient.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.640
One sausage and it's done.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.750
Got me all pumped up.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.240
Zip it.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.680
All that cold air.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.550
You'll have the runs.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.060
- Sorry. Next time.
- Pull over.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.520
Stop.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.630
Why are you running?

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.670
(Police)
Pull over. Get off.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.950
Get off.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.950
No helmet.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.680
No double-riding on e-bikes.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.430
Helmet… Uh…

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.720
Officer, we were in a rush

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.160
and forgot.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.750
Please don't fine us.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.650
Life's not easy.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:28.510
Whose life is easy?

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:29.350
Right.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.680
It's dangerous driving. You get that?

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680
Yeah. I understand.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.160
- I think...
- Got it. Got it.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.510
Officer,

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.480
we promise

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.240
it won't happen again.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.190
- Talk's cheap.
- No, it's not.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.080
Alright then.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.480
Let's make this stick.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.620
(Civilized Traffic, Safe Travel)

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.000
Green light.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.040
Go.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.240
Master.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.670
Captain Zhao.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.790
Master. Master.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.150
You're back.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.090
How's the dog-theft case going?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.880
I was just about to report.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.510
I've been looking

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.480
into Liu Yan's social connections.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.010
I told you to stick
with the dog theft case.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.650
Why are you digging into Liu Yan?

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.440
Isn't her case back with us now?

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.480
I have to look into it.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.910
Captain Zhao,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.640
the precincts sent over

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.030
recent dog theft reports.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.160
Some of them

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.310
match the serial theft MO.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.790
They want us to screen them.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.680
The dog-theft case isn't settled yet,

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.200
and you're all in on Liu Yan.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.310
Who's handling the dogs and the owners?

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.910
Give them all to him.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.000
Finish sorting today.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.240
Same rule as always.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.960
Catch the dog thief first.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.400
Stop thinking about Liu Yan.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.000
Let's go.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.110
Just poop.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.720
We've done like 100 laps.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.750
Go, go, go.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.590
Before you recognize here.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.720
Bro,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.590
I can't take this anymore.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.880
This dog poops nonstop.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.790
I'm tossing dog crap all day.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.920
I've lost kilos.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.440
It doesn't just poop. It eats like crazy.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.720
Its food bill's almost ours.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.000
Hurry. Take this.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.800
Hello.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:51.630
The dog's here.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.550
Why so rushed?

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.510
Alright. We'll do it your way.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.280
What's he saying?

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.440
He's pushing us to sell the dog.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:14.240
And specifically to Bagong Dog Shelter.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.400
No way.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.550
Bagong pays too little.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.240
But he said it has to be Bagong.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.590
That's weird.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.830
He never cared who I sold to before.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.550
Now it's gotta be Bagong.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.800
Do you think

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.200
they might be working together?

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.720
Nah. Doesn't seem like it.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.400
He seems alright.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.440
Tang Tang, it's past mealtime.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440
Let's go grab a bite.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.350
I'm not hungry. You guys go.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.390
Liu, Li,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.480
let's go eat.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.720
Yeah, let's go.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.640
Not coming?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.480
Enjoy.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.800
Don't worry about me.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.900
(Lost: Aug 3)

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.100
(Poisoned Sausage Found: Aug 23)

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.820
(Poisoned to Death: Jul 20)

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.550
In that case,

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.070
my master

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.550
knew her well.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.960
Now Liu Yan's dead,

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.550
and he doesn't react at all.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.140
(Poisoned Sausage Found: Aug 23;
Yili Yangguang Teahouse)

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.110
That's what he's been looking into.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.380
(Master)

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.550
Your nose is getting sharp.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.390
Followed the scent here?

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.300
Of course.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.920
How'd you know I made dumplings today?

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.110
I smelled it at the office.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.230
So I rushed all the way over.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.280
Wash your hands.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.680
I'm taking it, okay?

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.990
Dig in.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.680
Master,

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.110
what have you been busy with lately?

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.880
Feels like you're avoiding me.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.670
What are you talking about?

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.510
I've been working a case.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.030
Let me guess.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.550
Liu Yan's case?

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.760
You went without me.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.600
You hid it from me.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.960
Going solo's not nice.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.360
I told you to focus on the dog theft case.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.640
Instead,

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.230
you latched onto Liu Yan's connections

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.150
and chased it.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.550
Poisoning is just a theory.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.710
Don't fit the facts to your theory.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:05.480
I had to check the sausage myself.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.110
Trying to get you to listen

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.960
is like I'm hurting you.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.590
Master,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.760
I came to apologize.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.760
I'm sorry.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.110
Don't investigate alone without me.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.710
I'll listen from now on.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.880
I was worried

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.280
you had things bottled up.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.070
For anyone who like aggressive breeds,

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.000
I recommend a Malinois.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.630
Look at that coat.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.710
Watching dog shelter livestreams?

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:29.950
Suspicious of them?

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.550
This phone screen

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:35.760
is this small.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.070
What you see

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.110
is what they want you to see.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.190
That shelter

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:42.480
look lively,

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.140
keeps bragging about how legit it is,

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.280
calling everyone "loved ones."

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.320
But behind the scenes,

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.190
you have no idea who's involved.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:51.920
You don't know...

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.360
A Malinois is a real showstopper.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.200
That's my dog.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.630
You stole my dog.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.160
Miss.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:02.800
This is my dog.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.880
You stole it.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.960
You got it wrong.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:05.830
Maodou.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.440
Is she the girl at the farmers' market?

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.390
Is she...

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.240
Maodou.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.710
Maodou, run!

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.550
Is it her?

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.020
(Yimo: Maodou's taken! Shelter!
Dog thieves are here! Help me!)
