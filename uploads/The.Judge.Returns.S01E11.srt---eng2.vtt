WEBVTT

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:35.097
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:30.194
How is it?

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.531
To have returned to a world you wanted
in your past life?

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:25.124
Choi Yun-sun,
the Minister of Land and Transport?

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:29.128
I'll make sure homes are no longer bought
solely for speculation.

00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:33.591
As long as I, Choi Yun-sun,
am the Minister of Land and Transport

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:37.928
the green belt will not be harmed
without permission.

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:40.723
Until the day I resign

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:44.226
I vow to be a public servant

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.479
who causes no shame.

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:53.152
She'll join us from today.

00:02:56.822 --> 00:02:59.950
NEW CITY PLANNING FOR HANYANG
AND CLEARING OF THE GREEN BELT IN 2027

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:01.368
MINISTRY OF LAND AND TRANSPORT

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:13.005
I can't believe she's leaking
a public project like this!

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.426
The government will make
an official announcement next fall.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.386
The Presidential election is before that.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:23.182
Will this plan go forward,
even with a new President?

00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:28.604
It doesn't matter who the President is.

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:30.815
The true President of Korea is here

00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:32.858
at Suojae, after all.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:37.988
Come on. What are you doing?

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:41.784
Our Minister of Land and Transport brought
an amazing gift for us.

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:44.662
We have to build condos, bridges

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:46.247
and buildings, you know?

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.414
A round of applause!

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:58.050
And everyone, take your bags.

00:03:58.133 --> 00:03:59.134
Go ahead.

00:04:01.262 --> 00:04:02.388
Hold on.

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:05.599
This is Mr. Kang. Say hi.

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:09.937
Help her out when she needs.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.940
Sin-jin and Gwang-to.

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:14.859
I must stop both of them

00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:17.403
or the country's justice
will be gone for good.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.741
EPISODE 11

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:24.535
All the special activity funds from today

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.496
will be invested into Hanyang City.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.831
Yes, which is why

00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:33.711
I've told all conglomerate executives
to prepare money for the campaign.

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:35.963
Is that enough?

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.884
Whatever the excuse

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:43.679
talk to the President's office
to draw up the supplementary budget.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:45.556
Well...

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.185
the opposition is waiting to strike
with a special activity funds audit.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:51.979
It's not as easy as it sounds.

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:54.899
How can you handle an election
if you're so scared?

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:58.110
Increase the budget
for the special activity fund.

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:00.779
When the proposal reaches the assembly

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:02.948
just offer the opposition something
in return.

00:05:03.032 --> 00:05:06.368
Don't let them decrease
a penny of the special activity fund.

00:05:06.452 --> 00:05:07.620
Do you understand?

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:09.830
Yes, Mr. President.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.420
I let you be the party leader.
It's about time you get to work.

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:18.130
I apologize.

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:21.383
You can go.

00:05:51.038 --> 00:05:52.039
Have a seat.

00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:05.511
Does Your Young Honor realize

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:08.931
where he is right now?

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:14.687
Look at that.

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:20.150
You had the chance
to become the Chief Justice

00:06:20.526 --> 00:06:22.194
yet you couldn't even watch your son.

00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:24.613
I apologize.

00:06:25.698 --> 00:06:27.741
In fact, I've come here

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:30.744
to talk to you about that.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.497
You're retired now.
What more is there to say?

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.917
This was 15 years ago

00:06:38.002 --> 00:06:39.461
but I colluded with S Construction

00:06:39.545 --> 00:06:42.381
and framed an evicted resident
as a victim.

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:44.550
Are you here for a confessional?

00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:46.593
Because that's for a priest, not me.

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:48.137
But

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:51.306
the child of that evictee

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:53.475
became a judge.

00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:57.021
What?

00:06:58.313 --> 00:07:00.190
It's all because of that very judge

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:03.444
that my son suddenly confessed,
leading me to resign.

00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:07.906
So, who is that?

00:07:10.075 --> 00:07:12.202
Judge Lee Han-young

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.455
under Sin-jin.

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:16.623
Mr. Kang told me

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:18.834
this was where people really worked
for the nation.

00:07:20.377 --> 00:07:23.422
I'd like to contribute
to the work for the nation.

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.474
Judge Lee, who'd returned for revenge was

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.727
more manipulative than a snake
and without mercy.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.354
If Sin-jin ever brings him to you

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:40.522
do not trust him

00:07:41.648 --> 00:07:43.275
no matter what.

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:47.071
A rookie judge made a Justice resign

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.781
and Sin-jin is

00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:51.116
behind all that?

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:54.369
I'd like to suggest
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

00:07:57.748 --> 00:08:00.959
But he recommended Nam-yong to my face.

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:05.881
What is he

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:08.217
trying to pull here?

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:19.478
We built Suojae as the shadow government
before the end of Mr. Park's term.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.231
How does it feel?

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.818
To have seen the real powerhouse of Korea.

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:31.448
It was thrilling.

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:33.450
"Thrilling"?

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:36.370
Interesting.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:40.290
I guess I was like you, too.

00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:43.335
I have a question.

00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:47.798
Why did you take me there?

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:52.302
Are you asking if I trust you that much?

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:56.223
No.

00:08:57.975 --> 00:08:59.977
I didn't bring you there
because I trusted you.

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:02.771
I brought you there so you'd trust me.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.232
This is real power.

00:09:06.358 --> 00:09:08.443
So, trust and follow my lead.

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:13.740
The Minister of Land and Transport leaked
a government proposal

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:17.327
which the leader of Suojae is using
to embezzle public funds.

00:09:17.411 --> 00:09:20.914
Suojae has become an ugly cartel
of power and money.

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:25.210
I'll get rid of Gwang-to,
the crazy shaman believer

00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:27.212
and become the leader of Suojae.

00:09:28.922 --> 00:09:30.465
When the day comes

00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:34.678
I'll need someone to establish
new justice with me.

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:38.265
Someone

00:09:39.516 --> 00:09:41.727
who will never betray me.

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:10.297
What is justice

00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:14.635
to you?

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.397
The devil works quickly and clearly.

00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:29.066
Nothing ever hinders it.

00:10:29.524 --> 00:10:31.860
But justice needs formality
and a proper procedure.

00:10:32.986 --> 00:10:35.197
So, it feels lazy, slow

00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:36.990
and delayed.

00:10:37.866 --> 00:10:39.451
The justice that I want

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:41.787
works clearly and quicker than the devil.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.497
And it can't be hindered by anything.

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:47.542
What does justice mean to you?

00:10:55.384 --> 00:10:59.346
Are you sure you made a fair judgment?

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:00.430
Yes.

00:11:03.183 --> 00:11:04.268
No.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.938
There's no point in asking you this.

00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:10.857
Anyone would know it in their hearts.

00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:17.906
To me, justice is

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.286
not something found
through questions and debates.

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:25.789
It's equity

00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:27.833
and common sense

00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:30.294
everyone knows in their hearts.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.885
Equity and common sense
that everyone knows in their hearts?

00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:45.475
It aligns with my definition in some ways.

00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:49.980
No.

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:52.816
To you, justice is

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:54.735
self-righteousness.

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.418
Who's the lady you came with
the last time?

00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:12.711
She was so pretty.

00:12:12.794 --> 00:12:14.629
Pretty? Who was it?

00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:16.590
I came with Ms. Yu from Haenal Law Firm.

00:12:19.384 --> 00:12:22.220
Are you planning your wedding
now that you've given Mr. Eom

00:12:22.512 --> 00:12:23.722
as your sacrifice to Haenal?

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:25.682
No, it's too soon.

00:12:25.766 --> 00:12:27.184
Come on.

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:28.935
You mixed her jjajangmyeon

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:32.230
and tied her apron for her.
You have to marry her!

00:12:32.606 --> 00:12:36.234
It's cowardly for a man not to marry her
after all that flirting!

00:12:36.318 --> 00:12:37.694
I just...

00:12:37.778 --> 00:12:40.572
You tied her apron for her?
You're basically married.

00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:43.075
Right.

00:12:43.575 --> 00:12:46.661
The lady was looking at you
with so much love.

00:12:49.122 --> 00:12:50.665
Enjoy your dinner.

00:12:56.963 --> 00:12:59.216
I didn't know you were a coward.

00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:00.342
Me?

00:13:01.468 --> 00:13:02.469
Bottoms-up.

00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:05.222
Don't be a coward and leave any.

00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:17.692
One more glass?

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:28.036
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:33.208
Did you check it?

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:36.920
We'll know soon enough.

00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:39.381
It's 30 million won
from Sarang Securities, correct?

00:13:39.464 --> 00:13:41.091
Tae-sik's illegal loans were exposed

00:13:41.174 --> 00:13:43.093
with the arrest of the loan officer

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:46.221
at the Jeongdaun Savings Bank
for embezzlement.

00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:49.933
It won't be easy to get an arrest warrant
for Tae-sik.

00:13:50.392 --> 00:13:52.686
The higher-ups will do anything
to stop me.

00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:54.396
30 million won...

00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:56.690
Why do you need a warrant?
You know your expertise.

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:57.816
What?

00:13:58.108 --> 00:13:59.109
An emergency arrest?

00:13:59.192 --> 00:14:00.735
Break Tae-sik's back first.

00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:02.279
I'll twist his neck.

00:14:04.239 --> 00:14:05.949
So, I have to do all the work.

00:14:06.032 --> 00:14:09.161
Don't you know Tae-sik's neck is guarded
by Sin-jin?

00:14:09.244 --> 00:14:10.829
It'll be harder to twist his neck.

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:12.497
Okay, fine.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.083
Be ready to twist his neck any moment.

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:16.293
Don't worry.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.045
I'll be sure to warm up.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.265
Mr. Han Gwang-hun, the loan officer
at Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.641
Yes.

00:14:33.685 --> 00:14:35.896
You invested 150 million won
using embezzled money

00:14:35.979 --> 00:14:38.356
until just last month.

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:40.650
I'm sorry.

00:14:40.734 --> 00:14:43.028
I'll do everything to return the money.

00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:45.697
No need. You didn't steal my money.

00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:47.782
Sorry?

00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:51.745
You were going to return the money
once the stock prices went up, anyway.

00:14:52.996 --> 00:14:54.998
- Aren't I right?
- Sorry?

00:14:57.417 --> 00:15:00.003
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:15:01.838 --> 00:15:05.091
What a convincing, honest confession.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.344
It's like you're making a confessional.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.848
That being said

00:15:13.517 --> 00:15:15.435
help me serve our country.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.521
Be a buddy.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:23.902
TESTIMONY BY KIM SEOK-TAE

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:25.612
Jang Tae-sik.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.241
I'll make sure you don't commit
any more crimes in this life.

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:30.784
We can't put

00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:33.328
more people in misery because of you.

00:15:34.663 --> 00:15:37.123
But don't you even dream
of going to heaven.

00:15:49.469 --> 00:15:51.930
- Yes?
- Han-young, you bastard!

00:15:52.013 --> 00:15:53.723
What bastard? Me?

00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:55.433
Yeah, you.

00:15:55.517 --> 00:15:57.561
How dare you scam me?

00:15:58.603 --> 00:16:00.063
You're dead.

00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:03.608
Prosecutor Park!

00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:07.070
The day I...

00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:11.157
Remember the day
I was robbed of my three billion won?

00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:16.621
You were pretty damn busy
with Mr. Lee, huh?

00:16:17.497 --> 00:16:19.082
CALL HISTORY

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:22.961
You're dead, too, alright?

00:16:28.383 --> 00:16:29.426
Yes.

00:16:29.843 --> 00:16:33.388
The call history from you made
the world of a difference.

00:16:34.764 --> 00:16:36.766
Alright, looking forward to it.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:45.442
Lee Seong-dae has

00:16:45.525 --> 00:16:47.777
a record of everywhere we've been
and our call history

00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:49.446
around the time of the Miracle scam.

00:16:49.654 --> 00:16:52.574
What do we do now?
Sin-jin is going to catch on soon.

00:16:55.785 --> 00:16:56.786
Don't worry.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.663
Seong-dae and his greed will make him fall

00:16:58.747 --> 00:17:00.290
into yet another trap.

00:17:09.966 --> 00:17:13.678
So, how did that humble little party go
last time?

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:16.139
- Did you have a good time?
- Were you there?

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.974
No, well...

00:17:19.142 --> 00:17:21.561
Yeah, I went there
and went right back home.

00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:25.106
Isn't it about time
you introduce me to your friends?

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:27.025
I don't have any.

00:17:27.776 --> 00:17:28.902
I didn't keep you hidden.

00:17:29.486 --> 00:17:31.237
I just had nobody to introduce you to.

00:17:31.321 --> 00:17:34.282
But you have friends,
you're just taking too long.

00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:36.618
There we go!

00:17:37.243 --> 00:17:38.286
I'm counting on you.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:39.871
Not for free.

00:17:40.872 --> 00:17:42.540
I get a wish, no questions asked.

00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:44.000
If you don't want that, just go.

00:17:46.044 --> 00:17:47.045
Okay, then.

00:17:47.253 --> 00:17:48.463
Fine.

00:17:48.546 --> 00:17:51.174
I'll do it. Just don't mess up.

00:17:55.345 --> 00:17:57.055
Han-young, you bastard.

00:17:57.681 --> 00:17:58.723
Have a seat.

00:18:01.643 --> 00:18:03.228
I see why Haenal's daughter

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:05.980
came to that bullshit investment seminar.

00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:09.401
I heard you guys were getting married.

00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:11.319
What a match made in heaven, huh?

00:18:11.403 --> 00:18:14.114
Aw, are you already congratulating us?

00:18:16.032 --> 00:18:18.326
When did you clean up this office?

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.412
Are you dumb

00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:22.163
or fearless?

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:26.626
The police will look everywhere

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.713
but not here again.

00:18:30.672 --> 00:18:31.840
Cheol-woo.

00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:33.091
We meet yet again.

00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:37.345
This is 500 million won.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:40.932
Just 500 million?

00:18:43.601 --> 00:18:45.562
Give me my three billion won back
right now.

00:18:45.937 --> 00:18:48.356
Or else, I take all of you down.

00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:50.650
I'll give you three billion in a week.

00:18:51.025 --> 00:18:53.570
That'll mean
that you have made 500 million.

00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:55.321
That's a good investment.

00:18:55.822 --> 00:18:58.199
You won't need to worry
about your daughter abroad now.

00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:00.869
Shut up, you bastard.

00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:04.664
You think I'll fall for it again?

00:19:04.748 --> 00:19:07.751
Join our firm once things settle.

00:19:08.543 --> 00:19:11.629
I know you're a Presiding Judge
at the Seoul Central Court.

00:19:11.713 --> 00:19:13.882
I'll give you an office with a good view.

00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:17.177
Not a bad offer
for keeping your mouth shut, huh?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.763
Shut it.

00:19:20.346 --> 00:19:21.890
You think I'll fall for it again?

00:19:21.973 --> 00:19:24.434
Give me back my three billion right now!

00:19:24.517 --> 00:19:25.685
Man.

00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:28.438
I told you. We don't have it right now!

00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:34.110
Better look for it, then.

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:39.240
Shall I call Sin-jin right now?

00:19:43.912 --> 00:19:45.371
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:19:47.499 --> 00:19:48.541
Wait.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.293
I'll give it to you now.

00:19:52.837 --> 00:19:55.632
You bastard. You don't even have the guts
to carry through it.

00:19:56.257 --> 00:19:57.717
The account number is

00:19:57.801 --> 00:20:00.136
236021069923

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.680
for Ms. Lee Seon-yeong
at Gukje Bank, right?

00:20:02.806 --> 00:20:03.848
DEPOSIT AMOUNT: 0 WON

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:05.558
Damn you!

00:20:05.725 --> 00:20:07.560
- Hold on.
- Wait a second.

00:20:07.852 --> 00:20:08.853
- Who the hell are you?
- Stop.

00:20:08.937 --> 00:20:10.730
How do you know
my daughter's bank account?

00:20:11.022 --> 00:20:13.566
Don't you lay a finger on him!

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.776
She knows how to slap people!

00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:16.986
Let go! Let go right now!

00:20:17.111 --> 00:20:19.531
- You want to die?
- Let go!

00:20:19.614 --> 00:20:21.658
We can die later.
Let's calm down first, okay?

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:23.576
Calm down, Se-hee.

00:20:25.203 --> 00:20:26.496
That's not the issue here!

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:29.666
What do you think will happen
if I send three billion won to her?

00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:32.669
Don't you want to know
how Sin-jin would react to that?

00:20:33.211 --> 00:20:34.921
- Don't you?
- You bastard.

00:20:35.213 --> 00:20:36.297
So, calm down.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.009
I guess I can't give you three billion.
You don't want it.

00:20:40.093 --> 00:20:41.177
You know what?

00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:43.596
I guess this isn't your money, either.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.098
But you know

00:20:45.515 --> 00:20:48.059
if you want to join Haenal,
I'll still hire you.

00:20:48.142 --> 00:20:51.062
You're not the only official
pulling this crap, anyway.

00:20:51.145 --> 00:20:52.480
Nobody will care if we hire you.

00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:53.857
You're kidding.

00:21:05.493 --> 00:21:07.954
Let me give you some advice, Seong-dae.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.333
Shut up and leave.

00:21:12.709 --> 00:21:13.751
Sorry?

00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:18.131
Before the world hears
about all the bribes you've taken

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:23.970
to collude with criminals.

00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:38.776
LEE SEONG-DAE'S BRIBE TRANSACTION RECORDS

00:21:44.782 --> 00:21:48.036
LIST OF LEE SEONG-DAE'S ACCOUNTS
FOR RECEIVING BRIBES

00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:02.425
Yes, sir.

00:22:03.509 --> 00:22:05.261
I've checked

00:22:06.846 --> 00:22:08.514
and I seem to have been mistaken.

00:22:14.646 --> 00:22:15.647
Quit.

00:22:17.065 --> 00:22:19.192
You'll never hear from Mr. Kang again.

00:22:26.991 --> 00:22:29.202
How was this idiot mistaken?

00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:01.901
It's my turn to make a wish.

00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:03.069
No.

00:23:03.152 --> 00:23:05.446
Why not? I did everything you asked!

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.031
That's ridiculous!

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.702
Vroom!

00:23:10.785 --> 00:23:12.704
Time to make my wish!

00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:14.455
"Vroom," my ass.

00:23:18.209 --> 00:23:22.171
I can't believe you didn't take her out
for dinner until so late.

00:23:26.843 --> 00:23:28.344
I hope you like it.

00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:31.264
Thank you.

00:23:37.812 --> 00:23:38.896
May I...

00:23:41.774 --> 00:23:43.067
have some more?

00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:45.194
Of course! Have more!

00:23:45.278 --> 00:23:46.529
Honey, get some more rice.

00:23:46.612 --> 00:23:48.614
I was worried you'd only have one bowl.

00:23:48.698 --> 00:23:49.991
I'm so glad.

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:53.286
What are you doing?
The rice cooker is there.

00:23:54.203 --> 00:23:55.747
Your dad is nervous.

00:23:59.917 --> 00:24:01.377
She seems nice, right?

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:03.171
You think he'll marry her?

00:24:03.254 --> 00:24:05.006
Come on. Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:24:05.089 --> 00:24:07.216
We've only had a meal together now.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.801
Well, two servings of it, though.

00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:12.805
But he wouldn't bring just any woman over
for dinner, would he?

00:24:12.889 --> 00:24:14.307
They could've eaten out.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:15.391
Right?

00:24:17.602 --> 00:24:18.811
- Look at you.
- What?

00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:20.229
- You're ridiculous.
- What?

00:24:20.313 --> 00:24:21.522
My gosh.

00:24:22.273 --> 00:24:24.400
The weather is so nice.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:25.902
Man, I'm full.

00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:32.033
Let's see if I can get a cab.

00:24:43.544 --> 00:24:44.587
Mr. Lee

00:24:45.379 --> 00:24:48.424
you're not a bad man, are you?

00:24:50.551 --> 00:24:53.221
"Good" and "bad" are all relative terms.

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:57.141
I know.

00:24:59.102 --> 00:25:00.269
But what kind of a person

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.898
are you to me?

00:25:08.361 --> 00:25:09.445
My husband took bribes

00:25:10.154 --> 00:25:11.614
to play in favor of people in court.

00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:13.991
He wanted to open an attorney office

00:25:14.992 --> 00:25:16.619
for money laundering reasons, too.

00:25:17.328 --> 00:25:19.122
I tried to stop him

00:25:20.206 --> 00:25:21.874
and he said he wanted a divorce.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.260
Forget it.

00:25:32.718 --> 00:25:33.761
No need to answer me.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.763
I'll just think whatever I want.

00:25:35.847 --> 00:25:37.056
It's not like I ever cared

00:25:38.141 --> 00:25:39.517
about what others thought.

00:25:43.563 --> 00:25:44.564
Oh!

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:06.836
Your mother is a wonderful cook.

00:26:08.337 --> 00:26:09.338
See you.

00:26:26.647 --> 00:26:27.899
Se-hee...

00:26:37.658 --> 00:26:39.285
THESE ARE THE FILES

00:26:39.368 --> 00:26:41.287
S SHOPPING SENT TO JEONGDAUN SAVINGS BANK

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.122
FOR ITS LOAN APPLICATIONS

00:26:45.082 --> 00:26:46.334
Gosh.

00:26:49.587 --> 00:26:51.130
SEND

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:53.007
THE MAIL HAS BEEN SENT SUCCESSFULLY

00:27:06.771 --> 00:27:09.523
LOAN APPLICATIONS FROM S SHOPPING

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:10.733
Mr. Baek

00:27:10.816 --> 00:27:12.985
I'll send you a record
of S Shopping's loans.

00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:15.196
Let me know if anything looks suspicious.

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:17.198
We'll get moving as soon as you're done.

00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:22.495
It's me.

00:27:22.578 --> 00:27:24.830
I got the record of S Shopping's loans.

00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:26.749
Get Tae-sik under an emergency arrest

00:27:26.832 --> 00:27:29.252
and Ms. Song will spread the word
about his slush funds

00:27:29.335 --> 00:27:31.712
being at the Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

00:27:31.796 --> 00:27:33.047
If we spread the word

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.799
the higher-ups will try to stop us.

00:27:34.882 --> 00:27:36.425
That's exactly what I want.

00:27:36.509 --> 00:27:38.678
Keep him arrested
just until his father hears

00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:40.012
about the slush funds.

00:27:40.346 --> 00:27:41.681
You have something else on him?

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:45.601
Tae-sik isn't the only one
with slush funds

00:27:45.685 --> 00:27:48.062
deposited at the Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

00:27:48.145 --> 00:27:50.147
Yong-hyeon also has his funds
with the bank.

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:54.193
Really? Are you sure?

00:27:54.277 --> 00:27:56.320
I can't tell her
I know this from my past life.

00:27:56.404 --> 00:27:57.530
Oh...

00:27:59.031 --> 00:28:01.200
You know the previous cases

00:28:01.617 --> 00:28:03.577
with S Group and S Shopping?

00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:06.455
I just have a feeling
based on those cases.

00:28:07.415 --> 00:28:08.416
A feeling.

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:11.002
A hunch?

00:28:12.044 --> 00:28:13.838
So, you're not even sure?

00:28:14.714 --> 00:28:16.966
Ms. Kim,
I found a case of an illicit loan.

00:28:17.049 --> 00:28:18.050
Should we go right now?

00:28:20.803 --> 00:28:22.388
Yeah, let's go.

00:28:25.516 --> 00:28:27.059
Tae-sik's investigation went

00:28:27.143 --> 00:28:29.979
from illegal loans to slush funds
in my past life.

00:28:30.062 --> 00:28:32.481
That led Tae-sik to step down
from S Shopping

00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:34.608
and the slush funds went
to the National Treasury.

00:28:34.692 --> 00:28:36.694
But the bigger issue here was

00:28:36.777 --> 00:28:38.946
Jang Yong-hyeon, his father's slush funds.

00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:46.537
The call cannot be completed.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.498
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:28:55.713 --> 00:28:56.881
Hey, Sin-jin.

00:28:57.298 --> 00:28:58.299
It's me.

00:28:58.382 --> 00:29:01.344
Did you hear
about the Jeongdaun Savings Bank?

00:29:01.677 --> 00:29:03.929
The prosecution may arrest him
in an emergency arrest

00:29:04.722 --> 00:29:06.515
but we can stop things from getting worse.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.352
Please take care of it.

00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:16.067
Tae-sik, this moron!
Why this one, of all banks?

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.778
Why does it have to be
Jeongdaun Savings Bank?

00:29:18.861 --> 00:29:21.822
He'll be in bigger trouble
if Jeongdaun Savings gets busted.

00:29:23.574 --> 00:29:25.701
Don't tell me
he'll just call to sort it again.

00:29:34.293 --> 00:29:36.796
You should've been on your toes.

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:42.343
Keep him arrested
just until his father hears

00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:43.761
about the slush funds.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.021
A hellish life is still better than hell.

00:29:54.355 --> 00:29:56.899
Don't regret it all once you're dead.

00:29:56.982 --> 00:29:58.526
Don't take this too far.

00:29:59.193 --> 00:30:01.987
All these paper stacks mean nothing.

00:30:02.071 --> 00:30:04.865
You can't get me with them.

00:30:05.491 --> 00:30:06.951
When something like this happens

00:30:07.034 --> 00:30:08.577
the criminal gets away.

00:30:08.661 --> 00:30:11.038
We have our boys
to serve time in jail, okay?

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:12.540
I know.

00:30:12.957 --> 00:30:14.917
When rich bastards commit a crime

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.753
they say their employees did it
and that they had no idea.

00:30:17.837 --> 00:30:19.463
They always find a way out.

00:30:19.922 --> 00:30:21.048
I know it well.

00:30:24.093 --> 00:30:25.344
That being said

00:30:25.428 --> 00:30:28.472
I don't care who your boy is this time.

00:30:29.432 --> 00:30:32.560
I'm just interested
in taking some of your money.

00:30:35.521 --> 00:30:37.314
What the hell are you talking about?

00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:40.985
For example

00:30:41.068 --> 00:30:42.945
maybe some slush funds

00:30:43.028 --> 00:30:44.864
that S Shopping has
with Jeongdaun Savings?

00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:52.955
You're panicking, so it must be true.

00:30:56.083 --> 00:30:57.126
Get on it now.

00:30:59.753 --> 00:31:00.754
Hey.

00:31:01.172 --> 00:31:03.132
Have you heard the news?

00:31:03.215 --> 00:31:06.927
Jang Tae-sik, the CEO of S Shopping

00:31:07.011 --> 00:31:09.763
has 50 billion won hidden
with Jeongdaun Savings.

00:31:09.847 --> 00:31:13.434
This is a big deal if it's true, right?

00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:15.811
Yeah, I just heard about it now.

00:31:15.895 --> 00:31:17.521
Na-yeon, did you hear?

00:31:17.605 --> 00:31:20.357
Jang Tae-sik, the CEO of S Shopping

00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:22.234
has 50 billion won in slush funds!

00:31:22.318 --> 00:31:23.486
Really?

00:31:24.028 --> 00:31:25.237
Perfect.

00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.072
TOP SEARCHED KEYWORDS
JANG TAE-SIK'S 50 BILLION WON

00:31:27.698 --> 00:31:30.034
Words about Yong-hyeon's slush funds
got out

00:31:30.367 --> 00:31:32.077
because the investigation on Tae-sik

00:31:32.161 --> 00:31:34.079
became the biggest news among people.

00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:35.539
I apologize.

00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:39.210
S Shopping received illicit loans

00:31:39.293 --> 00:31:41.337
from Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.505
Not only that

00:31:43.297 --> 00:31:44.840
but I hid 50 billion won

00:31:45.341 --> 00:31:48.469
under an alias at the same bank.

00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:52.973
I am sorry.

00:31:56.477 --> 00:31:59.980
In the past life, the judge gave Tae-sik
a suspended sentence

00:32:00.064 --> 00:32:01.732
and the prosecution claimed

00:32:01.815 --> 00:32:03.526
Yong-hyeon's slush funds were a rumor.

00:32:03.943 --> 00:32:06.362
Yong-hyeon got away
by throwing his son under the bus.

00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:11.617
YEONGDEUNGPO-GU REDEVELOPMENT PLAN

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:13.035
Ms. Kim

00:32:13.869 --> 00:32:15.996
Tae-sik won't get away

00:32:16.455 --> 00:32:18.541
with a suspended sentence this time.

00:32:23.671 --> 00:32:25.297
Chairman Jang Yong-hyeon.

00:32:26.507 --> 00:32:27.967
There's no way he thinks

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.553
he can save
both his son and his slush funds.

00:32:35.307 --> 00:32:36.767
Or maybe he does.

00:32:38.352 --> 00:32:41.730
Tae-sik, that moron!

00:32:46.986 --> 00:32:49.572
MANWOL

00:32:57.246 --> 00:32:59.957
Mr. Jang Tae-sik will return home

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.750
once the detention limit passes.

00:33:03.002 --> 00:33:04.837
They won't get his arrest warrant.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.341
You said you'd help,
so I'm sure it'll work out.

00:33:14.597 --> 00:33:16.932
Your slush funds with Jeongdaun Savings.

00:33:18.475 --> 00:33:19.476
Give that up.

00:33:22.688 --> 00:33:23.897
Come on.

00:33:23.981 --> 00:33:26.442
Tae-sik worked hard to save up that much.

00:33:26.525 --> 00:33:28.819
I feel bad about letting all of it go.

00:33:28.902 --> 00:33:30.779
If you think the 50 billion

00:33:30.863 --> 00:33:32.781
that Tae-sik saved up is too precious

00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:37.119
I can't imagine how you feel

00:33:37.202 --> 00:33:39.288
about the 500 billion you've saved up.

00:33:39.371 --> 00:33:40.372
What?

00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:45.669
Why do you look so surprised?

00:33:46.253 --> 00:33:48.547
I thought that was what you were here for.

00:33:48.631 --> 00:33:50.591
- Sin-jin.
- Right.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.928
It's not easy to give up 500 billion won.

00:33:56.305 --> 00:33:57.598
Sin-jin!

00:33:57.681 --> 00:34:00.976
Once the prosecution starts investigating
Tae-sik's slush funds

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.812
they'll find yours in no time

00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:05.731
and Mr. President will find out.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.154
S Group only grew so big
by colluding with politicians.

00:34:13.405 --> 00:34:15.032
If you get on Mr. President's bad side

00:34:15.115 --> 00:34:18.452
that strong tie will break,
and he'll make sure you feel the lash.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:23.874
So what?

00:34:27.127 --> 00:34:31.048
You need to sort it out quickly
before Mr. President finds out.

00:34:32.257 --> 00:34:34.635
And you're willing to help me?

00:34:35.386 --> 00:34:38.764
The best-case scenario for now is
to have Tae-sik admit to his allegations

00:34:39.181 --> 00:34:41.475
and go to court.

00:34:41.558 --> 00:34:44.478
What will the world think

00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:46.355
if S Group's heir ends up in jail?

00:34:46.438 --> 00:34:49.024
They'll think
I can't even keep my son tame.

00:34:49.108 --> 00:34:50.401
It'll crush our reputation.

00:34:50.484 --> 00:34:52.486
On grounds that he complies
with the prosecution

00:34:53.153 --> 00:34:54.863
sincerely apologizes for what he's done

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.866
that he's made
a huge contribution to Korea's economy

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.660
and for many other reasons

00:34:59.743 --> 00:35:01.495
he'll walk away with a suspended sentence.

00:35:02.287 --> 00:35:05.040
And if he agrees to reimburse
for the damages done

00:35:05.457 --> 00:35:08.335
I'm sure
S Group's reputation will improve.

00:35:08.419 --> 00:35:10.295
You expect me to pay
for that reimbursement?

00:35:10.921 --> 00:35:12.923
Can I trust you that much
to keep your word?

00:35:20.097 --> 00:35:22.474
Are you sure about the suspended sentence?

00:35:24.059 --> 00:35:25.894
It won't be an issue

00:35:25.978 --> 00:35:28.230
as long as Attorney Byeon helps Tae-sik
with the load.

00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:30.441
Can he do that?

00:35:31.358 --> 00:35:33.902
A servant has to follow his master.

00:35:37.573 --> 00:35:38.949
I'll never forget

00:35:41.744 --> 00:35:42.870
your help.

00:35:43.912 --> 00:35:45.414
Feel free to forget.

00:35:45.873 --> 00:35:46.874
But

00:35:48.333 --> 00:35:50.669
I'll need 100 billion won in return.

00:35:53.714 --> 00:35:54.757
100 billion won?

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.968
It's not about losing 100 billion.

00:35:58.469 --> 00:36:00.220
Think about the 400 billion won

00:36:00.304 --> 00:36:02.639
and Mr. President's trust
that you'll get to keep.

00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:05.893
That's the only way

00:36:06.518 --> 00:36:08.020
to save you and S Group.

00:36:10.689 --> 00:36:11.815
Are you blackmailing me?

00:36:12.441 --> 00:36:15.903
I'd say this is a win-win situation.

00:36:20.324 --> 00:36:23.452
Since we need to convince the public

00:36:24.328 --> 00:36:27.122
the prosecution will indict him
while in custody

00:36:28.832 --> 00:36:32.294
and Judge Lee, whom we met at the Suojae,
will be on the case.

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:51.772
There will come a day
when you'll be in my place.

00:36:51.855 --> 00:36:53.023
When that happens...

00:36:55.818 --> 00:36:57.110
be sure

00:36:58.529 --> 00:36:59.571
to remember this moment.

00:37:31.186 --> 00:37:32.396
Welcome back.

00:37:33.939 --> 00:37:35.357
It was tough.

00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:38.819
The prosecutor was a real bitch.

00:37:40.404 --> 00:37:42.406
I'm sure you're tired. Get some rest.

00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:47.327
Dad.

00:37:49.872 --> 00:37:52.040
Sorry about the slush funds.

00:37:55.335 --> 00:37:58.505
Leave everything behind and start new.

00:37:59.798 --> 00:38:01.383
What do you mean?

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.302
Leave what?

00:38:05.512 --> 00:38:06.972
The prosecution will indict you

00:38:08.056 --> 00:38:09.600
under detention.

00:38:11.018 --> 00:38:13.312
What?

00:38:13.604 --> 00:38:15.522
They let me out, so why again?

00:38:15.606 --> 00:38:17.649
Indictment or not

00:38:17.733 --> 00:38:20.152
why can't I just go to court
without detention?

00:38:20.235 --> 00:38:22.070
Think about the public, too.

00:38:27.576 --> 00:38:28.702
What?

00:38:29.286 --> 00:38:30.662
Dad...

00:38:32.664 --> 00:38:33.916
Dad!

00:38:34.458 --> 00:38:35.876
Father!

00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:39.004
Father!

00:38:39.087 --> 00:38:41.423
You want me to crawl into a little cell

00:38:41.506 --> 00:38:43.216
where all the lowly people go?

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.676
Damn it!

00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:48.805
Come on!

00:38:50.098 --> 00:38:52.017
It's that prosecutor bitch, isn't it?

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.895
She started this
with the tax evasion case!

00:38:54.978 --> 00:38:58.106
She thinks I'm a moron!

00:39:02.194 --> 00:39:03.612
I'll break her limbs

00:39:03.695 --> 00:39:07.157
with her father's
and bury them upside-down!

00:39:21.088 --> 00:39:23.340
KIM SEOK-TAE

00:39:34.393 --> 00:39:35.644
Come on.

00:39:36.019 --> 00:39:37.980
This time, let's break your legs first

00:39:38.063 --> 00:39:39.356
before your head.

00:39:39.731 --> 00:39:42.317
There's no better way
to silence the evictees

00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:43.986
than taking them to court with this.

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:46.571
No, this won't do. Pass me that one.

00:39:46.947 --> 00:39:49.199
- Sir...
- Hold him.

00:39:49.282 --> 00:39:51.118
- You already hit me last week!
- Stop moving.

00:39:51.201 --> 00:39:53.078
You already hit me last week!

00:39:53.161 --> 00:39:54.705
- We have to go again if you move.
- Sir!

00:39:54.788 --> 00:39:56.164
Let's just do it in one-go.

00:39:57.833 --> 00:39:59.251
I told you not to move!

00:39:59.334 --> 00:40:00.335
Alright.

00:40:02.254 --> 00:40:03.255
Is it broken?

00:40:13.306 --> 00:40:15.684
I knew you looked familiar.

00:40:15.767 --> 00:40:20.397
How many times did I break his limbs
and hit his head?

00:40:23.984 --> 00:40:27.738
I wondered
why that bitch kept coming at me

00:40:27.821 --> 00:40:29.448
as if her life depended on it.

00:40:30.532 --> 00:40:31.616
How inspiring.

00:40:32.284 --> 00:40:33.368
So damn inspiring.

00:40:43.086 --> 00:40:44.087
Hey, Byeon.

00:40:44.463 --> 00:40:47.382
Dad probably has some slush funds
at Jeongdaun, right?

00:40:48.508 --> 00:40:50.635
Yes, I think so.

00:40:51.094 --> 00:40:52.846
He wants to sacrifice me

00:40:52.929 --> 00:40:55.015
because he doesn't want anyone
to mess with that.

00:40:56.099 --> 00:40:59.978
I can't let anyone take that money.

00:41:01.021 --> 00:41:03.482
That'll all be mine one day.

00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:07.903
Fine. I'll take one for the team.

00:41:12.949 --> 00:41:14.117
Hey, Dad.

00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:16.787
Delay that arrest warrant by a week.

00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:18.080
What for?

00:41:18.455 --> 00:41:20.916
I have some urgent stuff to take care of
before I go.

00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:22.292
Don't worry.

00:41:22.834 --> 00:41:24.628
Whatever it is, you only have one week.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.046
Alright.

00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:33.804
- Hey, Byeon.
- Yes?

00:41:33.887 --> 00:41:35.180
Find someone.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.725
What for?

00:41:38.809 --> 00:41:43.647
Someone to send
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a far, far away.

00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:49.236
We've been ordered to indict Tae-sik
under detention.

00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:50.904
He's begun to cut his ties now.

00:41:50.987 --> 00:41:52.489
But in this life

00:41:52.572 --> 00:41:54.324
we have to get Yong-hyeon's funds, too.

00:41:54.407 --> 00:41:58.328
That's the only way
to strike Sin-jin and Gwang-to, too.

00:42:00.413 --> 00:42:02.374
It's because of Yong-hyeon's slush funds

00:42:02.457 --> 00:42:04.876
at Jeongdaun Savings.

00:42:06.086 --> 00:42:07.712
I guess you were right.

00:42:07.796 --> 00:42:10.423
They wouldn't have allowed me
to indict him otherwise.

00:42:10.507 --> 00:42:11.633
And as it turns out

00:42:12.425 --> 00:42:14.261
the Deputy Prosecutor General ordered it.

00:42:14.386 --> 00:42:15.720
After Mr. Eom joined Haenal

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:19.141
the prosecution has been
without a Prosecutor General.

00:42:19.224 --> 00:42:21.935
That leaves the Deputy Prosecutor General
to take over.

00:42:22.018 --> 00:42:23.687
Yong-hyeon would've requested it

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.857
and Sin-jin would've told
the Deputy Prosecutor General to do it.

00:42:27.941 --> 00:42:29.276
He's sacrificing Tae-sik

00:42:29.776 --> 00:42:32.487
to stop further investigations.

00:42:33.655 --> 00:42:35.407
I guess money matters more than his kid.

00:42:36.616 --> 00:42:38.785
But Tae-sik has 50 billion won
in slush funds.

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:42.414
How much does his father have
if they can throw that away?

00:42:42.497 --> 00:42:43.957
Probably a few hundred billion won.

00:42:45.167 --> 00:42:46.626
500 billion won, to be exact.

00:42:47.752 --> 00:42:49.713
Including the funds at other banks

00:42:49.796 --> 00:42:52.382
paper companies, and international banks,
probably in the trillions.

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:57.179
That means we're giving them
what they want

00:42:57.262 --> 00:42:58.889
by ending it at Tae-sik's arrest.

00:42:59.222 --> 00:43:00.557
We can grab Tae-sik

00:43:01.224 --> 00:43:02.726
and shake up the whole S Group.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.812
Tae-sik may be the start

00:43:05.896 --> 00:43:08.190
but we can get to Yong-hyeon and Sin-jin

00:43:08.523 --> 00:43:10.692
and send them all to jail.

00:43:10.775 --> 00:43:11.860
Let's do that.

00:43:11.943 --> 00:43:13.695
We might as well arrest them all.

00:43:14.613 --> 00:43:16.823
There's something I haven't told you guys.

00:43:18.283 --> 00:43:20.535
There's another garbage
we have to take out.

00:43:21.578 --> 00:43:24.289
I followed Nam-yong one day

00:43:24.372 --> 00:43:25.665
and that was the day

00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:28.001
I found

00:43:28.084 --> 00:43:30.462
the worst trash of them all.

00:43:31.755 --> 00:43:33.006
Who's that?

00:43:34.132 --> 00:43:36.176
The real big hand that moves Korea.

00:43:37.594 --> 00:43:39.095
The leader of the shadow government

00:43:40.096 --> 00:43:42.140
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

00:43:46.061 --> 00:43:48.480
You're all here!
Why are you standing outside?

00:43:48.563 --> 00:43:50.857
- You have to open it.
- Oh, right. It's my office.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.360
Park Gwang-to?

00:43:53.443 --> 00:43:54.653
Damn...

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.574
You know, I voted for that guy.

00:43:59.658 --> 00:44:01.409
This is ridiculous. I feel so betrayed!

00:44:01.493 --> 00:44:02.494
Here, Han-young.

00:44:05.872 --> 00:44:07.290
- I'll take two.
- Okay.

00:44:10.502 --> 00:44:11.628
Hold on.

00:44:12.963 --> 00:44:14.714
Are you two the only ones here?

00:44:18.301 --> 00:44:20.720
You know I have to exhaust my knees
because of him, right?

00:44:21.721 --> 00:44:24.474
My wrists hurt with all the paperwork.
Being a judge is hard.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.980
Reporters have to deal with just as much.

00:44:30.063 --> 00:44:31.356
You should have some, then.

00:44:31.439 --> 00:44:32.440
Come here.

00:44:32.899 --> 00:44:34.651
Open that. I'll give this to Ms. Song.

00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:36.319
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

00:44:36.403 --> 00:44:39.197
You think our joints are made of steel
because we're prosecutors?

00:44:41.074 --> 00:44:44.244
Cheol-woo,
you can be so inconsiderate sometimes.

00:44:44.786 --> 00:44:46.079
I was getting some for you.

00:44:53.503 --> 00:44:55.046
By the way

00:44:55.755 --> 00:44:57.507
you all know the To's Club, right?

00:44:57.924 --> 00:45:00.760
The club for people who love Gwang-to.

00:45:02.345 --> 00:45:04.848
They'll try to kill us
if they know what we're doing.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.560
Yeah, he's not an easy one to take on.

00:45:08.935 --> 00:45:10.020
Feel free to forget

00:45:10.478 --> 00:45:12.063
everything I just said.

00:45:12.439 --> 00:45:13.815
How can I?

00:45:14.232 --> 00:45:16.026
- It's so interesting.
- Why?

00:45:16.443 --> 00:45:19.612
You think I'll get scared and run away
because it's the former President?

00:45:19.696 --> 00:45:21.197
Is that why you didn't tell us?

00:45:21.281 --> 00:45:22.866
Who do you think I am?

00:45:22.949 --> 00:45:24.075
Hey.

00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:26.578
How can we forget what you just said?
We're not goldfish.

00:45:26.661 --> 00:45:27.787
Suojae is

00:45:28.371 --> 00:45:30.874
the real powerhouse that moves Korea.

00:45:31.416 --> 00:45:33.543
Everyone there is terrible.
Terribly powerful.

00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:35.879
So, stay out of it.

00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:38.048
You, too, Ms. Song.

00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:39.215
- What do you mean?
- What?

00:45:39.299 --> 00:45:40.383
My gosh!

00:45:41.217 --> 00:45:42.385
I'm Seok Jeong-ho.

00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:44.804
I'm the one who discovered Suojae.

00:45:44.888 --> 00:45:46.222
There's no way I'm stopping!

00:45:46.306 --> 00:45:47.974
How can I do that?

00:45:48.058 --> 00:45:50.060
And you're not even asking me
to stay out of it.

00:45:52.062 --> 00:45:53.563
You said we were a team.

00:45:55.732 --> 00:45:56.733
One team.

00:46:05.241 --> 00:46:06.368
Oh, gosh.

00:46:07.952 --> 00:46:09.496
What are you two doing?

00:46:12.707 --> 00:46:14.125
It was an accident.

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:21.299
You're trying to get Tae-sik

00:46:23.676 --> 00:46:25.011
because of your father, right?

00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:32.977
You ran a background check on me?

00:46:34.187 --> 00:46:35.188
No.

00:46:36.272 --> 00:46:37.482
I just happened to find out.

00:46:55.083 --> 00:46:56.751
TESTIMONY

00:46:56.835 --> 00:46:58.336
CONFIDENTIAL

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.839
TESTIMONY BY KIM SEOK-TAE

00:47:10.306 --> 00:47:12.976
I beat up the protesting evictees

00:47:13.435 --> 00:47:15.103
and cussed at them.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.855
Because Mr. Jang Tae-sik

00:47:16.938 --> 00:47:21.192
of S Construction told me to.

00:47:21.651 --> 00:47:23.278
Mr. Jang

00:47:24.112 --> 00:47:27.282
banged my head against the wall

00:47:27.991 --> 00:47:30.201
and broke my arms

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.579
using a baseball bat.

00:47:33.204 --> 00:47:36.791
I lied to the judge

00:47:37.375 --> 00:47:40.962
saying the protesters hit me

00:47:41.045 --> 00:47:43.173
and left me with a head injury
and a broken arm.

00:47:43.798 --> 00:47:45.008
The judge concluded

00:47:45.508 --> 00:47:49.721
that the protester beat me up.

00:47:50.889 --> 00:47:52.682
Mr. Jang paid me

00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:56.603
a million won
and paid for my hospital bills.

00:47:57.312 --> 00:47:58.855
Mr. Jang told me

00:47:59.522 --> 00:48:03.651
he'd give me another chance to make money

00:48:03.735 --> 00:48:07.489
and told me to come again
once my bones were healed.

00:48:12.243 --> 00:48:14.120
Dad was a bad man.

00:48:17.916 --> 00:48:19.918
But he loved his daughter

00:48:21.503 --> 00:48:23.254
to his bones, literally.

00:48:24.088 --> 00:48:26.966
Jin-a, have some meat.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.718
It's so good.

00:48:31.012 --> 00:48:32.931
Whenever Dad came home, injured

00:48:33.014 --> 00:48:35.308
- we ate out.
- Do you have money for this?

00:48:35.892 --> 00:48:37.519
Of course, I do.

00:48:37.602 --> 00:48:38.603
You want to see it?

00:48:40.772 --> 00:48:41.856
Ta-da.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.942
Jin-a, here.

00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:47.028
This is your allowance.

00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:48.988
You don't have money, right? Here.

00:48:50.114 --> 00:48:52.659
On those days,
I'd get my overdue tutor fees

00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:54.869
and pocket money.

00:49:07.215 --> 00:49:10.051
You know, I dream of the day

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.388
you put on a white blouse every morning

00:49:14.222 --> 00:49:17.475
to go to a real job.

00:49:19.269 --> 00:49:20.853
I hope you'll get to work late nights

00:49:21.229 --> 00:49:23.231
and go drinking with your colleagues, too.

00:49:24.315 --> 00:49:26.025
I hope you'll get to live

00:49:26.526 --> 00:49:30.238
like everyone else.

00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:33.116
Gosh, what am I even saying?

00:49:33.908 --> 00:49:34.993
Let's go.

00:49:45.545 --> 00:49:47.297
He lived in hell

00:49:49.215 --> 00:49:51.467
but I guess he wanted me to live
like everyone else.

00:49:56.848 --> 00:49:58.433
But he had no idea

00:50:01.686 --> 00:50:03.354
I also wanted a dad

00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:07.150
who would put on a white-collared shirt

00:50:08.443 --> 00:50:11.112
and go to work in the morning
and come home in the evening.

00:50:12.447 --> 00:50:14.407
He didn't know I wanted a normal dad, too.

00:50:19.704 --> 00:50:21.873
I studied like my life depended on it.

00:50:24.167 --> 00:50:26.377
To get far away from my embarrassing dad.

00:50:33.259 --> 00:50:35.011
But before I could even run away

00:50:35.678 --> 00:50:37.472
he fainted.

00:50:40.475 --> 00:50:43.102
He was doing everything Tae-sik wanted

00:50:43.811 --> 00:50:46.147
and his body gave in.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.904
I only realized when my dad fainted

00:50:55.948 --> 00:50:59.535
that it wasn't him
from whom I wanted to run from.

00:51:02.455 --> 00:51:04.957
Instead, it was my guilt
of having been raised

00:51:08.169 --> 00:51:09.962
through his broken bones and head.

00:51:31.234 --> 00:51:32.860
Where did you get this, anyway?

00:51:42.453 --> 00:51:46.040
The evictee your father framed was

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.461
my father.

00:51:59.178 --> 00:52:00.221
What?

00:52:00.972 --> 00:52:02.098
You knew about it?

00:52:06.227 --> 00:52:08.312
When we went to the junkyard.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:18.781
Hello?

00:52:18.865 --> 00:52:20.032
Do you need help?

00:52:30.251 --> 00:52:33.671
I went there to apologize
on behalf of my dad.

00:52:45.683 --> 00:52:46.726
I see.

00:52:59.572 --> 00:53:00.865
The lead judge of the case was

00:53:00.948 --> 00:53:03.534
Justice Hwang Nam-yong,
who recently resigned

00:53:03.618 --> 00:53:05.870
and Sin-jin was the associate judge.

00:53:06.329 --> 00:53:07.330
What?

00:53:07.413 --> 00:53:11.125
That was why I made Nam-yong resign.

00:53:19.091 --> 00:53:21.344
Tae-sik made a fortune
through redevelopments

00:53:21.427 --> 00:53:23.638
but hurt many people in the process.

00:53:24.388 --> 00:53:26.849
My father and yours

00:53:26.933 --> 00:53:28.518
as well as all the evictees

00:53:28.601 --> 00:53:33.147
who lost their homes
due to the redevelopments are all victims.

00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:46.410
Where your donation leads to happiness.

00:53:46.494 --> 00:53:49.163
Seonjin Happiness Foundation is with you.

00:53:50.206 --> 00:53:51.207
What a good man he is.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.291
- Right?
- Right?

00:53:52.375 --> 00:53:53.543
We should donate, too.

00:53:56.128 --> 00:53:57.213
Cut! Okay.

00:53:57.296 --> 00:53:58.589
- All good?
- Yes.

00:53:59.006 --> 00:54:00.883
That was a bit awkward, wasn't it?

00:54:04.762 --> 00:54:07.139
What a handsome old man.

00:54:11.686 --> 00:54:15.022
Oh, my. He donated all his wealth?

00:54:16.691 --> 00:54:19.944
There are so many amazing people
in the world.

00:54:21.153 --> 00:54:22.238
My gosh.

00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:24.365
Please use the money to help
the students in need.

00:54:24.448 --> 00:54:27.577
Yes, we'll put the money to good use.

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.786
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:30.162
Give him a round of applause.

00:54:30.955 --> 00:54:33.082
- Here.
- Let's take a photo.

00:54:33.165 --> 00:54:35.084
- Okay.
- Smile!

00:54:36.085 --> 00:54:38.754
One, two, three, cheese!

00:54:39.422 --> 00:54:41.132
SEONJIN HAPPINESS FOUNDATION

00:54:41.215 --> 00:54:43.801
CHAIRMAN KANG SUN-CHEOL

00:54:48.055 --> 00:54:50.057
Yes, Mr. President.

00:54:51.809 --> 00:54:53.060
That's right.

00:54:53.144 --> 00:54:55.980
The story of the old man donating
all his money from collecting scraps

00:54:56.063 --> 00:54:59.317
seems to have touched people
really deep in their hearts.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.819
As soon as the story got out

00:55:01.903 --> 00:55:03.404
we got an influx of new donors.

00:55:03.487 --> 00:55:06.282
Some idiots even made huge donations...

00:55:06.365 --> 00:55:09.952
Oh, no. I mean, some people even made
huge donations.

00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:13.039
Yes, I'll always be careful.

00:55:13.122 --> 00:55:15.374
Yes, Mr. President.

00:55:17.543 --> 00:55:19.837
Mr. Kang, I've booked a room
at the hostess bar.

00:55:23.507 --> 00:55:25.051
What? Why?

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.054
In broad daylight?

00:55:28.137 --> 00:55:30.222
A hostess bar? Seriously?

00:55:30.306 --> 00:55:31.599
- Get on the floor.
- Yes, sir.

00:55:31.974 --> 00:55:33.100
You moron.

00:55:33.184 --> 00:55:35.144
- Wake up.
- Wake up!

00:55:35.561 --> 00:55:37.104
- Be on your toes.
- Be on your toes!

00:55:37.188 --> 00:55:38.272
Get up.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.691
- Turn around.
- Turning around!

00:55:40.775 --> 00:55:42.360
- At a 45-degree angle.
- At 45 degrees.

00:55:43.986 --> 00:55:46.280
Let's go!

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:47.990
- Let's go!
- Go!

00:55:48.074 --> 00:55:50.034
- Let's go!
- Go!

00:55:50.117 --> 00:55:51.160
Come on!

00:55:51.994 --> 00:55:55.164
Press 2 to confirm
that you're Ms. Park Mal-rye.

00:55:57.208 --> 00:55:58.501
Confirmed.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.921
It's done now.

00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:05.299
Now, they'll withdraw 10,000 won
from your bank account

00:56:05.383 --> 00:56:06.801
on the 25th day of each month.

00:56:06.884 --> 00:56:08.928
Oh, wow! Perfect.

00:56:09.011 --> 00:56:11.389
It's so thoughtful of you to do this.

00:56:11.472 --> 00:56:12.974
I know you have it hard already.

00:56:13.057 --> 00:56:16.394
No, some even donate everything they have.

00:56:16.477 --> 00:56:17.853
This is nothing compared to them.

00:56:18.562 --> 00:56:20.314
Whenever I think about my Na-yeong

00:56:20.398 --> 00:56:24.568
I feel like I need to do more good things
for good karma.

00:56:27.196 --> 00:56:30.658
I know I shouldn't donate anything
with this mindset.

00:56:30.741 --> 00:56:32.410
Why not?

00:56:32.493 --> 00:56:34.036
It's for your granddaughter

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.248
and other children in the country.

00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:38.541
Right?

00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:41.002
Honey

00:56:41.544 --> 00:56:43.129
it's all sorted now. Let's go home.

00:56:43.212 --> 00:56:44.463
- Okay.
- And here.

00:56:45.297 --> 00:56:48.592
They were selling huge sacks of chestnuts
at the market.

00:56:48.676 --> 00:56:49.719
It's chestnut season.

00:56:49.802 --> 00:56:51.929
My gosh, you always have something for me.

00:56:52.013 --> 00:56:53.889
I don't know how to thank you.

00:56:53.973 --> 00:56:56.392
It's not that much. No need to thank us.

00:56:56.475 --> 00:56:59.145
Thank you so much.

00:57:03.024 --> 00:57:04.859
Don't you have a date? It's the weekend.

00:57:10.823 --> 00:57:12.074
I'm meeting Jeong-ho later.

00:57:13.242 --> 00:57:15.911
Why are you meeting a guy?
You have a girlfriend.

00:57:17.538 --> 00:57:19.540
Did she break up with you already?

00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:22.126
We fed her two bowls of rice that day.

00:57:22.209 --> 00:57:24.712
If she broke up with you after that,
that's stealing!

00:57:24.795 --> 00:57:25.838
Han-young.

00:57:26.547 --> 00:57:28.299
- Han-young!
- What?

00:57:28.382 --> 00:57:29.508
No, right?

00:57:30.843 --> 00:57:31.969
I'll see her again.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.638
See?

00:57:37.266 --> 00:57:39.518
Han-young

00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.897
you know that thing?

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.398
Not even the Chief Justice

00:57:44.482 --> 00:57:46.734
let alone a judge, can understand
what "that thing" is.

00:57:46.817 --> 00:57:48.152
Stop it!

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:50.821
You know the organization

00:57:51.238 --> 00:57:53.324
former President Park advertises?

00:57:54.408 --> 00:57:57.286
The one that helps kids in need
and sick kids.

00:57:59.663 --> 00:58:01.123
The Seonjin Happiness Foundation?

00:58:01.207 --> 00:58:02.958
Yeah, that one.

00:58:04.085 --> 00:58:05.920
You know Ms. Park, who brings us scraps?

00:58:06.003 --> 00:58:09.840
She's donating 10,000 won per month now

00:58:09.924 --> 00:58:12.384
so her granddaughter has good karma.

00:58:12.468 --> 00:58:15.179
That's more than a whole cart
full of scraps.

00:58:15.262 --> 00:58:17.056
That's huge for her.

00:58:17.556 --> 00:58:18.974
That being said

00:58:19.058 --> 00:58:21.060
I also want to do something good

00:58:21.143 --> 00:58:23.479
for your good karma

00:58:23.562 --> 00:58:25.272
and make some donations.

00:58:25.606 --> 00:58:26.899
They're good people, right?

00:58:26.982 --> 00:58:28.901
How can you doubt the foundation?

00:58:29.443 --> 00:58:32.321
You think Mr. Park would agree
to advertise a corrupt foundation?

00:58:35.407 --> 00:58:38.285
I donate to a different organization

00:58:38.661 --> 00:58:41.539
so don't ever donate to that one, okay?

00:58:45.668 --> 00:58:46.710
Okay.

00:58:46.961 --> 00:58:48.003
Okay.

00:58:54.093 --> 00:58:55.970
This is a search and seizure.
Please comply.

00:58:56.053 --> 00:58:57.429
The Chairman of Seonjin was arrested

00:58:57.513 --> 00:59:00.641
for misappropriation of money
and breach of trust in the past life.

00:59:01.058 --> 00:59:03.435
There were rumors
that Gwang-to was behind this

00:59:03.519 --> 00:59:05.354
but people eventually forgot about it.

00:59:07.481 --> 00:59:08.732
What are you doing?

00:59:08.816 --> 00:59:10.442
Let go! Where are you taking me?

00:59:10.568 --> 00:59:11.569
Fine!

00:59:11.652 --> 00:59:13.070
Cover the table with newspapers.

00:59:15.906 --> 00:59:17.241
What's all this?

00:59:19.368 --> 00:59:20.744
That's so much.

00:59:23.289 --> 00:59:25.291
People at the market brought them.

00:59:25.374 --> 00:59:28.210
Mr. Seok exchanges the food at the store
with them.

00:59:28.836 --> 00:59:30.713
We get so much food

00:59:30.796 --> 00:59:33.757
that my grandma and I are getting chubby.

00:59:34.216 --> 00:59:36.177
Ms. Park looks even prettier
with some chub.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:38.721
Stop the chitchat
and go back to your homework.

00:59:38.804 --> 00:59:40.097
I'm already done.

00:59:40.181 --> 00:59:42.224
Don't talk back! Do your homework!

00:59:42.308 --> 00:59:43.475
Enjoy.

00:59:45.811 --> 00:59:47.771
Hey...

00:59:49.315 --> 00:59:51.942
I didn't know you had this side of you.

00:59:53.861 --> 00:59:55.487
Don't be too kind to your part-timers.

00:59:55.571 --> 00:59:57.323
Look at her, talking back to her boss.

00:59:57.406 --> 00:59:59.033
It's like she has no manners.

01:00:02.745 --> 01:00:04.580
- That's not it.
- Huh?

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:09.960
- Han-young...
- She's thankful.

01:00:10.336 --> 01:00:13.464
She was smiling,
but the way she talked back...

01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:15.841
- You saw her.
- Alright, let's eat.

01:00:15.925 --> 01:00:18.344
Mr. Park, you may be slow,
but you can still eat, too.

01:00:19.637 --> 01:00:20.888
There's a high chance

01:00:20.971 --> 01:00:24.308
that the Seonjin Happiness Foundation is
Gwang-to's pool for his slush funds.

01:00:25.017 --> 01:00:26.894
Let's give Tae-sik's case more publicity

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:28.395
and strike Gwang-to, too.

01:00:30.522 --> 01:00:31.732
That won't be easy.

01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:34.985
He's so popular
that he could still get elected

01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:36.695
if he were to run for presidency now.

01:00:37.279 --> 01:00:40.199
If we don't strike him properly,
he'll get all of us.

01:00:41.367 --> 01:00:43.327
And his supporters won't stay still.

01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:45.788
That's why we have to expose

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.915
Gwang-to's ugly real self.

01:00:49.124 --> 01:00:50.376
Here's a question.

01:00:50.459 --> 01:00:53.545
How will Sin-jin react to us
attacking the Seonjin Happiness Foundation

01:00:53.796 --> 01:00:55.381
and getting Gwang-to?

01:00:58.342 --> 01:01:00.469
You said they were a team.

01:01:00.886 --> 01:01:04.014
He'd try to use the Judiciary
to protect Gwang-to.

01:01:04.807 --> 01:01:08.644
But if we shake things hard enough
for Gwang-to to fall from his treehouse

01:01:08.727 --> 01:01:11.397
Sin-jin will be tempted to do otherwise.

01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:18.320
Because he wants to become
the leader of Suojae.

01:01:20.572 --> 01:01:23.784
This threat for Gwang-to will fuel a fire
for betrayal.

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:33.252
Oh.

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:35.087
About Tae-sik.

01:01:36.255 --> 01:01:38.424
His arrest warrant has been delayed
by a week.

01:01:38.757 --> 01:01:39.758
Why?

01:01:40.217 --> 01:01:41.635
The higher-ups wouldn't tell us.

01:01:42.136 --> 01:01:44.054
We have to wait a week, no matter what.

01:01:44.138 --> 01:01:46.849
In the past life

01:01:46.932 --> 01:01:50.019
Tae-sik poisoned a CEO of an affiliate
to stage a suicide

01:01:50.894 --> 01:01:52.980
and tried to stage my suicide, too.

01:01:53.564 --> 01:01:55.190
Something is definitely up.

01:01:55.983 --> 01:01:59.361
Was there anything odd
during his emergency arrest?

01:02:00.904 --> 01:02:04.116
He denied all allegations
and talked like a snake, as always.

01:02:04.533 --> 01:02:05.743
Think carefully.

01:02:10.039 --> 01:02:12.207
He talked about living and being in hell.

01:02:13.751 --> 01:02:15.002
But that's all crap.

01:02:18.047 --> 01:02:19.048
Wait.

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:39.735
What was that?

01:02:42.488 --> 01:02:45.949
FIND HAPPINESS
WITH SEONJIN HAPPINESS FOUNDATION

01:02:57.836 --> 01:03:00.255
I can't stop thinking about it.
I can't sleep.

01:03:47.636 --> 01:03:49.972
You definitely slept well last night.

01:03:50.055 --> 01:03:51.432
Look at that glow!

01:03:54.685 --> 01:03:55.978
No need to come here anymore.

01:03:56.061 --> 01:03:58.439
I'll weld my door shut
or sleep outside if I have to.

01:03:58.522 --> 01:04:00.524
I'll take care of myself
until we get Tae-sik.

01:04:02.317 --> 01:04:03.444
See you at work.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.196
Hey, Jin-a!

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:09.575
Hey, here.

01:04:12.035 --> 01:04:15.122
Don't just tase anyone who annoys you.

01:04:15.205 --> 01:04:16.623
Don't shoot at anyone, okay?

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:20.127
Who do you think I am?

01:04:20.419 --> 01:04:21.503
I don't need it.

01:04:21.587 --> 01:04:23.297
What? Don't make me sleep here again.

01:04:31.513 --> 01:04:32.723
Thanks, anyway.

01:04:33.515 --> 01:04:34.516
See you at work.

01:05:09.927 --> 01:05:11.512
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

01:05:17.267 --> 01:05:18.268
No.

01:05:21.647 --> 01:05:25.275
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:06.024
Sin-jin wants to be the new leader there.

01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:08.193
I was going to get rid of them all

01:06:08.277 --> 01:06:09.861
once I became the leader of Suojae.

01:06:09.945 --> 01:06:11.697
To break it, I must trigger
a fracture from the inside.

01:06:11.905 --> 01:06:14.032
The target is
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

01:06:14.116 --> 01:06:16.577
Your ammo is corruption
in the Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

01:06:16.743 --> 01:06:19.663
We found fraudulent ledgers!
How can we not investigate it?

01:06:19.746 --> 01:06:22.332
You want to strike the Seonjin Foundation?
I can help you.

01:06:22.416 --> 01:06:23.458
What the hell are you doing?

01:06:23.542 --> 01:06:25.586
Someone said I was garbage.

01:06:26.837 --> 01:06:28.297
That crazy bastard!

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.465
Didn't expect my chance to come so soon.

01:06:30.757 --> 01:06:31.967
Do whatever you want.

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:33.093
Bang!

01:06:36.054 --> 01:06:38.056
