[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.979
[Episode 6]

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.950
How dare you!

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.150
Your Majesty!

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.950
Your Majesty!

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.479
Your Majesty,
I'm only doing this for Great Xia!

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.710
Even if it may displease you,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.870
I must speak up!

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.830
Th—That's right!

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.759
I am willing to die to make my point!

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.840
Me too!

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.590
I wasn't talking about you.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.530
Come on.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.259
My beloved ministers,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.479
please rise.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.430
Get up.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.520
-Hurry.
-Get up.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.120
Up, up, up.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.710
Recently,
several of the Empress Dowager’s faction

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.800
have submitted memorials
impeaching your father.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.460
I pretended to have a headache
to brush them off.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.360
It seems the Empress Dowager
means to make an example of him.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.620
Should we respond?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.740
We could.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.960
Just...

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.250
demote him.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.680
That heartless?

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.320
It’s not heartless.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.670
It's for his own good.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.030
How so?

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.150
On the surface, they’re impeaching him.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.840
In truth,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.240
the Empress Dowager is warning me.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.150
After all, the incident of
Noble Consort Wei losing the sarira agate

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.550
escalated because of me.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.590
If she doesn’t vent her anger,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.050
this nominal father of mine

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.800
may suffer far worse.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.520
Then we can't just demote your father.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.240
I should probably give you
the cold shoulder for a while too.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.770
We have to make it look real.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.320
CEO Dan, you’re meticulous.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.750
Minister Yu!

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.990
How dare you!

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.390
Your Majesty,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.079
I am

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.390
wrongly accused, Your Majesty!

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.829
Your Majesty!

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.120
It’s true I enjoy playing cards

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.280
and often gather with a few friends.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.960
But...

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.230
accusing me of taking bribes

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.750
is simply false!

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.310
I’m just better at cards than most,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.820
so winning a bit more is normal.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.770
However,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.960
the game I play

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.690
is 10 coins a round,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.130
with a daily cap
of half a string of coins!

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.079
How...

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.510
How could that

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.500
possibly count as taking bribes,
Your Majesty?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.190
How dare you keep making excuses!

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.750
If only one person impeached you,
you could claim injustice.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.680
But now 3 court ministers
are impeaching you together,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.120
with evidence to back it up!

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.710
How can you argue your way out of this?

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.170
Guards!

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.240
Take off his official hat!

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.560
Yes!

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.680
It’s already fallen off.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.640
Then demote him and dock his pay!

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.370
Get out!

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.080
Your Majesty!

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.430
Your Majesty!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.910
I...

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.480
I am innocent, Your Majesty!

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.480
Your Majesty, I am innocent!

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.430
Your Majesty,

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.370
for my sake,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.200
please spare my father!

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.790
You dare plead for him?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.220
If I spare Minister Yu,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.060
how will the court officials view me?

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.370
And how do I answer to the people?

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.120
My father...

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.770
My father only gambles for fun.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.900
He never took bribes!

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.510
Stop making excuses!

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.640
Between officials,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.560
there is no such thing
as gambling for fun!

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.290
Well then...

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.610
have some aorta.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.300
Here.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.060
Have some vegetables.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.470
You’ve got mouth ulcers.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.670
Your Majesty,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.320
are you really unwilling to show me
even a bit of leniency?

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.500
I’ve already shown plenty.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.480
Otherwise, how would that old man

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.670
still be alive?

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.920
Kneeling won’t help!

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.450
Go back to your Zhaoyang Palace
immediately!

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.640
I'm not full yet.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.860
Say two more lines.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.390
Any more and it's just filler dialogue.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.360
Just pad it a bit.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.500
You’re heartless, cold,

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.310
and completely unreasonable!

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.040
How dare you call me heartless,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.900
cold,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.490
and unreasonable?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.560
Then answer me this.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.970
How am I heartless,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.720
cold,

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.680
and unreasonable?

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.270
Your Majesty, please calm your anger!

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.190
I will never do it again!

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.000
If there's a next time,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.330
I’ll wipe out your entire clan!

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.800
I honestly can't keep up
with your performance.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.860
Let's call it a day.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.670
No, no, no!

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.300
It's worth half my lifetime’s wages.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.460
No matter how expensive it is,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.080
can you take it with you?

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.560
[Bilan Pavilion]

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.420
Have you heard?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.210
His Majesty flew into a rage

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.560
and kicked Consort Yu
straight out of his bedchamber,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.600
all the way to the palace gate.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.510
She has completely lost face.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.160
Does His Majesty really have
that kind of strength?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.160
Of course he does.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.090
I also heard that Consort Yu

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.430
stayed at the palace gate
and refused to leave,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.720
begging nonstop for her gambler father.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.870
In a fit of anger, His Majesty

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.570
almost had her executed.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.140
Sisters, where did you hear all this?

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.140
Is it true?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.770
Oh, my silly little sister.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.000
I don't know about other things,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.590
but no one gathers gossips

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.480
better than Concubine He
and Concubine Chu.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.950
Your Majesty!

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.120
Your Majesty!

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.310
Why are you so heartless?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.000
That is my father

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.310
who gave birth to me, raised me,
and taught me everything!

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.460
This time, Consort Yu

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.000
is done for.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.240
She's doomed.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.720
Then...

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.360
what are we waiting for?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.560
Sisters,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.260
since ancient times they’ve always said
that beauty brings ruin to nations.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.190
It refers to people like Noble Consort Wei
and Noble Consort Yu.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.480
Some rely on family background,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.640
others on beauty.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.430
But they only bewitched His Majesty
for a moment.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.360
And what kind of man is His Majesty?

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.220
He cares for the realm
and holds all the people in his heart.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.360
How could he be so easily bewitched?

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.070
As consorts, we must not imitate

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.800
those demonic consorts
who bewitch their ruler.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.240
Instead, we should keep Great Xia in our hearts and share His Majesty’s burdens.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.370
Am I right, Sisters?

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.180
Where is everyone?

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.270
They all went
to share His Majesty’s burdens.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.250
Wait for me!

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.510
[Bilan Pavilion]

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.430
Wait for me!

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.460
I'm coming too!

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.760
With the likes of you,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.720
how can you compete with her?

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.600
Your Majesty.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.470
Consort Shu just came by.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.160
Fearing she might disturb your rest,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.890
I had her tell me about
what happened to Consort Yu

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.230
and sent her away.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.800
His Majesty dealt with

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.240
Minister Yu so swiftly?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.830
I really

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.680
didn’t expect it.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.390
What is there to be surprised about?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.510
A caged canary—

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.560
once released,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.690
can it really fly up to the sky?

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.520
You're right.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.120
Consort Yu indeed

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.870
made a huge scene because of it.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.260
His Majesty scolded her harshly

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.110
and kicked her out in the end.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.120
She’s too inexperienced.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.790
So short-sighted.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.410
She doesn’t understand

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.870
how quickly a ruler’s heart can change.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.930
Yes, indeed.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.630
This Consort Shu,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.480
however, has real insight.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.720
Have her come to pay her respects to me
within the next few days.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.080
Yes.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.710
Your Majesty,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.900
Lord Mu
has been waiting outside for a long time.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.120
Let him in now.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.910
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.960
Mr. Mu,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.000
how did you come up with that idea?

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.630
Mr. Mu

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.630
is remarkably sharp.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.360
How did he know

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.780
that Minister Yu loves to play cards?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.000
This is truly killing two birds
with one stone.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120
The plan

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.480
seems perfectly logical.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.200
It pleased me greatly.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.910
I only offered a small strategy.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.510
It was all thanks to
Consort Shu’s brother.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.360
The few words he spoke in court

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.630
proved crucial.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.270
Not only did every word hit the mark,

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.520
but they also blocked any possibility
of His Majesty showing mercy.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.270
Good.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.030
Useful people like him

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.600
must be heavily rewarded.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.440
I

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.260
will take my leave now.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.880
Your Majesty,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.240
I'll go prepare the rewards now.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.390
Rewards?

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.790
To be able to serve me

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.790
is the greatest reward of all.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.200
You are too honest.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.390
Look.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.960
These 3 little birds

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.670
are becoming brighter and brighter.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.330
How did the Minister of Revenue

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.390
die?

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.720
And who arrested

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.360
Grand Tutor Wei?

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.230
As for General Luo's son,

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.810
if he didn’t want him to enter the palace,

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.320
could he really not stop him?

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.690
The knife was handed to him by others,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.080
but whether he takes it or not

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.720
ultimately depends on His Majesty’s will.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.480
His Highness, you mean...

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.390
Our Emperor

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.480
has always been unpredictable.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.720
Still, I must remind you all

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.670
not to be fooled by his mad-king facade.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.080
Especially now,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.480
in this palace,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.750
he is no longer alone.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.530
Ever since the fire at the library,

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.270
His Highness
has not entered the palace again.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.910
I went to inquire at his residence.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.150
They only said

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.030
His Highness
has been busy with official duties.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.750
I then asked whether His Highness

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.010
had seen the letter in the brocade pouch,

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.530
and they gave no reply.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.690
Your Highness,
with Consort Yu’s father demoted

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.000
and she herself

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.930
fallen out of His Majesty's favor,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.240
all other consorts

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.000
are doing everything they can
to vie for His Majesty’s attention.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.200
Let them fight for it.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.390
I don't care.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.200
Yu Wanyin was right.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.910
Here,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.150
a man can lift you to the heavens today

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.430
and cast you into hell tomorrow.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.840
Their love and hate
are but a fleeting whim.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.650
Your Highness.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.390
Your Highness,
Eunuch An is here with a decree.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.790
Concubine Xie.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.720
His Majesty decrees
that
Concubine Xie is to attend him tonight.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.470
Congratulations, Your Highness.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.360
What?

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.910
He wants me to attend him tonight?

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:47.440
What?

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.270
Let her attend me?

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.030
Yes.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.210
You want me to find another woman...

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.800
to serve me in bed?

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.270
Keep it down.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.670
What's going on inside?

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.080
His Majesty and Noble Consort Yu
seem to have a quarrel.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.900
A quarrel?

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.730
Why does it feel like I'm forcing
a good boy into prostitution?

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.120
It's not like she'll actually
serve you in bed.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.000
I just figured out

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.260
how to get the list of scholars
out of her.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.480
Mr. Bei.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:20.750
Mr. Bei.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.240
You've roamed the world for so long

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.040
and lived among the common folk.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.350
Do you know of any drug

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.440
that can make someone hallucinate?

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.200
You want to drug Dan?

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.040
No, no.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.000
How could I do that to CEO...

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.470
I am using it for a proper purpose.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.000
I need someone to tell the truth.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:40.790
Simple.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.490
Get him drunk.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.670
Right.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.600
Drink makes people talk.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.080
But what if she remembers everything

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.550
the next morning?

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.390
That’s even easier.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.570
Make her drink more.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.550
You know I speed-read the book,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.480
so I don't remember the scholars' names
at all.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.720
But Xie Yong'er does.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.550
She went through the entire

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.840
"A thousand trees blossoms at night
in the East" carefully.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.240
When those talented and virtuous scholars

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.200
died unjustly,

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.150
it was truly heartbreaking.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.270
It must have made a deep impression
on her.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.400
And when the next imperial exam comes,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.120
the list of candidates Prince Duan
is going to poach will come from her.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.360
Stop grunting.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.390
Why don’t you...

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:26.520
think it over again?

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.320
Besides,
I’ve already acted without consulting you

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.920
and had Eunuch An notify her.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.600
You...

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.720
So, for the greater good,

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.050
make a small sacrifice.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.910

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.960
This one is a poem.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.030
While that one...

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.030
[Colorful black, haha][Earth Element]

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.000
Well...

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.840
In my humble opinion,

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:50.639
these...

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.730
these two pieces

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.800
don’t seem to be written
by the same person.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.150
It's time to meet her.
