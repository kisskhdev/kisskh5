WEBVTT

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.677
Who cares if I get hurt?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.389
I can just leave again.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.100
To anywhere.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.105
Is disappearing that easy for you?

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.027
When I get tired of people and sick of relationships,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.446
it's better to just disappear.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:30.447
I think that's wrong.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.032
I don't think so.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:38.830
Because that's how I endure.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.754
So was it that easy back then too?

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:57.599
Don't go.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:12.530
Don't go, Hangyeol.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:30.024
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.736
The one who left me first,

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:35.738
was you.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:09.105
That day, if I had made a different choice,

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:12.066
would we have been different?

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:35.298
I thought Hyung had disappeared...

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.550
I was so scared.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.973
Please pretend you don't know me in front of people at the company.

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.518
I don't want to.

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:49.604
Even if we force out a past connection,

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.192
only uncomfortable memories will remain.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.821
But I know myself well.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.535
Even if I go back to that day,

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.456
I know I would make the same choice.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.921
What are you smiling at?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.547
Someone enlisting in the army the day after tomorrow.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.799
Jeju Island.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.635
Ah, right, you're going to Jeju Island, aren't you?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.595
Did Minji send you the restaurant list?

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.264
Yeah.

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:27.684
Hey, but why did you say you were going with your mom?

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.686
Hey, if you said you were going with your lover,

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:32.480
Minji, who set up the blind date, would feel 'so great'.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.277
How does this bastard date with this kind of sense?

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.330
Hey.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.956
What?

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:50.707
Give me your hand.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:51.666
Why?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.127
Hurry!

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.380
Check it somewhere with no people.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.721
Ah, he's crazy, seriously...

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.555
Ah, put it away quickly.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:06.889
It's a leftover from yesterday.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.391
Ah, you use it.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.065
Have a safe trip!

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:31.497
Lee Hangyeol?

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:35.585
I heard he's preparing to transfer universities?

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:37.420
Crazy.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.213
Hey, do you believe that?

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:42.091
I'm Lee Hangyeol's ex-boyfriend.

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.844
Do you really know who you're meeting?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:49.015
Lee Hangyeol, he hit on me first.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.850
Ah, he's like that.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.644
Why would he suddenly prepare to transfer?

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:54.562
Because he has a guilty conscience.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.022
Right?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.233
What's this wound?

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:03.363
Ah... this...

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.783
I had a fight with a cat that has a nasty temper.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.243
He stalked me.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.914
Of course I feel wronged.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.293
If he transfers schools,

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.878
I'm going to spread rumors right away.

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.048
Hey, of course I'm the victim.

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.467
I told you, he stalked me!

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.933
Hey.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.066
Ha... you lunatic.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:40.942
Someone going to the army tomorrow,

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.319
what happened to your face?

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:54.914
Where's my phone?

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.252
Did you contact Hangyeol?

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.045
Go and get a haircut.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.007
I'll take care of fixing your phone.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.262
Is it okay to go without seeing him?

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:13.599
What's the point of showing him this mess?

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.685
I can contact him later.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:19.105
What about that jerk?

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.191
Do you think he'd dare go to school out of embarrassment?

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:25.611
He's a bastard badmouthing Hangyeol because he doesn't want to be outed.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.573
You are really...

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.577
Hopeless.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:10.615
Hangyeol, I'm sorry.

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:37.058
Excuse me... isn't this Hangyeol's place?

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.560
Ah... he moved overseas.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:42.897
Overseas?

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:43.981
Yes...

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.902
I see...

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.326
Hyung.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:58.454
What?

00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:02.875
Do you like being with me?

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:07.296
What if I suddenly disappear?

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:13.678
I'll be by your side somehow, forever.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:21.060
That day, if I had made a different choice,

00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:23.854
would we have been different?
