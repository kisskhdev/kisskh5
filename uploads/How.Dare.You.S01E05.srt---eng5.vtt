We got the wrong person.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.509
It's a misunderstanding.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.000
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.430
Sorry.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.240
Our apologies.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.310
Sorry about that.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.410
How dare you cause trouble on my turf?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.140
You must have a death wish.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.750
Dan.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.140
You really are Dan.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.440
-I...
-You really are Bei Zhou?

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.750
Who is this girl?

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.250
I'm his...

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.070
I'm his favored consort,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.810
the love of his life,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.550
his one and only,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.870
the end of his journey,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.050
and the anchor of his soul,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.400
Yu Wanyin.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.520
Demonic consort.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.840
Dan.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.120
How did you know

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.910
I was here?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.890
But isn't Bei Zhou supposed to be a man?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.000
Bei...

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.130
Mrs. Bei, impressive skills.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.140
Mrs.?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.780
Right. This is it.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.020
We've found the right person.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.000
Bone-Constriction Skill?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.930

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.320
Is this really the same person?

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.050
Definitely.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.640
Look at his eyes.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.390
So bright,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.920
so beautiful,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.680
and so round—

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.260
clearly not the eyes of a worker bee.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.720
So, Dan,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.360
how did you know

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.250
someone like me exists?

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.030
I've been away from the capital
for over a decade.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.260
That's because...

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.270
Shut up.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.480
I'm asking Dan.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.560
This is bad.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.270
He's testing you.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.480
CEO Dan.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.150
Don't make things up.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.550
Of course I know about you, Mr. Bei,

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.270
because...

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.930
Because...

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.620
Because I told him.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.960
Because you were mentioned

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.430
in my mother's final letter.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.440
Gosh.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.600
You can actually explain it like that?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.890
Even the original novel
isn't as good as your story.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.550
How did Nan write about me?

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.020
I know this one!

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.540
Just be as melodramatic as possible.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.390
Something like "never once dreamed of
returning home for 10 years,"

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.000
"longing for each other from afar
yet unrecognized,"

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.240
or "vows remain,
but letters are hard to send."

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.159
Mother said,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.330
"Dan, if you're ever in danger,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.940
the only person in the world to trust

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.800
is Bei Zhou."

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.560
You might as well just write
"Bei Zhou is useful"

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.159
on your forehead.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.490
What?

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.150
Those words actually moved him to tears?

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.500
She still remembered me.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.310
Actually,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.940
since ascending the throne,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.480
I immediately sent people to look for you.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.080
Only after many years

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.150
did we finally catch a faint trace of
your whereabouts, Mr. Bei.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.080
I came today

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.620
merely to try my luck.

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:34.840
I never expected

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.710
to run into this incident.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.560
That man deserved to die.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.440
In his room,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.560
I found this.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.090
How can anyone read this?

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.750
Reading so intently—

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.750
do you even know the Qiang language?

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.690
That man was an assassin
sent by the Qiang State?

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.870
Dan,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.560
you are truly smart—

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.740
just as smart as Nan.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.720
The Qiang State is wedged between
Yan and Xia.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.070
It's a mere speck of land,

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.530
unable to protect itself,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.600
so it resorts to
underhanded assassinations,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.070
trying to stir up internal strife
in our state.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.670
But why did he want to kill me?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.870
Our probing just now

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.470
might have made him think
his identity was exposed,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.920
so he tried to silence you.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.240
Or maybe these incompetents
you brought with you

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.750
made him realize he'd already
blown his cover

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.190
and that someone was coming after him.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.190
It seems the Qiang State
has been driven into a corner.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:44.800
Today,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.530
I'm fortunate to have been saved by you,
Mr. Bei.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.650
To be honest,

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.350
my situation in the palace

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.470
is indeed perilous now—

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.830
beset on all sides.

You really know how to put on an act.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.400
In truth, I returned to the capital

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.770
for the sole purpose of keeping you safe.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.330
If I were to abandon you,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.200

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.750
keep you safe?

-Let's leave together, Auntie.
-Take us with you.

Given the current situation,

should we call him Mr. Bei or Mrs. Bei?

after we return to the palace,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.790
you won't need to wear a disguise anymore.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.990
Just pose as my guard.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.610
No need.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.390
I prefer the way I look now.

could you tell me more

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.000
about your story with my mother?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.750
Nan

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.670
was the only person in the world
who understood me.

She never despised me.

and how to dress myself.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.080
I remember that back then,

You can write poems?

Can you compose one right now?

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.520
Three on the roof, two in the side hall,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.850
one in the side room
and one in the kitchen.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.660
Great.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.690
Now all 7 men of ours

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.520
are completely exposed.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.690
These are all our own people.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.390
It's fine.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.270
I earnestly ask you, Mr. Bei,

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.090
to treat her

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.730
as you'd treat me.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.800
Please ensure her safety at all costs.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.630
Rest assured.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.200
I'll definitely eliminate

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.380
the traitors at Your Majesty's side.

Straight.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.840

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.320
Come on, pay up.

-Come on.
-Here.

Here.

Prince Duan?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.940
What would bring him here?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.360
He says he's here to congratulate you—

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.220
Consort Yu has just been elevated
to Noble Consort.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:51.600
Master.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:52.920
Noble...

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.220
Noble Consort?

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.190
I didn't know Your Highness...

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.390
I didn't know Your Highness was coming.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.240
Please forgive me for not welcoming you

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.720
properly, Your Highness.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.270
Vice Minister Yu,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.730
there is no need for such formalities.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.120
I just happened to

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.500
be passing by

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.010
and thought I'd share in
the Noble Consort's joy.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.010
Your Highness,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.200
you are too kind.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.630
I...

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.370
Actually, I hadn't received any news.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.970
For such a big matter
as being made Noble Consort,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.550
she didn't even send word home?

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.910
To be honest, Your Highness,

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.310
ever since my daughter became a concubine,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.120
she hasn't contacted us.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.910
But I understand—

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.920
after all, it's not appropriate
for the harem

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.000
to interact too much

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.730
with their original families.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.140
Well, that is true.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.640
Lord Yu, you have truly
raised your daughter well.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.510
Not only is Noble Consort Yu

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.040
exceptionally beautiful,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.340
I've also heard she's highly accomplished
in her studies.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.320
It just so happens that
I have a close friend

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.780
whose daughter has always

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.370
looked up to Noble Consort Yu
as a role model.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.580
So I'd like to

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.650
ask you for a favor:

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.290
please select one of
Consort Yu's calligraphy or paintings

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.420
to give her as a gift.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.000
Of... Of course, why not?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.080
Fu.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.710
Hurry and bring one of

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:35.870
Lady Yu's calligraphy or paintings.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.330
Master.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.320
Her Highness sent someone a few days ago

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.380
to take all her works into the palace.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:41.840
That day,

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.870
you weren't here.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.910
Your Highness,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.080
you see, I didn't know.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.830
But it's okay.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.240
I taught my daughter everything
she knows about calligraphy and painting.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.440
I can write something for you.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.000
Lord Yu.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.510
It's okay. Forget it.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.770
Please don't say that.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.850
I'll be quick. Just a moment, please.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.720
The stronger a person is,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.650
the more they prefer to work alone—

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440
even on missions,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.050
they don't bring anyone along.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:28.720
What?

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.600
Mr. Bei

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.380
has gone to Prince Duan's Mansion
to get the book?

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.180
That's right.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.140
Isn't that too rushed?

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:37.980
Xu Yao told us

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.120
to wait a bit

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.570
so we wouldn't alert the enemy.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.270
I'm worried that...

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.980
I know what you're worried about.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.280
Xiahou Bo

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.630
has been scheming painstakingly for years,

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.460
and his mind is

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.550
exceedingly dark and sinister.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.480
Prince Duan's Mansion

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.880
must be heavily guarded.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.820
But Mr. Bei is no ordinary person.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.840
You said it yourself that

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.270
he has the highest combat power
in the entire book.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.670
Even if there's trouble,

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.280
with his abilities,

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.360
I believe

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.970
he can turn it to his advantage.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.970
That's true.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.290
Now that we have
the book Xu Yao left behind

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.200
and know all of Prince Duan's plans,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.640
can we really defeat him?

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.600
How much that book can actually
help us is another matter.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.200
So for now,

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.150
don't overthink it.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.120
I understand the logic,

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.270
but ever since we transmigrated here,

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.130
so many plot points have changed.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.970
I really can't feel at ease.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.550
Besides, in the original story,

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.420
Xu Yao lived for a long time.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.000
Don't worry.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.000
The worst that could happen

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.030
is we die.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.090
Thanks.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.900
That's oddly comforting.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.200
Why is he so handsome?

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.400
I've never seen him trim his eyebrows.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:20.790
So why are they shaped

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.440
so perfectly?

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:24.750
His eyes,

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:25.790
nose,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.040
and mouth.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.140
My dear, are you peeking at me?

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.270
No.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.320
Who's peeking?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.600
I... I was worried about your headache.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.410
I'm going to take a bath now.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.660
Why not together?

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.470
You can see even more.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.850
How inappropriate!

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.510
My dear,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.400
are you peeking at me?

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.060
Stop thinking about it.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.310
Being love-struck is a huge taboo.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.200
In stories like this...

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.720
-Why not together?
-The love-struck all die young.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.580

you are already the weakest.

If you want to survive till the end,

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.670
you can't let primal urges conquer you.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.800
Stay clear-headed.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.410
Clear-headed.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:12.830
Stay clear-headed.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:13.960
Stay clear-headed.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.830
How can I stay clear-headed?

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.750
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.880
Is this from Mr. Bai?

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.400
Yes.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.070
Tell him

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.480
that everything in the palace is as usual

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.610
and that he should proceed as planned.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.930
Yes.

You were slow.

I knew it wouldn't work.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.200
-Dan, look.
-I see.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.640
That's not right.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.310
Ever since she opened this booklet,

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.240
-she's been acting jumpy.
-This...

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.960
Even when I spoke to her,
she wouldn't respond.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.290
-Why is she like this?
-What is this thing?

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.030
What does this mean?

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.650
You're here.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.200
I happen to have something to ask you.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:26.820
Look at this.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.240
[Ways to win over Deputy Commander Zhao]

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.370
"Turn Deputy Zhao."

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.740
Who is Deputy Zhao?

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.550
There is indeed a Deputy Commander
surnamed Zhao in the Imperial Guards.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:34.270
Could it be him?

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.270
That explains it!

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:36.170
Explains what?

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.370
What exactly is written in this book?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.160
This book records

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.680
Prince Duan's future plans.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.810
"Turn Deputy Zhao."

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.410
It basically means

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.830
he wants to turn Deputy Commander Zhao
of the Imperial Guards,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.350
make him the Commander,

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.160
and thereby bring
the Imperial Guards' power

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.400
under his own control.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.480
Aren't the Imperial Guards supposed to
protect the Imperial City?

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.540
If Prince Duan wants to control them,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.810
what is he planning?

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.640
Exactly.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.530
Why do I remember

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.890
this wasn't part of the original story?

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.350
Where did it go wrong?

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.930
Why are you two acting so...

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.020
Isn't he planning a rebellion?

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:22.770
Correct.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.710
But now that we have the book,

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.300
we can defeat them one by one

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.720
and make their

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.270
plans fail.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.770
But the book also says,

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.270
"use foreign spies to eliminate Li."

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.070
Who is this Li?

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.350
A distant relative of the Empress Dowager,

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.790
Vice Minister of Works, Mr. Li.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.440
So Prince Duan intends to
use someone else's hand to kill

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.900
and eliminate his rivals?

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.110
So...

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.830
So our accidental killing

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.630
of the Qiang assassin last night

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.590
might have already ruined
Prince Duan's plan.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.270
He might not be from the Qiang State.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.400
Although Qiang also likes to pull tricks,

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.790
it's more likely the Yan State's doing.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.240
The Yan State...

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.680
Why would the Yan State want to
assassinate someone from Great Xia?

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.790
-The Yan State...
-The Yan State wants to fight for power.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.190
Sending a few assassins

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.210
to kill key officials of Great Xia

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.010
is their bargaining chip
for seizing power.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.180
Plus, the Yan State's land

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.400
is barren and plagued by years of drought.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.800
They can barely survive.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.870
The worse their lives get,
the more they resent us.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.550
What's with the "oh"?

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.960
Mr. Bei, I'd like to ask,

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.450
since

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.880
the Yan State's land is dry and barren,

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.210
what crops do they grow?

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.430
I think it's something called Yan millet.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.110
It's no good anyway,

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.510
rough and tastes terrible.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.000
Anyway, we don't grow it here
in Great Xia.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.200
Even if we did, it'd be for feeding pigs.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.570
-I see.
-I see.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.030
Forget about the plans.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.200
I'll just go chop off Prince Duan's head

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.600
and save you the trouble.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:46.240
Mr. Bei!

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.720
Prince Duan's faction is deeply rooted.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.200
No matter how good you are, Mr. Bei,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.360
you can't possibly fight thousands alone.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:51.830
It's fine.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.720
Besides,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.260
Prince Duan is backed by the Three Armies.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.600
Killing him isn't hard.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.880
The hard part is
seizing military power first.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.350
How do we know if we don't try?

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.070
-Mr. Bei!
-Mr. Bei!

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.470
Even if this is resolved,

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.510
the Empress Dowager will reign supreme.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.240
Her next step

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.440
will be to kill me.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.320
All this killing back and forth

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.400
only treats the symptoms,

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.460
not the root cause.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.600
Then how do we treat the root cause?

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.889
That depends on her.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.190
Her?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.290
Can a demonic consort really save a state?

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:25.110
[Prince Duan's Mansion]

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.630
Your Highness.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.830
Mr. Murong asked me to pass on a message.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.489
Go ahead.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.920
The Commander of the Imperial Guards
indeed has a concubine,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.520
who's extremely beautiful.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.880
She often goes to Nanshan Temple
to burn incense.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.800
Her route and Deputy Commander Zhao's

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.130
overlap in some places.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.110
If we drug him

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.960
and make him take liberties with her,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.920
the two men will surely become enemies.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.230
If Your Highness recruits
Deputy Commander Zhao then,

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.830
you'll surely succeed
in one decisive stroke.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.530
What else did he say?

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.400
Mr. Murong praised this plan
for achieving much with little,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.930
and said that the strategist behind it
is worthy of great trust.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.300
Give this letter to His Highness.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.560
It will surely help His Highness
make a comeback.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.470
How does Xie Yong'er know so much?

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.930
Your Highness.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.940
Shall I proceed with the plan?

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:32.640
Go and investigate

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:36.000
if Concubine Xie had any dealings
with these people

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.730
before she entered the palace.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.980
Yes.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.920
Still reading?

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.650
You've been at it for ages.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.480
This is Xu Yao's journal.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.560
He probably never expected

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.600
it would become evidence for us.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.280
But a lot of information is hidden
between the lines.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:10.880
I need to study it carefully.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.280
Study carefully?

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:14.800
Is that so?

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.520
Then let me study it too!

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.960
I'm not done yet. Stop it.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.840
Xiahou Dan!

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.710
Why can't I read it?

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.070
You're so childish.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.410
Go take a break.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.430
Stop it.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.670
Give it back to me.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.000
-I'm not done yet.
-Let me study it.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
So only you can study it carefully?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.110
Give it to me!

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.170
Who allowed you in?

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.590
Y-Your Majesty, please forgive me.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.030
These are Her Ladyship's
favorite pastries.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.230
I thought I'd bring them to her...

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.550
Leave this sort of thing

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.880
to Madam Bei from now on.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:46.640
Leave us!

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.380
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.610
You didn't have to be so harsh on her.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.590
Was I?

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.210
Look, how do you pronounce this character?

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.400
[Talents who failed
the February imperial exam]

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:05.760
Wei.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.990
As in "Weishi," meaning the imperial exam.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.710
Impressive.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.450
You even know such an obscure character.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.560
I picked it up practicing calligraphy.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:17.670
So here,

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:21.210
"talents who failed
the February imperial exam" means

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.360
that during the imperial exam
next February,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.360
Prince Duan will recruit
some of the talents

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.760
who fail the exam, right?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.400
Why recruit those who fail?

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.570
Because of that Empress Dowager,
of course.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.070
The current imperial exams

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.130
are plagued by fraud and corruption.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.510
Scholars from poor families
never stand a chance.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.920
As long as Prince Duan recruits
capable, ambitious people

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.670
and offers them even minor official posts,

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.670
they'll all end up

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.630
pledging their loyalty to him, won't they?

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:49.890
Besides, the book says

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.440
the scholars Prince Duan recruited

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.830
include many talents

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.150
who ended up becoming capable ministers.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.410
What should we do then?

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.190
Beat him to it

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.700
and poach them.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.540
Poach them?

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.710
Your Majesty, I have a matter to report!

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.640
I wish to impeach

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.990
[Lord Wang]

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.040
Minister Yu

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.230
for perverting the law
and lining his own pockets.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.480
I second that.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.880
Minister Yu relies on his status
as a royal relative

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.540
to disrupt court discipline.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.990
I hope Your Majesty
will judge this fairly.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.520
Although Minister Yu
is Consort Yu's father

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.460
and holds a fourth-rank post,

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.840
royal relatives

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.700
cannot place themselves above the law.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:41.230
What?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.670
Minister Yu often invites officials
to his residence

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.710
and accepts bribes

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.740
under the guise of playing cards.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.450
I have recorded all the money

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.540
he embezzled in the past year.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.410
I hope Your Majesty prioritizes the law,

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.110
handles this impartially,

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.370
and does not let Minister Yu off lightly.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.960
How dare you!

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.760
Your Majesty!

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.590
Your Majesty.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:28.030
Your Majesty.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.190
Your Majesty, I only have Great Xia's
best interests at heart.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.400
Even if it displeases Your Majesty,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:31.760
I

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.130
must remonstrate!

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.940
E-E-Exactly.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.280
I am willing to remonstrate with my life!

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.390
So am I!
