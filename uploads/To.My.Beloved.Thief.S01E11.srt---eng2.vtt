WEBVTT

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:48.631
All these tragedies

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.301
began with Your Majesty.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:56.598
Say that again.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.391
It's Your Majesty's fault.

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:03.188
Say that again.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.147
Your Majesty!

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:06.524
It's your fault.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.623
Hong Eun-jo!

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.008
That's the person you see?

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:36.429
Does this mean Hong Eun-jo is now…

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.394
Young Master.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.814
This is the last time I'm asking.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.191
Say that again.

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:54.948
No.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.536
If you go to the palace,
you'll put everyone in danger.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.495
Don't you understand?

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:01.579
It should've been me.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.207
I should be me!

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.671
Answer me.

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:13.716
I said, answer me!

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.802
Your Majesty!

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:18.930
Please stop.

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:20.390
Step aside.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.100
{\an8}Will you destroy everything yourself?

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:24.602
Was Hong Min-jik not enough for you?

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:42.579
Lady Jang.

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:45.373
Please return to your bedchamber.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.627
All of you, withdraw at once.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.589
The Grand Prince
will follow me to the main hall.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.260
Halt the interrogation.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:58.386
Yes, sir!

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.477
Yesterday, my son died.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.897
Today, your father died.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:11.774
Tomorrow, it could be your mother

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.026
and brother.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.360
And then,

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.404
you could be the next.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:18.740
When you're in the main hall,

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:21.451
please do not provoke His Majesty.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.037
Please spare your life, Your Highness.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.709
Don't worry.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.468
{\an8}Your Highness,
is the interrogation already over?

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.888
{\an8}Hong-si must be headed to the palace now.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.432
{\an8}Tell her this when you see her.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.645
{\an8}There will be…

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.815
{\an8}He said there would be no more mistakes?

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.026
{\an8}He said you would know what it means.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.033
{\an8}So the State Tribunal was dismissed,
and he's alone with His Majesty?

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.998
Who is it?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.837
I'm afraid I do not understand,
Your Majesty.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.342
Who is this person standing in my way,
hiding behind you?

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.177
Stop!

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.764
Who is this person
speaking through you to blame me?

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:26.516
All these tragedies

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.976
began with Your Majesty.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.519
I'm asking who this person is.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:39.696
Was it you?

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:46.911
Were you behind everything?

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:59.257
Your Majesty,
Secretary Im Jae-i of the State Tribunal

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.509
urgently seeks an audience
with Your Majesty.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:04.679
Let him in.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.192
What is it?

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.529
We found evidence that Hong Dae-il
couldn't have been the assassin.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.073
Bring her in.

00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:47.930
Who are you?

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.266
My father's name is…

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.477
Hong Min-jik.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.023
My young master took
the military examination every year,

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:58.649
but his archery scores were

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.110
never high enough
to even pass the first round.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.946
He lacks the skill
to threaten Your Majesty.

00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:07.909
Is this confirmed?

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:10.578
Her claim about his military exams
has been confirmed to be true.

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:12.705
Could that have been the intent?

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.957
If Hong had planned it
because of a personal grudge,

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.502
that would mean he deliberately
failed the exam for ten years,

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.212
like he knew the future.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.255
And I believe
that could not have been the case.

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.557
I still haven't heard your answer.

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.855
Your Majesty has asked on whose behalf

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.566
I'm defending Hong Min-jik's eldest son.

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:46.155
It's probably myself.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.493
I probably did it for myself.

00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.832
Just like when I took the arrow

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.376
here that was meant for Your Majesty,

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.089
risking my own life.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:15.685
The arrow meant to kill me
has saved your life.

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.771
This should repay what I owe you.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.616
Send Hong Min-jik's son back home.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.660
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:52.889
How was your father's final journey?

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.317
I just hope it was peaceful.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.574
Is there anything you wish for
as condolence?

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.163
If my father offered advice
that was hard to hear,

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.333
it would have been meant for nothing else

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.001
but Your Majesty's own good.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:28.174
Please remember the sincerity
with which he came before Your Majesty,

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.009
risking his own life.

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.722
That's the only thing I wish for.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.615
Today,

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.283
you have seen nothing.

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:56.160
Yes, sir.

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.844
I took it to the main hall.

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:18.849
As I said,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.893
I didn't want to make another mistake.

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:27.650
I learned that death
doesn't solve anything.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.656
I took the dagger

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.199
to protect this body,

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.828
in case His Majesty hurt you.

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:45.960
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

00:09:58.055 --> 00:09:59.390
Don't take this the wrong way.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.226
I just want to see
if my body is all right.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.946
Damn it.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:15.906
Why now?

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.953
Why does everything
have to be so cruel to us?

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.769
Are you all right?

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:47.647
Yes, it's nothing.

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.691
I was told of your help, Your Highness.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:53.402
Your mother must be worried.
You should hurry home.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.990
Yes, Your Highness.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.202
I'm sorry you went through that.

00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:04.538
Let's go home.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:07.625
Please go ahead.
We have something to talk about.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.548
His Majesty has awakened?

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:16.300
Jae-i urgently sent a letter saying so.

00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:24.058
Jae-i, not Lady Jang?

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.439
My head feels heavy.

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:36.362
Lady Jang woke up His Majesty.

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.407
Here's the decoction.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.160
It disgusts me!

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.412
We'll have it prepared again.

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:46.789
Where's Geum-nok?

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.959
Lady Jang has caught a cold.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:54.004
We isolated her
so she would not infect His Majesty.

00:11:58.175 --> 00:11:59.135
Come in.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:18.612
They should help ease
your weary mind, Your Majesty.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:35.379
The Grand Prince
stopped the interrogation of Dae-il?

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.131
Yes, my lord.

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:39.717
You suspected someone
who can't even hit a target.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:41.719
What?

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:42.928
Regarding Dae-il,

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:45.848
you were wrong.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.766
From here on, let Jae-i handle it.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.357
Does Grand Prince Dowol know Dae-il?

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:58.736
- That's--
- It's all because of that lowly girl.

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:05.201
I'm sure of it.

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:07.453
At the annex the other day…

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:15.794
Anyway,

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:18.047
the Grand Prince
fancies that concubine's daughter.

00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:20.424
Why her?

00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:27.640
He even stopped the interrogation.
Are his feelings that strong?

00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.266
It means she's his soft spot.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.809
She's just some girl.

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:32.603
What will you accuse the Grand Prince of?

00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:34.355
- Well--
- He's from the royal family.

00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:36.565
Even killing ten lowborns
wouldn't be a crime for him.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:40.861
If it's a silly reason like
romantic feelings, I'm rather relieved.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:44.073
Father, the Grand Prince must be removed
for me to return to my post.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.115
Wait for now.

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:49.286
Once the bedchamber matter settles,
we can remove the Grand Prince anytime.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.790
What's the bedchamber matter?

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.879
You're asking me a question.

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.300
You may go now, both of you.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.431
I've been thinking about it,
but I just don't get it.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.766
Why were we switched again?

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.561
The first time
might've been a twist of fate,

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.354
but now that it's happened twice,

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:17.690
I'm starting to think
it might just be our destiny.

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.067
Destiny?

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.112
Then destiny better have an answer

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.613
for why now, of all times.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.076
That's what I thought
the first time our bodies were switched.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.706
"Why does it have to be now?
So you'd find out about Gil-dong?"

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.378
But this time,
I'm glad it happened when it happened.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.306
If our bodies haven't been switched,

00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:52.725
you wouldn't have stopped.

00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:54.310
Say that again.

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:57.980
You would have continued to confront him.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.818
If that's the reason, why would we…

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:09.992
What's wrong?

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.413
You're right.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.332
I would've confronted him.

00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:18.626
You saved my life.

00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:22.171
That's why we should live.

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.006
We should be alive

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.842
to find out the answer to why it's us.

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:29.553
You might be right.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.767
We've already been switched once,
so it should be easier this time.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.145
Still, things could change at any moment,

00:15:38.228 --> 00:15:40.356
so let's share our daily schedules.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.692
Let's meet at the bookshop in the market
around 4:00 every day.

00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:56.914
I'll say goodbye here.

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.499
Go inside.

00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:00.167
Don't worry about your family.

00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:06.715
What's wrong?

00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:09.635
I'm supposed to return
to the Hyeminseo tomorrow.

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.846
I have to make ends meet, after all.

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:15.683
Right. I'm sure you do.

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:17.726
Well, I guess there's no choice.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.354
Just tell them you can't work for a while.

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:24.108
The Hyeminseo has already been
generous with you.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:27.444
Not having you means
losing a helping hand.

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:29.655
I don't want to trouble them.

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.657
So you're going to the Hyeminseo?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.158
Yes, I can give it a try.

00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:37.079
Until things go back to normal,
we have to keep living the lives we're in.

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.540
It'll be hard.

00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:41.583
Come on. What are you worried about?

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:43.794
I even survived your awful in-laws.

00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:45.546
The Hyeminseo should be easy.

00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:47.172
HYEMINSEO

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:01.353
Please, somebody help me!

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.522
Someone's dying here!

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:05.149
Please hurry!

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:13.657
Maybe she should quit the Hyeminseo.

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.577
I can open a big pharmacy for her.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:26.879
Now, wipe it.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:28.422
Yes, sir.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.134
Not yourself, the patient.

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:33.552
Oh, the patient.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.266
Fire.

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:43.687
Fire!

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.361
What are you doing?

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.907
Well, obviously, I'm starting a fire.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:57.910
Come on. Don't try my patience.

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:01.997
Coming through! Move!

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:10.839
Oh, that was close.

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:18.263
Goodness.

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.683
Eun-jo is definitely
not herself right now.

00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:24.853
What was that about Eun-jo?

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:26.563
My lady,

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.440
when your heart hurts,

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:30.025
it messes with your head.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.568
What?

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:44.706
How's that?

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.629
It keeps slipping down when I run,

00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:52.131
and it's really annoying.

00:18:53.674 --> 00:18:54.716
It's much better now.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.176
That's a smart trick.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.638
Most women know this.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.348
Right.

00:19:02.349 --> 00:19:04.810
I keep forgetting things these days.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.231
My lady.

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.901
Why don't we drop the formalities
when we're in private?

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:14.903
Like actual friends.

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:16.488
Friends?

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.323
Have they gotten closer?

00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:20.075
Sure.

00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:22.119
Lady Hae-rim?

00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:24.288
Yes, when did you two get so close?

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:27.291
Ever since the prince showed up

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:30.002
to save the heroine
when she was in danger.

00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:34.006
That is indeed my specialty.

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:37.384
How was the Hyeminseo?

00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:38.844
It's hard, isn't it?

00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:39.761
Not at all.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:41.263
I had everything well in hand.

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.598
Oh, really?

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.558
That sounds very convincing.

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.393
- You don't believe me.
- I should.

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:47.352
I have to.

00:19:48.812 --> 00:19:49.938
Anyway,

00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.982
I gave it some thought,

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:55.152
and if we told our families about this,

00:19:55.235 --> 00:19:58.113
they'd just think we'd lost our minds
and worry about us.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.700
Why don't we tell Dae-chu about this
so we can communicate more freely?

00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:03.452
Will he believe us?

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.623
So, in other words,

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:12.961
Hong-si is His Highness,

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:17.090
and His Highness is Hong-si.
Is that what you're saying?

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.808
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:35.984
Where are you going?

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:38.570
Not far. I'll be right back.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.281
Stop right there.

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.116
Are you running away?

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.204
Look, Dae-chu,

00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:50.791
I know it's hard to accept this reality.

00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:54.419
No more shaking your head.

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:55.712
Your Highness.

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:03.637
Your Highness, Hong-si is acting like you.

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:06.598
Officer Seo.

00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:10.102
Stay away.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:11.019
Good.

00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:13.647
I know you've been through a lot.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.024
Anyone would've lost their mind.

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:17.526
I understand.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.069
Let's get you treated.

00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:23.699
After Hong Eun-jo's wedding,

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.867
you thought I was being strange
at some point, right?

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.828
Why do you think

00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:29.496
"I did that?"

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:31.081
and "Oh, I did that" were

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.542
the only things
I was saying at some point?

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.004
That's exactly what I said
to His Highness.

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:41.216
Stop that! You almost fooled me.

00:21:42.342 --> 00:21:44.428
Officer Seo, your lord

00:21:44.511 --> 00:21:46.013
is not the kind of person

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:48.890
who would fold his own bedding
or clean for the court ladies.

00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:57.941
Well done! Very meticulous.

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.402
You've been planning this just to fool me…

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:03.488
But why?

00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:05.699
I wish I knew.

00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:09.328
If we had known,
we wouldn't be looking at you like this.

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:19.838
Dae-chu,

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:21.882
I'll see you again tomorrow.

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:25.135
Bye.

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:29.723
Let's hurry back to the palace.

00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:42.069
My whole body is aching
from dancing all day.

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:43.820
Don't you think His Majesty is a bit odd?

00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:45.822
The king is no different
from any other man.

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:54.081
Be quiet.

00:22:58.126 --> 00:22:59.127
Please come inside.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:04.800
I hear the courtesans here
frequent the palace.

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.051
How does His Majesty party?

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.762
You must refrain from heavy drinking

00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:11.556
and loose talk if you wish to live long.

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.101
I'm talking about both of us.

00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:19.689
And why aren't you saying anything?

00:23:26.696 --> 00:23:27.781
I'm considering

00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:30.450
whether to speak

00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:31.618
or hold my tongue.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.839
I heard you wanted to see me.

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:50.929
I have something to say to you.

00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:57.561
Once the bedchamber matter settles,
we can remove the Grand Prince anytime.

00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:01.648
Please

00:24:02.357 --> 00:24:03.525
be careful.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.653
What do you mean?

00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:07.988
I mean what I said.

00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:11.408
Watch your back, day and night.

00:24:11.491 --> 00:24:13.577
Just be careful in every way.

00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:16.580
Wait,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.583
if you're worried about me
'cause I stopped the interrogation--

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:20.792
I should get going.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.796
Has he been drinking?

00:24:28.049 --> 00:24:29.301
Are you all right?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.016
Why do you look worried?

00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:43.273
I must be really drunk.

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:46.484
Stay here.
I'll get someone to take you home.

00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.361
Now, you're worrying about me too?

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.949
I'm already overwhelmed

00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:54.284
by her worries.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.790
Your Highness knows who I'm talking about.

00:25:03.543 --> 00:25:04.377
Hong Eun-jo.

00:25:15.555 --> 00:25:16.681
Wait,

00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:18.516
the Grand Prince knew?

00:25:20.518 --> 00:25:22.229
When did he…

00:25:29.444 --> 00:25:30.904
Mother,

00:25:31.404 --> 00:25:33.573
I'm really sorry.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:36.368
For what?

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:46.461
I promised
I would never let myself lift a finger,

00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:50.006
but it ended in tears.

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:54.219
Eun-jo,

00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:56.471
I'm just grateful

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:58.348
that the young master is safe,

00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:01.184
and that you're here by my side.

00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:05.522
Let's not think about anything else,

00:26:05.605 --> 00:26:07.899
and just live like this.

00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:15.323
The physician said
you shouldn't move around yet.

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:16.992
Go back inside.

00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:19.160
I know my own body.

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.453
I'm all better now.

00:26:20.537 --> 00:26:21.830
What?

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.581
Did you take the medicine?

00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:24.708
Enough with the nagging.

00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:27.419
By the way,

00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:29.546
I was out cold from the medicine,
so I couldn't ask.

00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:31.798
Are you close with the Grand Prince?

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:37.429
He sometimes comes by the Hyeminseo,

00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:38.972
so we've spoken a few times. Why?

00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:42.183
Because it's strange.

00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:44.894
He was acting like he knew me well.

00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:47.772
He was almost treating me
like we're family.

00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:52.652
Wait, could it be…

00:26:53.903 --> 00:26:55.405
That's right.

00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:56.906
His Highness and I--

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.825
Is he thinking of me

00:26:58.908 --> 00:26:59.993
as his future ally?

00:27:01.661 --> 00:27:02.704
What?

00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:05.832
Well, I do look like a loyal Jindo dog.

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:08.209
Young Master,

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:10.003
you really can't read people, can you?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.465
I mean, isn't it strange
that he suddenly stepped up to help me?

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:15.258
I can't go to that side.

00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:18.136
Don't worry.

00:27:18.219 --> 00:27:20.180
I came to this side.

00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:22.015
What are you saying?

00:27:23.183 --> 00:27:25.060
Then why?

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:30.607
He said there was no special reason

00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.650
for helping you.

00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:37.447
He said it was simply
the right thing to do

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:40.742
in honor of the late lord.

00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:45.246
He also said
he wanted to offer his deepest apologies

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.539
on behalf of the royal family,

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:49.626
though what's been done
cannot be forgiven.

00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:56.466
Next time you see him,

00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:58.885
pass along my thanks.

00:27:58.968 --> 00:28:01.971
I was so overwhelmed earlier,
I forgot to say that.

00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:07.727
He didn't do it to receive thanks,

00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:09.312
and he's already received them.

00:28:10.105 --> 00:28:11.147
Well…

00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:13.858
That's what he said.

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:18.196
What a truly kind man.

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:47.809
Your Highness,

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:49.894
Her Majesty and
Chief State Councilor Han Seung-rok

00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:52.397
are waiting at Her Majesty's residence.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:56.234
I never learned
about the Chief State Councilor.

00:28:57.485 --> 00:28:59.487
What's his relationship
with the Grand Prince, sir?

00:29:00.613 --> 00:29:02.991
Please don't use honorifics with me
while wearing that face.

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:04.367
It feels too weird.

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:05.994
I won't.

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.912
I don't really believe it.

00:29:07.996 --> 00:29:09.414
I'll just consider this

00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:11.791
a strange little game
the two of you are playing.

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.294
That way, I'll feel less crazy.

00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:16.921
If you want.

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:21.176
The Chief State Councilor
is on good terms with everyone.

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:22.719
He's an easygoing man.

00:29:22.802 --> 00:29:23.636
Is that so?

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.765
Thank you for stepping up
for Min-jik's eldest son.

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:29.559
I know my late friend
would be deeply grateful.

00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:34.647
He was the lord's friend.

00:29:35.398 --> 00:29:36.524
It's nothing.

00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:41.112
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
I have only caused you concern.

00:29:41.654 --> 00:29:45.909
Imagine if that family
had lost their only son as well.

00:29:45.992 --> 00:29:49.120
I would've been too ashamed
before the late Lord Hong.

00:29:51.498 --> 00:29:54.417
You've been showing
a new side lately, Your Highness.

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:57.545
If His Late Majesty had seen this,

00:29:58.379 --> 00:29:59.964
he would have been greatly pleased.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.510
Thank you.

00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.178
His Late Majesty had seen

00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:07.764
Your Highness' brilliance early on.

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:13.394
He didn't see his future
as an idler though.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.613
Was it busy again today?

00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:24.989
Yes.

00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:28.827
What are you doing later?
Do you want to go see the moon?

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.286
That sounds nice.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.746
But let's go another time.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.747
I'm meeting someone.

00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:38.211
You looked excited when you said that.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.380
Is it someone you hold dear?

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:44.384
Oh, my. Really?

00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:47.345
I didn't say anything.

00:30:49.055 --> 00:30:50.348
Oh, dear.

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:52.767
Tell me. What's that person like?

00:30:54.227 --> 00:30:55.854
I don't know.

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.605
Come on, tell me.

00:31:02.902 --> 00:31:04.487
Someone who drifts farther away

00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:07.073
when I get close.

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:10.201
I see.

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:13.830
I suppose that's how it is
when you like someone.

00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:16.666
Do you have someone like that?

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:18.960
Yes.

00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:23.214
He has someone he will never forget
for the rest of his life.

00:31:24.674 --> 00:31:25.884
He has a serious problem.

00:31:28.177 --> 00:31:29.846
I think I have a problem too.

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:33.683
Even the kindness he shows

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.518
by keeping his distance

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.521
touches my heart.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.400
I'm running away,

00:31:42.483 --> 00:31:43.943
somewhere

00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:45.403
far behind her.

00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:48.907
That story…

00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:52.327
He's quite a charming man, isn't he?

00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:00.710
I think you should let go of that man.

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:03.463
What?

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.131
So you can let someone else

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.884
into your kind heart.

00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:15.516
Is anyone here?

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:18.061
Everyone went home. Who could that be?

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:29.030
What's wrong?

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.866
The kids are sick.

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:42.585
It's been over an hour already.
Why hasn't she shown up?

00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:46.965
Maybe it's still busy at the Hyeminseo.

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:53.012
This is the barn.

00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:56.015
We sold all the cows and horses.
There's only one cow left.

00:33:23.459 --> 00:33:24.794
You're burning up.

00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:26.129
What?

00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:28.840
When did these street urchins
crawl in here?

00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:30.675
Did you find them?

00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.386
- Move the children to the carriage.
- Yes, my lady.

00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:45.106
HYEMINSEO

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:46.315
What's going on?

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.650
These kids are sick.

00:33:48.234 --> 00:33:49.569
The Gwangtong Bridge kids.

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:51.612
Let's take them to the dispensary.

00:33:59.912 --> 00:34:02.832
I need fermented soybeans,
apricot kernels, perilla seeds, cork bark.

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:05.710
Soybeans, apricot kernels,
perilla seeds, cork bark. Got it.

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.638
Just one more spoonful,

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:20.141
and the fever goblin in your head
will run away.

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:24.604
There you go.

00:34:30.443 --> 00:34:32.445
Her fever has gone down.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.740
She should be better by tomorrow.

00:34:37.116 --> 00:34:39.452
I'm impressed by how smoothly
you picked out the medicine.

00:34:39.535 --> 00:34:43.247
You almost seem like a different person
when you're with the children.

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:45.833
Well…

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.377
I just remembered something
I came across in a medical book.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.297
Do you come by the Hyeminseo often?

00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:53.216
Right.

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:55.051
I once donated some medicinal herbs here.

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:58.221
I just want to make sure
they're not being wasted.

00:34:58.304 --> 00:34:59.555
I see.

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:02.100
That's how the two of you know each other.

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:05.770
Do you need more warm water?

00:35:06.896 --> 00:35:07.939
Eun-jo.

00:35:15.154 --> 00:35:16.239
Sorry.

00:35:29.877 --> 00:35:32.046
Are you sure
you can stay here by yourself all night?

00:35:32.922 --> 00:35:34.882
Like I said, don't worry.

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.175
What about tomorrow?

00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:37.593
Do you think you can handle it?

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.304
You have to trust me.
There's no other way.

00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:43.057
Attention.

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:45.434
Quiet. Stay in line.

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:47.353
We have one goal.

00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:49.480
It's to scrub the grime off our bodies.

00:35:49.564 --> 00:35:50.565
Understand?

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:51.732
Yes, ma'am!

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.151
Now, into the water!

00:35:53.234 --> 00:35:54.235
Into the water!

00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:59.699
Kids, you're not here to play.

00:35:59.782 --> 00:36:01.492
Scrub hard, all right?

00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:03.911
I knew it.

00:36:05.454 --> 00:36:06.497
What are you doing here?

00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:08.249
Are you here to watch me?

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.168
You said you once fell into the water.

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.128
I came to make sure you weren't drowning.

00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:14.005
I learned how to swim after that.

00:36:14.088 --> 00:36:15.673
Now, I can swim like a fish.

00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:16.924
Do you want to see?

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.384
No, thanks. Will you sit down?

00:36:18.467 --> 00:36:19.719
I need help.

00:36:21.888 --> 00:36:22.889
Blow.

00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:25.224
Good job.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.269
Do I have to use these hands for that?

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.104
Blow.

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.274
You should do it too.

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.358
Now, blow.

00:36:38.654 --> 00:36:40.656
Well done. What a talented kiddo.

00:36:41.782 --> 00:36:42.783
Hey, what was that?

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.493
You started it, all right?

00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:48.623
You little rascal.

00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:33.876
They made me so worried yesterday,

00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:37.213
and now they're playing
like they were never sick.

00:37:37.296 --> 00:37:38.756
They must've really startled you.

00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:47.056
Those sick kids
are so much calmer than me,

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.351
as if a stomach bug from spoiled food

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:52.019
were not a big deal.

00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:58.901
You said you found them in a barn?

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:03.781
That place was so stinky,
I could barely breathe in there.

00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:06.951
I don't know why they were there.

00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:13.916
They had fevers, their bodies were cold,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.209
and they had no home to go to.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.338
I'm sure they sneaked in there
to get some rest.

00:38:21.257 --> 00:38:23.217
How did they lose their parents?

00:38:24.885 --> 00:38:27.680
Wars, exploitation, neglect.

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:29.807
It's a typical story.

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.602
It should not be typical.

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:35.855
Especially for children.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.984
There's been a plague recently,

00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:42.820
so it must be even worse
outside the capital.

00:38:45.948 --> 00:38:48.034
And Lord Hong must have seen that

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.578
and run to the hunting ground.

00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:54.457
Because His Majesty

00:38:54.915 --> 00:38:57.001
does not care about the people at all.

00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:01.213
If the one who sits on the throne changes,

00:39:03.549 --> 00:39:05.301
will the world change?

00:39:06.093 --> 00:39:08.929
At the very least,
we will be able to change tomorrow

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.473
and the days that follow.

00:39:19.815 --> 00:39:21.692
Do you really think it will change?

00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:24.779
What do you mean?

00:39:26.072 --> 00:39:27.740
The future of these children.

00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.542
Could you pass the rest over?

00:40:12.535 --> 00:40:13.494
Your Majesty,

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:16.080
how is your health?

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:19.875
I am well now, thanks to your concern.

00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:21.627
Your Majesty,

00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:25.589
I wish to know the reason
for Hong Min-jik's execution.

00:40:30.803 --> 00:40:31.637
Why?

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:35.391
To record his crime, Your Majesty.

00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:37.601
May I record that the offense was

00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:40.521
provoking Your Majesty's anger
and troubling Your Majesty's mind?

00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:45.860
Yes, you may.

00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:51.240
From this moment on,
let Hong Min-jik's name

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:52.992
never be spoken again.

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.955
Whoever speaks his name again
shall be put to death.

00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:07.381
I shall bear it in mind, Your Majesty.

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:11.177
I shall bear it in mind, Your Majesty.

00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:27.109
They are afraid as well,

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:30.905
knowing, in this kingdom,
even nobles can be killed for no reason,

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:33.824
like beggars in the streets.

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.220
Chief Secretary Im.

00:41:59.642 --> 00:42:00.601
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:42:01.727 --> 00:42:03.437
I definitely saw it.

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:06.732
I saw the tiger roaming in Mount Dogo.

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:08.901
Your Majesty,

00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:11.070
please forget what happened that day.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.575
I really must be

00:42:17.243 --> 00:42:19.119
losing my mind.

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:21.956
That is untrue, Your Majesty.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.041
Your Majesty is
the late king's legitimate heir.

00:42:24.124 --> 00:42:27.336
The ruler of Joseon, ordained by fate.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.804
If Your Majesty commands it,

00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:40.641
I will burn down the mountains
to catch the tiger.

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.309
And if that still is not enough,

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.897
I will pray to drag Hong Min-jik's soul
back to this world.

00:42:49.024 --> 00:42:50.276
However,

00:42:50.859 --> 00:42:54.280
please do not reveal
Your Majesty's shortcomings to anyone.

00:42:55.114 --> 00:42:56.907
Let no one doubt

00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:59.034
the authority of the throne.

00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:08.460
It shall be done.

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:12.381
I am deeply grateful, Your Majesty.

00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:20.514
What's the matter?

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.643
Nothing. I just felt
something strange behind me.

00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:26.895
Sweetie, look.

00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:31.233
From now on,
they'll be your brothers and sisters.

00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:33.902
You can call me

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:36.030
Father from now on.

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.531
You're their father? How?

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:40.117
You'll be their mother, right?

00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:45.331
All their living expenses will be covered,
until they're grown,

00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:46.874
by this gentleman here.

00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:52.421
I know it's a lot to ask. Thank you.

00:43:52.504 --> 00:43:53.422
It's nothing.

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:56.759
It would've been too lonely
with just me and my baby anyway.

00:43:57.384 --> 00:43:59.762
What are you doing?
Come, take a look around your new home.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.105
Wow, I've never been
in a house with a roof.

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.107
I've never been in a house with walls.

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:14.360
I've never been in a house with blankets.

00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:16.070
Everything is new to them.

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:17.863
Now I want to give them more.

00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:19.365
Let's eat.

00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:20.908
Yes!

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:27.539
They emptied the whole pot.

00:44:32.294 --> 00:44:33.295
Where are you going?

00:44:33.629 --> 00:44:36.965
I should go get more bowls
and pillows for the kids.

00:44:37.049 --> 00:44:38.300
Do you even have to ask?

00:44:38.717 --> 00:44:40.678
You're a bachelor.
You've never even raised a kid.

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.347
I should go with him.
Please take care of the kids.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.391
Sure. Go ahead.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.520
I'm so tired.

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:57.653
Are the kids asleep?

00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:09.123
It was like a battlefield before.

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.916
Now it's finally quiet.

00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:16.588
On the street, every day
must've been like a battle for them.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:21.135
Now, all they need to do
is grow up safe and well here.

00:45:22.803 --> 00:45:25.931
We should come by from time to time
until they're all grown.

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:29.226
I guess we should.

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.395
It will take at least ten years, right?

00:45:33.355 --> 00:45:36.775
Until the youngest one grows up, yes.
That sounds about right.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:43.031
Should we send them to school?

00:45:46.285 --> 00:45:48.412
It'd be better
to have them taught at home.

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:52.875
Let's raise them as scholars,
not soldiers.

00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:55.419
Come on, blades over books.

00:45:55.502 --> 00:45:57.671
You need real skills.

00:45:57.754 --> 00:46:00.132
There's a quicker path to success.
They should be scholars.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.969
When it comes to making a living,
I know better.

00:46:04.052 --> 00:46:05.554
I can't compromise on this.

00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:07.139
You'll have to back down on this one.

00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:12.060
This is why they say
you never know until you live together.

00:46:12.978 --> 00:46:14.354
What did you just say?

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:15.856
Speak up.

00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:17.816
I said…

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.067
I want to live like this

00:46:19.151 --> 00:46:20.402
for a long, long time.

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.946
It didn't sound like that.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.826
You're right.

00:46:29.077 --> 00:46:32.247
I was saying we'd be together

00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:33.499
for ten years at least.

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:38.337
And that's more than enough.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.839
That's what I said.

00:46:47.012 --> 00:46:48.180
By the way,

00:46:49.932 --> 00:46:52.976
I heard you were planning to leave.

00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:57.689
Were you going somewhere far away?

00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:02.528
I just wanted to wander.

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:06.698
Because I made a promise.

00:47:06.782 --> 00:47:09.326
Please leave Joseon

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:11.870
for Eun-jo's sake.

00:47:11.954 --> 00:47:12.788
TONGJEONG DAEBU DAESAGAN

00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:13.956
THE TOMB OF THE RESPECTED GENTLEMAN
OF THE NAMYANG HONG CLAN

00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:16.208
I was going to leave to protect her,

00:47:18.252 --> 00:47:20.712
but right now,
I cannot protect her if I leave.

00:47:22.214 --> 00:47:23.715
Please let me keep my promise

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.426
this way.

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:35.435
I guess you can't keep that promise

00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:38.397
now that our bodies are switched.

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:40.607
I'll try to keep it

00:47:41.316 --> 00:47:42.859
while watching you, by your side.

00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:49.616
The sky is so clear.

00:47:56.665 --> 00:47:58.166
It's as if everything is all right.

00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:11.930
Is this a tonic for restoring strength?

00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:13.056
Yes, my lady.

00:48:14.474 --> 00:48:16.768
I should give it
to the Gwangtong Bridge kids.

00:48:16.852 --> 00:48:17.978
Again?

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:21.690
You've been getting
between those two a lot lately.

00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:24.484
What do you mean?

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:28.113
It's obvious that the Grand Prince
and Physician Hong have a thing going on.

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.827
Sorry.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.792
I hear you've been visiting
Lord Hong's grave a lot lately.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.170
I'm running away,

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.671
somewhere

00:48:45.213 --> 00:48:46.506
far behind her.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:48.342
Is that woman then…

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.138
Kkot-sim,

00:48:53.805 --> 00:48:56.183
could you deliver a letter
to the Grand Prince's residence?

00:49:03.732 --> 00:49:05.776
You said you'd come visit,
so I was waiting for you.

00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:07.819
I have something to ask, Your Highness.

00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:10.489
What is it?

00:49:10.572 --> 00:49:11.615
Do you…

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.036
and Eun-jo…

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.537
I can't hear you.

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.624
I mean…

00:49:23.877 --> 00:49:24.961
Hide!

00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:29.508
What's wrong?

00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:32.719
If she sees you with me,
it'll cause unnecessary misunderstanding.

00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:37.766
Do you know her?

00:49:43.188 --> 00:49:45.774
Yes, a little.

00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:51.405
It looks like it could rain at any moment.

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:54.449
Just like the day
I met Your Highness for the first time.

00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:58.203
It was at the royal wedding ceremony,
back when I was young.

00:49:59.371 --> 00:50:00.414
Right.

00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:02.374
I remember now.

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:06.169
Oh, I forgot.

00:50:06.253 --> 00:50:08.755
Your Highness couldn't attend
the ceremony at the time.

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:12.676
You fell ill during the epidemic,
and were staying at the royal villa.

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.430
Right. I was young,
so my memories are vague.

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.889
I caught the disease, yes.

00:50:17.973 --> 00:50:18.974
Now I remember.

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.394
You remember things you never did?

00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:26.565
Your Highness
did attend the ceremony that year.

00:50:27.816 --> 00:50:29.401
I made up the epidemic story,

00:50:29.484 --> 00:50:30.652
and that lady was

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:32.320
Her Majesty the Queen Consort.

00:50:37.075 --> 00:50:38.827
Who are you?

00:50:39.619 --> 00:50:40.454
Well…

00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:44.666
She should've denied it to the end.
So what happened?

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.127
She says he's not in his senses
so he should pray harder.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.421
She's reacting
pretty much the same way I did.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:56.762
I'm sure you already heard about it.

00:50:58.805 --> 00:51:00.891
Well, I guess that's how things are now.

00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:05.562
Lady Hae-rim, are you okay?

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.733
You're taking this joke too far.

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:12.235
I wish this was a joke more than anyone.

00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:15.489
Wait, that tone, that attitude…

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:18.742
I didn't mean to fool you.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.495
Are you really Eun-jo?

00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:24.915
Since when?

00:51:24.998 --> 00:51:26.249
When were you the Grand Prince

00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:28.251
and when were you Eun-jo?

00:51:29.544 --> 00:51:32.631
I was the one who helped you
when you were with the other ladies.

00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:35.675
Then who helped me
when I was with my brother?

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.886
That was me.

00:51:40.847 --> 00:51:42.182
I know it's confusing.

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:45.435
There have been two phases.
We were switched again after the funeral.

00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:48.563
I can't believe this.

00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:51.024
Officer Seo,

00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:52.609
do you believe this?

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.862
At times like this, I'd rather play along.

00:51:58.114 --> 00:52:00.367
If what they're saying is true,

00:52:01.493 --> 00:52:02.619
the two of them are…

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:06.623
Are they really bound by fate?

00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:10.669
Wait.

00:52:10.752 --> 00:52:13.588
There have been two phases.
We were switched again after the funeral.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.132
After? That means…

00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:17.759
Then two days ago…

00:52:18.343 --> 00:52:20.053
Even the kindness he shows

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:21.805
touches my heart.

00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:25.350
That was His Highness?

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:27.894
My lady!

00:52:29.855 --> 00:52:31.022
What happened?

00:52:31.398 --> 00:52:33.441
I made a confession.

00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:37.988
Did you tell the lord
about the jewelry you sold

00:52:38.071 --> 00:52:39.447
to help the Gwangtong Bridge kids?

00:52:41.032 --> 00:52:42.325
No.

00:52:42.409 --> 00:52:44.661
It was a confession of love.

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:47.539
HYEMINSEO

00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:50.208
Be careful.

00:52:52.919 --> 00:52:54.254
Have a safe trip home.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.091
Thank you.

00:53:20.071 --> 00:53:21.156
Her Majesty has sent word.

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.742
Again?

00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:25.285
Today, she's with Lady Sukeui.

00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:27.370
Lady Sukeui?

00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:29.581
Is she an ally?

00:53:31.625 --> 00:53:33.001
An enemy?

00:53:33.084 --> 00:53:35.211
She's an ally. Don't worry.

00:53:57.275 --> 00:53:58.109
Did you send for me?

00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:00.362
Have a seat.

00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:02.322
Lady Sukeui came by.
It's been quite a while.

00:54:06.284 --> 00:54:07.452
It's nice to meet you…

00:54:07.535 --> 00:54:08.912
Gil-dong.

00:54:12.332 --> 00:54:15.210
Lady Sukeui was
His Late Majesty's concubine.

00:54:22.342 --> 00:54:23.510
In the Gyeongo Year,

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:27.138
Lady Sukeui's son, Prince Yeonghu,
was killed by His Majesty.

00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:30.100
Now, who wishes to follow my father

00:54:31.142 --> 00:54:32.644
into death?

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:36.314
I would like to send him my regards.

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:39.776
After that, she turned to Buddhism.

00:54:40.986 --> 00:54:42.737
It's good to see you, Grand Prince.

00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:54.874
May I ask

00:54:55.667 --> 00:54:57.043
why you wanted to see me?

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.254
I was looking forward to seeing you.

00:55:01.923 --> 00:55:03.633
HYEMINSEO

00:55:09.848 --> 00:55:11.433
You act like you don't even know me.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.189
Come with me.

00:55:18.898 --> 00:55:20.400
There's something I want to show you,

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.319
Gil-dong.

00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:40.712
Can I ask something?

00:55:42.047 --> 00:55:43.423
Sure, go ahead.

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:44.883
For the past few days,

00:55:44.966 --> 00:55:47.260
you've been reading nothing
but books about treason.

00:55:50.388 --> 00:55:52.557
I don't know
if you're His Highness or Hong-si,

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.893
but why are you studying that?

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.148
I can't tell you right now.

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:02.609
But I can promise you this.

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.778
Whatever choice I make,

00:56:05.278 --> 00:56:06.821
it will protect your lord.

00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:10.825
All right.

00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:16.206
EXPLANATIONS ON THE COMPREHENSIVE MIRROR
FOR AID IN GOVERNMENT

00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:22.128
The desire to change the world
has always existed.

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.213
MENCIUS

00:56:23.296 --> 00:56:25.131
Rebellion, uprising,

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.175
revolt, upheaval.

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:30.845
Whatever it's called,
there's only one thing they seek.

00:56:31.429 --> 00:56:33.890
Hong Min-jik's death
has shaken the ministers.

00:56:33.973 --> 00:56:37.685
Hong Min-jik was His Majesty's teacher.
Now that even he has been killed,

00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:40.647
they will think that no one's life
is safe anymore.

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.274
The time is drawing near.

00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:46.194
Now, we must decide
which prince to place on the throne.

00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:48.363
We must establish a new ruler

00:56:48.446 --> 00:56:51.324
so that we can persuade
and rally the other scholar-officials.

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:53.785
It seems like the decision has been made.

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:58.414
It was also the late king's wish.

00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:01.793
Are we all agreed?

00:57:01.876 --> 00:57:03.878
Yes, Your Highness.

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.065
The prince we will place on the throne is

00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:25.024
Yi Yeol,

00:57:25.692 --> 00:57:26.818
Grand Prince Dowol.

00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:32.949
They're plotting against the king.

00:57:33.908 --> 00:57:35.243
A new ruler.

00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:39.747
This is why Lady Sukeui
came to see the Grand Prince.

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:47.338
It's past curfew.

00:57:47.422 --> 00:57:48.381
What's the matter?

00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:51.426
The time is drawing near.

00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:01.561
Is everything all right?

00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:05.190
The prince we will place on the throne is

00:58:05.273 --> 00:58:06.357
Yi Yeol,

00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:08.443
Grand Prince Dowol.

00:58:12.113 --> 00:58:13.114
Let's go.

00:58:13.698 --> 00:58:15.366
You'll be in danger if you stay here.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:16.451
What's going on?

00:58:16.534 --> 00:58:20.121
They're trying to put Gil-dong
at the forefront of treason.

00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:21.039
Let's run away.

00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:23.541
Somewhere far from the palace,

00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:24.792
somewhere far from Joseon,

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:26.503
somewhere no one knows us.

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:39.474
I…

00:58:41.142 --> 00:58:41.976
can't go.

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:48.107
You already

00:58:49.484 --> 00:58:50.777
knew.

00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:59.160
You already made up your mind.

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.454
You were already

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.165
with them.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.770
{\an8}Once you're caught as a traitor,
you'll be torn limb from limb.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.188
{\an8}If we go back to our own bodies,

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.857
{\an8}I'll join them as Gil-dong.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.774
{\an8}How can you

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.193
{\an8}speak of death so lightly in front of me?

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.112
{\an8}Play the music louder!

01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:17.447
{\an8}My ears are ringing!

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:19.240
{\an8}In a world like this,

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:21.367
{\an8}I have no choice but to live as a thief.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.368
{\an8}Now, you know

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:25.204
{\an8}the very things I wished
you didn't know about my life.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.372
{\an8}Are you ready?

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.626
{\an8}I will make a world
where I don't need to live

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:31.252
{\an8}as a thief.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.797
