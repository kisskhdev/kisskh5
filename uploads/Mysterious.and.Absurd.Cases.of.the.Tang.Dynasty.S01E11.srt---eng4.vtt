00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.160
Wanling Township, west of Chang'an City

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.480
Is a key hub for Western Regions caravans trading with the Great Tang

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.280
Especially the Ten Thousand Nations Inn

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.840
It is where caravans rest

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.440
And a bustling place to trade exotic goods

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.360
Treasures from the Western Regions

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.640
Beauties from the Western Regions

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.760
Here

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.800
You can find absolutely everything

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.160
Everyone, everyone

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.960
This treasure

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.120
Honored guests

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.200
What is this thing? What kind of treasure?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.440
Watch closely

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.800
Isn't this just a big painting of a beauty?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.480
Yeah, who hasn't seen that before?

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.800
I thought it was some kind of treasure

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.400
It's just a painting

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760
Come down, come down

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.840
Go down

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.360
Come down

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.360
You

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.520
Look closer

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.280
A beauty! A beauty!

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.800
Good, good

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.240
Good

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.720
Good

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.360
What a treasure, what a treasure!

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.320
Good, good

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.200
Station Master

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.440
What happened?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.120
This lowly one is Shen Qinghai

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.640
I am the Station Master of this inn

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.800
This was the first time the Ten Thousand Nations Inn was haunted

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.880
It happened about a month ago

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.600
My Lord, look

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.400
Although there are still some merchants at the inn now

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.640
Compared to when business was booming

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.080
It's truly less than one in ten

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.440
Since there are ghosts

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.880
Why do these people still dare to stay at the Ten Thousand Nations Inn?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.360
Wanling Township

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.040
Is the most convenient route for Western Regions merchants to Chang'an City

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.320
If they don't take this road

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.440
They have to take the mountain path

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.000
Which is farther and harder to travel

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360
And there might be wild beasts

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.960
Weighing the two options

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.960
They have no choice but to come this way

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.840
What this Lord says is very true

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.520
As the Station Master

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.160
Why didn't you report it to the Magistrate's office?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.720
I did go to report it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.600
But when the county Magistrate's office heard it was a haunting

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.880
They didn't dare to come investigate

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.200
Then please

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.920
Take us to the merchant warehouse to have a look

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.000
Oh

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.720
This way, please

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.960
Come

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.560
Has anyone been killed?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.200
That, this lowly one does not know

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.960
However, every night after the haunting

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.000
Merchants would inexplicably disappear

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.520
But I don't know if they were scared away

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.720
Or taken by the malicious ghost

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.240
Shentu

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.400
Did you find anything strange?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.640
Vice Minister

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.920
How about we stay at this Ten Thousand Nations Inn tonight?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.000
You decide

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.120
Then, Station Master Shen, I must trouble you

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.360
To spread a message for us

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.960
Say a wealthy merchant has arrived from the Western Regions

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.360
Carrying a pearl this big

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.520
And is staying in Celestial Room No. 1

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.600
This...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.720
This isn't very good, is it?

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.200
Just do as I say

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.760
Spread it as far as possible throughout Wanling Township

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.960
Make it sound as real as possible

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.920
As for the truth of the matter

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.040
Only the four of us know

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.640
If anyone else finds out

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.600
I will hold you responsible

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.600
This lowly one understands

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.720
Number One Sleuth of the Realm

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.880
The bait laid out today

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.360
Is not particularly clever

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.680
It's not bait

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.000
It's just an open strategy

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.520
The warehouse and the room plaques correspond

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.680
Who brought what goods

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.160
Is all indicated there

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.200
You mean it's an inside job?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.800
That's right.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.280
There aren't that many demons and monsters in this world.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.600
It's just a cheap trick of playing ghost to kill and rob.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.560
The news about the pearls is out.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.160
If a "ghost" comes tonight,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.760
we'll shut the doors and catch the thief.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.520
If no one comes,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.520
then someone must have leaked the news.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.600
Then Station Master Shen Qinghai...

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.520
...cannot escape suspicion.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.920
Didn't I tell you?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.800
People from the Dali Temple are here.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.960
We shouldn't stay here long.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.240
Stop knocking.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.480
Why are you still knocking?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.760
You are...

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.640
You aren't...

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.880
The light's out.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.600
The light's out!

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:56.960
Ghost!

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.400
A ghost!
