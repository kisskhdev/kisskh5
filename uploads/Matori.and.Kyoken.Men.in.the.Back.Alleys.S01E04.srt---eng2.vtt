WEBVTT

00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:03.817
Stimulants, narcotics, cannabis.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.237
People who have used these drugs

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.740
are now estimated
to total two million in Japan.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.452
The number of people arrested
for drug-related offenses

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:17.247
is as many as 14,000 yearly.

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:20.542
The college student from before.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.711
Another case of addiction,
like it always goes?

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.255
Remember it now?

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:26.339
Why?

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:29.551
We used some drugs
and had a lot of fun together.

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:33.138
A woman with symptoms of drug addiction
was brought in this morning.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.057
The symptoms point to cocaine addiction.

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:37.392
No way.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:39.727
Why!

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:41.396
Why are you crying?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.149
Isn't she just a stranger?

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:47.277
It's just a drug addict who died.

00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:49.863
Ouch!

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:52.448
Are we going to let
scum like him roam free?

00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:56.369
I'm with you. We have to keep
gathering evidence in secret for now.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.204
A GPS tracker?

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:00.790
She's at her home right now.

00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:02.208
If we keep track of her,

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:05.128
we'll uncover Kaga's
true colors soon enough.

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:07.714
I met with that shitty Kurosaki
from the NCD just now.

00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:09.507
I have some info.

00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:10.800
Do you want it?

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.136
I didn't expect a call
from you this quick.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.305
Quite useful, aren't you?

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:19.475
Aoi?

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.023
Aoi.

00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:33.364
Wakey-wakey.

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:41.164
How do you feel?

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:49.505
Morning.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.468
Remember anything?

00:01:58.264 --> 00:01:59.766
Or not yet?

00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:39.597
Hello?

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.266
Aoi left her apartment.

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:44.143
Okay. Tail her and make contact.

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:45.353
What?

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:50.024
Use any means to figure out
where Kaga gets his cocaine from.

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.112
We'll use that information
to crush the whole operation.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:56.280
Come on, you're asking a lot here.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.992
Weren't you an actor before?

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:01.703
Figure it out.

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:04.122
How is that relevant?
Don't you have a plan?

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:05.832
Don't be a baby.

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:09.585
A good spy needs to think for themselves
without being too reliant on others.

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.837
Figure it out.

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:16.884
You've got to be kidding me.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:19.303
I don't want to be a good spy.

00:03:43.453 --> 00:03:44.620
You okay?

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:47.832
Sorry.

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.043
I'm fine.

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.629
You don't look fine to me.

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:00.386
Do you have a fever?

00:04:01.137 --> 00:04:02.638
You're sweating a ton.

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:10.706
Here.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.250
Thank you.

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.836
Had me worried with the way you collapsed.

00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:19.632
Maybe I ate something weird.

00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:28.349
Wait.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.191
Did you ever star in a movie
called School King?

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:38.484
Yeah.

00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:41.863
My mother was an extra in it
ten years ago,

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.323
and I had a small part in it too.

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:46.200
Wow, really?

00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:48.786
Sorry, you probably don't remember me.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.413
No, I remember you.

00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:51.664
Wait, really?

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:53.374
Of course, I do.

00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:56.586
How you've grown.

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:02.216
Oh, but I don't think
my height has changed all that much.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.136
Well, I mean, you've gotten mature.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.764
Women get this different aura
about them as time goes by.

00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:13.311
It's fine.

00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:17.857
Of course, you wouldn't remember
an extra from ten years ago.

00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:20.067
Sorry.

00:06:21.194 --> 00:06:24.614
Wait, but I remember back then,

00:06:24.697 --> 00:06:28.993
filming was going a bit long,
and I ended up crying.

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:33.748
You kept me company the whole break.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:38.920
Oh, now, I actually remember you.

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:43.591
You were crying a ton, right?
You had snot all over your face.

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:47.261
I got snot on my costume.
It was such a mess.

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:48.429
Sorry.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:51.265
No, I'm sorry
for not remembering you sooner.

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:54.894
But wow, what a coincidence.

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:03.819
That stalker woman committed suicide.

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:07.073
The police and NCD are taking action.

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:09.533
She's a pain in the ass, even in death.

00:07:09.617 --> 00:07:10.785
Damn it.

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:13.287
You sure she didn't leave a will?

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:18.417
The people I asked to handle the cleanup
said they found nothing in her room.

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:20.670
It's going to be fine.

00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:22.463
Things are far from fine!

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.301
Lay low for a while, okay?

00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:29.178
Right.

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:30.513
But you know,

00:07:31.514 --> 00:07:37.061
seeing the face of someone drooling
in bliss from the cocaine I fed them…

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:44.110
It gets me so turned on.

00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:56.372
It doesn't sound

00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:00.543
like you just happened
to eat something bad.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.593
Some time ago,
I was in a movie that focused on drugs.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.471
Your symptoms sound very familiar.

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:16.434
Could it be that…

00:08:20.146 --> 00:08:22.315
I might be able to help you out.

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:23.899
Can you tell me more?

00:08:31.907 --> 00:08:33.284
I can't.

00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:35.953
Why?

00:08:38.664 --> 00:08:40.207
Because,

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:43.336
if I do…

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:47.465
It would suck if this got
shared publicly, wouldn't it?

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.180
Damn it, this is getting annoying.

00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:55.848
What?

00:08:56.432 --> 00:08:57.642
There's a rumor

00:08:57.725 --> 00:09:02.521
that a certain celebrity forcefully feeds
cocaine to women and assaults them.

00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:06.901
So hearing your story got me concerned.

00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:10.279
And that celebrity is?

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:15.409
Hibiki Kaga.

00:09:24.126 --> 00:09:25.461
Did that ring a bell?

00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:28.339
Does he have dirt on you?

00:09:32.051 --> 00:09:35.596
If you don't do anything,
you'll be an addict in a month's time.

00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:38.224
Are you okay with that?

00:09:41.394 --> 00:09:44.480
I've seen many people
whose lives were ruined by drugs.

00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:47.858
I don't want you to turn out the same.

00:09:50.986 --> 00:09:52.613
I can figure something out.

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:56.701
I just need you to tell me
if Kaga gets in touch with you.

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:04.667
There's no going back
once you get addicted.

00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:07.670
Are you okay with hurting
those dear to you

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:10.256
and losing everything?

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.142
Please…

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:24.770
help me.

00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:03.476
What is it?

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:07.855
Aoi was fed cocaine by Kaga.

00:11:09.648 --> 00:11:10.691
You sure?

00:11:10.775 --> 00:11:13.903
Kaga told her to come
to a club in Roppongi tonight.

00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:16.572
Good job.

00:11:43.474 --> 00:11:47.478
That said, you really think
Kaga would go to a club?

00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:50.523
A woman he got addicted
to cocaine took her life.

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:55.569
Word must have gotten out
that you and the police are on the case.

00:11:55.653 --> 00:11:58.656
The scary thing about drugs
is that you can't stop.

00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:03.327
What about Aoi?

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:06.497
Like I would let her come.

00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:10.334
I told her to make up
an excuse and turn Kaga down.

00:12:13.003 --> 00:12:14.672
I'll help her somehow.

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.090
You of all people?

00:12:16.173 --> 00:12:17.716
Why not me?

00:12:18.384 --> 00:12:19.760
Get off my back.

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:29.228
- Oh, there he is.
- We were waiting for you, Mr. Kaga.

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:32.231
- Heya.
- Let's go in.

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:34.191
He really did come.

00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:37.653
I'm in Roppongi for the Kaga case.
Be ready to mobilize.

00:12:39.697 --> 00:12:44.493
Club A2. That's where the rapper Igarashi
died by overdose after stabbing a waiter.

00:12:44.577 --> 00:12:46.745
That was here?

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:49.331
They were closed for a while
after that incident,

00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:51.458
but they're throwing
a regulars-only party today,

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:54.962
and dealing cocaine to guests
in the VIP room through waiters.

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:56.714
Gotcha.

00:12:56.797 --> 00:12:58.716
That's where you come in.

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:00.634
- What?
- Sneak in.

00:13:00.718 --> 00:13:02.011
What?

00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:03.762
Come on, man.

00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:07.349
If you already know that much,
just go in there with the whole NCD.

00:13:08.017 --> 00:13:11.228
If we go now, we'll only catch
the waiters at best.

00:13:11.312 --> 00:13:14.648
You're the key for us to get Kaga.

00:13:15.274 --> 00:13:19.153
Yeah, but the party
is only open to their regulars.

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:20.988
I'm not a regular here.

00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:24.658
You think they'll just let me
into such a crazy party that easily?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.871
I didn't say to go in as a guest.

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:34.543
What's this?

00:13:34.627 --> 00:13:37.379
Bite-sized Love
at a Family Restaurant, was it?

00:13:38.047 --> 00:13:40.049
You played a waiter in it.

00:13:41.759 --> 00:13:43.927
Did you check all the dramas I was in?

00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:46.263
Not all of them. Just three.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.475
This is a keycard for club personnel.

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:52.061
Why do you have this?

00:13:52.144 --> 00:13:55.481
I picked it up at the hospital
from the waiter who got stabbed.

00:13:58.734 --> 00:13:59.735
Do I get any--

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:01.403
- I'll arrest you.
- Let me finish!

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:15.542
Find Kaga.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.795
I'm on it.

00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:19.672
So annoying.

00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:22.216
I can still hear you.

00:14:29.682 --> 00:14:30.724
Found him.

00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:36.146
Go ahead.

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:43.988
Excuse me.

00:14:48.325 --> 00:14:50.577
Here you are. Please come in.

00:15:02.339 --> 00:15:03.924
He went into the VIP room.

00:15:04.008 --> 00:15:08.012
If Kaga does cocaine, record evidence
with your phone and contact me.

00:15:08.095 --> 00:15:10.764
That will be my cue
to enter and arrest him.

00:15:10.848 --> 00:15:13.392
Okay, I'll let you know
if anything happens.

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:18.689
Gotta find a way into the VIP room first.

00:15:28.198 --> 00:15:29.992
Hello, can you hear me?

00:15:30.075 --> 00:15:31.035
Yeah.

00:15:31.118 --> 00:15:33.746
Contact me the moment Kaga does cocaine.

00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:35.080
Got it.

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:36.790
I will not tolerate failure.

00:15:37.374 --> 00:15:38.625
Gotcha.

00:15:41.462 --> 00:15:43.255
Just watch, NCD asshat.

00:15:44.214 --> 00:15:45.758
I'll get him first.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.481
Hey.

00:16:00.564 --> 00:16:02.232
Still no updates?

00:16:02.316 --> 00:16:04.610
Can you not put more pressure on me?

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.990
I'll get back to you.

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:14.119
Hello, sir.

00:16:14.203 --> 00:16:15.204
Who're you?

00:16:15.287 --> 00:16:18.082
Can I handle the VIP room today?

00:16:18.165 --> 00:16:21.043
What? No one told me about this.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.516
So heavy!

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.975
Damn it.

00:16:47.194 --> 00:16:48.612
Perfect.

00:16:52.032 --> 00:16:53.450
Excuse me.

00:16:57.412 --> 00:16:58.747
Who are you?

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:04.211
My colleague fell ill and had to leave,
so I will be filling in as his substitute.

00:17:05.504 --> 00:17:06.588
Fine.

00:17:08.632 --> 00:17:09.967
Mr. Kaga.

00:17:13.053 --> 00:17:14.888
I have some good stuff for you.

00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:17.641
Huh?

00:17:18.684 --> 00:17:20.894
It's ultra-fine stuff from Syria.

00:17:21.603 --> 00:17:25.941
My colleague said you could have it
on the house, since you're a patron.

00:17:32.072 --> 00:17:36.076
My grandma always told me
not to accept gifts from strangers.

00:17:37.077 --> 00:17:40.497
I'm not gonna trust a guy I just met.

00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:43.959
Care to try it?

00:17:44.668 --> 00:17:46.044
Just a taste.

00:17:53.468 --> 00:17:54.928
If you get high on it,

00:17:56.763 --> 00:17:59.349
I'll buy enough for everyone here.

00:17:59.433 --> 00:18:00.434
What?

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:03.645
Oh, but I'm not in the mood today.

00:18:03.729 --> 00:18:04.771
Come on.

00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:09.985
- Ow.
- Get to it.

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:13.113
But…

00:18:14.531 --> 00:18:16.658
You really a dealer?

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:22.331
I understand.

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:25.667
I'll do it.

00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:41.099
Goddamn it!

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:46.230
You're a fun guy, aren't you?

00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:48.523
Care to join me,

00:18:49.691 --> 00:18:50.859
Mr. Kaga?

00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:54.947
If this stuff really does the job,

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.783
I'll buy from you from now on.

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:19.930
Holy crap!

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:25.102
So good.

00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:30.983
You guys try it too.

00:19:33.944 --> 00:19:36.238
This rocks!

00:19:50.294 --> 00:19:52.462
I did it, Katsuragi.

00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:54.673
Kaga just did cocaine.

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:57.092
I left to avoid any trouble.

00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:59.052
Get back to Kaga right now.

00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:02.639
What? Screw that.

00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:05.392
I just inhaled a full dose
of Loxoprofen Sodium.

00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:07.311
Of course, I'm gonna scram.

00:20:07.936 --> 00:20:09.688
Loxoprofen Sodium.

00:20:09.771 --> 00:20:11.732
You really a dealer?

00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:13.358
I understand.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:14.609
I'll do it.

00:20:20.532 --> 00:20:22.034
I kept my end of the deal

00:20:22.117 --> 00:20:24.161
and contacted you
as soon as Kaga did drugs.

00:20:24.244 --> 00:20:26.371
Just go arrest him or whatever.

00:20:26.455 --> 00:20:28.332
Listen. To arrest someone for drugs,

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:31.501
the police must either have evidence
or catch them in the act.

00:20:31.585 --> 00:20:34.880
However, Kaga is inside a building
owned by an acquaintance.

00:20:34.963 --> 00:20:37.632
I have no evidence
that Kaga actually did drugs.

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:40.969
Without evidence, the courts
won't issue a search warrant,

00:20:41.053 --> 00:20:44.056
so I can't do a search,
meaning I can't catch him in the act.

00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:47.809
Meaning you need to get your ass
back to the VIP room right now!

00:20:48.393 --> 00:20:49.603
I told you,

00:20:50.354 --> 00:20:53.440
he's doing cocaine in there right now!
Just go catch him in the act!

00:20:54.691 --> 00:20:56.026
And how do I know that?

00:20:57.277 --> 00:20:58.487
What?

00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:01.782
No, seriously, you lost me there.

00:21:02.616 --> 00:21:05.202
Because I saw it and reported it to you.
That's evidence!

00:21:05.285 --> 00:21:07.704
Isn't that how sting operations work?

00:21:07.788 --> 00:21:08.997
Sting operations?

00:21:09.081 --> 00:21:10.248
Yeah.

00:21:10.332 --> 00:21:13.085
The police aren't allowed
to carry out sting operations.

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:16.546
You're ultimately only moving
under my personal instructions.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.131
What?

00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:19.674
Let's say I arrest Kaga.

00:21:19.758 --> 00:21:21.176
Unless you're in there with him,

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:24.054
how am I gonna explain
how I knew what he was doing in there?

00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:27.933
I don't really get it,
and your dialect is leaking.

00:21:28.016 --> 00:21:29.601
This is such a huge pain!

00:21:29.684 --> 00:21:33.730
Plus, Kaga consumed cocaine
after you offered it to him, right?

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:35.524
Yeah, I put myself at risk to do it.

00:21:36.316 --> 00:21:40.278
I told you to coax him
into obtaining drugs of his own accord!

00:21:40.362 --> 00:21:42.864
Let's say this goes to court.

00:21:42.948 --> 00:21:46.326
What if they argue that he was entrapped
into doing cocaine

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.954
by some lackey
that the police put up to it?

00:21:49.037 --> 00:21:50.038
What about it?

00:21:50.122 --> 00:21:52.833
If the court rules it
an illegal investigation,

00:21:52.916 --> 00:21:53.917
Kaga will walk free.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.254
And if the police are found guilty
of entrapment,

00:21:57.337 --> 00:21:59.089
it will reflect badly on me.

00:21:59.172 --> 00:22:00.424
If it comes to that,

00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:02.843
how do you plan to make up for it?

00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:07.013
So you're only concerned about yourself?

00:22:07.097 --> 00:22:09.224
Of course, I am. Now, get back in there!

00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:11.059
Go in and scream somewhere randomly

00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:13.353
that Kaga was about
to make you do cocaine.

00:22:13.437 --> 00:22:16.273
Then I'll take him in
as I go in to investigate.

00:22:16.356 --> 00:22:20.986
We can add on charges for possession
and use of cocaine after the fact.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.115
As long as the rule
of law exists in Japan,

00:22:25.198 --> 00:22:28.243
we have to prioritize
optics above all else!

00:22:28.326 --> 00:22:31.246
Screw that! You're just trying
to cover your own ass!

00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:32.455
What?

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.584
Remember your place, damn S.

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:37.419
Shut up! I don't care!

00:22:40.422 --> 00:22:42.632
{\an8}Damn jackass piece of shit!

00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:47.679
{\an8}Shit.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.097
{\an8}Hey.

00:22:49.181 --> 00:22:50.098
{\an8}You scared me.

00:22:50.182 --> 00:22:52.309
{\an8}Why weren't you responding?

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:56.605
{\an8}Well, I got Kaga to do cocaine.

00:22:58.148 --> 00:23:00.192
{\an8}But that's not good enough, right?

00:23:01.318 --> 00:23:02.694
{\an8}You did well.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.487
{\an8}What?

00:23:04.571 --> 00:23:08.783
{\an8}I'll go inside the club now
and arrest Kaga for possession of cocaine.

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:11.745
{\an8}But I thought you weren't allowed
to do sting operations.

00:23:12.746 --> 00:23:14.748
{\an8}Yeah, it's not allowed.

00:23:15.415 --> 00:23:18.168
{\an8}For those fools in the police.

00:23:20.045 --> 00:23:23.673
{\an8}We're allowed the ultimate weapon
that the police can't use.

00:23:23.757 --> 00:23:25.717
{\an8}Sting operations.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.053
{\an8}That's the NCD's prerogative.

00:23:28.136 --> 00:23:29.304
{\an8}Let's go.

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:41.441
{\an8}Hurry up and jump.

00:23:41.524 --> 00:23:42.859
{\an8}MAD DOG KUROSAKI RUNS WILD

00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:44.611
{\an8}- I didn't do anything!
- Screw you!

00:23:44.694 --> 00:23:47.197
{\an8}Even if it was against their will,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.367
{\an8}once consumed, one's body
will never forget the taste of drugs.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.537
{\an8}I will never consider you a human being.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:01.002
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS,
GROUPS, OR CASES IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:02.045
