WEBVTT

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.719
I can't eat all that

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:59.659
Take it back

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.540
Give it to Doudou

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.980
Don't take it back, Mom

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.980
This is all stuff I secretly...

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.379
No

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:05.700
I bought this for you openly and honestly

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:07.459
Just eat to your heart's content

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.740
When you finish it, I'll buy more

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.539
If you can't finish it

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.300
Share it with the other uncles and aunties

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.180
What good stuff is this?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.780
That you want to share with us?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.379
Uncle Liang

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.620
I brought my mom some fruit and things

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:17.360
You have some too

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.939
Take some, take some

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.259
Da Bao is so filial

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.180
Xiao Cai

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.180
You usually say he's an ingrate

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.020
And a rascal

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.060
Lao Li, Lao Fan, Xiao Liu, Ludi

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.979
Quick, there's good food

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.639
Come on

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.340
It doesn't matter what you buy me

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.379
You should have brought my grandson

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.300
Are you that afraid of your wife?

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:41.639
Me, afraid of her?

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.620
As soon as I glare

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.740
She immediately...

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.139
Makes you kneel on a washboard

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.780
Who?

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.699
I don't know, that little vixen

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.379
Mom

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.259
Her name is Hu Xiaoli

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.620
Mom, I'm leaving

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.479
Uncles, goodbye

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.259
Have one

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:59.699
My son bought it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.620
Everyone come eat, come eat

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.740
Having a son like Da Bao

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.159
Xiao Cai, you are so lucky

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.099
Lao Fan, regret it now? Too late

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.219
As if you have a son

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:09.860
I...

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:11.699
We have a daughter

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:12.419
Right?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.500
I'm talking about a son

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.099
A son

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.199
Do you have one?

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.080
I do

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:18.740
Son

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.020
Call me Dad

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.139
No

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.800
Whose dad are you?

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:26.560
I am your dad

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.139
I am your dad

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.099
Hurry up, call me Dad

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.280
Son, call me Dad

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.020
Hurry up

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.419
Gou'er Ye is confused again

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.180
Yusheng

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.180
Call me Dad

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.259
Hurry up

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.900
Call me Dad

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.659
Grandpa Gou'er

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.740
This is President Li

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.099
Not your son

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.180
I'm not your son

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.580
Could you have a sixty-year-old son?

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.620
Could your son be a group president?

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.699
Really

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.580
This isn't the first time

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.340
Son

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.939
I am your dad

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.939
Was it easy for me to raise you?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.139
Grandpa Gou'er

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.800
Okay

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.539
Okay

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:07.300
Good

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.099
What's wrong?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.939
I'll make him come back in a while

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:11.860
Make your son come back

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.339
Gou'er Ye won't even eat

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:22.500
He's still making a fuss there

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.699
It's really pitiful

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.620
His son doesn't recognize him

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.740
He's anxious

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:28.579
If you want to recognize him, you do it

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.899
You have an addiction to being other people's son

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:35.339
Gou'er Ye is all muddled

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.980
Should we

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.920
Find someone to pretend to be his son

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.819
Right, coax him to eat first

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.339
Or else he'll get sick later

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.660
But who should we get to play the son?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.180
Grandpas and Grandmas

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.779
Would you like some soup?

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:50.220
This son isn't bad

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.779
Dad, I'm your son.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.300
Come on, let me take you to eat.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.779
Let's go.

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.560
Who's your dad?

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.800
Get, get away.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.420
No, Gou'er Ye.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.740
Really, he really is your son.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.800
That's right, look.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.420
Look how much you two look alike.

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.500
Look at that pathetic face of his.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.220
Be my son? As if he's worthy.

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.060
I was sleeping just fine.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.139
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.199
Xiao Liang.

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:21.540
Brother Xiao Liang.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.319
You're too kind.

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.920
Brother Liang, you're too kind.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.379
Right?

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.819
Volunteering to be someone's son.

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.060
I... I...

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.139
I'm just asking for it.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.360
I've got nothing better to do.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.939
Let me tell you.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.220
I'm only doing this for you two.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.500
Fine, I'll just humor Gou'er Ye for a bit.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.300
Speak nicely.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:41.720
Dad

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.019
You are my son

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.139
Goushengzi

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:46.660
Yes

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.459
Why is his son named that?

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.060
Right, that's the name

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:51.620
Right

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:53.939
I am your son, Goushengzi

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.300
That's not right

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.420
Why do you look so old?

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:59.860
Does President Li look younger than me?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.060
No

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.079
Dad

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.060
I'm almost fifty years old

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.980
It's not bad looking like this

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.360
I remember you being thirty-three

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:11.620
I remember this clearly

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.459
You call that clear?

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:17.980
The year 1990

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.819
Gou'er Ye had kids pretty late

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:21.120
Never mind that, just say it

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.660
Right, I was born in 1990

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.139
Getting old

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:26.540
I even get to play a post-90s kid

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.779
If you are my son

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:34.300
My son loved to sing when he was seven

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.819
What song did he love to sing back then?

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:38.100
You remember, right?

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:40.019
Why is he testing on singing now?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.300
You say it

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.899
Back in '97, he loved singing *Xin Tai Ruan*

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.060
What? *Xin Tai Ruan*?

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.139
I know *Xin Tai Ruan*

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.860
I know it

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.420
What is this nonsense?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.259
It should be

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.540
*I'm a commune's...*

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.000
*...livestock keeper*

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:59.819
What era is that song from?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.519
Alright

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:02.019
My confused dad

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.459
I'll take you to eat

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.540
I'm not going, you're not my son

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.920
He is your son, yes

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.420
He's very rich now

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.459
Just have a meal first

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:11.019
Right

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.699
If you're really my son Goushengzi

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.139
I have to test you again

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.060
When my son was little

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.800
What did he love to eat the most?

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.500
Why is he still testing?

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:22.899
What does this Goushengzi love to eat?

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:23.360
How would I know?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.040
Guess

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.459
When I was little, I loved eating...

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.339
Fried mantou slices

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:29.019
That's right!

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.800
That's right!

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:34.980
You really are Goushengzi

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.339
Yes

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:37.920
He finally recognized him

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.939
Lao Liang, quick

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:39.500
Take your...

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.480
Take your dad to eat

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:42.220
Let me ask you again

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.379
When my son ate fried mantou slices as a kid

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:46.740
What did he like to spread on them?

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.019
Spread what?

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.139
Spread sesame paste with sugar

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:52.139
Wrong

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:53.779
Stinky tofu

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.680
Stinky...

00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:56.199
This...

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:57.439
We loved eating it like that as kids

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.180
Right, right

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.180
I'm a Southerner

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.060
I don't eat that Northern stinky tofu

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:02.779
You... you...

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.220
You liar

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:09.740
This old guy

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.860
He's quite strong

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.420
I meant well, you...

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.199
Ouch, that hurts!

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.500
I'm not going with you

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.980
Human trafficker!

00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:20.199
Oh, give it a rest

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:22.259
What trafficker would want someone like you?

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.300
Who would pay money to buy a dad?

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.860
He's just completely senile

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.180
It hurts so much

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.699
Slow down

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:29.540
You slow... be careful, walk slowly

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.860
My son!

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.440
Stop crying.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.019
Okay.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.559
Gou'er Ye.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.879
Where are you?

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.220
I'm here.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.179
Come.

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:45.860
Have some tea.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.179
Xiao Lizi.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.980
You're asking for a tea splashing, aren't you?

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.679
I still don't understand.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.059
What exactly happened?

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.899
That Gou'er Ye.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.940
Insisted I call him Dad.

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:01.100
He can forget it.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.340
He's gone senile.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.080
It's that senile dementia.

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:08.860
Ms. Cai, you can't say that.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.940
Senile dementia.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.159
Nowadays, it's called...

00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:13.179
Alzheimer's.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.980
Al's Hammer.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.580
What kind of name is that?

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.539
Not Al's Hammer.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.779
It's Alzheimer's.

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:21.240
Alzheimer's.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.399
Our German medical scientist.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.340
Your fellow countryman.

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:26.940
He invented this disease.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.500
Yes.

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:28.860
No.

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:30.779
How can a disease be invented?

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:31.460
It was him...

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:32.740
Designed...

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.259
Developed...

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:34.860
Dis...

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.700
Discovered.

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:36.820
Right.

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:37.700
Discovered.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.700
He researched this disease.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.759
What's there to research?

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:43.399
It's just getting senile.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.379
Look at him.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.980
Probably was stupid when he was young too.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.480
This disease...

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:48.259
Has nothing to do with being stupid.

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:50.200
Many high-IQ big shots...

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.679
Get it when they're old too.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.639
Like Reagan, Mrs. Thatcher.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.200
And there's that one...

00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:58.100
The Chinese scientist who won the Nobel Prize.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.899
Named Gao...

00:09:59.379 --> 00:10:00.460
Gao something... it's on the tip of my tongue.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.100
Look at you guys.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.720
He's about to get Alzheimer's.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:05.340
If anyone's getting it, it's you.

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:06.860
Just like Gou'er Ye.

00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:08.580
It runs in your family, right?

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.860
You're really asking for a tea splashing now.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.019
Stop it, you two brothers.

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:12.700
Stop it.

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:15.820
So Gou'er Ye isn't eating or drinking now, right?

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.360
Just crying out for his son.

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:20.940
President Li

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.820
Could you...

00:10:23.139 --> 00:10:23.820
No.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.259
I can't.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.940
Absolutely not.

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:29.259
Stop trying to persuade President Li.

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:30.700
He's held a high position for years.

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:32.960
To play the son of an old farmer...

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.580
can he handle that?

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.139
This has nothing to do with rank.

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:37.100
No, look...

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.559
Forget it.

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:40.340
Let me say a few words.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.139
Speaking from my professional perspective...

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.299
Gou'er Ye's son...

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.179
is quite a character.

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:50.460
A role.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.179
To play it well...

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:54.220
is very, very difficult.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.419
Especially...

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.379
for someone who hasn't studied acting.

00:10:57.379 --> 00:10:58.460
They definitely can't do it.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.419
Right? Exactly.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.240
And besides...

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.700
out of all of us...

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.100
why is Mr. Liu the only one...

00:11:03.179 --> 00:11:04.779
who is a famous performing artist?

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:05.500
Right?

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.259
Ordinary people haven't studied acting...

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:09.539
nor do they have acting talent.

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.899
Is it that he doesn't want to act?

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:13.700
It's that he simply can't act.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.120
Right.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.059
Nonsense!

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:16.620
Who says I have no talent?

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:17.919
Who says I haven't studied acting?

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.019
I was the lead singer in a children's choir.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.620
When I was in the Production Corps...

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.740
I was a key member of the art troupe.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.299
My comrade Jiang Kun and I...

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:27.299
our artistic levels...

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:28.379
were on par with each other!

00:11:29.539 --> 00:11:31.120
The famous artist from Beijing People's Art Theatre...

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.940
Dong Xingji...

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:33.440
Mr. Liu, you know him, right?

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.860
He was my teacher!

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.620
Really?

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.379
Yes!

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:38.000
That's amazing.

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:39.460
Mr. Jiang Kun...

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.279
I know of him too.

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:42.899
But this Master Dong...

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:44.779
I've never heard of him.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.860
Later, I accidentally became a CEO.

00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:48.620
Work was too busy...

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.299
and wasted my artistic talent.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.700
Let's not just talk.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.340
Show us if you've got the skills.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.399
Let Mr. Liu give a critique.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.539
He's using reverse psychology.

00:11:57.539 --> 00:11:58.220
I know.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.379
You don't have to fall for it.

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:01.379
How could I fall for it?

00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:03.000
But Mr. Liu...

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.559
if you could give me a critique...

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.820
I wouldn't mind giving it a try.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.980
You agreed!

00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:10.899
What's the big deal?

00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:11.820
In the early days of the business...

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.139
for the sake of the group's development...

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:14.539
I played the "grandson" so many times.

00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:16.100
Isn't this just playing a son?

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:17.700
I'll do it right now.

00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:18.740
Great!

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.340
However...

00:12:19.899 --> 00:12:20.679
Mr. Liu...

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:22.440
you have to give me some private coaching.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.620
Okay.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.259
Son.

00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:31.000
Don't be sad.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.240
Your son will be here soon.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.539
Just bear with it.

00:12:33.539 --> 00:12:34.940
If we're going to act, let's make it realistic.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.179
Why did your dad have to look down on me...

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:38.179
and take a liking to you?

00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:39.940
We can't just let him pick whoever he wants.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.580
Well...

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.740
Son

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.580
Goushengzi

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:48.899
Gousheng

00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.059
Who is Gousheng?

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:51.980
Gousheng

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.259
Gousheng

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:54.779
He's calling you.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:55.340
Right.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:55.980
It's Goushengzi.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.179
That's the character you're playing.

00:12:57.179 --> 00:12:58.419
Quick, get into character.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.139
Right.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.679
I am Gousheng.

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:04.100
Li Gousheng.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.460
Nonsense.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.000
You...

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:10.899
why did you change the surname?

00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:14.539
You're the only heir of our Gou family.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.860
Quick.

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:16.620
Call him Dad.

00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:18.820
Hurry up and say it.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.639
Say it.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.220
Dad.

00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:32.340
Gousheng.

00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:34.500
Don't be so enthusiastic.

00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:36.539
Shall I take you to eat?

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.379
Eat. Let's go.

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:39.620
I'll take you to eat.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.620
Not that way.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.500
This way.

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:42.120
Okay.

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.240
This way.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.299
Slow down.

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:46.480
Slow down.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.539
You father and son, slow down.

00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:48.620
Gou'er Ye, slow down.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.460
Going to eat.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.139
That's really nice.

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:53.500
So nice.

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:58.279
Look how happy Gou'er Ye is.

00:14:01.379 --> 00:14:02.559
If one day,

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.259
I become confused too,

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.259
I wonder if anyone

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:07.700
will humor me like this too.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.600
Of course there will be.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.580
You have me...

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:12.379
...and all of us will humor you.

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:13.759
Right, we'll all humor you.

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.700
Treat you well.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.220
Don't you worry.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.799
Just be confused in peace.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:28.779
Son

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.019
Son

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.200
Goushengzi

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:35.159
Time to get up

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.259
Get up, Son

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:41.759
Gou'er Ye

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:43.299
It's early in the morning

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:44.460
What's all this racket?

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.820
Is that how you talk to your dad?

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.779
Whose dad are you?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.340
Right

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:52.820
You're my dad

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.659
Come on, Dad

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.740
Let's sit here

00:14:58.539 --> 00:14:59.600
Fellow villagers

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:01.879
Fellow villagers

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.139
You're all up early

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:06.659
My son is back

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.820
Tell me

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:11.779
What are sons for?

00:15:11.779 --> 00:15:12.620
Sons...

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.620
Are for taking care of you

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:16.820
To give you money to spend

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:18.779
To buy things for you

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:21.419
To do work for you and let you scold them

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:23.779
To beat whenever you feel like it

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.179
You old rascals

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:26.320
You're stirring up trouble, aren't you?

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:28.620
Why should I give him money?

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:29.620
And get beaten too?

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.299
You dare!

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:31.580
Mr. Liu

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.419
Is Lao Li's acting okay?

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.600
He hasn't gotten into character

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:37.179
Lacks conviction

00:15:41.299 --> 00:15:42.100
Dad

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.259
I'll treat you right

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.340
What do you want to eat?

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.340
What do you want to buy?

00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:48.059
I'll go buy it for you

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.340
I have money

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.600
I want a...

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:53.740
Big black mule

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.220
Ten jin of dry tobacco

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:56.759
Okay

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.580
And a 28-inch Fenghuang men's bicycle

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.220
And buy me a Hongdeng brand radio

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:04.980
This...

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:07.980
Where am I supposed to find all this for you?

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.820
It's hard to buy

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.600
Hard to buy, huh?

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.399
I don't want them

00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:13.019
Look how much your dad loves you

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:15.179
Son

00:16:16.259 --> 00:16:18.139
If you really care about me

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.700
You just...

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:22.940
That dog landlord Qi Yongnian's family's...

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:25.059
Those few acres of prime land at the big diagonal corner

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:26.000
Buy them for me

00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:26.860
This...

00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:27.639
This...

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.480
This is even harder to buy

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.559
How about this

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:33.000
Dad

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.940
I have money here

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:35.980
Whatever you want to eat

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:36.940
Whatever you want to buy

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.039
Go buy it yourself

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:44.440
What kind of money is this?

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:45.399
This...

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:47.200
This isn't an old 10-yuan bill

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:54.340
Stop rubbing.

00:16:54.379 --> 00:16:56.500
My hand's about to lose its skin.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:16:58.940
Son.

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:02.419
You haven't visited me in all these years.

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:03.539
Where have you been?

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:05.319
I...

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.859
I went to the Great Northwest.

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:10.059
I know the Great Northwest.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.539
Honghu waters, wave upon wave.

00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:13.779
That's in Hubei.

00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:15.119
Gou'er Ye is getting more and more confused.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.940
You must be thirty-three, right?

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:17.660
Yes.

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:18.700
Thirty-three.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.140
Does a thirty-three-year-old look like this?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.720
Nonsense.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.740
I look old for my age.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.779
Is that not allowed?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.099
Are you married?

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:25.619
Yes.

00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:29.019
Why hasn't my daughter-in-law come to see me?

00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:30.460
This old man is pushing his luck.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.279
He just got a son, now he wants a daughter-in-law.

00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:35.660
My daughter-in-law has to come see me.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.099
A daughter-in-law has to meet the ugly in-laws sooner or later.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.299
Yes.

00:17:42.259 --> 00:17:43.259
This daughter-in-law...

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.140
We have one.

00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:47.420
I... I don't think it's appropriate.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.660
Mr. Liu, do you think it's appropriate?

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.380
Appropriate.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.740
Very appropriate.

00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:54.059
Just the chance for Mr. Liu to show off some talent.

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:55.420
So we can learn from you.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:55.859
Yes.

00:17:55.859 --> 00:17:57.779
President Li said that...

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.940
Gou'er Ye wants to see his daughter-in-law.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.099
If we don't agree, he'll cry and fuss,

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:03.140
and roll all over the floor.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.059
So tell me, at a time like this,

00:18:04.059 --> 00:18:06.500
I have to help out no matter what.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.579
My Sister Liu is just so warm-hearted.

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:10.259
Yes.

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:11.180
Come here.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:12.839
Come.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.180
Liu...

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.220
Xiaozhi.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:19.019
Let's hurry and get into character.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.220
Find that feeling of being passionately in love.

00:18:32.259 --> 00:18:34.359
This isn't crying and rolling on the floor.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.420
A characteristic of Alzheimer's

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.740
is mood swings.

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:40.579
Dad.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.859
Come take a look.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.579
This is your daughter-in-law.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.819
My wife.

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:46.940
My missus.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.099
My spouse.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:48.759
My better half.

00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:49.500
Enough.

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:50.779
It's all nonsense.

00:18:51.619 --> 00:18:52.819
Isn't this Little Liu?

00:18:54.579 --> 00:18:56.940
You took care of me when I was sick last time.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.500
No.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.460
Dad.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.799
This is your daughter-in-law.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.759
Quick, explain again.

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:04.480
I...

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.940
Explain what?

00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:07.460
The jig is up.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:09.019
You're unfilial.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.059
You're rebellious.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.140
Think I'm an old fool?

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.720
You just find anyone and...

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.140
try to hoodwink me, right?

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:17.819
I raised you all these years.

00:19:17.819 --> 00:19:18.740
Was it easy for me?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.940
Right, serves you right.

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:20.940
My book collection.

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:24.460
What do we do now? No...

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.420
He's lucid one moment, bad the next.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.579
How do we handle this?

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.180
Dad.

00:19:31.819 --> 00:19:33.259
I am your daughter-in-law.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.779
Girl.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.359
You aren't lying to me, are you?

00:19:36.819 --> 00:19:37.779
No.

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:41.740
I'm the Gou family's Five-Good daughter-in-law.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.859
Why is my name Gou now too?

00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:47.660
I work hard and never complain.

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:51.539
Here, have a banana.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.619
It's delicious.

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:56.180
If you don't believe me, just taste it.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.259
Here.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.460
Yummy.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.920
Yummy.

00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:02.779
Slow down, slow down.

00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:06.619
I'm an expert at taking care of the elderly.

00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:07.900
Back in the day,

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:11.279
I took care of Dabao's grandpa.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.500
Dad.

00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:14.759
If the pressure is too hard or soft,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.240
just say the word.

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:16.980
Good.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.140
Just right.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:22.380
I married into your family at twenty-one.

00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:25.420
Working and raising Bao'er.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.339
Massaging shoulders, washing feet.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.740
With elders above and little ones below.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.299
The kid's dad left early.

00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:36.980
Leaving us widow and orphan, and I haven't remarried.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.019
Left...

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:40.259
Didn't go far.

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:41.460
He came back again.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.660
Gotta come home often, right?

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.099
He has to help you...

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.579
wash the chopsticks,

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:47.500
wash the dishes.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.339
Pound the back, massage the shoulders.

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:52.539
That's great.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:54.220
Goushengzi.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.299
I'm calling you, Goushengzi.

00:20:58.259 --> 00:20:58.859
Look.

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:00.460
Look how good your wife is.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:00.940
Good.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:02.980
Come here.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.859
Massage Dad's legs.

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:05.460
Hurry.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.220
Massage legs.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.140
Kneel down. Massage legs.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.819
Dad

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.180
Can't you let someone else push for a while?

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.059
I've been pushing you for ages.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.059
If I didn't have a son,

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.539
I'd let someone else.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.460
With a son here, why ask someone else?

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.380
Hurry up.

00:21:32.619 --> 00:21:33.619
Push me.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.859
Go around the lake three more times.

00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:41.619
This is killing me.

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:44.740
I wasn't this tired even in the Army Corps.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.339
Gou'er Ye's ancestors

00:21:47.579 --> 00:21:49.180
must have been local tyrants or bullies.

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:51.299
How can he be so good at torturing people?

00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:52.799
If this keeps up,

00:21:53.859 --> 00:21:54.940
Gou'er Ye, the white-haired one,

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.519
is bound to bury me, the black-haired one.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.740
Lao Li,

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.980
take a look at yourself in your phone camera.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.279
Do you even have any hair left?

00:22:01.579 --> 00:22:03.339
You really think you're thirty-three?

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.900
Actually, compared to Gou'er Ye,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.059
we aren't that much younger.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.900
Student Wang Song is right.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.380
People...

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.380
everyone gets old eventually.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.299
And that day

00:22:16.779 --> 00:22:17.859
isn't far off.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.420
As for the next Alzheimer's case,

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.539
who knows who it'll be?

00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:23.859
If it's me,

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:26.339
you all have to humor me too.

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:28.579
Xiao Fan,

00:22:29.539 --> 00:22:30.619
you pretend to be my son.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.880
Why should you be the one with Alzheimer's?

00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:35.539
As if no one else can get it.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:37.339
Right, maybe I'll get it before you guys.

00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:39.980
Is this really something to compete over?

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.859
Professor Fan is here.

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:48.819
It's me, Gou'er Ye.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.819
Mr. Liu.

00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:51.779
Yes, it's me.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.700
Gou'er Ye's confusion has passed.

00:22:55.099 --> 00:22:56.700
Look at me, who am I?

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.140
Brother Lao Liang.

00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:01.059
Sister Xiao Cai.

00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:03.900
I was confused just now.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.299
I had a dream.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.960
I dreamt you were pretending to be my son,

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.059
pretending to be my daughter-in-law.

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:10.579
It was so funny.

00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:12.619
Really?

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:14.140
Gou'er Ye isn't confused anymore.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.640
Yes.

00:23:14.819 --> 00:23:16.099
I'm not confused.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.460
Son,

00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:20.579
old landlord Qi Yongnian's family...

00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:22.259
those few acres of prime land at the big diagonal corner,

00:23:22.259 --> 00:23:24.180
did you buy them for me?

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.900
Well, he still doesn't get it.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.019
My poor old back

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:38.740
Go ask for that wheelchair

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.140
I need to use it

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.299
It's been less than two days and I can't take it

00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:45.559
Let whoever wants to handle it do it

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.539
I'm done

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.819
Gou'er Ye is a sick man

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.380
You have to bear with him

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.500
At our age

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.779
who isn't sick?

00:23:56.779 --> 00:23:58.460
Does being sick give you the right to bully people?

00:23:59.579 --> 00:24:00.940
Gou'er Ye, you're here

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:01.700
Grandpa Gou'er

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:02.980
No need

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:04.740
Dad

00:24:06.819 --> 00:24:08.000
Who are you calling Dad?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.099
Who is your dad?

00:24:11.099 --> 00:24:11.779
No

00:24:11.859 --> 00:24:13.420
He's really sick

00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:15.220
This...

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.539
No need

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.140
No need

00:24:19.359 --> 00:24:19.819
No need

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:21.640
Gou'er Ye has come to his senses

00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:23.220
Lao Li, you're liberated

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.059
Just like that

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.299
severed the father-son relationship so quickly?

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.160
Suddenly having no one to wait on

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.519
feels a bit empty inside

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:39.900
President Li

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.839
You've recovered quite well

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:44.099
My back is fine now

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.740
but my memory is getting worse and worse

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.180
I remember I had something to do today

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.819
but I just can't recall what it was

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.259
Say

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:54.980
this Alzheimer's

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.660
is it contagious?

00:24:56.819 --> 00:24:58.619
Your memory is fine

00:24:59.619 --> 00:25:00.420
Mr. Liu

00:25:00.619 --> 00:25:01.420
President Li

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:03.539
If I get confused one day

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.200
and call you my husband

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.380
please don't get angry

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.019
Okay

00:25:09.059 --> 00:25:10.799
You have to play along and humor me too

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:11.980
You...

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.099
Say, Lao Li

00:25:13.259 --> 00:25:15.660
didn't we agree to meet at Yongfeng Mall?

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.779
Why didn't you go?

00:25:16.779 --> 00:25:18.380
Made me wait there like a fool for half an hour

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.740
That's the thing! I forgot

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.660
Look at my memory

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:22.980
You took care of Gou'er Ye for a few days

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.420
and now you've got senile dementia too?

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.380
I really might have a bit

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.740
Then the 30,000 yuan you owe

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.660
don't forget to pay me back

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.380
Nonsense

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.420
When did I ever borrow money from you?

00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:34.579
If anything, you've taken advantage of me plenty

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.299
Tuesday

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.700
we took a taxi together

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.539
I paid the fare

00:25:39.339 --> 00:25:40.380
The fifth of last month

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.819
you had a toothache and I bought the medicine

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:43.220
I didn't ask you to reimburse me, did I?

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:43.839
And also

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:45.299
the second day I arrived at the community

00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:46.339
you used my shaver

00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:47.140
and you broke it

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.980
Don't listen to his nonsense

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:48.720
That never happened

00:25:48.819 --> 00:25:50.140
You still haven't paid me back for it

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.180
Pay me for my shaver

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.420
With a memory like that

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.380
you won't get Alzheimer's

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:55.980
Sister

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.119
Goodbye

00:25:58.259 --> 00:25:59.359
What are we practicing today?
