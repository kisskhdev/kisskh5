WEBVTT

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.055
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.723
JB DAEHAN CONSTRUCTION HIRING RESULTS

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:39.434
HWANG TAE-SEONG

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.395
PASS

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:43.689
What? He passed?

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:47.234
Chief Justice Jeon will resign soon.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.696
The next nominee for the position is
Justice Hwang.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.157
That's the father of Hwang Tae-seong here.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.286
So, you'll stop the nominee from becoming
the Chief Justice

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.622
by exposing his son for being a nepo baby?

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:03.041
Justice Hwang took bribes

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.835
to frame a victim into a perpetrator

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:07.254
in a case 18 years ago.

00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:10.966
Justice Hwang,
who was the judge on the case

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:14.469
heard only S Construction's guards out

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:18.724
simply under the justification
that the testimonies were consistent.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.227
So? How did the trial end?

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:25.439
One year and six months of imprisonment.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:27.024
A year and a half in prison.

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:29.359
That's unbelievable.

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:33.113
By the way (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.408
how do you know about a case
from 18 years ago?

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:39.453
You were only a teenager...

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:40.662
I was in 12th grade.

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:43.957
The victim, who ended up in prison

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.376
was my father.

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.047
Mr. Lee...

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:52.674
The one who bribed Justice Hwang then was

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.052
Jang Tae-sik from S Construction.

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:56.637
He's

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.847
now the CEO of S Shopping.

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.475
Mr. Hwang and Mr. Jang are

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:03.477
still friends now.

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:08.357
What a guy, Justice Hwang.

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:12.361
Forget becoming the Chief Justice.
He shouldn't be a judge at all.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.740
But Mr. Lee

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:21.370
who are you, really?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.871
Me?

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:23.997
Yeah.

00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:26.250
Lee Han-young, the judge

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.501
at the Seoul Central Court.

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.462
EPISODE 9

00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:38.679
What now?

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.097
Not seeing Colleen today?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.057
- You're not busy?
- I am.

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:44.434
But I have to make time
for people who matter.

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.019
But I'm busy, too.

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:47.771
Oh, is that so?

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:49.439
Next time, then.

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:51.149
Wait! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:55.279
You said you should always make time
for those who matter.

00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:56.405
What was that?

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:57.739
Let's meet.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.160
Well

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.538
it's not too bad.

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:06.915
She liked this place
in our past lives, too.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:09.251
I've been here with a colleague.

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:13.338
Bring up Colleen again

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:14.548
and you're dead meat!

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:17.926
Is Haenal interested in picking
a Chief Justice?

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:21.930
You need some big achievements
to take over Haenal one day.

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:23.515
I'll help you

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:25.600
make Haenal Law Firm yours.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:30.731
I can't believe your audacity.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.401
I don't need your help with that.

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:38.363
But who are we choosing
as the next Chief Justice?

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:43.285
So, you're telling me

00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:46.455
to endorse Mr. Baek Yi-seok
and make him the Chief Justice?

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:54.421
And why should I do that?

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:57.215
That's your chance

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.426
to get Mr. Baek on your side.

00:04:04.222 --> 00:04:05.599
In our past lives

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:08.560
Seon-cheol made Yi-seok
an unprecedentedly big offer

00:04:08.643 --> 00:04:11.313
to make him Haenal's legal advisor.

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:13.565
But he failed.

00:04:14.524 --> 00:04:17.652
"Baek Yi-seok,
Haenal Law Firm's legal advisor."

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:20.280
Isn't that exactly what you want?

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:30.540
Chief Justice Jeon's term began
less than six months ago.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:34.002
You think some online critics

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:35.712
can make the guy resign?

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:37.756
Chief Justice Jeon will resign

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.633
in less than a month.

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:41.843
That's complete nonsense.

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:51.186
How are you so sure of that?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.776
JEON HEUNG-WOO

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:18.964
JUSTICE HWANG DEMANDS CHIEF JUSTICE JEON
TO STOP ABUSING HIS POWER

00:05:19.047 --> 00:05:20.632
Justice Hwang isn't the hero type

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:24.052
to speak out so recklessly.

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:25.512
Why is he doing this?

00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:28.640
Because he wants to be
the next Chief Justice.

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:36.022
Even becoming a Justice was a long shot
for Mr. Hwang.

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:37.107
Doesn't he realize

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.234
the President nominates the Chief Justice?

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:41.445
This is absolutely nonsense.

00:05:41.903 --> 00:05:43.113
What if Mr. Kang Sin-jin

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:45.699
the Senior Presiding Judge
at Seoul Central, endorses him?

00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:50.704
- What?
- Is it still too far-fetched?

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:55.417
Han-young

00:05:57.043 --> 00:05:59.212
you know Mr. Kang?

00:05:59.588 --> 00:06:00.714
Enough to get his help.

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:07.929
You must know very well

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:11.349
that I'd be going against Mr. Kang

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.311
if I were to support Mr. Baek
as the next Chief Justice.

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.358
I can't put Haenal on the line
for this gamble.

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:24.196
You won't ever need to go head-to-head
with Mr. Kang.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.449
Because I'll get rid of Justice Hwang.

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:30.327
All you need to do is
get the President's nomination.

00:06:31.286 --> 00:06:32.454
This is your only chance

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:34.915
to hunt for Mr. Baek,
the Titan of the Judiciary.

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.002
No way!

00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:41.505
Is Dad really eyeing Mr. Baek?

00:06:41.588 --> 00:06:43.798
How did you know? I had no idea.

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:47.969
Because you're on Haenal's side.

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:49.846
What?

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.148
We just had steak...

00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:02.776
How was I supposed to eat
when you dropped that heavy topic?

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:03.860
But you finished it...

00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:06.363
You asked me out first

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:08.073
but didn't even give me time to eat!

00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:10.200
Isn't that a breach of duty?

00:07:10.283 --> 00:07:12.160
- "Duty"?
- Yeah, what else?

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:13.787
It's not like...

00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:17.249
It's not like we were on a date, right?

00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:22.879
We were only having dinner,
me, as the daughter of the firm

00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:25.131
and you, as our future son-in-law
and a judge.

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:39.104
This is your only chance

00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:41.606
to hunt for Mr. Baek,
the Titan of the Judiciary.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.275
Hiring the Prosecutor General

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:47.070
and the Chief Justice as legal advisors?

00:07:47.153 --> 00:07:49.656
Damn, I'm getting spoiled.

00:07:57.497 --> 00:07:58.582
Aren't you going home?

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:02.252
Have a seat.

00:08:09.843 --> 00:08:12.846
How would you feel
about Mr. Baek Yi-seok joining our firm?

00:08:13.513 --> 00:08:14.639
He wouldn't do that.

00:08:14.723 --> 00:08:16.558
He rejected us, even with a massive offer.

00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:19.269
What if we made him the Chief Justice?

00:08:21.062 --> 00:08:22.689
Would he still say no?

00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:25.358
Dad!

00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:43.168
Hey, my Mr. Senior Secretary
for Civil Affairs! You busy?

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:46.630
It's about time we caught up, isn't it?

00:08:46.713 --> 00:08:49.257
For sure. Let's meet.

00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:50.967
Alright, then.

00:08:52.177 --> 00:08:53.803
Let's schedule something soon.

00:09:00.852 --> 00:09:02.979
This is rude.

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:06.274
I know it's strictly business

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.151
but it's still a date.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.364
You can't expect me to chow down on this

00:09:12.572 --> 00:09:13.948
with the sauce all over my face.

00:09:21.247 --> 00:09:22.290
I want to go.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.876
The food is amazing here.

00:09:29.714 --> 00:09:31.049
And

00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:33.760
we can't get the sauce
on your white outfit.

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:36.221
Can't ruin your hair, either.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.849
What are you doing?

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.551
I can wear an apron

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:16.803
without your help.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.271
How did you know my shoe size?

00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:28.398
Why wouldn't I know it?

00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:31.234
I was forced to be your butler
on every shopping trip.

00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:33.027
I could tell by looking at your feet.

00:10:33.862 --> 00:10:34.988
Not bad.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.240
Love the style, too.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:39.284
No, hold up.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.245
How many women have you dated?

00:10:42.328 --> 00:10:44.497
You keep playing games
like there's no tomorrow!

00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:48.126
Are you a player?

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:50.003
Maybe you shouldn't say that out loud.

00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:53.715
It's your fault for listening.

00:11:02.724 --> 00:11:03.767
This is nice.

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:07.353
Everything looks prettier from a distance.

00:11:07.437 --> 00:11:09.355
They all shine.

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:11.649
Everything is prettier from afar.

00:11:11.733 --> 00:11:12.817
I know.

00:11:14.944 --> 00:11:16.946
It's always beautiful from afar

00:11:17.864 --> 00:11:19.491
and tragic

00:11:20.116 --> 00:11:21.159
close up.

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:32.796
Don't become our firm's son-in-law.

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:36.841
Join us as a high-ranking judge one day.

00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.350
You know my family doesn't need

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.143
a husband for me

00:11:48.978 --> 00:11:52.148
but a slave and a puppet for the firm.

00:11:55.068 --> 00:11:57.237
So, leave me when I let you.

00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:01.491
You slapped me on our first date

00:12:01.574 --> 00:12:03.618
and now, you can't even look at me
to end things?

00:12:26.099 --> 00:12:27.100
Well

00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:29.352
you're not my type, anyway.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.364
But I can keep these, right?

00:12:43.408 --> 00:12:44.951
Don't you want Haenal to yourself?

00:12:45.618 --> 00:12:47.412
I told you I'd help you.

00:12:48.705 --> 00:12:50.623
You think I believe that?

00:12:50.707 --> 00:12:51.791
What about me?

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.755
Why don't you try believing in me?

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:04.929
I gave you a chance to leave, okay?

00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:08.600
No, I'm giving you a chance.

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:12.645
In hopes you'll choose
a different life this time.

00:13:28.953 --> 00:13:31.497
Heung-woo will step down soon.

00:13:32.248 --> 00:13:34.876
And I'll get Nam-yong to replace him.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.712
There's no way Nam-yong can become
the Chief Justice

00:13:37.795 --> 00:13:40.131
once Tae-seong is found guilty
for unfair employment.

00:13:40.423 --> 00:13:43.760
Why, then, did Sin-jin tell me
about Tae-seong?

00:13:47.013 --> 00:13:48.139
Mr. Lee

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:49.682
I can't write this article.

00:13:50.683 --> 00:13:51.768
What?

00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:55.188
Why not?

00:13:55.897 --> 00:13:57.315
Why can't you write the article?

00:13:57.398 --> 00:14:00.026
I'm not going to write
a single word for you

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:02.362
until you tell me who you really are.

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:03.780
I told you earlier.

00:14:03.863 --> 00:14:05.698
Lee Han-young, a judge at Seoul Central.

00:14:06.199 --> 00:14:07.241
Chief Judge Baek!

00:14:09.744 --> 00:14:11.663
- You're busted.
- Huh?

00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:13.706
What judge in this world

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.542
busts the Justice Minister nominee
and the Chief Justice?

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:18.461
Sure, let's say you're busting Mr. Hwang

00:14:18.544 --> 00:14:20.380
for your father's revenge.

00:14:20.463 --> 00:14:21.756
But

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:24.092
why did you drag Mr. Woo down?

00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:25.301
Because he's a bad guy?

00:14:25.385 --> 00:14:27.136
Come on.

00:14:27.428 --> 00:14:29.555
- You're not alone, are you?
- What?

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:32.141
The prosecution arrested
Gyo-hun's daughter.

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:34.060
A mere judge can't move the prosecution.

00:14:34.143 --> 00:14:36.354
I'm not that stupid. There's way more.

00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:38.398
You have

00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:40.316
Mr. Baek on your side, don't you?

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.151
You're shocked. I'm definitely right.

00:14:42.235 --> 00:14:43.987
My gosh, I'm right again!

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.531
The draft dodger list
wasn't a coincidence, either, was it?

00:14:46.614 --> 00:14:49.033
Mr. Baek made you move to Seoul

00:14:49.117 --> 00:14:51.160
because he had a plan all along.

00:14:51.828 --> 00:14:52.829
Wow.

00:14:52.996 --> 00:14:54.539
Queen of jumping to conclusions.

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:55.623
You know what?

00:14:55.707 --> 00:14:57.166
I'm getting sad talking about it.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.919
Why would you hide that from me?

00:15:00.003 --> 00:15:01.713
I thought we were close.

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.132
Don't worry.

00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:05.216
I'll zip my lips

00:15:05.675 --> 00:15:08.386
and throw the key away.

00:15:08.469 --> 00:15:10.805
I'll be a shadow for both of you.

00:15:11.472 --> 00:15:13.558
HWANG TAE-SEONG, JUSTICE HWANG'S SON,
UNFAIRLY GETS HIRED BY JB CONSTRUCTION

00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:16.394
JUSTICE HWANG, A HARSH CRITIC
OF CHIEF JUSTICE JEON

00:15:16.477 --> 00:15:18.479
IRONICALLY LOBBIED JB CONSTRUCTION
TO HIRE HIS SON

00:15:30.992 --> 00:15:31.993
Hey!

00:15:32.368 --> 00:15:34.537
Does our website look
like your personal blog?

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:36.247
Get your posts approved first!

00:15:37.123 --> 00:15:39.834
I wasn't the only one tipped off about it.

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:41.085
Had it not been for me

00:15:41.169 --> 00:15:43.546
another reporter would've reported on it
in ten minutes.

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:44.630
What?

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:47.842
You want other reporters to beat me
to the story?

00:15:47.925 --> 00:15:49.260
Na-yeon!

00:15:49.844 --> 00:15:50.845
Yup!

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.514
Gotta go. Bye!

00:15:56.017 --> 00:15:57.560
My gosh.

00:15:57.643 --> 00:16:00.104
Nobody has time to proofread my work
at this hour.

00:16:00.313 --> 00:16:01.314
Ridiculous.

00:16:01.939 --> 00:16:03.524
Should I open my own news agency?

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.279
What's taking him so long?

00:16:08.362 --> 00:16:09.530
Here comes Mr. Hwang!

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:10.656
Justice Hwang

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.493
did you help your son get hired
at JB Daehan?

00:16:13.576 --> 00:16:15.036
Your son worked for ten months

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:17.288
but the job required
three years of experience.

00:16:17.371 --> 00:16:18.873
Do you agree to the allegation?

00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:23.377
DID JUSTICE HWANG PULL STRINGS
TO GET HIS SON A JOB?

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:32.178
Things already went down with Mr. Woo.

00:16:32.261 --> 00:16:34.305
Won't you get in trouble at Suojae

00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:36.808
if there's an issue
with Justice Hwang, too?

00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:38.434
How do you even sleep at night?

00:16:40.853 --> 00:16:41.854
Sorry?

00:16:42.313 --> 00:16:43.898
Your worries are unnecessary.

00:16:45.775 --> 00:16:48.361
Nam-yong will become
the next Chief Justice.

00:16:58.955 --> 00:17:00.206
How did it go?

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:04.710
What?

00:17:13.845 --> 00:17:14.846
Mr. Hwang Tae-seong.

00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:15.930
Yes.

00:17:16.013 --> 00:17:17.014
Get cozy.

00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:19.433
Because it's about to get uncomfortable.

00:17:22.562 --> 00:17:23.813
Did you see the news?

00:17:23.938 --> 00:17:26.732
What should we do?

00:17:27.984 --> 00:17:29.026
Sort it out.

00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:32.363
Can you do that?

00:17:32.947 --> 00:17:35.449
He's the son of the next Chief Justice.

00:17:36.075 --> 00:17:37.451
I wouldn't mess up.

00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:40.163
Okay.

00:17:41.414 --> 00:17:42.957
I'm counting on you.

00:17:46.085 --> 00:17:48.296
Weren't we over already?

00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:51.549
I'd like to pay you back

00:17:51.632 --> 00:17:53.092
for bringing me to Seoul.

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:56.262
There's no need for that.

00:17:56.846 --> 00:17:59.682
You found the list and all, anyway.

00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:04.937
Why did you bring this to me?

00:18:05.021 --> 00:18:07.231
This is beyond my power.

00:18:07.773 --> 00:18:11.110
I thought I could count on you
to guard it better.

00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:14.947
Had it not been for you,
I couldn't have gone through with it.

00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:17.867
I've started yet another thing,
and I need you to see it through.

00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:19.785
What do you mean?

00:18:19.869 --> 00:18:23.456
Chief Justice Jeon will step down soon.

00:18:23.664 --> 00:18:24.665
What?

00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:26.334
Please become the next Chief Justice.

00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:29.712
Look here.

00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:32.048
You can't just become the Chief Justice

00:18:32.506 --> 00:18:34.258
because someone asks you

00:18:34.342 --> 00:18:36.719
or because you want to become one.

00:18:37.136 --> 00:18:38.262
I'm well-aware of that.

00:18:38.346 --> 00:18:40.431
But if you don't step up

00:18:40.973 --> 00:18:43.809
Justice Hwang will become
the next Chief Justice.

00:18:46.604 --> 00:18:47.939
Any Justice is qualified

00:18:48.022 --> 00:18:50.566
to become the Chief Justice.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.151
But not Nam-yong.

00:18:52.735 --> 00:18:56.030
The President wouldn't nominate him
with his son's scandal going on.

00:18:56.656 --> 00:18:59.033
Mr. Kang will get
the President to nominate him.

00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:03.913
Mr. Kang plans to make Mr. Hwang

00:19:03.996 --> 00:19:06.332
his puppet in the Chief Justice position.

00:19:08.417 --> 00:19:10.169
Once Mr. Hwang becomes the Chief Justice

00:19:10.836 --> 00:19:13.214
bus drivers will be fired

00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:14.882
for getting some free coffee

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:17.593
while a prosecutor taking sex bribes

00:19:17.677 --> 00:19:19.929
doesn't even get arrested

00:19:20.012 --> 00:19:21.764
because the bribe is
less than a million won.

00:19:21.847 --> 00:19:23.474
Watch it!

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.601
You left me for Sin-jin

00:19:25.685 --> 00:19:27.561
and now, you want to come back?

00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:29.188
Is this how...

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.154
Hold on.

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:39.407
So, the real reason

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.742
you left me to side with Sin-jin...

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.044
Hello?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.422
Hello.

00:19:54.505 --> 00:19:57.216
I'm Yu Seon-cheol from Haenal Law Firm.

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:06.434
What brings you to call me?

00:20:12.106 --> 00:20:14.442
My daughter is building a great connection

00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:17.194
with Mr. Lee,
the judge with whom you set her up.

00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:19.488
Thanks to you,
I now have a great future son-in-law.

00:20:19.822 --> 00:20:21.574
I'm sorry for thanking you so late.

00:20:23.242 --> 00:20:24.243
Here.

00:20:26.912 --> 00:20:29.957
I heard
Prosecutor General Eom joined Haenal.

00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:33.377
Yes, he's our legal advisor.

00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:34.962
We give him the best deal.

00:20:35.546 --> 00:20:36.589
And thanks to him

00:20:37.131 --> 00:20:39.175
Haenal will become the best in the field.

00:20:39.258 --> 00:20:40.259
Oh, my.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.720
We still have a long way to go.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.890
But we'd certainly become the best
if we got

00:20:45.973 --> 00:20:47.641
the head of the Judiciary with us, too.

00:20:47.933 --> 00:20:49.894
Do you mean Chief Justice Jeon?

00:20:51.604 --> 00:20:53.397
Han-young told me

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.860
Chief Justice Jeon would resign soon.

00:21:00.946 --> 00:21:02.281
And you believe him?

00:21:02.365 --> 00:21:03.657
Look at how things are going.

00:21:03.741 --> 00:21:05.576
I believe him.

00:21:10.164 --> 00:21:11.165
And

00:21:12.249 --> 00:21:15.711
Mr. Jeon isn't the one I want.

00:21:16.921 --> 00:21:18.339
If you'd like

00:21:19.673 --> 00:21:21.300
I could help you get nominated

00:21:23.177 --> 00:21:25.429
as the next Chief Justice.

00:21:46.992 --> 00:21:49.453
Will you let me in
if I put my life on the line?

00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:52.915
Seems like you've already put your life
on the line.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.801
What are you doing?

00:22:04.343 --> 00:22:05.803
I'm busy.

00:22:06.303 --> 00:22:07.304
You getting out?

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.897
Nice car.

00:22:17.356 --> 00:22:18.941
Didn't know judges made a fortune.

00:22:33.164 --> 00:22:34.415
I graduated second in my class.

00:22:34.498 --> 00:22:35.791
Not only am I smart

00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:36.876
but I've also got...

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:38.669
I graduated second in class
from Hanguk Law School.

00:22:39.128 --> 00:22:40.212
Not only am I smart

00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:41.672
but I have one hell of a temper, too.

00:22:41.755 --> 00:22:43.174
You have a hell of a temper, too.

00:22:44.175 --> 00:22:45.176
Did I tell you that?

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:47.219
You didn't need to tell me.

00:22:49.346 --> 00:22:50.681
You have a good eye for people.

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:53.809
Trust this smart prosecutor

00:22:53.893 --> 00:22:55.060
with a hell of a temper.

00:22:55.853 --> 00:22:57.938
I don't care
if he's the beast or the devil.

00:22:58.022 --> 00:23:00.858
I'll arrest him with Tae-sik
and crush them both.

00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:02.234
You might bleed and be crushed

00:23:02.318 --> 00:23:03.944
before you even get to them.

00:23:06.989 --> 00:23:08.991
Tae-sik is the reason
I became a prosecutor.

00:23:09.992 --> 00:23:12.077
I don't care if my skull splits
or my bone breaks.

00:23:13.454 --> 00:23:16.248
I'll arrest him with my own hands
and bring him to trial.

00:23:17.082 --> 00:23:18.792
I should be the judge, then.

00:23:19.668 --> 00:23:21.003
Okay, let's team up.

00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:22.796
You can crush them.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.590
I'll break their necks.

00:23:27.218 --> 00:23:30.471
The devil of the Judiciary
that we're going after is

00:23:32.306 --> 00:23:35.017
the Senior Presiding Judge
at the Seoul Central Court

00:23:39.897 --> 00:23:41.232
Mr. Kang Sin-jin.

00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:45.027
Kang Sin-jin?

00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:08.676
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

00:24:09.468 --> 00:24:11.178
What happened when the world saw

00:24:11.262 --> 00:24:13.264
the video of the big-name CEO doing drugs?

00:24:13.639 --> 00:24:15.558
The whole nation recognized his face

00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:17.685
except for the prosecution.

00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:20.980
When a Governor's son got
five billion won in salary

00:24:21.063 --> 00:24:23.440
the court considered it
to be lacking in reciprocity.

00:24:23.816 --> 00:24:26.443
And Sin-jin has way more than that

00:24:26.777 --> 00:24:29.488
but not even all evidence in the world
is enough to arrest him.

00:24:31.365 --> 00:24:32.491
So, what's your plan?

00:24:33.033 --> 00:24:34.159
Kidnap him?

00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:36.745
I can't torture him
into confessing his illegal deeds.

00:24:40.374 --> 00:24:42.251
Legal or illegal

00:24:42.334 --> 00:24:43.627
I'll find my own way.

00:24:45.129 --> 00:24:46.130
Can you do that?

00:24:54.638 --> 00:24:56.181
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

00:24:58.976 --> 00:25:00.894
Didn't you say you had plans?

00:25:01.312 --> 00:25:02.313
Yeah.

00:25:02.646 --> 00:25:05.107
I'm getting dinner with my parents.

00:25:07.026 --> 00:25:10.321
And your parents live here?

00:25:10.404 --> 00:25:12.823
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

00:25:13.449 --> 00:25:14.533
You think

00:25:14.617 --> 00:25:17.620
judges only come
from the richest areas in Gangnam?

00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:23.000
No, that's not what I mean.

00:25:41.644 --> 00:25:42.686
Hello?

00:25:46.607 --> 00:25:47.775
Do you need help?

00:25:48.525 --> 00:25:50.069
Did your mom tell you to come?

00:25:53.364 --> 00:25:54.406
Well...

00:25:58.786 --> 00:26:01.038
HANDEUL JUNKYARD

00:26:01.121 --> 00:26:03.999
Jin-a, are you really not going in?

00:26:04.083 --> 00:26:05.167
Fine.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.462
Stay here until the trial is over, then.

00:26:09.421 --> 00:26:11.924
Let's get some beef once I'm done.

00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:13.592
Korean beef, your favorite.

00:26:23.477 --> 00:26:24.478
The court hereby orders

00:26:25.562 --> 00:26:27.106
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:26:27.189 --> 00:26:30.734
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

00:26:32.528 --> 00:26:34.279
The Defendant has one week to appeal

00:26:34.363 --> 00:26:37.199
to the court's decision
from the day of the announcement.

00:26:37.783 --> 00:26:39.326
If an appeal is not filed

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.579
the decision will be carried out
as announced.

00:26:44.581 --> 00:26:46.291
He was the boy there.

00:26:57.678 --> 00:26:58.679
Yes?

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.348
So, what's our first task

00:27:01.807 --> 00:27:03.600
legal or illegal?

00:27:07.521 --> 00:27:09.273
You want to try acting?

00:27:09.523 --> 00:27:12.401
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:27:12.568 --> 00:27:15.946
Make sure you're ready.
I'll give you a sign to go.

00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:17.156
Yes, sir.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:20.492
This is

00:27:21.577 --> 00:27:23.620
everything up to the final verdict.

00:27:23.704 --> 00:27:25.539
Just read the script and dismiss the case.

00:27:27.166 --> 00:27:28.834
Let's grab a drink at Manwol after.

00:27:29.793 --> 00:27:30.794
Sure.

00:27:45.434 --> 00:27:48.645
Case Number 2025GD315.

00:27:49.271 --> 00:27:51.064
The court will now deliver the verdict

00:27:51.148 --> 00:27:54.359
on the insurance claim
by Plaintiff Yoon Ji-hye and two others

00:27:54.443 --> 00:27:58.697
against Defendant SIC Life Insurance.

00:28:05.245 --> 00:28:08.916
The facts of the indictment
are established by the following evidence.

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:11.794
BAEK YI-SEOK

00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:20.135
How did it go?

00:28:20.928 --> 00:28:22.888
The Plaintiff's claims were dismissed.

00:28:23.305 --> 00:28:24.473
There's enough room

00:28:24.556 --> 00:28:27.351
for the possibility of the father
to have died in an accident

00:28:27.434 --> 00:28:30.187
but Judge Kim completely eliminated
that option.

00:28:33.607 --> 00:28:35.651
And Haenal is representing the case?

00:28:35.734 --> 00:28:36.777
Yes, sir.

00:28:37.152 --> 00:28:39.196
The document Han-young brought to me

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:41.949
showed Haenal's connection to Sin-jin.

00:28:42.574 --> 00:28:44.201
These jerks!

00:28:45.285 --> 00:28:46.453
It's for sure, then.

00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:03.428
Should we really go forward
with Mr. Hwang?

00:29:04.263 --> 00:29:05.722
His reputation is terrible.

00:29:06.139 --> 00:29:08.308
Endorsing him feels like a waste of money.

00:29:08.684 --> 00:29:10.143
You going to be presumptuous, too?

00:29:13.939 --> 00:29:15.858
I decide if it's a waste.

00:29:20.153 --> 00:29:21.238
Go ahead with the plan.

00:29:21.697 --> 00:29:22.698
Yes, sir.

00:29:36.545 --> 00:29:37.546
Mr. Kang

00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:40.674
it's been dismissed.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.301
Is that right?

00:29:43.552 --> 00:29:44.553
Okay.

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:49.600
Hey

00:29:49.683 --> 00:29:51.894
I hear
the cryptocurrency scammers are in Korea.

00:29:54.438 --> 00:29:56.982
They pay out fake returns
for about three months

00:29:57.065 --> 00:29:58.775
to get you to invest more, right?

00:30:00.903 --> 00:30:04.615
Maybe I can play it safe
and invest for just two months.

00:30:04.698 --> 00:30:05.699
Why not?

00:30:06.116 --> 00:30:07.159
Just two months...

00:30:08.785 --> 00:30:11.246
Hey, I'll call you back.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.372
Okay.

00:30:19.671 --> 00:30:20.672
KIM JIN-A
CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:30:23.425 --> 00:30:26.261
Can't believe she's a prosecutor.

00:30:27.721 --> 00:30:30.349
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:30:38.565 --> 00:30:40.192
- Lunch?
- Can't. I'm on a diet.

00:30:40.275 --> 00:30:42.527
Perfect.
I'm also trying to lose some weight.

00:30:42.611 --> 00:30:44.613
How about some coffee? You down?

00:30:47.574 --> 00:30:50.369
You can't make me do anything anymore.
Don't even try.

00:30:54.831 --> 00:30:56.708
Why are you like that?

00:30:56.792 --> 00:30:58.377
Jin-a arrested Gyo-hun's daughter

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.670
so why can't you tell me?

00:31:00.087 --> 00:31:01.797
Who's that great evil of the Judiciary?

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.131
Oh, that?

00:31:03.674 --> 00:31:05.509
I already told Jin-a who that is.

00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:07.219
What? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:31:09.972 --> 00:31:11.473
Senior Presiding Judge Kang Sin-jin

00:31:12.557 --> 00:31:15.936
at the Seoul Central District Court.

00:31:19.106 --> 00:31:21.692
Was he behind Mr. Kang Jeong-tae's death

00:31:21.775 --> 00:31:23.110
and that attack on me, too?

00:31:23.193 --> 00:31:24.569
It's over now.

00:31:27.155 --> 00:31:29.032
He's a hired murderer for Sin-jin.

00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:33.745
That's not a judge. That's the devil.

00:31:34.496 --> 00:31:36.248
We can't just get him.

00:31:36.957 --> 00:31:38.709
Shouldn't we wear armor or something?

00:31:38.792 --> 00:31:40.043
It's too dangerous.

00:31:40.127 --> 00:31:42.004
That's why I've teamed up with Jin-a.

00:31:42.796 --> 00:31:43.964
We'll break his neck

00:31:44.047 --> 00:31:45.799
before he breaks ours.

00:31:45.882 --> 00:31:47.342
And just how will you do that?

00:31:48.135 --> 00:31:49.177
Are you helping me?

00:31:49.261 --> 00:31:51.263
Didn't you come here to ask me
for help, anyway?

00:31:51.346 --> 00:31:52.347
You okay

00:31:52.723 --> 00:31:53.724
with risking your life?

00:32:10.407 --> 00:32:13.076
TAEGYEONG BIO

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.912
I even used my daughter's tuition
without telling my wife.

00:32:16.788 --> 00:32:18.206
This can't be real.

00:32:19.666 --> 00:32:20.667
Oh?

00:32:21.126 --> 00:32:22.252
Mr. Lee?

00:32:22.335 --> 00:32:23.920
Oh, hey, Mr. Park.

00:32:24.796 --> 00:32:25.797
Nice seeing you!

00:32:26.798 --> 00:32:29.342
Didn't expect to see you here.
I only ever see you in court.

00:32:29.718 --> 00:32:32.220
I was watching you there.
You looked like a pro.

00:32:32.304 --> 00:32:33.597
Are you going pro soon?

00:32:34.556 --> 00:32:36.725
I've been playing golf for a decade now.

00:32:37.267 --> 00:32:38.268
You any good?

00:32:38.351 --> 00:32:39.895
I'm a golf noob.

00:32:39.978 --> 00:32:41.730
- What?
- A newbie at golf.

00:32:43.523 --> 00:32:45.192
Not a boob. A noob.

00:32:53.158 --> 00:32:54.868
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

00:32:58.622 --> 00:32:59.956
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

00:33:00.499 --> 00:33:02.667
Hey, I'll call you back.

00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:03.752
Okay.

00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:11.426
Here's your coffee, sir.

00:33:13.762 --> 00:33:15.430
This little brat.

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:18.600
What's wrong?

00:33:19.601 --> 00:33:21.937
She's a colleague,
and she won't leave me alone.

00:33:23.188 --> 00:33:24.773
I don't mean to snoop

00:33:25.357 --> 00:33:27.442
but is she begging for your love?

00:33:27.776 --> 00:33:30.112
Begging for my love? I wish.

00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:32.239
It's nothing like that.

00:33:32.322 --> 00:33:33.323
Come on.

00:33:37.035 --> 00:33:38.954
International investment scams are

00:33:39.037 --> 00:33:40.038
in Gangnam now.

00:33:40.122 --> 00:33:42.791
And she wants to invest some money
into their scheme.

00:33:42.874 --> 00:33:45.919
Can't believe
how greedy this young one is.

00:33:47.504 --> 00:33:48.505
Wait.

00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:52.092
How can you scam the scammers?

00:33:52.425 --> 00:33:53.426
Here's how.

00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:56.513
Before they run away with your money

00:33:57.055 --> 00:33:59.766
they build trust with you
by paying you all the interest

00:34:00.225 --> 00:34:01.726
for about three months.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:02.894
So, take your money out

00:34:02.978 --> 00:34:05.063
before they run away with it,
and you earn money.

00:34:05.605 --> 00:34:06.982
It's a 10% return per month.

00:34:08.817 --> 00:34:10.110
10%?

00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:23.665
How did it go?

00:34:28.795 --> 00:34:31.173
He was ready to invest immediately.

00:34:32.007 --> 00:34:33.633
Don't make me do this again, alright?

00:34:33.884 --> 00:34:37.345
Seong-dae's loan began to snowball around
this time due to stocks.

00:34:37.804 --> 00:34:39.347
He'll bite the bait soon enough.

00:34:40.056 --> 00:34:42.726
SEONHWAGAK

00:34:48.356 --> 00:34:49.900
I want to know why you gave me

00:34:49.983 --> 00:34:51.860
Tae-seong's job application scores.

00:34:58.575 --> 00:35:00.076
Justice Hwang Nam-yong.

00:35:02.078 --> 00:35:04.331
It was the first time you asked me
for anything.

00:35:04.414 --> 00:35:05.498
I had to get it for you.

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.918
Once Tae-seong gets arrested

00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:11.338
it'll be hard for Justice Hwang
to become the Chief Justice.

00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:12.881
That could be true.

00:35:16.593 --> 00:35:17.761
No.

00:35:17.844 --> 00:35:20.722
There's no way Sin-jin will give up
on Nam-yong.

00:35:21.431 --> 00:35:22.641
How does it feel

00:35:22.724 --> 00:35:25.435
watching a Justice being chased
by the press?

00:35:26.478 --> 00:35:27.604
Do you feel satisfied?

00:35:28.355 --> 00:35:29.689
It's only the beginning.

00:35:30.065 --> 00:35:31.066
That's right.

00:35:31.358 --> 00:35:33.735
Forget your benefactors,
but never forget your enemies.

00:35:34.444 --> 00:35:36.029
If you forget who helped you

00:35:36.112 --> 00:35:38.073
you'll just be called a jerk.

00:35:38.156 --> 00:35:40.492
But you forget your enemy,
and you'll fall again.

00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:51.002
But are you sure you can handle it?

00:35:51.086 --> 00:35:52.587
I have to do whatever it takes

00:35:52.671 --> 00:35:54.631
to make Nam-yong the Chief Justice.

00:35:55.382 --> 00:35:57.759
However it ends, you'll be happy.

00:35:59.177 --> 00:36:00.262
If I succeed

00:36:00.762 --> 00:36:03.056
you'll be proud of me
for the successful revenge.

00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:04.891
If I fail

00:36:05.725 --> 00:36:07.018
you'll gain

00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:09.729
the Chief Justice on your side.

00:36:10.397 --> 00:36:11.773
Is that how it is?

00:36:14.359 --> 00:36:16.194
I guess that's fun both ways.

00:36:43.263 --> 00:36:45.682
You cast the bait yourself

00:36:45.765 --> 00:36:47.684
so hunt him yourself, too.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.062
Transfer to the Criminal Division
and take Tae-seong's case.

00:36:51.813 --> 00:36:52.814
Sorry?

00:36:53.148 --> 00:36:54.983
Why? You don't want to do that?

00:36:56.026 --> 00:36:57.068
No.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.488
I'll do my best

00:37:00.947 --> 00:37:02.324
in whatever you tell me to do.

00:37:02.949 --> 00:37:03.950
Okay.

00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:07.162
Let's both do our best for our goals.

00:37:31.019 --> 00:37:32.312
Did he see me?

00:37:39.319 --> 00:37:40.820
The guy you were with earlier.

00:37:42.989 --> 00:37:44.115
Is that the guy?

00:37:48.244 --> 00:37:49.579
Mr. Lee?

00:37:52.415 --> 00:37:53.708
Change of plans.

00:37:55.543 --> 00:37:57.504
You won't see him again.

00:38:01.424 --> 00:38:02.425
Yes, sir.

00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:16.189
What are you doing?

00:38:17.107 --> 00:38:18.108
Welcome.

00:38:18.191 --> 00:38:20.527
Why are you welcoming me at my own store?

00:38:22.987 --> 00:38:24.239
What's there to see?

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.534
Na-yeong has midterms.

00:38:28.785 --> 00:38:30.161
Wow.

00:38:30.703 --> 00:38:31.746
She's studying hard.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:33.623
Oh, my stomach!

00:38:33.706 --> 00:38:34.874
Gosh, it hurts so much.

00:38:35.792 --> 00:38:38.420
It's from the samgak gimbap
I bought at this store.

00:38:39.045 --> 00:38:41.714
I think they sell expired food.

00:38:43.049 --> 00:38:44.801
I'm just here for some cigs.

00:38:47.345 --> 00:38:48.763
- Quit smoking.
- What?

00:38:48.847 --> 00:38:49.931
Just quit.

00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:52.350
Don't smoke.

00:38:52.434 --> 00:38:55.145
"It kills you and those around you."

00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:57.814
Well

00:38:57.939 --> 00:38:59.774
if you insist you want to die

00:38:59.858 --> 00:39:00.942
I can help you with that.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.446
He's a really scary guy.

00:39:04.529 --> 00:39:05.530
Look at his big guns.

00:39:05.613 --> 00:39:08.783
They're so big
that he can't even roll up his sleeves.

00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:13.204
I'll quit smoking.

00:39:14.205 --> 00:39:15.707
- You'd better.
- Yes, sir.

00:39:16.207 --> 00:39:17.208
Goodnight.

00:39:17.667 --> 00:39:18.710
Good luck!

00:39:25.216 --> 00:39:27.427
- Thank you for coming.
- It was great.

00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:31.014
Thank you! Come again.

00:39:31.097 --> 00:39:32.390
- Jeong-ho!
- Huh?

00:39:32.474 --> 00:39:34.100
- Water.
- Can't you read the sign?

00:39:34.184 --> 00:39:35.768
"Please get your own water."

00:39:35.852 --> 00:39:37.228
You were too spoiled growing up.

00:39:39.105 --> 00:39:40.773
Hey, I'm heading out for a delivery.

00:39:40.857 --> 00:39:44.235
Okay! I'm taking
all the cash you make today.

00:39:44.319 --> 00:39:45.320
Are you stupid?

00:39:45.403 --> 00:39:47.363
Everyone pays with cards. There's no cash.

00:39:47.447 --> 00:39:48.448
Gosh, you dummy.

00:39:49.365 --> 00:39:51.034
That's what I'm saying!

00:39:53.077 --> 00:39:54.746
You stupid or what?

00:39:55.038 --> 00:39:56.915
How are you a building owner
with that brain?

00:39:57.707 --> 00:39:58.708
You want to know?

00:39:59.584 --> 00:40:00.585
Want me to tell you?

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:20.021
I bought the building
with the money I earned with hard work.

00:40:24.234 --> 00:40:26.152
I don't need a building.

00:40:30.782 --> 00:40:31.783
Fly!

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:38.873
What are you doing?

00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:41.668
Pick them up right now!

00:40:41.751 --> 00:40:42.794
Fly!

00:40:43.253 --> 00:40:44.295
Fly!

00:40:44.379 --> 00:40:45.922
CLOSED FOR THE DAY
THANK YOU

00:40:54.222 --> 00:40:55.765
I just realized

00:40:56.849 --> 00:41:00.103
my fingers' nerves are connected
to my wrists.

00:41:03.064 --> 00:41:05.233
What a pathetic neural network.

00:41:05.316 --> 00:41:06.568
It's okay.

00:41:06.651 --> 00:41:09.028
A judge just needs to talk.
You don't need hands.

00:41:09.737 --> 00:41:10.738
Hey!

00:41:11.239 --> 00:41:12.615
No job requires

00:41:12.699 --> 00:41:15.326
more reading and writing
than being a judge.

00:41:15.868 --> 00:41:17.870
Really? That's too bad.

00:41:18.121 --> 00:41:19.122
Good luck!

00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:21.958
Man, that hurts.

00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:28.172
Oh, my.

00:41:28.256 --> 00:41:30.216
I can't believe you did the dishes.

00:41:31.676 --> 00:41:33.845
Are you sure this is okay?

00:41:33.928 --> 00:41:35.763
Of course. Hand it over already.

00:41:35.847 --> 00:41:37.890
Okay, this is for me.

00:41:39.601 --> 00:41:41.603
Let's see.

00:41:47.317 --> 00:41:48.318
Wow!

00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:51.988
The minimum wage is
finally 10,000 won per hour!

00:41:53.364 --> 00:41:54.365
Here.

00:41:54.866 --> 00:41:57.910
The minimum wage in 2025 is 10,030 won.

00:41:57.994 --> 00:42:00.705
You worked for two hours,
which means you get 20,060 won.

00:42:00.788 --> 00:42:01.789
Here.

00:42:04.584 --> 00:42:06.461
- Give me my money.
- Treat yourself.

00:42:06.544 --> 00:42:08.087
Preferably at my convenience store.

00:42:10.673 --> 00:42:12.258
I can't use this precious money.

00:42:12.342 --> 00:42:14.427
Really? I'll use it, then.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.137
Stop it before I break your wrist.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.389
You can't even use yours right now.

00:42:18.973 --> 00:42:20.558
Here. Just have some sundae.

00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:22.101
Open up.

00:42:22.352 --> 00:42:23.353
Good boy!

00:42:26.314 --> 00:42:27.565
- Give me some soju.
- Soju?

00:42:27.649 --> 00:42:28.650
Soju.

00:42:28.733 --> 00:42:29.984
Here, Your Honor.

00:42:30.068 --> 00:42:31.569
Delicious, huh?

00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:34.572
Hey (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:42:35.698 --> 00:42:37.617
the stage and the actors are all ready.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.868
When's the show happening?

00:42:41.913 --> 00:42:43.164
Soon!

00:42:43.247 --> 00:42:47.752
MIRACLE ASIA 2025 GLOBAL INVESTMENT EVENT

00:42:51.631 --> 00:42:52.632
There he is.

00:42:57.178 --> 00:43:00.890
MIRACLE ASIA 2025 GLOBAL INVESTMENT EVENT

00:43:04.852 --> 00:43:06.437
Hi, everyone!

00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:08.815
My name is Brian.

00:43:10.942 --> 00:43:11.943
I'm

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:13.861
Brian.

00:43:14.737 --> 00:43:17.365
I'm the man

00:43:18.032 --> 00:43:20.993
who will make you

00:43:21.452 --> 00:43:22.787
rich.

00:43:28.084 --> 00:43:29.252
Brian?

00:43:29.335 --> 00:43:30.795
Rich, my ass.

00:43:31.212 --> 00:43:34.173
You all get scammed
because you want free money.

00:43:36.968 --> 00:43:38.803
Sounds good, right?

00:43:38.886 --> 00:43:40.972
Hey, that's Ms. Yu Se-hee
of Haenal Law Firm.

00:43:41.055 --> 00:43:42.974
Yeah, the girl who slapped that judge.

00:43:43.516 --> 00:43:45.393
This must be a legitimate thing

00:43:45.476 --> 00:43:47.437
if someone from Haenal is here, right?

00:43:49.355 --> 00:43:50.690
Why not?

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:54.736
What's wrong with Asia?

00:43:54.819 --> 00:43:57.864
Over four billion people go nuts

00:43:57.947 --> 00:44:01.284
for K-pop, K-drama, and K-food!

00:44:01.367 --> 00:44:02.452
Absolutely nuts!

00:44:02.535 --> 00:44:03.745
Oh, nuts. I'm sorry.

00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:06.330
How should I put it?

00:44:06.414 --> 00:44:07.999
- Is it going well?
- If not Asia

00:44:08.082 --> 00:44:09.876
the continent

00:44:09.959 --> 00:44:11.711
the world is raving about now

00:44:11.794 --> 00:44:14.088
where would you invest in?

00:44:14.172 --> 00:44:15.173
Right?

00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:16.466
- Brian!
- Brian!

00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:21.554
- Brian, Brian!
- Brian, Brian!

00:44:22.972 --> 00:44:23.973
What the hell is this?

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.933
You want me to invest in this?

00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:27.351
Just stay there for a bit.

00:44:28.561 --> 00:44:31.189
You need to do this
to bring Yi-seok to Haenal.

00:44:31.272 --> 00:44:34.025
Long time ago

00:44:34.108 --> 00:44:36.652
there was the Silk Road

00:44:36.736 --> 00:44:39.447
to make people rich. But now

00:44:40.031 --> 00:44:43.701
you have the Miracle A-Token Road!

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.501
All you need is to get ready.

00:44:51.584 --> 00:44:52.585
To be rich!

00:44:52.668 --> 00:44:54.629
So many reporters are here, too.

00:44:54.712 --> 00:44:57.173
I'd better invest some money
before everyone else does.

00:44:57.256 --> 00:44:58.299
Same.

00:44:58.382 --> 00:44:59.926
- Where is he?
- Excuse me!

00:45:02.845 --> 00:45:03.846
As you can see

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.849
we're developing a cryptocurrency
that four billion people will use.

00:45:06.933 --> 00:45:10.436
We guarantee 10% in return every month.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.896
So, within a year...

00:45:12.438 --> 00:45:13.856
- You sure about the 10%?
- Yes.

00:45:17.068 --> 00:45:18.611
- Hey.
- Hey, Han-young.

00:45:19.237 --> 00:45:20.988
Seong-dae was here just now

00:45:21.072 --> 00:45:22.615
but only invested 100 million won.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.409
Isn't that too little for a guy
who has three billion won?

00:45:25.493 --> 00:45:26.911
Or did we just not do a good job?

00:45:26.994 --> 00:45:28.329
He's very careful.

00:45:28.412 --> 00:45:30.498
Send him 10% in profit when I tell you to.

00:45:30.998 --> 00:45:32.375
He'll fall for it right away.

00:45:33.251 --> 00:45:36.462
First, I changed Mr. Hwang's car

00:45:36.546 --> 00:45:38.297
to a used compact sedan.

00:45:38.923 --> 00:45:41.592
And I'm looking for a humble home
near Sinyeong-dong.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.971
It's taking some time to find
the donation recipient

00:45:45.054 --> 00:45:48.891
that'll lie about Mr. Hwang having donated
to them for five years.

00:45:50.434 --> 00:45:52.228
Donate 300 million won. Don't be late.

00:45:53.062 --> 00:45:54.272
Yes, Mr. Kang.

00:45:57.441 --> 00:45:58.776
You having a good day?

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.781
We're preparing a future Chief Justice.

00:46:04.532 --> 00:46:05.533
I'm just nervous.

00:46:07.326 --> 00:46:08.578
No need to be nervous.

00:46:10.037 --> 00:46:11.038
Don't mess up.

00:46:11.455 --> 00:46:12.498
Yes, sir.

00:46:20.423 --> 00:46:23.676
Case Number 2025GD2203.

00:46:23.759 --> 00:46:26.095
We'll now begin the trial
for Defendant Hwang Tae-seong

00:46:26.178 --> 00:46:28.931
on charges of obstruction of business
and document forgery.

00:46:39.108 --> 00:46:40.776
JUSTICE HWANG NAM-YONG

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:47.867
JUSTICE HWANG NAM-YONG

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.286
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

00:46:52.914 --> 00:46:55.291
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:46:59.629 --> 00:47:02.340
Your call cannot be completed.
Please leave a message...

00:47:13.726 --> 00:47:15.770
PARKING SPOT FOR JUSTICE

00:47:38.918 --> 00:47:42.964
BOSS

00:47:43.255 --> 00:47:45.216
You wrote the article on Tae-seong.

00:47:45.299 --> 00:47:47.009
Why don't you want to attend his trial?

00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.845
Why would I go there on a day like today?

00:47:49.929 --> 00:47:51.472
What am I, an amateur?

00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:52.974
What?

00:47:53.516 --> 00:47:54.767
Where are you now, then?

00:47:55.851 --> 00:47:57.979
Investigate first, report later.

00:47:58.062 --> 00:47:59.730
I'll report it to you later.

00:48:02.817 --> 00:48:05.695
Where is Justice Hwang going

00:48:05.778 --> 00:48:07.530
when his son is in trial?

00:48:12.743 --> 00:48:15.371
Kim Yun-cheol will be the next President.

00:48:16.122 --> 00:48:17.957
The screening for the next cabinet is

00:48:18.624 --> 00:48:20.292
already underway.

00:48:25.089 --> 00:48:29.301
I acquired a Canadian mining company.

00:48:29.385 --> 00:48:31.637
The plan is to invest 100 billion won
from my group.

00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:33.848
If there's no profit in a year

00:48:33.931 --> 00:48:35.224
it'll go bankrupt

00:48:35.307 --> 00:48:36.684
wasting 100 billion won.

00:48:38.644 --> 00:48:40.396
Recommend me
a Commissioner of the National Tax Service

00:48:40.479 --> 00:48:42.440
and a Trade, Industry,
and Resources Minister.

00:48:42.523 --> 00:48:46.152
And the Environment and Labor Minister.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.863
My, my.

00:48:50.573 --> 00:48:52.074
You get more greedy with age.

00:48:52.158 --> 00:48:53.826
That greed got you

00:48:53.909 --> 00:48:56.495
in that very seat, didn't it?

00:48:57.204 --> 00:48:59.165
All the power goes to you

00:48:59.248 --> 00:49:02.084
and all the money to me, Jang Yong-hyeon.

00:49:02.168 --> 00:49:05.212
That very greed created our Suojae.

00:49:05.296 --> 00:49:06.922
My gosh, Mr. Jang.

00:49:07.506 --> 00:49:08.924
Fine, then.

00:49:10.009 --> 00:49:12.344
You can choose
up to the Environment and Labor Minister.

00:49:13.637 --> 00:49:14.805
I wouldn't ask for more.

00:49:27.651 --> 00:49:29.945
I can't trust Mr. Kang.

00:49:30.279 --> 00:49:31.989
He told me not to worry at all

00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:33.574
but he's ignoring all my calls!

00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:35.493
I don't understand

00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:36.994
where this is going at all.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.538
No need to understand it.

00:49:40.623 --> 00:49:41.624
Sorry?

00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:44.085
If Sin-jin says it'll be done,
it'll be done.

00:49:45.377 --> 00:49:46.754
Since you're here

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.716
just have some tea.

00:50:31.715 --> 00:50:34.677
Defendant Hwang Tae-seong applied to work

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.346
at JB Daehan Construction
on October 14, 2024

00:50:37.429 --> 00:50:40.266
with fake work experience
in his application.

00:50:40.808 --> 00:50:42.393
Therefore, the Defendant

00:50:42.476 --> 00:50:46.355
obstructed the company's business
with fraudulent information.

00:50:48.107 --> 00:50:51.193
Why did Sin-jin really leave me
to take Tae-seong's case?

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:54.738
Is Sin-jin the only one

00:50:55.531 --> 00:50:57.867
who wants Nam-yong to become
the Chief Justice?

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.622
Hey.

00:51:06.584 --> 00:51:07.585
Hey

00:51:08.627 --> 00:51:10.212
what's your plan now?

00:51:11.213 --> 00:51:13.340
- With what?
- What else?

00:51:13.799 --> 00:51:15.467
Justice Hwang's son's life is

00:51:15.551 --> 00:51:17.178
right in your hands.

00:51:17.887 --> 00:51:20.431
It's like you won the lottery.

00:51:21.432 --> 00:51:22.641
I can't believe you.

00:51:23.392 --> 00:51:24.393
Hey

00:51:24.935 --> 00:51:25.936
did he not call you?

00:51:28.063 --> 00:51:29.064
He did, didn't he?

00:51:30.065 --> 00:51:32.401
He definitely called you.

00:51:33.027 --> 00:51:34.278
So, what's in it for you?

00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:35.696
You haven't had lunch, right?

00:51:35.779 --> 00:51:37.364
Why don't we talk over lunch?

00:51:37.865 --> 00:51:39.867
Do you still not have a lunch buddy here?

00:51:43.245 --> 00:51:46.373
I have many. I have them lined up!

00:51:47.249 --> 00:51:50.502
Isn't it so nice of me to visit you
for old time's sake?

00:51:54.673 --> 00:51:56.842
You can stop shaving that.

00:51:56.926 --> 00:51:59.053
Don't be so old.
I'll buy you a mechanical pencil.

00:52:00.846 --> 00:52:03.015
You know what gets longer,
the more you shave?

00:52:06.518 --> 00:52:08.395
What are you even talking about?

00:52:08.771 --> 00:52:10.022
What, the pencil lead?

00:52:10.564 --> 00:52:11.565
Correct!

00:52:11.941 --> 00:52:13.776
It's for you. Take it and go.

00:52:23.994 --> 00:52:24.995
Hey

00:52:25.287 --> 00:52:26.580
you can have all of these.

00:52:26.997 --> 00:52:28.249
I'll stick to mechanical.

00:52:29.416 --> 00:52:30.459
Gosh.

00:52:41.345 --> 00:52:44.848
The lead paradoxically becomes longer
the more it's shaved

00:52:44.932 --> 00:52:47.059
because the secret is
that shaving it is different

00:52:47.142 --> 00:52:49.353
from it getting longer.

00:52:51.814 --> 00:52:54.858
It's also a paradox
that Sin-jin threw Tae-seong at me

00:52:54.942 --> 00:52:57.987
when he wants to make Nam-yong
the Chief Justice.

00:52:58.821 --> 00:53:02.408
And I must find the answer in it.

00:53:06.161 --> 00:53:08.122
TAEGYEONG BIO

00:53:08.205 --> 00:53:09.707
MARKET VALUE: 137,352,000 WON

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.417
58,200 WON PER UNIT

00:53:25.931 --> 00:53:28.600
I hear Taegyeong Bio is
at the brink of delisting.

00:53:28.684 --> 00:53:30.894
Mr. Lee also told me
to buy some shares for it.

00:53:30.978 --> 00:53:32.021
Did you?

00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:34.523
I'm barely paying my mortgage on time.

00:53:34.606 --> 00:53:36.275
TAEGYEONG BIO,
FOUND TO BE A WITHDRAWN COMPANY

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.071
Send Mr. Lee

00:53:41.155 --> 00:53:43.115
10 million won in 30 minutes.

00:53:43.991 --> 00:53:45.200
"Trading suspended"?

00:53:45.909 --> 00:53:46.952
The market value...

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:50.331
No!

00:53:50.414 --> 00:53:51.415
TRADING SUSPENDED

00:53:51.498 --> 00:53:52.499
No!

00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:53.667
My 400 million won!

00:53:53.751 --> 00:53:54.918
TAEGYEONG BIO DELISTED

00:53:55.878 --> 00:53:57.046
How do I tell my wife?

00:53:58.881 --> 00:54:00.966
That's our daughter's tuition.

00:54:04.636 --> 00:54:05.971
WIFE

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.770
Hey.

00:54:12.853 --> 00:54:15.898
You know Seon-yeong's allowance
and tuition for next month?

00:54:15.981 --> 00:54:18.776
Why don't we send the money in advance
when the dollar is cheaper?

00:54:19.318 --> 00:54:22.071
You called me mid-day
just because the dollar is cheap?

00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:24.073
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

00:54:29.578 --> 00:54:31.080
Oh, no.

00:54:31.955 --> 00:54:33.332
You're calling again?

00:54:33.415 --> 00:54:34.750
MIRACLE ASIA (SCAM)

00:54:39.046 --> 00:54:40.172
Hello?

00:54:40.923 --> 00:54:43.050
Hello, Mr. Lee Seong-dae.

00:54:43.133 --> 00:54:44.676
I'm calling from Miracle Asia.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.304
I'm calling about the profit you made
earlier than expected.

00:54:47.388 --> 00:54:48.389
Sorry?

00:54:48.639 --> 00:54:50.432
We'll send you the money right now.

00:54:50.516 --> 00:54:51.517
Good luck! (Support Admin Watch on

ACCOUNT BALANCE: 2.9 BILLION WON

00:55:21.713 --> 00:55:22.965
Yeah

00:55:23.048 --> 00:55:25.050
there's always a way out.

00:55:26.135 --> 00:55:28.846
10% of 3 billion won is
300 million won a month

00:55:28.929 --> 00:55:30.264
and 600 million in two.

00:55:30.347 --> 00:55:32.683
That makes up for the 400 million I lost
from investing

00:55:32.766 --> 00:55:34.059
and still leaves 200 million.

00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:37.271
I can just borrow money for a month

Hello, Mr. Park.

00:55:46.613 --> 00:55:48.157
What brings you all the way here?

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.241
Here, have some coffee.

00:55:50.701 --> 00:55:51.743
Well

00:55:53.162 --> 00:55:56.915
about the foreign cryptocurrency fraud
you mentioned last time.

00:55:56.999 --> 00:55:58.000
Yeah?

00:55:59.001 --> 00:56:01.837
I have some money to spare.

00:56:03.172 --> 00:56:04.173
Mr. Park.

00:56:04.256 --> 00:56:05.966
- You can't do that!
- What?

00:56:06.467 --> 00:56:08.010
I'd suggest you not get into that.

00:56:08.093 --> 00:56:10.762
There's no way you can handle
whatever issue this may cause.

00:56:10.846 --> 00:56:13.182
It's really not that much.

00:56:13.765 --> 00:56:17.019
I won't blame you,
not even if I lose all my money.

00:56:17.102 --> 00:56:19.354
Just shoot me a text

00:56:19.813 --> 00:56:21.315
before you get those guys.

00:56:22.441 --> 00:56:25.152
I can't give out details
on an ongoing investigation...

00:56:25.235 --> 00:56:27.029
I won't ever mention your name

00:56:27.112 --> 00:56:29.990
not even if my life depends on it.

00:56:30.407 --> 00:56:31.408
Please?

00:56:33.952 --> 00:56:35.329
Do you need the money that bad?

00:56:42.044 --> 00:56:44.087
I told him we'd strike in about two months

00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:45.881
and promised to give him a heads-up.

00:56:46.465 --> 00:56:47.549
Good work.

00:56:48.717 --> 00:56:50.010
Mr. Lee, look at this.

00:56:53.639 --> 00:56:54.640
Suojae?

00:56:55.432 --> 00:56:57.684
This was where Nam-yong went?

00:56:57.768 --> 00:57:00.521
Yeah, but that's not all.

00:57:00.604 --> 00:57:02.940
I checked the owner of the vehicle
leaving here

00:57:03.398 --> 00:57:05.108
and it was Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon.

00:57:05.901 --> 00:57:08.487
And he took a bag out of that car.

00:57:08.987 --> 00:57:09.988
What do you think it has?

00:57:10.072 --> 00:57:11.073
Money, probably?

00:57:14.326 --> 00:57:15.827
Do you know who lives here?

00:57:17.246 --> 00:57:18.914
Of course.

00:57:19.831 --> 00:57:22.459
I looked into it on my way here.

00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:30.259
Don't pass out from shock or anything.

00:57:30.342 --> 00:57:31.343
Okay.

00:57:33.595 --> 00:57:35.180
The former President

00:57:36.056 --> 00:57:37.516
Mr. Park Gwang-to.

00:57:42.729 --> 00:57:43.772
Wow.

00:57:57.411 --> 00:57:59.246
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:57:59.955 --> 00:58:02.082
You have no idea how shocked I was.

00:58:02.541 --> 00:58:04.543
This is something I didn't know
in my past life.

00:58:04.835 --> 00:58:08.380
Mr. Park Gwang-to, the former President,
had Sin-jin's back all along!

00:58:12.884 --> 00:58:13.885
By the way

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.472
can I write an article about this...

00:58:17.556 --> 00:58:18.890
Let's keep it a secret for now.

00:58:29.401 --> 00:58:32.070
SECRETARY KIM, FUTURE TALENTS FOUNDATION

00:58:32.237 --> 00:58:33.238
Hello?

00:58:33.322 --> 00:58:35.073
Hello, Mr. Lee.

00:58:35.365 --> 00:58:37.618
I'm the secretary
at the Future Talents Foundation.

00:58:38.785 --> 00:58:41.413
It's about the donation
you mentioned last time.

00:58:41.496 --> 00:58:44.082
I can tweak the ledger a bit

00:58:44.166 --> 00:58:46.543
and change the donation period
to five years.

00:58:47.753 --> 00:58:48.754
Really?

00:58:48.837 --> 00:58:51.923
You'll be donating 300 million won, right?

00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:53.967
Yeah, sure.

00:58:54.259 --> 00:58:55.510
Yes, 300 million won.

00:58:57.346 --> 00:58:59.306
Get the Investigation Task Force ready.

00:59:05.562 --> 00:59:06.730
You wanted to see me?

00:59:07.439 --> 00:59:09.650
Weren't you scared

00:59:09.733 --> 00:59:12.319
knowing Hee-young's father was
the Justice Minister nominee?

00:59:13.570 --> 00:59:14.738
It was your order.

00:59:14.821 --> 00:59:16.073
Of course, I'd follow it.

00:59:19.534 --> 00:59:20.535
Come with me.

00:59:20.744 --> 00:59:23.163
I'll put your name
on the case report, too.

00:59:26.958 --> 00:59:27.959
What?

00:59:30.337 --> 00:59:32.297
Where are we going?

00:59:32.714 --> 00:59:33.840
To Gangnam.

00:59:33.924 --> 00:59:36.343
I was tipped off
about Asian investment frauds.

00:59:36.927 --> 00:59:38.220
They're from Miracle Asia.

00:59:39.304 --> 00:59:41.431
They've even held
an investment seminar already.

00:59:42.641 --> 00:59:43.809
Why are you so surprised?

00:59:45.602 --> 00:59:47.688
I just can't believe
people still pull that trick.

00:59:48.021 --> 00:59:49.856
Money drives the world.

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:51.441
New ones will keep coming.

00:59:52.234 --> 00:59:53.235
Right.

00:59:58.281 --> 00:59:59.408
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

01:00:00.784 --> 01:00:01.952
CALLING JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

01:00:03.537 --> 01:00:05.539
We'll be there in about ten.

01:00:06.832 --> 01:00:08.166
Arriving in ten.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.251
Get ready.

01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:10.669
Yes, sir.

01:00:14.297 --> 01:00:16.466
We have nine more minutes to go.

01:00:20.303 --> 01:00:21.346
Hey, Jeong-ho.

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.639
What? The prosecution?

01:00:23.181 --> 01:00:24.182
Right now?

01:00:39.698 --> 01:00:41.491
Come sooner, Seong-dae.

01:00:41.575 --> 01:00:43.285
My Seong-dae.

01:01:12.481 --> 01:01:14.191
What the hell is he doing?

01:01:28.872 --> 01:01:30.957
Just let him go.

01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:32.417
Is he drunk or something?

01:01:45.806 --> 01:01:47.182
Oh, my neck!

01:01:47.974 --> 01:01:49.476
Are you kidding me?

01:01:49.559 --> 01:01:51.269
I told you to just let him go!

01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:53.647
How dare that bastard get in my way?

01:01:56.107 --> 01:01:58.193
Did you learn to drive on Mario Kart?

01:01:58.610 --> 01:01:59.611
Hey!

01:01:59.694 --> 01:02:01.863
Did you learn to drive on Mario Kart?

01:02:01.947 --> 01:02:03.907
You think
the blinkers make everything okay?

01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:05.659
Are you okay?

01:02:05.951 --> 01:02:07.035
Of course.

01:02:09.246 --> 01:02:10.247
"Of course"?

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.374
You're kidding me!

01:02:12.457 --> 01:02:14.543
The world doesn't need any of this!

01:02:14.626 --> 01:02:16.211
No need to get that insulting.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.381
So what?

01:02:19.464 --> 01:02:20.507
- Huh?
- What?

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:22.384
Watch your language, alright?

01:02:22.467 --> 01:02:24.177
- Did you just cuss?
- Hey!

01:02:24.261 --> 01:02:25.846
Let's just get going, okay?

01:02:25.929 --> 01:02:27.347
No, just stay in your seat!

01:02:28.348 --> 01:02:29.850
I'll take care of it myself.

01:02:30.976 --> 01:02:31.977
Get in.

01:02:35.188 --> 01:02:36.773
What were you thinking?

01:02:37.858 --> 01:02:38.942
Wow.

01:02:39.025 --> 01:02:41.903
They were right about her being a witch.

01:02:43.864 --> 01:02:46.241
We don't have time for this!

01:02:51.454 --> 01:02:53.415
Hello, are you Mr. Lee Seong-dae?

01:02:53.498 --> 01:02:54.708
- Yes.
- This way, please.

01:02:58.128 --> 01:02:59.129
Come in.

01:03:01.131 --> 01:03:02.632
- Hello.
- Oh, my!

01:03:03.174 --> 01:03:05.093
- Hello, sir.
- Here comes our investor.

01:03:05.176 --> 01:03:06.803
- How have you been?
- I've been well.

01:03:06.887 --> 01:03:07.888
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:08.972
- Is coffee okay?
- Yes.

01:03:09.055 --> 01:03:10.432
Two coffees, please.

01:03:14.227 --> 01:03:15.812
TAEGYEON BANK

01:03:15.896 --> 01:03:17.397
RECEIVED 2,900,000,000 WON
FROM LEE SEONG-DAE

01:03:20.358 --> 01:03:21.735
We've received your money.

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:24.696
That's 3 billion won,
including the initial 100 million.

01:03:24.779 --> 01:03:27.198
You'll get 300 million won in profit
next month.

01:03:28.783 --> 01:03:29.784
Hurry.

01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:31.202
Okay, that's all for today...

01:03:31.286 --> 01:03:32.287
Wait.

01:03:35.749 --> 01:03:36.750
About

01:03:38.168 --> 01:03:40.253
next month's profit.

01:03:41.588 --> 01:03:43.381
Can I invest that, too?

01:03:45.091 --> 01:03:46.843
Of course.

01:03:46.927 --> 01:03:48.678
Would you like that?

01:03:48.762 --> 01:03:51.389
10% of 300 million won is 30 million.

01:04:02.776 --> 01:04:04.569
APK BUILDING

01:04:13.787 --> 01:04:14.871
Oh, no!

01:04:15.205 --> 01:04:16.748
- What's wrong?
- My back!

01:04:16.831 --> 01:04:18.541
It's from the earlier crash.

01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:20.794
- Just stay out of it, then.
- Oh, no.

01:04:20.877 --> 01:04:21.878
Stay here, alright?

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:23.797
HAN-YOUNG

01:04:29.469 --> 01:04:30.804
Your call cannot be completed.

01:04:58.415 --> 01:05:00.458
He took the elevator just now. Hurry!

01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:01.710
Yes, sir.

01:05:01.918 --> 01:05:04.045
Oh, come on. I have to take the stairs?

01:05:05.672 --> 01:05:08.591
The profit is coming a whole month later

01:05:08.675 --> 01:05:11.219
so just let me know before that,
and I'll take care of it.

01:05:11.302 --> 01:05:13.263
I'm late for something right now

01:05:13.346 --> 01:05:14.389
so let's wrap it up.

01:05:14.889 --> 01:05:16.683
That's 60 million in two months, then.

01:05:16.766 --> 01:05:19.561
What? Of course.
It's 30 million won per month.

01:05:19.644 --> 01:05:21.396
I really have to go now.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.415
The prosecution is here!

01:05:48.423 --> 01:05:52.135
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:06:16.242 --> 01:06:19.204
What do you say? It's a chance
to join the real power circle.

01:06:19.287 --> 01:06:21.456
Announce Tae-seong as not guilty.

01:06:21.539 --> 01:06:22.957
It's just a small entry fee for that.

01:06:23.041 --> 01:06:25.835
I'm not conducting a trial.
It's a hostage situation.

01:06:25.919 --> 01:06:28.338
Just be patient. I'll be right over.

01:06:28.463 --> 01:06:30.298
Guard him, no matter what. Strike first.

01:06:30.381 --> 01:06:31.716
I'm Seok Jeong-ho, alright?

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.176
Can you handle it?

01:06:33.259 --> 01:06:34.677
You'll become the Chief Justice.

01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:36.596
You'll never become the Chief Justice.

01:06:36.679 --> 01:06:38.389
Whose word do you think weighs more?

01:06:38.473 --> 01:06:39.766
I'm the one giving you a chance.

01:06:39.849 --> 01:06:41.559
- You told me to trust you!
- No!

01:06:41.643 --> 01:06:42.977
Those crazy bastards!

01:06:43.061 --> 01:06:44.562
You've really lost your mind.

01:06:44.646 --> 01:06:46.397
One slip, and it's game over.

01:06:49.067 --> 01:06:51.069
