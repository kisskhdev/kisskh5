[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.200
[Episode 15]

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.479
What now?

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.070
Send him back?

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:48.900
Brute.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.220
You've never done

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.280
any counseling.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.420
Zhang Yang, go.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.000
Tashi, look.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.449
Tashi.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.450
Look here.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.760
Don't move. Look here.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.450
It's not done.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.210
Why run?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.250
I won't.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.800
I don't like taking photos.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.980
Same here.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.170
Me neither.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.970
Fine.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.800
Go ahead.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.730
We'll watch.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.230
Zhang Yang, look here.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.079
Okay.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.140
One, two.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.079
Come on.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.880
It's a bad angle.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.440
Here.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.350
Come here.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.370
By the hood.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.770
Let's check it out.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.870
This works.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.980
Okay.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.630
One, two, three.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.680
Well.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.780
Sit on the hood.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.079
Nice.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.550
One, two, three. Done.

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.140
Try it.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.680
It's easy. Try it.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.250
I'll break it.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.900
The camera's sturdy.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.780
It won't break.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.890
Tashi, look.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Aim at people.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.460
Press this button.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.980
Press.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.150
Press.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.430
Press.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.500
Press.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.620
Okay.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.340
Stop.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.400
You're pressing

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.340
like firing a gun.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.430
I have limited shots.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.420
You'll use them all.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.360
You're stingy.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.470
I'll buy another

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.079
roll.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.640
Give it.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.310
Tashi, hold this.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.470
Like I showed you.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.040
Come on, press this.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.180
Right.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.770
Press.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.770
Okay.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.780
Stop.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.120
Tashi, I'll show you.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.320
Look.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.690
See

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.300
this black frame?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.329
This is the viewfinder.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.890
Put your eye up to it.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.600
Hold it. Eye up to it.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.420
See the image?

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.700
Yeah.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.150
It's blurry.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.640
Clear now?

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.720
Clear, right?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.650
Press this with your index finger.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.220
Right.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.970
Aim and press.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.890
Yes, look.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.030
That's your

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.079
first photo.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.820
Come here.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.970
Come.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.900
Look.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.340
This is focus.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.750
Bigger?

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.750
He looks bigger,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.560
right?

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.340
Clear?

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.830
Press the shutter.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.360
Good shots, right?

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.500
Your Dad

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.390
is the best

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.740
survival expert.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.100
Cars get stuck in snow.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.880
Others check on foot.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.690
He sees subtle ground

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.680
differences and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.370
avoids soft

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.770
spots without stopping.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.330
Why are its face

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.210
and legs black?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.040
From the cold?

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.740
I also asked your

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.370
Dad this.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.720
He said that

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.600
during mating season,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.920
male Tibetan antelopes

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.330
turn black.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.250
Black looks stronger and

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.590
attracts females.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.360
You're lying.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.420
I can tell.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.310
Police don't lie.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.720
This photo

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:58.690
tells a story.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.930
We

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.540
followed

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.580
Tibetan antelope tracks

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.140
to a

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.180
mountaintop lake

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.180
with fresh water.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.800
We saw

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.960
Tibetan sand foxes,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.090
snow leopards, and brown bears.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.590
Almost a paradise.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.450
Want to go?

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.240
I can take you next time.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.410
This is what your

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.630
Dad is doing.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.130
Such a beautiful land

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.180
needs protection.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.380
We can't let it be a hunting ground

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.960
or dump.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.000
Right?

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.590
When we took this photo,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.580
we'd just gotten

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.800
the car out of a ditch.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.620
Like it?

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.000
It's yours.

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:42.510
Take it.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.300
At home,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.350
I've never seen him

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.460
smile so happily.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.130
Zhacuo,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.980
introduce.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:20.600
Speak to this?

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.100
Yes.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.860
These are

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.910
the pelts we found last time.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.820
Tibetan antelope pelts.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.320
Over 400 pelts.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.220
The biggest haul yet.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.480
The four of us

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.470
almost died there.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.130
We didn't get them all.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.130
We couldn't carry all at once,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.250
so we buried the pelts

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.050
and will get

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.320
them next time.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.460
Reporter Shao, look.

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.000
Poachers don't just

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.870
hunt Tibetan antelopes.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.630
These small ones are Tibetan sand foxes.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.890
Over 20 were poisoned.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.180
This is the Mountain Patrol's daily life.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.480
In 1.5 years,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.560
they seized

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.230
over 1600

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.630
animal pelts.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.730
Captain's back.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.590
Let's go.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.860
Captain brought food.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.270
Come on.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.930
Move everything

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:20.750
onto the car.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.310
What is "Jin Xiang"?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.600
Is it food?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.770
Not food.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.860
Go for a meeting.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.200
Captain, what's this?

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.380
Don't ask.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.110
Just move it.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.530
Stop looking.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.050
[Toilet Paper]

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.850
Come help.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.320
Hurry.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.650
Only six boxes?

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.230
There's plenty

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.490
piled at the hospital.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.610
You young people,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.390
why so conservative?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.240
Yes.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.460
It's perfectly normal.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.910
Women here

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.500
rarely use sanitary belts.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.790
They've definitely never seen them.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:07.870
Captain,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.050
this is too sudden.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.120
This has nothing to do

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.090
with our work.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.140
Put your hands down.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.520
Fine.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.820
Open your eyes.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.630
Fine.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.210
Stop it.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.540
Director Zhang

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.670
assigned this task.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:26.920
Distributing toilet paper

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.660
and sanitary belts

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.320
to women in nearby townships.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.500
Our team has cars and

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.620
covers a wide area.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.299
We should help.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:36.429
Distribute?

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.020
Do we have to take

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.510
these into others' homes?

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.650
If not to homes,

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.690
where else would you take them?

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.740
For the Uninhabited Zone's

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.870
Tibetan antelopes?

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.360
I'm not going.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.450
Disobeying order?

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.760
He, what about you?

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.880
I'll make tea.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.210
What's with the attitude?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.360
This is a good deed.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.070
Show the same energy you have

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.530
when dealing with criminals.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.200
Let's go.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.120
If we distribute this,

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.220
they'll think we're

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.100
criminals.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.370
Right, Sangba?

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.030
I don't know how to use this.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.580
I have no idea

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.640
how to explain it to people.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.400
Hey.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.640
Take that down.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.130
You don't use it like that.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.910
Why do you take it out?

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.570
Put it back.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.520
You idiots.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.590
I'll distribute them.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.050
Only Bai can do it.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.630
Set an example for us.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.030
Good job, Bai.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.030
Applause for Bai.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.980
Go.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.910
Cut the crap.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.920
Come with me.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.840
No problem.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.100
Look at you,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.380
so scared.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.820
It's no big deal.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.560
Let's go.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.220
Go.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.100
Talk calmly.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.390
Get

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:02.890
out.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.740
Hands off.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.640
Stop pushing.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.170
Get out.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.320
Our land,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.220
water,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.440
wool are clean.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.410
No disease.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:10.700
Why give me this?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.410
I'm not saying your wife is sick.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.620
It's for prevention.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.220
Prevention.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.200
I don't understand.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.600
I don't understand.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.370
We don't need it.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.370
It's not up to you.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.720
I want to talk to Sister.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.990
Sister, come out.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.170
Hands off.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.930
Go.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:22.480
Go.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.080
Leave.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.770
Go.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.150
Don't come back.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.220
I'm so mad.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.160
Get inside.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.720
It wasn't for you.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.330
Why

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.410
refuse it for your wife?

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.080
Enough.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.780
Stop shouting.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.610
People like that are

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.290
ignorant.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.390
We have a long way to go.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.080
When he pushed,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.750
couldn't

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.620
you stop him?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.370
I tried to stop!

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:52.980
No.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.060
You let him push me.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.240
I did stop him.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:56.630
You're

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.980
a coward.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.080
Why blame me?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.130
Bai Shao.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:14.750
let's go

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.670
get lunch.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.480
You go.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:17.600
Stop dieting.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.650
Let's get noodles.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.460
Yeah.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.690
I'm not going.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.200
I have

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.200
a date.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:26.960
Yes.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.890
Our Bai Shao

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.100
is taken.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.880
Not true.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.460
Don't talk nonsense.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.380
Sorry.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.390
We're closed.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.750
Hello.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.540
Comrade, you're late.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.790
It's lunch time.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.770
Come back later.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.460
I'm not

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.820
too late, am I?

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.480
Bai Shao.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:10.910
Bai Shao.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.180
I wanted

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.700
to buy you peonies.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.290
They're symbolic.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.240
I'll make it up next time.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:21.860
You think

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.320
everything can be made up?

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:27.180
Sorry, Bai Shao.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.420
Don't apologize.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.360
We broke up.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.700
No.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.700
We never said we were

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.120
breaking up.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.320
How is this a breakup?

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.520
What is this then?

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.000
You just left,

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:40.760
never told

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.240
me where you went.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.360
Did you

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.670
call me even once?

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.050
Did you write me a letter?

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.680
What's this if not a breakup?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.370
My fault.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.860
I regretted it

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.500
while we were apart,

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.030
Back then,

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.270
I hesitated.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.380
I backed out.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.090
I shouldn't have

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.810
left

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.550
you here.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.160
Get this straight.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.050
You didn't leave me.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:08.740
This

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.030
is my home.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.740
I can

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.590
live well

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.670
without you.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.390
But I can't.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:15.820
Honestly,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.390
without you,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.550
I want to die.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.700
If you don't forgive me,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.030
I'll die.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.250
Fine.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.070
How will you die?

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.670
I'll jump off a building.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.720
Jump, huh?

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.580
Come.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.720
Bai Shao.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.240
Bai Shao.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.100
Do you see that?

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.790
The tallest building in the county is

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.060
no more than three stories.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.060
Want to jump?

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:41.860
Go ahead.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.760
Jump now.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.320
I'd like to see how you do it.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.320
Go.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.510
Go.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.160
Don't, Bai Shao.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.100
Forgive me.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.810
Just once.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.220
Once.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.390
Ding Zhuoxi.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.350
What do you take me for?

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.240
A bank?

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.090
You open an

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.620
account in my heart,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:01.970
dole out some

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.050
affection,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.150
expecting me to generate interest.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.410
Ding Zhuoxi.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.640
We're done.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.550
We're done.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:10.350
Understand?

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.500
Bai Shao,

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.600
forgive me.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.500
I've thought it through.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.360
Don't touch me.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:14.870
Thought what through?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.360
Bai Shao, just a chance.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.290
Don't touch her.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.290
Harassing her

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.080
in broad daylight?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.500
No.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.780
She's my girlfriend.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.020
What?

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.130
She's my girlfriend.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.700
Touch her again,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.840
I'll call the police.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.700
Lin Jianshe.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:25.750
I'm not your girlfriend.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.390
None of your business.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:26.770
Go.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:27.460
Bai Shao.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.170
Stay out of it.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.030
You know him?

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.560
Drop it.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.450
Let go!

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.840
Stay out of it.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.430
What're you doing?

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.320
What're you doing?

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:33.980
Who are you?

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.340
Who are you?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.610
I'm her boyfriend.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.910
The last batch isn't done,

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.190
and here comes more.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.220
Wear a uniform next time.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.790
No one would dare to touch you.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.970
Easy for you to say.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.090
Sister.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.320
Over here.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.100
Sister.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.280
Bai Shao,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.300
what's wrong?

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.510
Stop shouting.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.930
What happened?

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.010
Lin Jianshe.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.650
Your head's bleeding.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:09.720
Xi.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.810
Xi, you're back.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.560
What's with them?

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.820
Don't ask.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.220
Which department should they see?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.050
They...

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.760
Is Mom here?

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.320
She's out on a house call in pastoral area.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.380
Maybe not back yet.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.790
That's good.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:26.870
What?

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.020
Mom, you're back.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.610
What happened?

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.980
I don't know.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.310
My Sister just came.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.310
I'm not sure.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.130
Your head's bleeding.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.350
Jianshe.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.540
What happened?

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.250
I did it.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.700
What?

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.240
No, Auntie.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.920
It's my fault.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.150
Sort of

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.740
I hit him.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.770
Who are you?

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.390
Hello, Auntie.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.530
I'm Ding Zhuoxi.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.570
Call me Xi.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.740
Okay, stop talking.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.000
Stop standing there.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.860
He's hurt.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.090
Get him to the clinic.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.460
You too.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.430
Okay.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:14.630
Wei.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.980
Come here.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.980
Head wound.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.630
Your Sister brought two men

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.220
in the hospital, beaten up.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:27.880
Why do they

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.310
fight?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.600
None of your business.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.030
Move.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.740
So.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.270
That's what happened.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.100
Mom.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:00.770
Well,

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.480
I didn't want this.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:04.920
Lin Jianshe

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.740
hit him.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.910
I couldn't stop him.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.540
Stop, Lin Jianshe.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.510
Let go.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:11.890
And

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.500
I didn't know

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.290
there was something on my bag.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.500
Not that right now.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.810
Luckily, it's not serious.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.790
Tell me the truth.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.140
What is your relationship

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.220
with Lin Jianshe?

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.140
I told you.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.840
Why don't you believe me?

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:31.760
We're

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.000
not dating,

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.760
just friends.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.000
I already made

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.010
it clear to him.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.960
Why is he

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.980
so agitated?

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.440
How should I know?

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.900
He has a bad temper.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.420
His family must have

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:42.830
spoiled him.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.030
Watch your language.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:50.350
So,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.090
when you were friends,

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.290
did you contact...

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.350
What's his name?

00:17:59.180 --> 00:17:59.960
Xi.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.460
He doesn't even have a last name.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.420
Xi.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.720
Were you in contact?

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.900
Absolutely not.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:10.900
I

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.290
couldn't even find him.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.920
Bai Shao,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.480
be honest.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.720
What is your relationship

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:27.850
with

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:30.380
Xi now?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.070
He.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.250
He's my

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.240
boyfriend.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.110
Louder.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:54.880
He's my boyfriend.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.520
I don't have time

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.400
for your drama.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.530
All you do is cause trouble.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.130
Auntie Zhu

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.330
trusts us,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.280
and you.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.700
No, Mom,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.850
you can't blame me.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.930
I never lied to

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.660
Lin Jianshe

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.500
or took

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.380
advantage of their family.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.020
But you break

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.920
her son's head.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.240
I can't

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.480
understand

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.630
young people today.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.250
Always talking

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.380
about free love,

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.420
dating

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.290
casually,

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.530
on and off,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.550
like it's a game.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.350
Back in our day,

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.590
it wasn't like this.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.980
Who understands

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.750
relationships now?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.520
Auntie Zhang.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.350
You should let Bai Shao

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.160
be careful.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.900
I think that Southerner...

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.200
Did I ask you to speak?

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.060
I won't speak.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.480
Aren't you embarrassed enough?

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.150
Fight with others.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.720
Is this what a college

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.780
student should do?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.650
Who raised you like this?

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.590
Ma'am,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.700
don't scold Jianshe.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.000
This is Bai Shao's fault.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.300
I'm her mother.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.660
I failed to educate her.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.480
When will Lin be back?

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.890
He went to the countryside.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.290
He won't be back for days.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.680
When your Dad gets back,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.330
how do I explain this?

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.940
You

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.830
talk too much.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.380
But I get it now.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.200
Auntie,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.310
don't worry.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.330
I'm serious.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.460
I'll make up for my

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.010
mistakes with actions.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.980
So,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.380
this time,

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.880
I came here

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.250
to formally propose.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.200
That's asking for her hand.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.750
Yes.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.140
Asking for her hand.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.550
I'm too nervous.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.790
I didn't say it well.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.400
Then don't say it.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.850
It's painful to listen to.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.790
Mom.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.370
Have you thought this through?

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.740
I have.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.560
Have you decided to marry him?

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.380
Yes.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:58.980
And live with

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.900
him in Guangzhou?

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.420
Exactly.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:11.270
A...

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.460
A-Auntie.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.020
Mom, what's wrong

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.090
with you today?

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.530
You look mad all day.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.900
What did Xi do?

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.760
I hit Lin Jianshe.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.980
It's not Xi's fault.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.610
And

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.570
Lin Jianshe was wrong.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.570
He started the fight.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.830
Don't mention him.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.190
He has nothing

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.610
to do with this.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.260
That man

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.410
dumped you,

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.570
left just like that,

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.700
left you heartbroken.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.790
Now he returns.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.220
He's only met me twice,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.610
and says he wants to marry my daughter

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.160
and take her to Guangzhou.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.180
Guangzhou.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.410
It's far from home.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.090
It's several days away by train.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.980
You've

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.980
never left

00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.780
my side.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.830
Do you

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.960
understand a mother's feelings?

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.930
Mom.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.210
Xi.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.400
Come in.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.180
I want to talk to you.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.240
My Sister said

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.960
Mom and Xi

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.660
talked long that night

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.160
but didn't hear what

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.480
was said.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.160
But the result was unexpected.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.030
Mom said

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.030
Xi is honest.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.090
She likes him and

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.220
trusts his character.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.310
They had dinner, and

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.570
became like a family.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.640
Xi seemed

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:22.380
born to be

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.560
part of this family.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.200
Our family

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.690
always does

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.010
unexpected things.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.240
Maybe we

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.240
are all like Mom.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.900
You left

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.930
something

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.070
in my room.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.590
[The Besieged City]

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.420
You saw it?

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.310
I'm not blind.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.380
It's under my

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.350
Light Weapons.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.740
Why did you do this?

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.330
If I handed

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.320
the book to you,

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.540
you might not like it.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.880
This way,

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:26.870
you might flip

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.160
through it and keep it.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.060
Then give it to He Qingyuan.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.720
No. It's for you.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.660
Why me?

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.000
You were right.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.350
I wasn't honest

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:50.460
about my feelings.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.520
Don't mind that it's old.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.870
It's the 1980

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.460
first edition

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.660
of The Besieged City.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.860
My Dad's prized copy.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.080
He gave it to me when

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.250
I got into college.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.550
So,

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.770
it means

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:11.770
a lot to me.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.640
People outside the city want in,

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.880
while those inside want out.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:26.000
Marriage,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.940
careers,

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.590
life's the same.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:32.800
In the later edition,

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.330
the author added lines

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.510
which resonated with me.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.580
You're quite mature.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.240
Dated a lot?

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.160
No.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.260
I disagree with

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.640
those lines now.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.110
I want to

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.270
be with the one

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:51.920
I love.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.510
If we're trapped in the city,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.220
feeling stifled,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.140
let's escape

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.070
together.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.460
If we're

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.240
outside the city,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.300
tired of drifting,

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.390
let's find

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.660
a home together.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:15.770
Bai Ju.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.000
In elementary school,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.480
I loved

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.630
my Chinese teacher.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.880
She had nice handwriting,

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.850
spoke gently,

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:21.970
and praised my

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.830
essays.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.790
I had my first girlfriend

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.760
when I was a sophomore.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.580
-She's my classmate.
-What are you talking about?

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.230
And,

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.290
you were right.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.920
I called the provincial capital.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.810
Not the newspaper.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.150
I called a friend in

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.460
Public Security publicity.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.390
He knows people.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.440
I asked him about

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.130
Forestry Police

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.660
training.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.240
After the reserve is set up,

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.110
you can transfer to the Forestry Police.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.190
That could lead you

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:42.710
to the

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.940
provincial capital.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.640
I didn't want to say this.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.480
Because

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.430
it wasn't

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.500
certain.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.170
But I want to be honest.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:56.750
No secrets.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:57.880
No lies.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:04.080
Did I

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.250
say too much?

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.130
Anything unclear,

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.170
I can explain.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.640
I don't get it.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.710
Are you planning my future?

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.500
Yes.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.100
Why?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.850
Why are you planning my future?

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.740
I-if we're going to keep going,

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:37.270
it's

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.400
better to plan

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.460
early.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.510
Sorry.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.500
Am I

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.880
being presumptuous?

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.830
Sorry.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.210
I was afraid

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.910
you'd think I...

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.960
Keep going?

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.180
Did my Mom's

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.310
words affect you?

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.030
Shao Yunfei,

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.000
You're

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.110
overthinking.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.460
But thanks for asking about

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.570
Forestry Police.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:21.690
Even if I join

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720
Forestry Police,

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.140
I won't leave here.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:29.480
My birth parents

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.540
and adoptive father are buried here.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.510
My Mom raised us

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:34.740
all by herself.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.810
This is my home.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.400
I'm not leaving.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.500
You have no family here.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.530
You won't stay.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.350
No matter how much you like

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.160
a place

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.380
or a thing.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.490
If no one cares about you,

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:05.980
you won't stay long.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.940
This book is important.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.720
Keep it safe.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.110
Don't give it away casually.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.010
Thanks, sir.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.570
Mom,

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.440
why are you home this time?

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:02.830
Night shift today?

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.140
Day shift.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.850
I knew you'd be back,

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.980
so I came to meet you.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.000
Why do you call me back?

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.310
Why the rush?

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.500
Big news.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.660
Eat first.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:14.900
Bring the dishes up.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.510
What news?

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:24.570
Here.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.070
Mom,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.400
I got the message to

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.720
bring everything

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.440
back.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.570
I knew it was good news.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.580
What is it?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.940
After dinner.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.400
Just say it.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:45.220
Wait for Big Sister

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.280
to say it together?

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.990
Is Second Sister coming?

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.700
Have some soup.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.380
Stop stalling.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.470
Did Uncle Lin

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.590
transfer me back?

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:01.890
Which department?

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.440
No.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.280
Not a transfer.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.740
Then what?

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.830
I want

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.200
you to quit.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:22.980
Guys,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.980
I brought shrimp chips.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.000
Come on, have some.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.250
Hey, have some.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:38.160
Zhacuo,

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:39.920
have some.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.000
There's plenty.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.100
Sister, have some?

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:00.720
They

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:02.740
won't hit Xi, right?

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.170
You think I'm a

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.180
useless police?

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.570
Talk.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.570
What?

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.330
Questioning me?

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.920
Relax.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:17.949
Mom

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.900
cleared you.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.679
I can't

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.900
interrogate you.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.760
Chairman Ding's

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:32.780
a good man

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.550
and capable.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.480
Close with Captain.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.210
I'm fine with it.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.980
Hold on.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.820
You're getting off track.

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.510
I'm marrying Xi,

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:46.760
not his Dad.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.530
Exactly.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.000
That's the issue.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.000
I don't

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.730
trust Xi.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:52.929
Why not?

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.360
You sound like Mom.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.190
Relax.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.300
Xi loves me.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.000
Besides,

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:02.050
he told me he's

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.340
quitting

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.160
his Dad's

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.940
business.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.970
No more mining?

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.100
He said because

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.100
he found the world's

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.690
best gold mine.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.040
Ugh.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.590
So cheesy.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.590
Good?

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:27.760
Yeah.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.190
What's that?

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.500
This is the 10000 yuan

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.300
I saved up.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.540
Hold it for Mom.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.000
Why not give it to her?

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.300
She won't take it.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:49.940
She knows

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.210
that I want to start

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.230
a business there,

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.940
and I'll need the money.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.630
Exactly.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.730
You should

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.000
keep it.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.270
You

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.580
say it's fine,

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:08.960
but

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.100
I feel guilty.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:11.960
Why?

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.690
When I apologized

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:14.990
to Auntie Zhu,

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.450
she didn't say

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.690
anything harsh.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.030
But after all this,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.940
both Uncle Lin's family

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.990
and ours

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.690
have lost face.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.850
I can just

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.000
leave.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.780
But you still

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.950
have to live here.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.760
Don't make it sound

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.130
like we're suffering.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.000
Not to mention Mom,

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.340
I've got plenty

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.180
to do here.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.780
And what I want

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.630
can only be done

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.380
here.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.940
I'm not going anywhere.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:54.840
Alright.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.740
I'll keep this

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.030
for Mom.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.060
Hey!

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:03.010
Knock!

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:03.900
Stop them!

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.250
They're fighting!

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:06.270
You said

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.570
they wouldn't hit Xi.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.070
I.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:09.980
Get up.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.280
Bro, calm down.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.280
It's your fault!

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.250
You tricked my Sister

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.520
and cost me my job!

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.600
I'll kill you!

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.650
Bai Ji, calm down.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:18.770
Bai Ji!

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.230
Bai Ji,

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:20.550
Bai Ji,

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.440
Why did you come here?

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:21.930
Bai Ji.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:22.800
Stay out of this.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.650
It's a misunderstanding.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:24.780
Misunderstanding?

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.560
Hey, stop!

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:26.440
I'll kill him!

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.140
Stop it!

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.900
He didn't trick me.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:30.180
I chose

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.010
to go with him.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.250
Mom called you back

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.680
to not trouble Uncle Lin.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.300
If you're mad, take it out on me.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.460
Beat me if you want.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.370
What are you doing, Bai Ji?

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.060
Stop!

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.830
I should apply what I said to Duojie

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:13.710
to myself.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.530
What did you say?

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.800
Don't just work.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.840
Discipline your kids.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.090
Lin Peisheng, you're always like this.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.230
If you're angry, say it.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.730
Don't bring

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:25.800
your office act

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.380
home.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.050
It's you who is always like this.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.400
What about me?

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.070
You've shielded

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:32.470
him since

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.940
he was little.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.660
Look what

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:35.860
you've made him.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.350
I was gone just over a week,

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.680
and he caused this mess.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.690
I told you.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.670
These things

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.070
depend on fate.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.940
But you insisted on matchmaking.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:45.890
Don't you know

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.960
your own child?

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.500
I matched them, not forced them.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.960
If Bai Shao didn't want to,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.920
she could've said so.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.340
No one forced her.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.150
If she'd said it earlier,

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.550
it wouldn't be like this.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.150
Besides,

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.270
you

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.260
don't hit people.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.230
Who hit first?

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.820
Didn't your son

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.780
start it?

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.130
Who burns bridges unless

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.240
they're pushed?

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.870
Why didn't she say it earlier?

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:10.560
Enough.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.070
This reflects

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.860
poorly on all of us.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.380
Let bygones

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.360
be bygones.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.790
No one mentions this again.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.320
Dad.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.280
I don't want to stay in Mazhi anymore.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.780
I've lost all face.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:45.800
Okay.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.170
You've improved.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.360
You know shame now.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.510
Lin Peisheng.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:56.300
I know.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040
I'll ask around.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.500
Check the city...

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.360
I don't want to stay there either.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.510
Then where?

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.440
To the sky?

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.110
I want to go to grad school.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.480
Grad school?

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.260
You know your

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.270
limits.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:23.990
Don't you?

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.010
Without

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.120
that

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.280
city cram school,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.090
you'd only be in junior college.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.300
I want to go abroad.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:33.550
What did you say?

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:39.530
Go abroad.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.220
Zhu Li, did you hear that?

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:50.110
Go abroad.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.060
Alright.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.120
Go ahead

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.350
and see how much

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.840
you can squeeze

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.110
out of us.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.540
If it's enough, then go.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:58.850
Abroad?

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.250
Why

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.400
not the moon?

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:02.130
County Mayor Lin.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.550
Is County Mayor Lin home?

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:04.070
Enough.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:05.920
-Yes.
-Ma'am.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.650
Ma'am.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:08.960
Feng is here.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.650
He just got back.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:10.370
Come in.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:10.750
Okay.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:11.370
I'll cook.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.230
Thank you.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.050
County Mayor Lin.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.570
Feng.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.270
Uncle Feng.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.460
What's wrong with Jianshe?

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.310
He's up to no good,

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.310
fighting people.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:23.880
Come, sit.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:25.670
Don't just stand there.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.070
Pour Uncle Feng some tea.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.050
I rushed to get this

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.410
wedding dress

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.770
made,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.710
and you won't wear it.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:16.520
Don't mention it.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.160
That

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.480
is bright red,

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.920
it looks scary.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.230
Look how nice mine is.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.030
Not wearing it.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.170
Then keep it

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.120
for your Sister.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.920
I'm not wearing it either.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.680
Are you really not having a banquet?

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.420
I'll follow

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.950
Bai Shao about the banquet.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:38.560
I don't want one.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:40.710
We'll drive south,

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.430
playing as we go.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.700
That'll be our celebration.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.420
That's good.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.180
Better than a wedding.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.770
Really?

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.670
You don't get it.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.050
Ms. Zhang.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.950
You don't get it.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:05.730
Take this.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:07.590
A wedding gift.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:08.440
You make it?
