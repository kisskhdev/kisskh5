NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.276
{\an8}SEOUL SANGSEO POLICE STATION

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:53.158
{\an8}Damn it.

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:00.248
{\an8}Mr. Kang, you can step out now.

00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:09.925
{\an8}You just keep outdoing yourself.

00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:12.719
{\an8}You're really a piece of work, aren't you?

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:18.725
{\an8}Hey, Si-yeol.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.186
{\an8}What?

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:25.857
{\an8}Are you acting out
because I told you to quit soccer?

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:28.902
No, it's not like that.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:32.072
Jeez, you're a total nutjob.

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.700
Is apologizing to me that difficult?

00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:38.954
You've got a seriously nasty temper.

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:40.831
Seriously.

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:45.752
Fine.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:47.170
You win.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.591
Come back to training tomorrow.

00:01:51.675 --> 00:01:52.884
But on one condition.

00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:55.929
You'd better get your head in the game.

00:01:56.722 --> 00:01:57.889
Listen.

00:01:58.974 --> 00:02:02.519
Let's win the championship this season
and get promoted to the third division.

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:11.319
Are you crazy?

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:18.326
You expect me to play
in the fourth division?

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:20.996
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:28.670
I can't live like that.

00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:30.088
No.

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:32.215
I won't, damn it!

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:35.093
Seriously…

00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:41.892
Seriously, what the hell
is wrong with him?

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.364
- Hey, Woo-seok.
- Si-yeol.

00:02:56.448 --> 00:02:57.407
Where are you right now?

00:02:57.491 --> 00:02:58.784
Are you in London too?

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.036
Actually, Woo-seok…

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.789
- The thing is--
- No, wait.

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:06.750
Let's just meet up.

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:08.919
Let's talk in person.

00:03:11.213 --> 00:03:12.297
I think

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:14.925
I've become a Premier League player.

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:17.511
That's the thing, Woo-seok--

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:20.430
It's all thanks to you, Si-yeol.

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:23.183
Hey, Woo-seok.

00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:25.894
The thing is,

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:29.231
our fates have been switched.

00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:34.444
What do you mean, switched?

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:37.948
You became
a Premier League player instead of me.

00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:42.160
And I'm playing
in the fourth division instead of you.

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:50.085
Woo-seok?

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:54.881
So what do we do now?

00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:57.551
What happens now?

00:03:58.343 --> 00:03:59.928
Well, I asked.

00:04:00.512 --> 00:04:02.848
She says you have to wish

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.934
to have our fates switched back.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.061
A wish?

00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:10.647
I have to make a wish?

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.402
Yes, because I don't have
anything left to pay for a wish.

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:18.697
I see.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.533
Can you check your pockets or your bag?

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:24.035
Her business card
should be in there somewhere.

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:25.787
Woo-seok, come out here for a minute.

00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:27.455
Just a second.

00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:35.881
Si-yeol, hang on. I'll call you back.

00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:37.716
Woo-seok? Hello?

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:38.925
Woo-seok, wait--

00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:01.740
Woo-seok, do you have any idea
how crazy things are right now?

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:04.951
The clubs are fighting over
who's going to sign you,

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:06.703
and the reporters keep calling.

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:10.415
God, having such a perfect son
is exhausting!

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:18.048
Okay, today's the day.
Let's lock in your team!

00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:20.634
And when your transfer fee comes through,

00:05:20.717 --> 00:05:22.260
can I get…

00:05:23.386 --> 00:05:24.721
a new car?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.727
- Dad--
- I know.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.439
I know we have plenty of cars, but…

00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:36.441
Dad.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.111
You're happy, right?

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.530
What?

00:05:43.782 --> 00:05:45.367
Of course I am.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.703
Thanks to you, I've got it pretty good.

00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:50.205
Of course I'm happy.

00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:56.044
I really was hoping for that one car.

00:06:12.644 --> 00:06:15.981
Hello? Hey, Woo-seok.
Did you find the business card?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.693
Well, the thing is…

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.778
What, it's not there?

00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.864
No, that's not it.

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:26.908
Then what is it?

00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:30.870
Do we really
have to switch back right now?

00:06:32.038 --> 00:06:34.666
What… do you mean?

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.460
Just one month.
Let's switch back in a month.

00:06:37.544 --> 00:06:40.046
I promise I'll switch us back then.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.966
- Hey!
- If we're switching back anyway,

00:06:43.633 --> 00:06:45.927
does it matter when we do it?

00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:48.388
Of course it does.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.933
Just give me a little more time.

00:06:53.268 --> 00:06:55.520
Hey, Woo-seok.

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:57.897
You can't do this. Please.

00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:58.940
I'm sorry.

00:06:59.024 --> 00:07:00.900
Woo-seok!

00:07:00.984 --> 00:07:04.362
Hyeon Woo-seok! Oh, come on!

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:07.282
I'm screwed!

00:07:07.365 --> 00:07:09.492
I'm seriously screwed!

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:11.536
Damn it!

00:07:32.724 --> 00:07:33.725
Damn.

00:07:48.073 --> 00:07:49.949
REPUBLIC OF KOREA PASSPORT
KANG SI-YEOL

00:07:56.414 --> 00:07:58.541
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

00:08:02.087 --> 00:08:04.506
One ticket to London, please.
The earliest available.

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:07.008
- Would you like a round-trip ticket?
- No, one-way.

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:11.429
Excuse me.

00:08:11.513 --> 00:08:14.099
It looks like your passport has expired.

00:08:14.182 --> 00:08:15.058
What?

00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:17.352
Then what do I do?

00:08:17.977 --> 00:08:19.854
I have to get to London right now.

00:08:19.938 --> 00:08:22.440
And here I thought
your friendship was special.

00:08:22.524 --> 00:08:23.983
Not so special after all.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:26.069
You!

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.240
Have you learned your lesson?

00:08:30.323 --> 00:08:32.659
I'm not really fond of stupid humans.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:35.537
Learned what lesson, exactly?

00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:38.039
You think I'm the one who needs a lesson?

00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:39.749
Apparently not.

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.292
Wait!

00:08:41.376 --> 00:08:43.461
I seriously can't live like this.

00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:46.089
Put me back!

00:08:47.966 --> 00:08:48.842
Please.

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:57.225
You shouldn't have been
so cocky in the first place.

00:08:58.434 --> 00:09:01.896
Well, that should do it.
I guess I've tamed you enough.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.565
Shall we end this here?

00:09:05.066 --> 00:09:07.902
When you wake up tomorrow,
everything will be back to normal.

00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:10.738
- Really?
- Yes.

00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:12.740
If you ever make a wish,

00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:17.370
always remember what happened today.

00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:20.832
So you don't make the same mistake
with me ever again.

00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:26.129
And from now on,
don't be so quick to trust people.

00:09:26.212 --> 00:09:28.506
Consider it a free lesson from me.

00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:38.725
Man…

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:42.103
Seriously.

00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:47.775
I'll never make a wish again.

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:50.862
Not even if my life depends on it.

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:52.280
Never, damn it.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.218
Sorry.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.396
What?

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.651
What was that?

00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:41.371
Where to?

00:10:53.508 --> 00:10:56.511
I'm sorry. I thought this was a taxi.

00:10:57.178 --> 00:10:58.846
You're right. It is a taxi.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.515
But…

00:11:00.598 --> 00:11:02.308
VACANT

00:11:05.645 --> 00:11:06.938
Sir.

00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:12.735
I'll take you exactly
where you need to be.

00:11:25.665 --> 00:11:29.168
EPISODE 4
THE PRICE OF GOOD DEEDS

00:11:50.315 --> 00:11:51.566
Who are you people?

00:12:25.475 --> 00:12:27.769
What's with the weather all of a sudden?

00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:29.437
Something feels wrong.

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:35.026
Stay still.

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:37.612
Who the hell are you people?

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.198
What are you doing?

00:12:44.952 --> 00:12:46.204
It's not here.

00:12:46.287 --> 00:12:48.206
That's impossible. Look again.

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:54.837
Look for yourself then. It's not here.

00:12:54.921 --> 00:12:57.048
You've got the wrong person.

00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:59.217
I have jack squat right now.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.136
I won't call the police,
so just let me go.

00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:04.806
Shut up.

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:11.145
There's no business card
or anything remotely like it.

00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:13.523
Are you sure this is the right guy?

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:26.577
I'll get straight to the point.

00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:28.121
We're looking for something.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.791
Hand it over,
and I promise nothing will happen to you.

00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:37.213
You have the wish-granting
business card, don't you?

00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:39.215
A business card?

00:13:39.298 --> 00:13:40.508
That's right.

00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:42.635
I have some business with that fox.

00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:47.098
Unbelievable.

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:52.937
You did all this just for that?

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.815
Kidnapping an innocent guy
and tying him up?

00:13:57.358 --> 00:13:58.401
Fine, I get it.

00:13:59.527 --> 00:14:01.320
Just untie me first.

00:14:01.404 --> 00:14:03.030
I'll just summon her for you.

00:14:03.114 --> 00:14:04.740
You think this is a joke?

00:14:04.824 --> 00:14:06.033
Hold it!

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:13.416
What did you just say?

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:18.754
You don't even have the card.
How are you going to summon her?

00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:26.512
Dad, should we go look at some watches?

00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:30.099
No, I'm good.
Let's find something for you instead.

00:14:30.183 --> 00:14:32.101
You've already bought me plenty today.

00:14:33.978 --> 00:14:36.355
Who knows when we'll have
a day like this again?

00:14:37.148 --> 00:14:38.816
I really want to buy you one.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.818
It's not like this is our only chance.

00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:46.491
But I wonder if they still have
that limited edition.

00:14:46.574 --> 00:14:48.201
- Let's go look.
- Shall we?

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:49.952
Hold on.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.580
SI-YEOL

00:14:58.961 --> 00:15:01.255
Who is it? Why didn't you pick up?

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:04.008
It's okay. I don't need to take that call.

00:15:04.091 --> 00:15:05.092
Let's hurry.

00:15:05.176 --> 00:15:07.303
We should go check out some cars later.

00:15:07.386 --> 00:15:08.429
Really?

00:15:08.513 --> 00:15:10.848
But that can wait
until the transfer talks are--

00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:12.308
You said you wanted one.

00:15:12.391 --> 00:15:14.936
Why wait? Let's buy it now.

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:16.896
Okay, then. Let's go.

00:15:20.316 --> 00:15:23.903
Why isn't he picking up?

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.743
Just wait.
I'll get her here for sure, okay?

00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:39.460
By the way, I don't know
what wish you're trying to make,

00:15:39.544 --> 00:15:41.629
but you may want
to think it through one more time.

00:15:41.712 --> 00:15:44.090
Thanks to that crazy fox…

00:15:45.883 --> 00:15:50.221
Anyhow, wishes don't work
the way you think they do.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:51.931
I know.

00:15:52.932 --> 00:15:54.433
I'm not going to make a wish.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.145
Then why are you
looking for the nine-tailed fox?

00:15:58.729 --> 00:15:59.855
We're going to kill her.

00:16:02.024 --> 00:16:03.651
You're going to kill her?

00:16:04.694 --> 00:16:06.571
It's not for a wish?

00:16:14.328 --> 00:16:15.329
Hey!

00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:18.541
Hello?

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:21.669
Hey, Woo-seok.

00:16:24.922 --> 00:16:28.634
Look, I'm a bit busy right now,
so I missed your call.

00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:32.305
Okay…

00:16:34.807 --> 00:16:35.808
Si-yeol.

00:16:36.892 --> 00:16:38.144
I'm begging you, please.

00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:40.980
I just need a month.

00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:42.940
That's all I'm asking.

00:16:44.358 --> 00:16:47.862
We're going to kill her.

00:16:48.654 --> 00:16:49.655
Si-yeol?

00:16:51.365 --> 00:16:53.242
Look, Woo-seok.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.995
Let me call you back.

00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:00.207
What are you doing?

00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:05.630
I don't think this'll work.

00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:10.635
Look, I don't like
that nine-tailed fox either.

00:17:10.718 --> 00:17:14.722
But still, you don't have to kill her.

00:17:15.848 --> 00:17:16.849
Fine.

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:20.311
If that's how you feel, then so be it.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.731
We'll just have to find another way.

00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:14.615
What is this?

00:18:41.767 --> 00:18:44.979
I'm about to lose a huge chunk
of my spiritual power again.

00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:04.123
I was wondering what was going on with me.

00:19:04.749 --> 00:19:06.250
I should've known it was you.

00:19:09.503 --> 00:19:10.504
Wait.

00:19:13.466 --> 00:19:14.675
What is all this?

00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:18.804
Look at you, crawling in here
not knowing this is where you'll die.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.146
I recognize that face.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.737
And you're that male shaman!

00:19:35.446 --> 00:19:38.032
Your name…

00:19:38.115 --> 00:19:40.326
was it Jang Do-cheol?

00:19:41.327 --> 00:19:43.204
You're quite the wicked creature.

00:19:43.287 --> 00:19:45.414
How did you know my name?

00:19:48.209 --> 00:19:49.710
Oh my gosh!

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:56.300
Did you

00:19:56.383 --> 00:19:58.010
trap me in here?

00:19:58.594 --> 00:20:00.554
I spent years researching this.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.516
You won't be able to do a thing in there.

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:06.352
Not even a centuries-old nine-tailed fox.

00:20:07.728 --> 00:20:10.564
A human after a fox bead…

00:20:12.399 --> 00:20:14.443
There used to be a few like you.

00:20:16.487 --> 00:20:20.616
Ever wonder what happened to them?

00:20:28.874 --> 00:20:30.292
Rumor has it

00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:34.797
this dagger can cut through anything.

00:20:36.173 --> 00:20:38.092
Humans, ghosts,

00:20:38.717 --> 00:20:40.970
and even fate decreed by Heaven.

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:55.734
How disappointing.

00:20:56.694 --> 00:20:59.947
I thought a centuries-old nine-tailed fox
would be different.

00:21:18.507 --> 00:21:20.551
Are you about to leave?

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:27.850
The time has come, so I must.

00:21:29.852 --> 00:21:32.980
Is your long watch finally over?

00:21:50.873 --> 00:21:51.957
What?

00:21:55.169 --> 00:21:56.629
Well?

00:21:56.712 --> 00:21:58.505
Not so disappointing now, am I?

00:22:05.804 --> 00:22:06.722
That really hurts.

00:22:08.098 --> 00:22:09.183
It hurts!

00:22:11.018 --> 00:22:12.519
Now do you wonder?

00:22:12.603 --> 00:22:15.648
About what happened
to the humans who dared chase my fox bead.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.233
How on earth…

00:22:18.317 --> 00:22:20.027
It seemed like you were
digging into my past,

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.612
so I did some digging on you too.

00:22:22.821 --> 00:22:25.741
Jang Do-cheol, 54 years old.

00:22:26.575 --> 00:22:27.660
And?

00:22:27.743 --> 00:22:30.037
And he's a former high-flying
fund manager.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.040
He chose his profession wisely.

00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:36.794
With his powers, he must've predicted
every stock price perfectly.

00:22:36.877 --> 00:22:39.171
And he probably mistook it
for his own talent.

00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:41.090
Anything else?

00:22:41.173 --> 00:22:44.218
Ten years ago,
he quit a perfectly stable job

00:22:44.885 --> 00:22:47.763
and has been wandering since,
with nowhere to call home.

00:22:48.639 --> 00:22:51.725
His last known address is right here.

00:22:54.103 --> 00:22:56.563
ID CERTIFICATE: JANG DO-CHEOL
YANGHEUNG-GUN, GANGWON-DO

00:23:10.077 --> 00:23:13.038
I came to see if I could find anything,

00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:16.041
but it looks like this will take a while.

00:23:33.225 --> 00:23:34.893
If you have something to say, go ahead.

00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:36.687
I'm listening.

00:23:40.482 --> 00:23:42.317
What are you going to do with me?

00:23:43.902 --> 00:23:44.903
I'm not sure.

00:23:45.946 --> 00:23:47.281
Nothing at all, actually.

00:23:48.282 --> 00:23:51.326
- What?
- You don't have long to live anyway.

00:23:51.827 --> 00:23:52.953
You know that already.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.790
You're destined
for a particularly miserable death.

00:23:57.583 --> 00:24:00.502
So why should I bother
getting my hands dirty?

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.968
And as for you.

00:24:08.052 --> 00:24:10.179
I'll be coming for you soon

00:24:10.846 --> 00:24:13.432
since you clearly
haven't learned your lesson.

00:24:14.683 --> 00:24:15.642
No!

00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:19.730
This wasn't even my idea.

00:24:20.272 --> 00:24:22.274
That guy made me do all of this.

00:24:35.412 --> 00:24:38.290
I once heard someone say…

00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:41.376
Damn it!

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:43.212
What is it now?

00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:50.302
You…

00:25:08.487 --> 00:25:11.448
…"Heaven's net is vast and wide,

00:25:12.074 --> 00:25:14.326
yet nothing slips through."

00:25:22.209 --> 00:25:23.418
What a joke.

00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:26.296
Deities have no interest in humans.

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:31.301
There's no world
where the guilty are justly punished.

00:25:33.846 --> 00:25:38.308
So I just need to deceive them
enough to get by as well.

00:25:38.892 --> 00:25:40.561
Get up, Kang Si-yeol.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.983
It'll be quite inconvenient for me
if you die like this.

00:26:10.507 --> 00:26:13.802
If you're going to die, do it tomorrow.
Don't make it my problem.

00:26:16.054 --> 00:26:18.682
If you die with your fate switched,

00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:21.560
the ones above
will find out what I'm up to.

00:26:21.643 --> 00:26:23.562
And that would be

00:26:24.563 --> 00:26:26.231
extremely annoying for me.

00:26:27.107 --> 00:26:28.192
Hey,

00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:30.235
are you okay?

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:33.155
What happened to those people?

00:26:35.073 --> 00:26:36.575
Why?

00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:37.826
Planning on getting revenge?

00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:40.162
Did you…

00:26:41.955 --> 00:26:43.207
kill them?

00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:46.043
What?

00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:48.003
You must've forgotten already.

00:26:48.086 --> 00:26:49.630
I don't kill humans.

00:26:51.131 --> 00:26:52.341
Right.

00:26:53.508 --> 00:26:57.888
Though I will pay them a visit soon
and make their lives a living hell.

00:26:59.264 --> 00:27:00.474
Anyway.

00:27:05.062 --> 00:27:06.355
I'm sorry.

00:27:07.648 --> 00:27:08.774
What?

00:27:10.692 --> 00:27:14.488
I feel like you got dragged
into this because of me.

00:27:19.243 --> 00:27:21.078
Are you just going to sit there?

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.288
Get up. I'll take you home.

00:27:24.456 --> 00:27:25.832
Yeah, okay.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.206
I told you

00:28:48.999 --> 00:28:50.334
this would happen,

00:28:50.917 --> 00:28:51.960
Geum-ho.

00:28:53.253 --> 00:28:55.088
You never once came to look for me.

00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:57.716
Not when your child was sick,

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:00.010
or even after they died.

00:29:01.261 --> 00:29:03.013
Not when your family was ruined,

00:29:03.096 --> 00:29:05.932
when your husband died,
or when you were left to starve.

00:29:06.016 --> 00:29:08.769
While you were living that miserable life,

00:29:10.354 --> 00:29:13.148
why did you never once ask me
to grant you a wish?

00:29:13.774 --> 00:29:15.859
You never gave me the chance to help you.

00:29:19.905 --> 00:29:25.035
I smell the earth on you, miss.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.747
It smells like the place

00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:32.209
where I once lived, long ago.

00:29:36.004 --> 00:29:39.424
I told you that you'd be miserable.

00:29:40.634 --> 00:29:43.428
You knew you'd forget
everything in the end

00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:47.140
and die as a lonely, withered old woman.

00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:51.520
Why did you choose to endure it all?

00:29:52.938 --> 00:29:53.980
Oh my.

00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:56.983
You're such a beauty.

00:29:58.402 --> 00:30:00.445
My, how beautiful you are.

00:30:05.158 --> 00:30:07.160
I came to say goodbye.

00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:10.539
Because you're going to die today.

00:30:12.874 --> 00:30:15.460
There was something I needed to say.

00:30:18.213 --> 00:30:20.257
I will never become human.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.221
I won't love a human as you did.

00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:29.224
I won't live in misery,
and I won't die in despair.

00:30:30.434 --> 00:30:31.852
I'll never

00:30:33.145 --> 00:30:35.021
live like you.

00:30:42.446 --> 00:30:44.614
Gosh. Ma'am!

00:30:44.698 --> 00:30:45.949
Ma'am!

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:48.243
- Oh gosh. Ma'am!
- My goodness.

00:30:48.869 --> 00:30:50.620
- Goodness!
- Gosh.

00:30:50.704 --> 00:30:51.830
Ma'am!

00:30:52.747 --> 00:30:53.874
There she is.

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:58.044
Good grief. This senile old woman
is always wandering back here.

00:30:58.128 --> 00:31:00.005
She can't even find her own home anymore.

00:31:00.088 --> 00:31:02.382
How does she find
this place so well every time?

00:31:02.466 --> 00:31:04.342
The sun's setting. Let's go.

00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:12.058
Ma'am.

00:31:15.228 --> 00:31:16.605
No…

00:31:16.688 --> 00:31:18.523
Oh no. Ma'am!

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:22.986
Goodness me.

00:31:23.069 --> 00:31:25.238
Ma'am…

00:31:25.864 --> 00:31:28.158
Oh no.

00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:32.245
Oh no. Ma'am! Poor thing!

00:31:50.555 --> 00:31:51.806
Wait.

00:31:52.474 --> 00:31:53.892
Are you crying?

00:32:01.024 --> 00:32:02.192
Where am I?

00:32:02.984 --> 00:32:03.902
I brought you here.

00:32:04.528 --> 00:32:06.279
Are you feeling better?

00:32:06.363 --> 00:32:07.531
The light's so bright.

00:32:15.747 --> 00:32:16.915
What's wrong now?

00:32:35.725 --> 00:32:37.185
What's wrong with me?

00:32:52.492 --> 00:32:54.703
What just happened?

00:32:54.786 --> 00:32:56.162
How is this possible?

00:32:56.246 --> 00:32:59.791
- What did I do to deserve--
- What is it? What's wrong?

00:33:04.504 --> 00:33:05.839
Yes, you.

00:33:05.922 --> 00:33:08.842
It's because of you.
This is all your fault!

00:33:08.925 --> 00:33:11.136
Why is it my fault again?

00:33:11.219 --> 00:33:13.263
Do you know what I went through
because of you?

00:33:13.346 --> 00:33:14.514
That's not the point!

00:33:14.598 --> 00:33:16.016
Then what is?

00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:17.267
I…

00:33:19.644 --> 00:33:20.812
I've become human.

00:33:22.439 --> 00:33:23.732
What?

00:33:23.815 --> 00:33:26.526
I've become human because of you!

00:33:30.113 --> 00:33:32.324
INN

00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:42.042
Where are you going?

00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:45.629
We should go our separate ways now.

00:33:46.338 --> 00:33:47.964
What about me then?

00:33:48.048 --> 00:33:49.507
What am I supposed to do?

00:33:51.968 --> 00:33:53.386
Move to a new place every day.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:54.638
What?

00:33:54.721 --> 00:33:57.057
Don't stay in one place for too long.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.893
That way, she'll have a harder time
finding your energy.

00:33:59.976 --> 00:34:01.102
Hey, wait!

00:34:03.813 --> 00:34:05.190
That's it?

00:34:05.273 --> 00:34:07.025
What if that fox finds me here?

00:34:07.108 --> 00:34:10.862
Maybe you're fine with dying,
but what about me?

00:34:10.945 --> 00:34:13.698
That's not really my problem.

00:34:25.794 --> 00:34:26.670
Calm down.

00:34:28.755 --> 00:34:30.548
Explain it so I can understand.

00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:37.097
I've become human.

00:34:37.722 --> 00:34:39.057
What more is there to explain?

00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:41.685
But is that really such a big deal?

00:34:42.977 --> 00:34:44.020
What?

00:34:44.104 --> 00:34:47.649
I mean, nine-tailed foxes eat
human livers to become human.

00:34:47.732 --> 00:34:49.651
At least, that's what the stories say.

00:34:50.443 --> 00:34:52.445
Are you out of your mind?

00:34:52.529 --> 00:34:57.534
If you were me, would you really choose
to lose your powers, grow old and sick,

00:34:57.617 --> 00:34:59.744
and die before even reaching a hundred?

00:34:59.828 --> 00:35:02.997
- You think I'd eat a liver just for that?
- All right.

00:35:03.498 --> 00:35:04.916
I get it.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.628
Then how did this happen?

00:35:08.712 --> 00:35:11.923
You wouldn't have suddenly
become human for no reason.

00:35:12.006 --> 00:35:13.258
That's…

00:35:15.093 --> 00:35:17.095
because I saved your life.

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:23.685
As you were dying,
I was losing my spiritual power.

00:35:23.768 --> 00:35:27.647
So I saved you
just to stop that from happening.

00:35:28.857 --> 00:35:31.568
But how can they count that
as a good deed?

00:35:31.651 --> 00:35:33.236
How does that even add up?

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:36.072
Do they have any idea
how many terrible things I've done?

00:35:36.698 --> 00:35:38.491
All because I saved one meager life?

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.831
Well, I agree.

00:35:44.914 --> 00:35:46.666
You're not fit to be human yet.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.960
There must've been some mistake.

00:35:49.043 --> 00:35:51.004
You think so too, right?

00:35:52.881 --> 00:35:56.885
Anyway, since you became
human against your will,

00:35:56.968 --> 00:35:59.345
I really do feel for you.

00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:07.437
But there is something
I've been wanting to ask.

00:36:09.439 --> 00:36:10.732
What's that?

00:36:10.815 --> 00:36:14.986
When exactly will I go back
to how things were?

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:18.656
What?

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.034
You said so last night.

00:36:21.117 --> 00:36:24.162
That everything would be back
to normal by morning.

00:36:24.245 --> 00:36:26.039
And it's morning.

00:36:26.122 --> 00:36:28.958
Actually, it's already past morning.
It's lunchtime.

00:36:30.668 --> 00:36:31.795
When will it switch back?

00:36:34.923 --> 00:36:37.300
Have you even been listening to me?

00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.803
I'm human now.

00:36:40.887 --> 00:36:42.096
So?

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.100
I'm human now, so how am I supposed
to turn things back the way they were?

00:36:48.144 --> 00:36:51.022
Wait, what are you talking about?

00:36:51.523 --> 00:36:52.398
No way.

00:36:52.482 --> 00:36:54.734
You're joking, aren't you?

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.320
Does it look like I'm joking?

00:36:57.403 --> 00:37:00.114
This isn't a joke. This is hell.

00:37:00.198 --> 00:37:04.953
No, no. This can't be happening.
Please don't do this to me!

00:37:05.995 --> 00:37:08.790
Are you saying
I have to keep living like this?

00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:13.169
Yes, for the time being.

00:37:14.087 --> 00:37:15.505
"For the time being"?

00:37:15.588 --> 00:37:16.881
For how long?

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.425
A few weeks?

00:37:20.051 --> 00:37:21.344
Well…

00:37:22.428 --> 00:37:23.304
A few months?

00:37:24.848 --> 00:37:26.474
Say something!

00:37:26.558 --> 00:37:29.894
What are you going to do?
There's no way I can live like this!

00:37:29.978 --> 00:37:31.646
Do you think I want to live like this?

00:37:31.729 --> 00:37:35.275
Then do something! Anything!

00:37:35.358 --> 00:37:37.068
There has to be a way, right?

00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:38.862
Do you even have to ask?

00:37:39.362 --> 00:37:41.614
If there isn't a way, I'll make one.

00:37:54.919 --> 00:37:57.755
Could you have gone any slower?
I said I was in a hurry.

00:37:58.423 --> 00:38:00.091
I'm sorry.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.261
I'm really sorry.

00:38:10.602 --> 00:38:12.562
That temper of yours, seriously.

00:38:14.772 --> 00:38:16.524
What are we doing here anyway?

00:38:16.608 --> 00:38:18.860
I have some things to say
and questions to ask.

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:21.195
Something definitely went wrong.

00:38:29.454 --> 00:38:31.789
You there, could you leave for a moment?

00:38:31.873 --> 00:38:33.666
I have some business here.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.835
- Hey.
- What?

00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:37.962
He is

00:38:38.046 --> 00:38:39.923
no longer here.

00:38:41.007 --> 00:38:42.175
What?

00:38:42.258 --> 00:38:44.302
He left last night.

00:38:45.595 --> 00:38:47.764
That crazy old geezer!

00:38:50.058 --> 00:38:54.646
Since you've come all this way,
why don't you stay for some tea?

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.367
Where did he go?

00:39:07.951 --> 00:39:09.494
I wouldn't know.

00:39:10.161 --> 00:39:14.415
How could a mere monk
fathom the divine will?

00:39:14.499 --> 00:39:17.251
There's something I need answers to.

00:39:18.252 --> 00:39:21.631
So I'd appreciate it if you could
just tell me where he went.

00:39:21.714 --> 00:39:24.008
He didn't say.

00:39:24.092 --> 00:39:28.221
But he told me to give you this.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.601
Since you'll be living
in the human world now,

00:39:34.268 --> 00:39:36.521
he said it's something
you'll definitely need.

00:39:48.032 --> 00:39:49.492
What is this?

00:39:49.575 --> 00:39:53.705
Your name is Ok-sun.
"Ok" for jade, and "Sun" for pure.

00:39:53.788 --> 00:39:58.292
Lord Pagun hoped
that choosing a name like this for you

00:39:58.793 --> 00:40:01.671
would help you rein in your temper.

00:40:01.754 --> 00:40:02.880
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD

00:40:11.472 --> 00:40:12.598
How did it go?

00:40:13.224 --> 00:40:14.600
Is there a way?

00:40:15.393 --> 00:40:17.770
Hey, say something.

00:40:19.147 --> 00:40:20.606
How did it go?

00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:23.401
STORAGE ROOM

00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:28.364
What are you doing?

00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:30.950
Hey.

00:40:33.995 --> 00:40:35.246
Carry this and follow me.

00:40:37.081 --> 00:40:38.291
What are these for?

00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:41.252
What are you doing?

00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:44.756
What is…

00:40:46.174 --> 00:40:48.134
Gosh, that smell! Are you crazy?

00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:49.677
Hey!

00:40:50.762 --> 00:40:52.722
I'm going to burn
this place to the ground!

00:40:52.805 --> 00:40:53.681
Jeez!

00:40:54.515 --> 00:40:56.684
Let me go!

00:40:56.768 --> 00:40:58.394
Excuse me, what's going on?

00:40:58.478 --> 00:41:00.438
Let me go!

00:41:01.064 --> 00:41:03.649
I'm going to burn this place down!

00:41:04.275 --> 00:41:06.402
I'm going to burn this place down!

00:41:06.486 --> 00:41:08.362
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!

00:41:09.739 --> 00:41:13.242
- Why are you doing this?
- Put me down!

00:41:15.578 --> 00:41:18.414
TRUSTED POLICE
WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.837
The head monk spoke up for you.

00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:27.298
He said you'd be able to
get out tomorrow morning.

00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:28.758
Tomorrow morning?

00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:31.552
Are you kidding me?
Tell them to let me out now.

00:41:31.636 --> 00:41:34.806
You're here for attempted arson.

00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:37.934
You should be grateful
they're letting you out tomorrow.

00:41:38.017 --> 00:41:40.436
Can't we just pay them off or something?

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.979
Where would I get the money?

00:41:42.063 --> 00:41:43.523
I'm broke because of you.

00:41:43.606 --> 00:41:45.316
Whatever. This is pathetic.

00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:47.652
Good grief.

00:41:47.735 --> 00:41:49.654
Grab those two blankets over there.

00:41:49.737 --> 00:41:52.198
There won't be any left
when the drunks get here.

00:41:53.574 --> 00:41:55.952
By the way,
where's my wooden-handled dagger?

00:41:56.035 --> 00:41:57.120
What?

00:41:57.203 --> 00:41:58.663
The dagger I had.

00:41:59.413 --> 00:42:01.124
It was gone when I woke up.

00:42:02.583 --> 00:42:03.835
Don't tell me.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.420
Did you not bring it yesterday?

00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:10.299
Was there a dagger?

00:42:12.802 --> 00:42:14.303
Oh, that.

00:42:14.387 --> 00:42:16.430
I was all over the place yesterday.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.808
You left it behind?

00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:21.894
Yes. Was it important?

00:42:22.895 --> 00:42:24.272
Go and get it right now!

00:42:24.355 --> 00:42:25.481
Right now?

00:42:26.357 --> 00:42:28.151
You want me to go back there?

00:42:28.234 --> 00:42:30.862
Why? You want to wait until next year?

00:42:30.945 --> 00:42:32.738
That's not what I meant.

00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:38.244
After everything that happened yesterday,
how can I go back there alone this late?

00:42:38.327 --> 00:42:42.582
Let's just wait until morning
and go together, okay?

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:47.044
It's the only Sajin Ritual Blade
left in the world.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:50.131
Sajin… what?

00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:53.676
It's a sacred dagger
that can sever and defy fate.

00:42:55.136 --> 00:42:57.471
If we want to get things back
to how they were…

00:42:58.848 --> 00:43:00.600
we might need it.

00:43:05.438 --> 00:43:06.856
Jeez.

00:43:23.164 --> 00:43:24.165
Is this the place?

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:25.833
Yes.

00:43:26.709 --> 00:43:28.586
The NASDAQ is about to open.

00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:30.046
Where are we going at this hour?

00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:32.506
Jeez!

00:43:33.299 --> 00:43:34.634
What is this place?

00:43:34.717 --> 00:43:37.720
Where are we?
What are we looking for here?

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.016
There's a lot of weird stuff in there,

00:43:42.642 --> 00:43:44.060
so don't be too shocked.

00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:46.437
Weird stuff like what?

00:43:47.188 --> 00:43:48.522
Hey, wait.

00:43:51.234 --> 00:43:52.985
Si-yeol!

00:43:53.986 --> 00:43:55.029
Damn it.

00:44:18.636 --> 00:44:19.929
Oh, jeez.

00:44:24.892 --> 00:44:27.895
Wait, why is it…

00:44:30.898 --> 00:44:34.443
What's wrong? What's supposed to be here?

00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:36.195
What is it?

00:44:36.821 --> 00:44:38.531
- There's nothing here, Beom.
- What?

00:44:42.743 --> 00:44:44.161
Seriously.

00:44:45.746 --> 00:44:47.540
It's just a construction site.

00:44:48.165 --> 00:44:51.127
You say there's something here?
Looks like there's nothing at all.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.337
Are you okay, Si-yeol?

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.923
Yeah.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.658
Top teams

00:45:22.742 --> 00:45:26.370
from all over the world made offers.

00:45:31.208 --> 00:45:33.377
Stop it, Dad.

00:46:28.391 --> 00:46:30.559
Ms. Kim Ok-sun, you can come out now.

00:46:36.565 --> 00:46:38.109
Ms. Kim Ok-sun.

00:46:38.776 --> 00:46:40.236
I said, you can come out now.

00:46:48.202 --> 00:46:50.121
I told you yesterday.

00:46:50.204 --> 00:46:51.664
My name's not Kim Ok-sun.

00:46:52.373 --> 00:46:54.125
Then are you going to stay in here?

00:47:02.842 --> 00:47:04.844
I am coming out.

00:47:06.345 --> 00:47:08.347
But I'm not Kim Ok-sun.

00:47:44.008 --> 00:47:44.967
Hey.

00:47:46.177 --> 00:47:47.261
How can I help you?

00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:48.512
Call Kang Si-yeol for me.

00:47:49.305 --> 00:47:52.349
- I'm sorry, who?
- I just got released from here,

00:47:52.433 --> 00:47:55.102
but Si-yeol isn't here yet.
Tell him to get here fast.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.274
This isn't the place for jokes.
Please leave.

00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:43.734
Hey!

00:48:48.781 --> 00:48:50.199
Kang Si-yeol?

00:48:50.282 --> 00:48:52.409
I thought you'd abandoned me.

00:48:52.493 --> 00:48:54.662
What are you talking about?
Why would I do that?

00:48:54.745 --> 00:48:56.497
I need you more than ever right now.

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.456
Really?

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.416
Get in. We're going to Seoraksan Mountain.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.710
We have to hurry before it closes. Get in.

00:49:02.878 --> 00:49:03.921
Buckle up.

00:49:05.923 --> 00:49:08.801
- Hurry up. Come on.
- Okay.

00:49:10.052 --> 00:49:11.595
Okay, here we go.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:14.139
Let's go.

00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:19.353
Why Seoraksan Mountain all of a sudden?

00:49:19.436 --> 00:49:21.146
Do you think we have time for that?

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:22.731
I found something.

00:49:22.815 --> 00:49:25.067
Right. Did you find
the wooden-handled dagger?

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:29.321
No. When I got there,
there was nothing left.

00:49:29.405 --> 00:49:34.076
The dagger was gone,
and so was all the shaman stuff.

00:49:34.159 --> 00:49:35.202
What?

00:49:36.579 --> 00:49:38.872
Then what on earth did you find?

00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:40.291
Another

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:42.710
nine-tailed fox.

00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:44.587
What?

00:49:48.257 --> 00:49:49.967
How long are we staying here?

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.427
There's nothing there.

00:49:58.601 --> 00:50:01.395
COUPLE SAVED BY NINE-TAILED FOX
STARTS NEW LIFE THROUGH VOLUNTEERING

00:50:03.063 --> 00:50:04.940
That's absolute nonsense.

00:50:05.024 --> 00:50:07.943
There is no other nine-tailed fox
in this land besides me.

00:50:08.902 --> 00:50:10.321
How can you be so sure?

00:50:10.404 --> 00:50:11.697
I just am.

00:50:12.197 --> 00:50:15.451
If there were another being like me,
we would sense each other's energy.

00:50:15.534 --> 00:50:16.452
Even from a distance.

00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:18.829
Then what about those people?

00:50:19.371 --> 00:50:21.123
They're just talking nonsense.

00:50:21.206 --> 00:50:22.583
Humans are always like that.

00:50:22.666 --> 00:50:25.210
They either hallucinated
or just wanted attention.

00:50:26.211 --> 00:50:27.671
They didn't seem like that.

00:50:30.174 --> 00:50:31.258
How would you know?

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:34.178
Because I met them myself.

00:50:35.846 --> 00:50:39.683
Gosh, I really thought
I was going to die that day.

00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:44.813
I think it was around 2 or 3 p.m.
when we entered Dinosaur Ridge.

00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:46.940
Sometime around then.

00:50:47.024 --> 00:50:50.903
But since it was winter,
the sun went down so fast.

00:50:50.986 --> 00:50:52.613
It was freezing cold,

00:50:52.696 --> 00:50:55.866
and we'd been hiking all day,
so we were exhausted.

00:50:55.949 --> 00:50:58.452
We couldn't see a thing in front of us.

00:50:58.535 --> 00:51:02.373
But she suddenly said
she was getting sleepy.

00:51:02.456 --> 00:51:04.958
It was because of hypothermia.

00:51:05.042 --> 00:51:08.170
If that happens on a mountain,
you're in big trouble.

00:51:08.253 --> 00:51:13.300
I forced her to stay awake
and was dragging her along

00:51:13.967 --> 00:51:16.261
when she suddenly appeared.

00:51:19.515 --> 00:51:22.226
She was a very pretty young lady.

00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:26.689
She suddenly appeared and asked,
"Would you like some help?"

00:51:27.356 --> 00:51:29.692
We thought we were seeing things.

00:51:29.775 --> 00:51:34.697
So we asked who she was
and if she was a ghost.

00:51:35.364 --> 00:51:39.868
She said she was a fox trying
to become human by doing good deeds.

00:51:39.952 --> 00:51:44.206
Anyway, she lit a fire for us
and helped us find our way.

00:51:44.289 --> 00:51:46.709
So, thankfully, we made it back alive.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.378
She said she was a fox, right?

00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:51.338
The young woman said that herself?

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:54.717
I understand if you don't believe us.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.844
But it's true.

00:51:56.927 --> 00:51:59.179
Actually, there are
a few others besides us.

00:52:00.472 --> 00:52:01.348
A few others?

00:52:01.974 --> 00:52:03.475
After the article came out,

00:52:03.559 --> 00:52:06.812
a lot of people got in touch,
not just you.

00:52:06.895 --> 00:52:10.524
They all said they were saved
by that young lady on Seoraksan Mountain.

00:52:13.652 --> 00:52:14.737
By the way,

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.030
you said there was nothing there, right?

00:52:17.114 --> 00:52:18.240
What?

00:52:18.323 --> 00:52:22.161
You said there were no shamanic items
and no Sajin Ritual Blade either.

00:52:22.244 --> 00:52:23.328
Oh, that.

00:52:23.912 --> 00:52:26.331
It was spotless,
as if someone had swept it clean.

00:52:26.415 --> 00:52:29.084
Who could have cleaned the place up
overnight like that?

00:52:29.835 --> 00:52:32.087
Maybe those guys came and went last night.

00:52:32.171 --> 00:52:33.338
Not likely.

00:52:34.089 --> 00:52:36.216
They wouldn't know that I've become human.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.552
Why would they risk going back there?

00:52:38.635 --> 00:52:40.179
And how could they have known

00:52:40.262 --> 00:52:42.806
that you were stupid enough
to leave the dagger?

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:44.266
Hey!

00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:46.226
Come on, that's not the point.

00:52:47.352 --> 00:52:49.730
What do you think
about what I said earlier?

00:52:49.813 --> 00:52:53.817
If we find that fox on the mountain,
couldn't she turn things back to normal?

00:52:54.568 --> 00:52:56.028
Don't you think it's strange?

00:52:56.111 --> 00:52:57.196
What is?

00:52:57.279 --> 00:53:00.324
A deserted construction site wiped clean,

00:53:00.407 --> 00:53:02.868
and a newspaper scrap
about a nine-tailed fox

00:53:02.951 --> 00:53:05.788
lying around
as if it were deliberately left there.

00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:08.248
I guess…

00:53:10.042 --> 00:53:10.918
Take it out.

00:53:12.669 --> 00:53:14.171
Sure.

00:53:20.469 --> 00:53:22.387
COUPLE SAVED BY NINE-TAILED FOX…

00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:23.806
SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1997

00:53:25.682 --> 00:53:28.101
See? I knew it.

00:53:28.852 --> 00:53:29.937
What?

00:53:30.437 --> 00:53:31.396
Look at the date.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.397
NOVEMBER 16, 1997

00:53:32.481 --> 00:53:34.191
This newspaper is over 20 years old.

00:53:34.274 --> 00:53:36.985
Isn't this a bit too convenient
to be a coincidence?

00:53:37.528 --> 00:53:39.988
Someone is pulling the strings here.

00:53:40.072 --> 00:53:41.448
Who?

00:53:43.283 --> 00:53:45.035
Probably those guys up there.

00:53:46.286 --> 00:53:48.372
That's just how deities treat humans.

00:53:48.455 --> 00:53:51.834
Under the pretext of things like
fate or coincidence,

00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:53.710
they manipulate humans however they want.

00:53:54.628 --> 00:53:58.966
So there's no nine-tailed fox
on Seoraksan Mountain?

00:54:00.259 --> 00:54:01.510
I wouldn't know.

00:54:01.593 --> 00:54:05.472
Whether there's an actual nine-tailed fox
and they're sending us there,

00:54:06.223 --> 00:54:08.141
or if there's another reason for this.

00:54:09.226 --> 00:54:10.143
Let's go.

00:54:10.227 --> 00:54:13.981
I need to see for myself
what they're up to.

00:54:41.383 --> 00:54:42.426
Is that Park Bi-ryong?

00:54:44.136 --> 00:54:45.596
How nice.

00:54:48.223 --> 00:54:49.349
Do you know this bear?

00:54:56.857 --> 00:54:59.234
The sun will be setting soon.

00:55:00.402 --> 00:55:04.031
Wouldn't it be better to sleep nearby
and hike up tomorrow?

00:55:04.114 --> 00:55:06.241
We're trying to get stranded anyway.

00:55:07.743 --> 00:55:10.162
But aren't we a little unprepared?

00:55:10.245 --> 00:55:12.247
You do have a plan, right?

00:55:14.541 --> 00:55:18.170
It's just one night on a mountain.
Why are you making such a fuss?

00:55:18.253 --> 00:55:19.713
Have you forgotten who I am?

00:55:19.796 --> 00:55:21.673
I lived on a mountain for centuries.

00:55:23.133 --> 00:55:24.384
Just follow me.

00:55:31.767 --> 00:55:32.726
Wait for me.

00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:45.614
Are you all right?

00:55:46.406 --> 00:55:49.076
Go. Just keep going.

00:55:54.665 --> 00:55:59.002
Eat this and hang in there.
You're still so young.

00:56:04.341 --> 00:56:07.678
Just how much steeper does this get?

00:56:08.387 --> 00:56:11.264
This useless human body.

00:56:28.699 --> 00:56:30.075
Hey, young man!

00:56:31.118 --> 00:56:33.036
- Take these with you.
- Pardon?

00:56:34.287 --> 00:56:36.873
- No, I'm okay.
- Just take them with you.

00:56:37.499 --> 00:56:38.583
And also…

00:56:42.087 --> 00:56:43.505
Here, take this.

00:56:45.841 --> 00:56:47.634
If you give all of this to me…

00:56:47.718 --> 00:56:48.927
It's fine.

00:56:50.512 --> 00:56:51.638
But…

00:56:54.307 --> 00:56:56.435
What's wrong with humans today?

00:56:57.394 --> 00:56:58.812
They keep giving us things,

00:56:58.895 --> 00:57:01.523
looking at us with teary eyes,
and holding our hands.

00:57:02.357 --> 00:57:04.109
Do we look that pathetic?

00:57:07.904 --> 00:57:08.780
Excuse me!

00:57:10.741 --> 00:57:11.700
Hold on a second.

00:57:14.703 --> 00:57:16.705
Yes? How can I help you?

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:18.290
We received a report.

00:57:22.794 --> 00:57:24.671
I'm telling you, it's not like that.

00:57:24.755 --> 00:57:26.923
Who said anyone was going to die?

00:57:27.466 --> 00:57:29.384
- Jeez.
- Are you sure?

00:57:29.468 --> 00:57:32.888
If you weren't thinking such things,

00:57:32.971 --> 00:57:35.515
why would you climb the mountain
at this hour dressed like that?

00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:37.851
We've received several reports.

00:57:37.934 --> 00:57:40.228
I don't know what you're going through,

00:57:40.312 --> 00:57:42.439
but you're a young couple
with a future ahead of you.

00:57:42.522 --> 00:57:43.607
Please think it over.

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:45.108
- No--
- We're not a couple.

00:57:45.192 --> 00:57:47.527
And we're not here to die,
so just let us go.

00:57:48.528 --> 00:57:52.449
We were dragged down for nothing.
How are we supposed to get back up?

00:57:52.532 --> 00:57:53.950
You're going back up?

00:57:54.034 --> 00:57:56.745
Of course I am.
Why else would I have come this far?

00:57:56.828 --> 00:57:59.831
Goodness, you have no idea
how dangerous mountains are.

00:57:59.915 --> 00:58:03.418
Anyway, you can't go up now.
You can't see anything, and it's cold.

00:58:03.502 --> 00:58:08.131
Even expert hikers would be
in serious trouble without proper gear.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:15.722
MULLEBOGO RESTAURANT

00:58:18.016 --> 00:58:19.267
Oh man.

00:58:19.351 --> 00:58:20.477
Jeez.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.521
My goodness.

00:58:25.273 --> 00:58:27.984
I thought you lived
on a mountain for centuries.

00:58:28.819 --> 00:58:30.445
I've realized one thing for sure.

00:58:31.071 --> 00:58:32.405
I'd rather die

00:58:32.489 --> 00:58:34.658
than live as a human.

00:58:41.706 --> 00:58:44.709
It's all cooked,
so you can eat it right away.

00:58:44.793 --> 00:58:45.669
Enjoy your meal.

00:58:45.752 --> 00:58:47.045
- Thank you for the meal.
- Sure.

00:59:00.809 --> 00:59:03.687
Gosh, you're spilling everywhere.

00:59:05.564 --> 00:59:08.441
You hiked with your legs,
so why are your arms shaking?

00:59:09.442 --> 00:59:10.819
How should I know?

00:59:11.361 --> 00:59:14.197
There's not one part of my body
that doesn't hurt.

00:59:17.075 --> 00:59:18.702
Okay.

00:59:31.464 --> 00:59:32.465
Here.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.093
Say "ah."

00:59:46.104 --> 00:59:47.397
Is it good?

00:59:48.773 --> 00:59:51.443
Give me some more.
And some broth too. It's a bit dry.

00:59:57.073 --> 00:59:58.116
Here.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.457
Careful, it's hot.

01:00:08.585 --> 01:00:09.878
You've got quite an appetite.

01:00:10.795 --> 01:00:11.922
You want this?

01:00:12.422 --> 01:00:13.840
Yes, the chives too.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.510
- Please come again.
- Thank you.

01:00:23.725 --> 01:00:24.935
Are you asleep already?

01:00:25.477 --> 01:00:26.728
Jeez.

01:00:34.486 --> 01:00:36.029
She must've been really tired.

01:01:11.815 --> 01:01:14.734
Man, what on earth am I thinking?

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:18.154
Hey, wake up.

01:01:18.822 --> 01:01:21.408
Come on, wake up.

01:01:27.163 --> 01:01:28.707
What's this?

01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:31.501
Why am I suddenly…

01:02:08.955 --> 01:02:10.832
{\an8}SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY SON SUK

01:02:35.148 --> 01:02:38.026
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:39.694
{\an8}Did you have a weird dream or something?

01:02:39.778 --> 01:02:42.072
{\an8}It wasn't a dream.
It was more like a prophecy…

01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:45.784
{\an8}You seem to keep forgetting,
but you're just a human woman now.

01:02:47.744 --> 01:02:50.580
{\an8}I get it. This is like hitting
on a female. It's called flirting.

01:02:50.663 --> 01:02:51.539
{\an8}Are you nuts?

01:02:51.623 --> 01:02:54.084
{\an8}Look into the records of the car accident
from nine years ago.

01:02:54.167 --> 01:02:57.504
{\an8}Find out everything
about where he lives and what he's doing.

01:02:57.587 --> 01:02:59.339
{\an8}You can't just do this all of a sudden.

01:02:59.422 --> 01:03:01.049
{\an8}How can you do this?

01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:03.051
{\an8}Have you ever seen
any other nine-tailed foxes?

01:03:03.134 --> 01:03:05.220
{\an8}- I have.
- Are you okay?

01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:06.679
{\an8}Do you need help?

01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:11.393
Geum-ho?

01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:14.813
