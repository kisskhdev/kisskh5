{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:36.305
Please hold up.

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.465
What's wrong, scaring the guests?

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:39.665
It's fine!

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.305
Probably just a rat.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.425
- What's going on?
- There's a rat!

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:15.425
It scared me to death!

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:18.105
How come it's always you,
making a fuss over nothing?

00:02:18.785 --> 00:02:20.105
He's new here and ignorant.

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:22.705
That scream just now
was clearly from a woman.

00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:24.185
What woman?

00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:25.865
There's only this snot-nosed kid.

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:30.865
I got it! Look!

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:43.385
No telling what happened to her.

00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:49.105
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:51.225
- Taozhi!
- Run again and I'll break your legs!

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.985
What do you want from us?

00:02:53.065 --> 00:02:55.345
What's the rush?
You want a beating too, huh?

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.465
Niu.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:03.785
Now that you're here,

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:05.065
don't worry about finding work.

00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:06.785
I'll give you a guarantee right now.

00:03:08.185 --> 00:03:09.345
- What're you doing?
- Move aside!

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.185
- What're you doing?
- What're you doing?

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:16.385
Taozhi!

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:18.865
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:21.185
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:24.625
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:27.505
Come take a look!

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:30.625
Xiuhong House is really odd.

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:34.585
The silks hanging in the courtyard
are like a maze,

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:36.225
like there are people hiding everywhere.

00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:38.545
Those silk colors are chosen for a reason.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:39.785
They're to gather qi and draw in money.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:41.265
And that's not all.

00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:42.545
There are pines and cypresses
by the hall door

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:44.145
and a peachwood sword on the beam.

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.825
These props don't match the décor at all.

00:03:46.905 --> 00:03:48.425
They're all meant to boost luck
and pull in wealth.

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:51.225
What kind of embroidery house is this?

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:53.545
You can't even spot a single thread there.

00:03:54.745 --> 00:03:56.385
Do you remember
the face powder in the gutter?

00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.425
With that much powder,
there should be lots of embroiderers here.

00:04:00.505 --> 00:04:03.665
No. Embroiderers rarely wear makeup,

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:06.585
because powder falls on the frame
and stains the embroidery.

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:08.745
So you mean

00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:11.905
Xiuhong House was only dressed up
to look like an embroidery house.

00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:16.225
Taozhi!

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:18.504
Taozhi…

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:33.945
It's all my fault.

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:40.265
Why did you have to make such a scene?

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:42.705
We ex-palace maids

00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:46.385
trying to make it out here
already have it hard enough.

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:48.425
We're not like you,

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:51.465
with a brother at court to back you up.

00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:53.105
You pulled a stunt,

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.665
and all of us got dragged down with you.

00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:58.145
How is that Taozhi's fault?

00:04:58.225 --> 00:05:00.145
She did it for us too!

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:01.745
How can you be so foolish?

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:04.265
If this were legit work,

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:06.105
why won't they let us leave
once we came in?

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.905
Now they've locked us up
in this place like a cage.

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:25.745
I'd rather starve on the street

00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:29.905
than die here without knowing why.

00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:50.505
A person's fate, how it turns out
isn't just about your birth parents.

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.705
It also depends on your adoptive parents.

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:55.385
Hu Da found himself a rich godfather,

00:05:55.465 --> 00:05:57.905
so he could lend money in the palace,
and nobody dared touch him.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:05:59.505
Godfather?

00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:01.145
The wealthy merchant Sun Zhiwang.

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:03.305
The one people call Sun "Eight Wards"?

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:04.905
That's him.

00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:07.225
They say he's obsessed
with birth charts and fate.

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:09.025
He's consulted nearly every fortune-teller
in Western Capital.

00:06:09.905 --> 00:06:11.505
Even his godson couldn't dodge destiny?

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.785
You can't just pick a godfather at random.

00:06:16.905 --> 00:06:19.145
Do you remember what Hu Da once said?

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.785
Before Hanxiao left the palace,
she barely paid back the principal,

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.945
and he wiped out the remaining interest.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:27.505
A businessman, no matter how rich,

00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.425
wouldn't just erase a debt

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:30.825
and take a loss.

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:33.585
Debts have to be paid.

00:06:33.665 --> 00:06:35.425
It's just how you pay.

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:37.625
Besides lending money,

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:40.185
Hu Da also finds jobs for ex-palace maids.

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.825
He wants these women to work
and earn to pay back the usury?

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.905
Right. I heard that before
Hanxiao left the palace,

00:06:45.985 --> 00:06:47.625
she couldn't pay,
and was a wreck day and night.

00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:50.825
Then Hu Da found her a job,
and she finally relaxed.

00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:55.225
Could it be she went to Xiuhong House?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.945
Quit that.

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:40.785
RUYI

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:41.665
You're not getting out.

00:07:43.945 --> 00:07:45.465
I got here months before you.

00:07:55.065 --> 00:07:56.065
Miss,

00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:58.585
what are we doing here, exactly?

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:03.545
Once you get down to the storeroom,
you'll find out.

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:08.585
- Storeroom?
- Storeroom?

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.665
I'll get you out too.

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.145
Wannian County offices told me
the identity of Xiuhong House's owner.

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:03.425
The name's Chen Youdao.

00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:04.385
Have you seen him?

00:09:04.985 --> 00:09:07.465
No. They said
he went to Suzhou to buy silk.

00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:08.505
I checked.

00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:10.345
In Western Capital,
he only has this one business.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:11.985
His family is all in Suzhou.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:13.865
I'm afraid this man doesn't even exist.

00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:15.065
Come with me.

00:09:18.505 --> 00:09:19.585
Where is Sun Zhiwang from?

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.305
Same as the owner
of Xiuhong House, Suzhou.

00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:25.505
That "owner" was likely hired
by Sun Zhiwang to throw people off.

00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:28.145
We have to look
into this Sun "Eight Wards".

00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:30.305
This time, no visit.
Let's go straight in and take him.

00:09:30.385 --> 00:09:32.385
"Take him" is a bit rough.

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:34.105
If we pay a call and he won't see us,

00:09:34.185 --> 00:09:35.785
then we'll make him invite us.

00:09:37.385 --> 00:09:38.425
ZUIXIAN HOUSE

00:09:38.505 --> 00:09:39.705
Make way!

00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:46.105
Get out of here!
Stop forcing me to call the authorities!

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.105
No need to bother. I am the authority.

00:09:49.825 --> 00:09:50.945
FUCHANG COUNTY PRINCESS BADGE

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:54.745
Madam, you came at the perfect time.

00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:58.545
This street con man is scamming
free food at our place!

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.785
What "immortal master" are you,
stirring up trouble here?

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:08.785
Immortal Master Wuwang from Mount Shennan.

00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:12.545
What immortal master? He's a fraud!

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:15.105
Easy. Let's talk. What happened?

00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:16.745
An hour ago,

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:19.585
this guy swaggered in
like he owned the place.

00:10:19.665 --> 00:10:21.825
I hurried over to greet him.

00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:24.345
Sir, what would you like today?

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.665
We've got live fish.

00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:27.945
He looked like a real immortal!

00:10:28.785 --> 00:10:31.145
- What was he holding in his hand?
- No idea.

00:10:57.025 --> 00:11:00.505
Sir, another crooked "sorcerer" here

00:11:00.585 --> 00:11:01.745
to mooch a free meal.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:14.065
- What bad luck!
- I'm not eating!

00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:16.025
LIQUOR

00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:23.745
Immortal Master, why the sigh?

00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:29.345
Immortal Master, please sit.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.825
Please.

00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:43.305
What did you see just now?

00:11:43.945 --> 00:11:46.305
Could you give us a hint?

00:11:48.345 --> 00:11:50.745
Illusion melts away.

00:11:51.425 --> 00:11:54.145
Splendor fades to nothing.

00:11:54.745 --> 00:11:56.225
This place is full of bad feng shui.

00:11:56.905 --> 00:11:59.465
The owner's been having a rough time,
no sleep at night.

00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:01.505
Evil is stirring,

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.025
wrecking fate and draining money.

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:06.865
Soon, there'll be a major disaster.

00:12:10.065 --> 00:12:11.105
Immortal Master,

00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:15.145
our master cares most about layout.

00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:17.105
Look at what we've put here.

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:20.865
Which one isn't meant
to bring luck and wealth?

00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:23.105
Business here is booming!

00:12:23.185 --> 00:12:24.345
Exactly!

00:12:25.185 --> 00:12:27.105
If you truly see something,

00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:29.545
please tell us plainly.

00:12:46.585 --> 00:12:48.785
"Hu"… All in vain…

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:54.105
Has your Master Hu
run into any trouble lately?

00:12:54.185 --> 00:12:56.265
Nonsense!

00:12:56.345 --> 00:12:58.945
Our master's surname is Sun, not Hu.

00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:04.545
What should we call you, Immortal Master?

00:13:05.225 --> 00:13:07.905
Immortal Master Wuwang from Mount Shennan.

00:13:08.945 --> 00:13:10.665
Could you be a bit more specific?

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:13.225
So I can report to my master.

00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:16.025
Your master isn't surnamed Hu?

00:13:17.185 --> 00:13:18.745
Perhaps I misread it.

00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:21.945
Immortal Master, wait.

00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.385
Quick! Serve the best dishes.

00:13:24.465 --> 00:13:25.785
Don't you dare slight him.

00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:29.185
- Go!
- Understood.

00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:31.945
We treated him with full respect,

00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:32.945
and what does he do?

00:13:33.025 --> 00:13:36.025
Sits there without a word, just eats.

00:13:36.105 --> 00:13:38.585
No explanations, and he won't pay either.

00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:41.505
And what he said
was all so vague and mystical.

00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:44.305
He only picked the nastiest things to say.

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:45.865
He even cursed us!

00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:47.665
That's when I got into it with him.

00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:51.985
You ate their food. Why didn't you pay?

00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:55.025
I didn't order any of it.

00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:56.945
They brought it over and insisted I eat.

00:13:57.025 --> 00:14:00.265
After I finished, they told me to pay.

00:14:00.345 --> 00:14:02.425
This money, I can't give.

00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:03.585
And I can't afford it.

00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:05.265
Fine, you don't need to.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:08.145
But since you claim
their master has evil omens,

00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:10.065
then tell us how to fix it too.

00:14:12.065 --> 00:14:13.225
I'm not keeping it from you,

00:14:13.865 --> 00:14:16.465
but this evil omen is too strange.

00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:18.625
It's not something
you can fix in a moment.

00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:24.505
Or are you just making it up,
scamming free food?

00:14:25.225 --> 00:14:26.785
Madam,

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.545
throw those chopsticks,

00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:30.025
and you'll know if I'm a fraud.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.825
Looks like lately,

00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:41.065
you haven't had much luck either.

00:14:41.705 --> 00:14:43.785
Everywhere you turn, it's a death case.

00:14:43.865 --> 00:14:46.745
The clues keep snapping off.

00:14:50.225 --> 00:14:51.585
Not bad.

00:14:51.665 --> 00:14:53.305
But with just that,

00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:55.185
you're not worth
one meal at Zuixian House.

00:14:55.865 --> 00:14:57.505
Exactly. You leave things half-done.

00:14:57.585 --> 00:14:59.185
What kind of skill is that?

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.305
What else can you see, Immortal Master?

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:03.345
You really wish to know?

00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:04.505
Of course.

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.505
Lake over Wind,
the Great Exceeding hexagram.

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:25.025
Fool clings to a dream within a dream.

00:15:25.105 --> 00:15:27.065
What's sought outside is hard to redeem.

00:15:27.145 --> 00:15:30.145
This sign says,
"Good things stay out of reach.

00:15:30.225 --> 00:15:31.145
Release your grip, and cease to seek."

00:15:31.825 --> 00:15:33.705
Seems like you have something

00:15:33.785 --> 00:15:36.825
you can't hold on to, yet can't let go of.

00:15:36.905 --> 00:15:39.905
You're lost, but you can't tell anyone.

00:15:39.985 --> 00:15:41.705
The knot in your heart won't untie.

00:15:50.945 --> 00:15:52.505
Does that count as a meal?

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:03.505
They're coming out!

00:16:03.585 --> 00:16:05.345
- They're coming out!
- He's right on the mark!

00:16:05.425 --> 00:16:07.545
Unbelievable. Her face even changed.

00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:09.905
Stop staring! Move along!

00:16:09.985 --> 00:16:10.825
What's her problem?

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.505
- Hey!
- All right.

00:16:15.585 --> 00:16:17.505
Consider it the Lady covering your meal.

00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:26.185
Immortal Master! Immortal Master!

00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:28.625
Immortal Master, wait.

00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:30.545
We were rude just now.

00:16:31.225 --> 00:16:34.905
Our master invites you upstairs
for a talk.

00:16:45.025 --> 00:16:47.505
Sorry. I can't get involved.

00:16:48.385 --> 00:16:50.665
Immortal Master… Immortal Master!

00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:57.025
Why's there only chicken and no wine?

00:16:57.105 --> 00:16:58.825
Drink less.

00:16:58.905 --> 00:17:01.025
You'll drink your brain rotten
and turn into a useless old wreck.

00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:02.585
How am I supposed to count on you then?

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:10.944
What I said in the divination verse
was pure nonsense.

00:17:11.025 --> 00:17:13.505
If I offended you,
I hope you'll forgive me.

00:17:15.224 --> 00:17:16.944
Seems my acting was pretty good.

00:17:17.025 --> 00:17:18.944
Even you got scared.

00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:21.545
You scared me too.

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:24.305
I thought Mr. Xiao really hit something.

00:17:25.025 --> 00:17:27.505
If even you bought it, then everyone there

00:17:27.585 --> 00:17:29.385
won't doubt our "Immortal Master."

00:17:31.785 --> 00:17:35.065
Well… So the one you click with best now

00:17:35.145 --> 00:17:36.265
isn't me anymore.

00:17:39.025 --> 00:17:41.105
That's just acting.

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:43.905
Since "Immortal Master Wuwang"
was talking nonsense,

00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:45.305
I had to make it look real.

00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:48.265
Mr. Xiao, what on earth did you say?

00:17:48.345 --> 00:17:50.425
Mr. Xiao cast a hexagram

00:17:50.505 --> 00:17:53.545
and said Inspector Du asks
too many questions,

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:54.545
so he'll end up in Tongue-Pulling Hell.

00:17:55.145 --> 00:17:56.625
You little lunatic!

00:17:56.705 --> 00:18:00.545
Cut the nonsense,
or you'll meet me right there!

00:18:01.785 --> 00:18:02.785
Look at her.

00:18:05.225 --> 00:18:06.505
What do we do next?

00:18:08.065 --> 00:18:09.785
The show's already started.

00:18:10.425 --> 00:18:11.385
Don't rush.

00:18:24.105 --> 00:18:24.985
Who is it?

00:18:27.385 --> 00:18:28.665
- Godfather…
- Who?

00:18:31.505 --> 00:18:32.985
- Godfather…
- Get away!

00:18:33.065 --> 00:18:34.505
Give me my life back!

00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:42.825
{\an8}SUN'S MANSION

00:19:07.465 --> 00:19:08.665
He took the bait?

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:13.585
We got a bonus.

00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:24.825
ACCOUNT BOOK

00:19:25.745 --> 00:19:27.345
Disguising the account book like this…

00:19:27.425 --> 00:19:28.985
Hu Da really is something.

00:19:30.225 --> 00:19:32.505
So many palace maids
borrowed money from Hu Da?

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:34.265
And the interest is insane.

00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:36.265
On a maid's monthly pay,
there's no way they could repay it.

00:19:36.345 --> 00:19:37.945
MONEY LENT TO HANXIAO

00:19:38.025 --> 00:19:40.025
Then how did these maids pay it off?

00:19:40.105 --> 00:19:41.465
Their names were crossed out.

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:45.825
But in the deposit records,
their names aren't there at all.

00:19:48.985 --> 00:19:49.705
HANXIAO

00:19:49.785 --> 00:19:52.105
Found it. Hanxiao's name
was crossed out too.

00:19:53.465 --> 00:19:55.465
So they really made them work to repay it?

00:19:56.785 --> 00:19:58.065
I'll check where these women ended up.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.625
Xiuhong House
and Sun's Mansion are far apart.

00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:04.065
That day, Hu Da had no time
to deliver the account book there.

00:20:04.145 --> 00:20:07.745
So it seems Xiuhong House
must be tied to Sun Zhiwang.

00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:12.585
SUN ZHIWANG, WESTERN CAPITAL'S RICHEST

00:20:12.665 --> 00:20:14.705
A ghost!

00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:17.625
Master, easy!

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:20.505
There's nothing unusual in the room.

00:20:20.585 --> 00:20:22.865
The men thoroughly searched the courtyard.

00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:23.785
There's nothing odd.

00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:26.625
It was Hu Da! Hu Da is back!

00:20:27.385 --> 00:20:29.345
His face was covered in blood,
and he tried to bite me!

00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:32.625
Where's my peachwood sword?
Where's my talisman?

00:20:32.705 --> 00:20:34.265
- Hurry!
- Bring the peachwood sword and talisman!

00:20:34.345 --> 00:20:35.625
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

00:20:36.545 --> 00:20:37.905
Master, your peachwood sword.

00:20:41.945 --> 00:20:44.505
- Realgar wine! Realgar wine!
- Bring the wine!

00:20:44.585 --> 00:20:45.425
REALGAR WINE

00:20:47.785 --> 00:20:48.865
Master.

00:20:49.385 --> 00:20:50.065
JIANG TINGWEI, GUARD

00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:54.145
The storm outside likely stirred up
those troubled dreams, Master.

00:20:57.105 --> 00:20:58.345
It wasn't a dream!

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:03.465
Go. Bring that Immortal Master
from today to me.

00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:17.145
SUN'S MANSION

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.465
Take me to see your master.

00:21:43.945 --> 00:21:46.825
That day, we were impolite
at Zuixian House.

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:48.985
Please don't take offense.

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:51.425
The dead had an unsettled grudge with you.

00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:54.065
I was also guided here by fate itself.

00:21:54.145 --> 00:21:55.225
No need to worry, Mr. Sun.

00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:15.825
Where bright qi stays,

00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:18.225
dark shadows creep.

00:22:18.825 --> 00:22:20.305
This blame is not the one you see.

00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:24.385
From long-held grudges,
deeper spite is sown.

00:22:26.385 --> 00:22:27.345
What does that mean?

00:22:27.945 --> 00:22:30.225
Mr. Sun, lately, your business
has run into some trouble, right?

00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:35.105
The man's death wasn't due to
his destined calamity, but because of you.

00:22:35.185 --> 00:22:37.025
One of your properties
has too much yin qi,

00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:38.105
suppressing your fortune.

00:22:38.705 --> 00:22:41.785
First it hits your children,
then it harms you.

00:22:41.865 --> 00:22:45.625
You must trace it to the source
to break the evil.

00:22:48.665 --> 00:22:51.465
Immortal Master,
can you tell which property it is?

00:23:02.145 --> 00:23:05.545
You already have an answer. Why ask me?

00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:09.665
Prepare the carriage, now!

00:23:09.745 --> 00:23:10.705
Master.

00:23:13.665 --> 00:23:15.185
Immortal Attendant,

00:23:15.265 --> 00:23:18.705
may you lift your veil
and show us your face?

00:23:18.785 --> 00:23:20.425
My attendant's face

00:23:20.505 --> 00:23:22.025
is not to be shown.

00:23:22.105 --> 00:23:24.945
I've never seen
an immortal attendant dressed like this.

00:23:26.105 --> 00:23:28.025
I'm truly curious.

00:23:44.465 --> 00:23:47.025
My attendant's eyes
are strange from birth.

00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:48.305
Not fit to be seen.

00:23:49.425 --> 00:23:50.505
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Sun.

00:23:51.585 --> 00:23:53.105
My servant offended you. Sorry.

00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:55.545
Tingwei, how rude!

00:23:56.465 --> 00:23:58.785
Immortal Master, then let's set off.

00:23:59.425 --> 00:24:00.545
But…

00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:02.945
I have one more request.

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:16.585
Covering your eyes
is by no means disrespect.

00:24:17.345 --> 00:24:18.625
My godson died suddenly.

00:24:18.705 --> 00:24:21.425
It has already stirred up quite a storm
in Western Capital.

00:24:21.505 --> 00:24:24.465
If people also learn that I hired
an Immortal Master to drive out evil…

00:24:24.545 --> 00:24:26.625
You're worried word will get out,

00:24:27.145 --> 00:24:28.665
and guests will get uneasy,

00:24:28.745 --> 00:24:30.865
- hurting your business.
- Yes.

00:24:31.705 --> 00:24:33.345
You see right through me.

00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:48.425
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:25:01.785 --> 00:25:02.625
Immortal Master.

00:25:11.185 --> 00:25:12.265
Please light incense for Immortal Master.

00:25:24.585 --> 00:25:25.425
Let's begin.

00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:27.865
This estate is quite large.

00:25:27.945 --> 00:25:30.785
Immortal Master,
I beg you leave no detail unchecked,

00:25:30.865 --> 00:25:32.705
and sweep away every evil.

00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:36.745
- Don't miss a thing.
- Don't worry.

00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:39.745
This way, please.

00:25:50.505 --> 00:25:52.305
Watch your step.

00:26:08.345 --> 00:26:09.225
East four.

00:26:15.505 --> 00:26:16.345
South two.

00:26:19.825 --> 00:26:21.105
North seven.

00:26:28.865 --> 00:26:30.145
We're going in circles.

00:26:51.865 --> 00:26:53.465
Watch your step!

00:27:16.585 --> 00:27:19.665
There's a lot in the room. Careful.

00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:36.665
By sacred decree,
the sun ascends the east.

00:27:36.745 --> 00:27:40.145
This charm I grant, all ill to cease.

00:28:06.345 --> 00:28:08.185
Immortal Master, anything unusual?

00:28:11.305 --> 00:28:13.505
My breath exhales the mountain's fire.

00:28:14.265 --> 00:28:15.785
The talisman's light
seals the door, the space entire.

00:28:16.465 --> 00:28:17.825
Sweep specters from on high.

00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:21.065
Through ages piled, let plagues pass by.

00:28:21.665 --> 00:28:22.625
I take the Vajra's might inside,

00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:26.785
subduing all fiends,
turning harm to blessings wide.

00:28:33.585 --> 00:28:36.985
Immortal Attendant, why aren't you
following the Immortal Master?

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:42.545
Make noise again, and I'll kill you!

00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:53.985
Immortal Master,
there seems to be evil here.

00:28:58.025 --> 00:28:58.905
The evil is gone.

00:29:01.505 --> 00:29:04.065
Immortal Master,
shall we go to the next place?

00:29:11.425 --> 00:29:14.105
{\an8}SUN'S MANSION

00:29:14.865 --> 00:29:17.585
You can take the blindfolds off now.

00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:25.745
Immortal Master, please accept this.

00:29:28.265 --> 00:29:31.145
My bond with you is not for money.

00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:32.265
No need to spend.

00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:36.345
Such noble virtue from you

00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:41.265
only fills me with fear
and unrest in my heart.

00:29:41.345 --> 00:29:42.705
In that case,

00:29:43.545 --> 00:29:47.305
may I ask you for 12 copper coins,
to soothe your heart?

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:48.585
Fine!

00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:49.825
Fine!

00:29:55.905 --> 00:30:00.345
Immortal Master, has the evil
been completely cleared?

00:30:00.425 --> 00:30:01.665
One step remains.

00:30:01.745 --> 00:30:04.705
Tonight at You Hour,
it's an auspicious day and time.

00:30:04.785 --> 00:30:07.785
You must host a banquet for old guests
to bring in lucky joy.

00:30:07.865 --> 00:30:10.545
Only then is the evil truly gone.

00:30:11.145 --> 00:30:15.105
From then on, you'll prosper,
go smoothly, and keep rising.

00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:18.945
You Hour?

00:30:24.545 --> 00:30:25.945
I'll follow your arrangement.

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:28.945
Please prepare an empty room for me

00:30:29.025 --> 00:30:30.625
in the southwest corner
of the first floor.

00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:32.945
Before You Hour,
I need to set up the offerings

00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:34.345
in that room.

00:30:34.425 --> 00:30:36.745
Then, all the rite to drive out evil

00:30:36.825 --> 00:30:39.825
and bring luck and wealth
will be complete.

00:30:42.625 --> 00:30:43.985
Thank you, Immortal Master.

00:30:44.065 --> 00:30:45.185
Farewell.

00:31:13.465 --> 00:31:15.425
Sun Zhiwang's guard was so cautious.

00:31:15.505 --> 00:31:18.305
It's basically telling us outright
Xiuhong House is hiding something.

00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:21.225
That strange noise on the second floor
must mean trouble.

00:31:21.305 --> 00:31:23.305
That room was packed
with embroidery frames.

00:31:23.385 --> 00:31:24.705
It should be the embroidery room.

00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:27.305
Too bad we were blindfolded.
I have no idea which room it was.

00:31:27.905 --> 00:31:29.345
I secretly scattered
incense ash along the way,

00:31:29.425 --> 00:31:31.705
but the scent
was covered by soapnut water.

00:31:31.785 --> 00:31:34.665
Clearly, wherever we walked,
they'd clean it up at once.

00:31:35.265 --> 00:31:36.225
They're careful.

00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:38.025
It's the easternmost room
on the south side.

00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:39.585
- What?
- The embroidery room

00:31:39.665 --> 00:31:41.705
is in the far east room, south side,
second floor.

00:31:43.585 --> 00:31:47.785
Mr. Xiao, have you got magic
or a third eye?

00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:49.025
Neither.

00:31:49.105 --> 00:31:52.025
When we reached the second floor,
Jiang Tingwei immediately led us left.

00:31:52.105 --> 00:31:53.425
The first time we visited Xiuhong House,

00:31:53.505 --> 00:31:56.305
I noticed there are two stairways
up to the second floor.

00:31:56.385 --> 00:31:57.545
But if you turn left after going up,

00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:59.985
only the southwest one
connects to the corridor.

00:32:00.065 --> 00:32:01.625
So once we got upstairs,

00:32:01.705 --> 00:32:04.745
we walked the south corridor
from west to east.

00:32:05.385 --> 00:32:07.185
When Jiang Tingwei
led us away from the embroidery room,

00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:08.105
he first turned us east.

00:32:08.185 --> 00:32:10.705
Then after just a few steps,
he had us turn north.

00:32:10.785 --> 00:32:13.225
That means the embroidery room
sits at the far eastern end

00:32:13.305 --> 00:32:14.065
of the south corridor.

00:32:15.545 --> 00:32:18.425
Next time, just say you've got magic.

00:32:22.345 --> 00:32:23.305
Someone's following us.

00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:35.185
- Split up.
- Don't panic.

00:32:35.865 --> 00:32:36.985
Put on your fake eyes.

00:32:38.825 --> 00:32:41.545
Oh no, my master only gave me one pair.

00:32:41.625 --> 00:32:42.705
I don't have a spare.

00:32:54.825 --> 00:32:55.945
Immortal Master.

00:32:56.025 --> 00:32:57.905
Your master didn't send you, did he?

00:32:57.985 --> 00:33:00.105
You're truly something.

00:33:00.185 --> 00:33:01.665
It has nothing to do with my master.

00:33:01.745 --> 00:33:02.825
What is it?

00:33:04.025 --> 00:33:06.425
I have something
to ask Immortal Attendant.

00:33:07.025 --> 00:33:08.545
Ask away.

00:33:09.865 --> 00:33:10.865
Immortal Attendant,

00:33:11.505 --> 00:33:13.825
may I see your eyes again?

00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:16.665
Actually,

00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:19.465
I know a traveling physician
who's best at treating eye problems.

00:33:19.545 --> 00:33:20.905
I can introduce him to you.

00:33:20.985 --> 00:33:22.545
It would be a good deed

00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:24.865
and earn me blessings.

00:33:24.945 --> 00:33:27.505
So please, do me this favor.

00:33:33.265 --> 00:33:35.345
- Ignorant.
- What's wrong?

00:33:35.425 --> 00:33:38.545
To insist like a rogue, isn't it cruel?

00:33:40.505 --> 00:33:41.545
Let's go.

00:33:59.745 --> 00:34:00.585
He won't follow again.

00:34:01.625 --> 00:34:03.505
Thanks for getting me out of that.

00:34:03.585 --> 00:34:05.145
I was getting Jiang Tingwei out of it.

00:34:05.225 --> 00:34:07.545
Otherwise, today,
he would've had a rough time.

00:34:09.865 --> 00:34:12.465
After all that mystic act,
I'm starving now.

00:34:12.545 --> 00:34:15.744
Earlier, why didn't you take
Sun "Eight Wards"'s money?

00:34:15.824 --> 00:34:17.264
We could've feasted at Yunchui House.

00:34:18.105 --> 00:34:20.025
Sun Zhiwang's guard
was already suspicious.

00:34:20.105 --> 00:34:22.744
If we took the money,
they'd get even more wary.

00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:24.145
We're not short on cash.

00:34:24.225 --> 00:34:26.945
I want the guilty to pay the real price.

00:34:29.425 --> 00:34:31.105
You think far ahead.

00:34:31.185 --> 00:34:34.744
But next time, remember to claim my half.

00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:36.025
Real silver is what counts.

00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:41.705
These copper coins are to pay you back.

00:34:41.784 --> 00:34:44.304
Last time at Zuixian House,
you covered the bill for me.

00:34:46.425 --> 00:34:47.665
They say

00:34:47.744 --> 00:34:50.105
diviners take on a share
of fate's consequences too.

00:34:50.185 --> 00:34:51.625
Taking money helps ward off the bad luck.

00:34:52.264 --> 00:34:54.784
Consider this money
your fee for reading my fortune.

00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:57.425
The divination was just an act.

00:34:58.265 --> 00:34:59.345
You took it seriously?

00:35:03.425 --> 00:35:06.385
You really aren't tempted by money.

00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:07.545
I was being petty.

00:35:15.305 --> 00:35:16.185
Thanks!

00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:21.705
Thanks!

00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:24.865
Idiot!

00:35:24.945 --> 00:35:27.625
Last time, you were jumping at shadows
and drove an Immortal Master away.

00:35:27.705 --> 00:35:29.185
Haven't you learned your lesson?

00:35:29.265 --> 00:35:31.705
If you mess this up,
can you take the consequences?

00:35:32.305 --> 00:35:33.345
Master,

00:35:34.185 --> 00:35:36.745
do you really believe
that Immortal Master Wuwang?

00:35:36.825 --> 00:35:40.225
Not long after Hu Da died,
they showed up at Zuixian House.

00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:41.745
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

00:35:41.825 --> 00:35:43.465
He said

00:35:43.545 --> 00:35:46.025
only after he arrived
that he sensed the bad qi.

00:35:46.105 --> 00:35:47.745
That divination verse hinting at "Hu"

00:35:47.825 --> 00:35:50.345
was something he cast himself!

00:35:50.945 --> 00:35:53.665
They could've known Hu Da for a long time.

00:35:57.305 --> 00:35:58.905
Hu Da was a nasty piece of work.

00:35:58.985 --> 00:36:01.345
He must've offended plenty of people.

00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:03.425
You keep a low profile,

00:36:03.505 --> 00:36:05.745
but who's to say
Hu Da didn't brag everywhere

00:36:05.825 --> 00:36:06.985
about his ties to you?

00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:09.545
If someone with an agenda noticed,

00:36:10.665 --> 00:36:12.785
they might use it to stir trouble.

00:36:14.785 --> 00:36:16.105
If it was for money,

00:36:16.705 --> 00:36:18.585
I prepared a huge reward earlier,

00:36:19.545 --> 00:36:20.745
but he didn't take it.

00:36:23.665 --> 00:36:25.505
But if it's not for money,

00:36:27.025 --> 00:36:29.465
then he may be after something bigger.

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:40.825
My master said you may remove
the blindfolds in this room.

00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:52.545
Sir.

00:36:55.745 --> 00:36:58.185
The dead man died young, never married.

00:36:58.265 --> 00:37:00.785
So we're offering him a virgin girl
to soothe his resentment.

00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:03.705
You really gave him what he wanted!

00:37:04.225 --> 00:37:05.305
Please watch your mouth.

00:37:10.905 --> 00:37:12.145
‪YU JIAN ER‪ APOTROPAIC TALISMAN

00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:19.865
Put it on the front door. I can't go out.

00:37:19.945 --> 00:37:21.185
Please do it for me.

00:37:42.665 --> 00:37:43.825
Leave these offerings in the room.

00:37:43.905 --> 00:37:45.385
At dawn tomorrow, carry them out.

00:37:46.705 --> 00:37:48.145
Find a proper place and burn them.

00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:49.785
Then you can rest easy.

00:37:53.265 --> 00:37:54.545
It's to ward off evil.

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.105
The rite is complete. Please send us out.

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:13.625
This way, please.

00:38:34.905 --> 00:38:35.985
Careful.

00:38:46.985 --> 00:38:48.665
Peiyi won't be found, will she?

00:38:48.745 --> 00:38:50.985
No need to worry. Thanks for your help.

00:38:55.225 --> 00:38:59.505
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:39:16.705 --> 00:39:18.025
Sun Zhiwang is so superstitious.

00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:19.625
He specifically told us to miss no corner

00:39:19.705 --> 00:39:20.985
when driving out evil.

00:39:21.985 --> 00:39:23.865
So this room
right next to the embroidery room

00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:24.785
has to be hiding something.

00:39:37.785 --> 00:39:40.665
From these two spots, we can watch
the carriages coming in and out,

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:41.705
or anyone suspicious.

00:39:41.785 --> 00:39:42.665
You take one, I'll take the other.

00:39:43.665 --> 00:39:45.185
- Then Her Ladyship--
- She and I agreed.

00:39:45.265 --> 00:39:46.985
This time, we only scout the place,

00:39:47.065 --> 00:39:48.865
find out what Xiuhong House
is really doing here,

00:39:48.945 --> 00:39:50.025
and we won't act rashly.

00:39:50.905 --> 00:39:53.505
I've arranged it.
Once You Hour starts, every ke,

00:39:53.585 --> 00:39:55.705
the watchman will call the time
outside Xiuhong House.

00:39:55.785 --> 00:39:58.505
By the third ke of You Hour at the latest,
she has to come out.

00:39:58.585 --> 00:40:00.305
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:40:16.665 --> 00:40:17.585
I smell incense powder!

00:40:43.305 --> 00:40:44.665
Who are you?

00:41:35.225 --> 00:41:36.625
I hate people who sneak attack.

00:41:37.345 --> 00:41:39.905
You never thought
you'd end up as a bench, did you?

00:41:40.505 --> 00:41:41.545
Let go of me!

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:43.785
Then answer my question.

00:41:44.905 --> 00:41:46.905
Behind the embroidery room wall
lies a secret room.

00:41:46.985 --> 00:41:49.145
Its entrance is hidden in the east room.

00:41:49.225 --> 00:41:50.705
And to cover their tracks,

00:41:50.785 --> 00:41:52.705
you've made a hidden door.

00:41:52.785 --> 00:41:54.505
Am I right?

00:41:54.585 --> 00:41:57.185
If you already know,
why waste your breath on me?

00:41:57.785 --> 00:41:58.945
Because I've got more to ask.

00:42:05.545 --> 00:42:06.705
The banquet's about to start,

00:42:07.785 --> 00:42:09.945
yet the whole house is this quiet.

00:42:11.905 --> 00:42:13.585
So where did you hide the place

00:42:13.665 --> 00:42:15.185
you're hosting your guests?

00:42:16.905 --> 00:42:18.065
Who are you, really?

00:42:18.665 --> 00:42:20.305
You won't answer a single thing I ask,

00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:21.505
yet you're questioning me instead?

00:42:23.145 --> 00:42:24.785
Even if I tell you,

00:42:24.865 --> 00:42:27.065
do you think you'll live to find it?

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.305
Why waste time on threats?

00:42:32.105 --> 00:42:35.265
Don't worry. If I die,

00:42:35.345 --> 00:42:37.745
you'll keep me company in the underworld.

00:42:51.105 --> 00:42:52.825
Your eyes are beautiful,

00:42:52.905 --> 00:42:55.265
but they've seen too much filth.

00:42:55.865 --> 00:42:57.465
Since you won't spill anything…

00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:03.745
Madam, your tea and snacks.

00:43:11.985 --> 00:43:13.265
Why's it suddenly so lively there?

00:43:14.465 --> 00:43:15.545
The master had a son.

00:43:15.625 --> 00:43:17.385
He's in a great mood,
so it's on the house for everyone.

00:43:17.465 --> 00:43:18.985
Free wine, free dishes,
free wedding cakes.

00:43:19.065 --> 00:43:21.185
- Waiter!
- Coming!

00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:26.385
Bravo!

00:43:27.065 --> 00:43:28.265
Oh no…

00:43:40.185 --> 00:43:42.425
- Your Ladyship…
- You know me?

00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:44.945
I heard my brother mention you.

00:43:46.025 --> 00:43:47.265
Who's your brother?

00:43:47.945 --> 00:43:50.945
Gu Lingzhou, Prosecutor
of the Court of Judicial Review.

00:43:53.145 --> 00:43:54.505
How did you end up trapped here?

00:43:55.025 --> 00:43:56.305
Don't be afraid. I'll get you out.

00:43:57.185 --> 00:43:58.425
Don't worry about me.

00:43:58.505 --> 00:44:00.425
There are other girls.
They took them away.

00:44:01.425 --> 00:44:03.625
Your Ladyship, please go save them!

00:44:08.225 --> 00:44:09.065
‪XIUHONG HOUSE

00:44:13.265 --> 00:44:14.385
Make way!

00:44:19.265 --> 00:44:21.105
- What's the situation?
- The crowd's too thick.

00:44:21.185 --> 00:44:22.025
- I couldn't make out
- Bravo!

00:44:22.105 --> 00:44:23.265
who was coming or going.

00:44:23.865 --> 00:44:25.265
It's already past
the second ke of You Hour.

00:44:25.345 --> 00:44:26.745
She probably can't hear the watchman.

00:44:27.705 --> 00:44:29.345
What do we do now, wait for the third ke?
