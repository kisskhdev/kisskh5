WEBVTT

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:32.366
Hey, hey, look, look!
That person looks like a prince, right?

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:36.367
True! I wonder what his job is?

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.367
Yo, Takasugi.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.367
You were quite bold yesterday.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:57.367
Don't get cocky, hey!

00:00:57.367 --> 00:01:01.433
Ooh, ooh.
Small fries are so noisy.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.367
What did you say?!

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:07.367
Do you know what they call
people like you?

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.367
Huh? What?

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:13.367
Weak... Dog?

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.367
Cat?

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:20.367
It's becoming more vague!

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:25.367
"The weaker the dog, the louder it barks," right!
Don't speak if you don't know!

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.367
You idiot!

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:30.367
Shut up!

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.367
Come at me all at once!

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:42.367
Entering range! Hmph!

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.367
Ah, Toru.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:48.367
Hey. What are you doing?
It is already afternoon.

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.367
Just entertaining some people looking for trouble.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.367
Again?
Did you lose?

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:55.367
No way.
I beat them up thoroughly.

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.367
Yeah!

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.367
By the way,
I met Akaishi-senpai yesterday.

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:04.367
Eh! Seriously?

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.367
Unfair! I want to meet him too.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:10.366
Toru, you really still like Akaishi-senpai.

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:12.367
Of course!

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:16.367
Anyone who hears the legend of
Akaishi would definitely be amazed...

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:20.367
Akaishi-senpai fought against 100 police officers, right!

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:24.367
Ah, that fight.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:29.367
Right... the police attacked Akaishi in a group, but...

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.367
He did not budge at all.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:35.367
Before they knew it, the police officers
were piling up, falling one by one.

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:38.367
I thought it was a giant garbage truck.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:41.367
So cool!

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:44.367
After that, they say he went alone
to the police headquarters and destroyed it.

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:48.367
I heard he went on a rampage at the Yakuza office.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:52.367
I heard he dueled a gorilla and won!

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:56.367
Akaishi-senpai is truly a real man!

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:59.367
I also want to become strong like Akaishi-senpai!

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:06.367
What are you doing, Toru?

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.367
If you want to be strong, you must do sit-ups, sit-ups!

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:12.367
That's true!
I will join!

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:19.367
Oi! You guys do it too!

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.400
- They always look happy, don't they.
- It must be nice.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:34.367
Ouch, slightly overdid it...

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:36.367
Hey! Takasugi!

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:39.367
- Huh?
- You are skipping class again!

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:41.367
Shut up.
You should praise me for actually coming to school.

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.367
You idiot!

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:50.367
And the test from that time.

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:52.433
What is this?!

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:55.367
Oh! Full House.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.367
Don't joke around!

00:03:58.367 --> 00:04:04.367
Skipping lessons, always fighting,
and then getting this score on a test!

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:06.367
Don't underestimate school!

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:09.367
That is because the lessons are boring.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:15.367
Takasugi... Don't think you can
graduate if this continues.

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:17.367
Huh?

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:21.367
With grades like this, you are guaranteed to not advance a grade!

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:26.367
That's great then.

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:35.367
If you keep going like that, you won't
have a proper future!

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:39.367
I am not interested in a proper life.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.367
Akaishi-senpai!

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:53.367
I will definitely become like
Akaishi-senpai in the future!

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:06.400
Good at fighting, riding motorcycles,
smoking, opposing society.

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:15.367
I will become a true cool man just like that!

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:22.367
Aah, I'm hungry.

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:25.367
Toru!
Say "I'm home" when you come home!

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.367
- Did you wash your hands?
- Shut up, I did!

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:31.367
And you...
Mr. Yamauchi called today.

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:34.367
That damn Yamasen...

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:37.367
What do you actually want!

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:41.367
Shut up!
I don't care about graduating!

00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:45.367
I want to die at age 27
like Jimi Hendrix and become a legend.

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:50.367
Don't talk stupidly!

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:52.367
Your father in the sky will cry!

00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:57.367
He just took a plane for a business trip out of town.
Don't say things that cause misunderstandings.

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:01.367
Anyway, you must graduate.

00:06:01.367 --> 00:06:03.367
What is this?

00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:06.367
- I already ordered a private tutor.
- Hah!?

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:08.400
He will come starting today.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.367
What are you doing, you old hag!

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:12.367
There is no way I want to join
such lame private tutoring!

00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:15.367
Huh?

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:17.367
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...!

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.367
Don't think you can win against me.

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.367
St... strong...

00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:31.367
He will come at 19:00,
so study properly, okay.

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:39.367
A private tutor is probably just a soft university student.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:43.367
If the person is lame, I will beat him up!

00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:57.367
Just come in!

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400
Allow me to introduce myself.
I look forward to working with you.

00:07:12.367 --> 00:07:16.367
I am the private tutor, Kishi Knight.

00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:25.367
A neat two-block cut parted in the middle.

00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:28.367
Wearing a suit vest dapperly.

00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:35.366
This man is an inhabitant of a world
that is the complete opposite of mine!

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:41.366
Ah... he smells nice.

00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:49.367
He is a soft man...

00:08:49.367 --> 00:08:52.367
That means, an enemy!

00:08:52.367 --> 00:08:55.367
Well then, Toru-san.
Let's start studying.

00:08:56.367 --> 00:09:00.367
I will give him such a hard time
that he won't want to come again.

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:07.367
Sensei, I have no intention to study.

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:11.367
My textbooks and pencil case,
I left them all at school.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.400
A soft big brother like this must be...

00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:20.367
Hiii...

00:09:20.367 --> 00:09:24.367
I cannot do it in such a violent place!

00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:27.367
I'm going home!

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:30.367
There, give up already!

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.367
- That is not a problem.
- Eh?

00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:43.367
Please use this!

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:50.367
A... all subjects...

00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:54.367
Th... this person... is so prepared!

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:56.367
But...

00:09:56.367 --> 00:10:01.367
Sorry, I cannot study using a mechanical pencil.

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.367
I am on the wooden pencil team.

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:11.367
Take that! A nitpicking excuse meant for a delinquent!

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:14.367
- I understand.
- Huh?

00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:20.367
I have all types.
Any thickness is available!

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:26.367
F...?

00:10:27.367 --> 00:10:29.367
I've never seen that...

00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:32.367
Let's begin.

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:35.367
Th... this person is not daunted at all!

00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:38.367
- Since today is the first meeting...
- In that case...

00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:42.367
First, to see Toru-san's ability,
please work on this...

00:10:42.367 --> 00:10:45.367
An ordinary person who doesn't cry
when I stare at them sharply is...

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:50.367
Wah!
His eyelashes are long.

00:10:54.367 --> 00:10:58.367
You don't need to be so tense, it is alright.

00:10:58.367 --> 00:11:01.367
Eh... Eeh!?
Wh... what does this mean?

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:03.367
Head...?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.367
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts...!

00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:08.367
Mom just hits me...

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:11.367
Even my dad never patted my head!

00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:15.367
Just kidding. Actually, I am nervous too.

00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:17.400
We are the same, aren't we.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.367
Wh... what is this...

00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:22.367
Kind of cute...

00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:27.367
Let's relax together.
Let's study while having fun, okay!

00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:32.367
Having fun...

00:11:32.367 --> 00:11:34.367
Yes!

00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:38.367
It feels... different from the teachers I imagined.

00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:44.367
First, let's do a light test.
Please try doing these questions.

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.367
Japanese History questions.

00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:53.367
It can't be helped...

00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:56.367
But...

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.367
I am best at Japanese History.

00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:06.367
Is that so!
I am looking forward to it.

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:11.367
Behold my true ability!

00:12:11.367 --> 00:12:17.367
"What is the name of the woman said to rule Yamataikoku
in the Chinese history book Gishiwajinden?"

00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:23.367
Matsuko!

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:29.367
"Who was the main figure of the rebel army leading
more than 30,000 people in Shimabara and Amakusa?

00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:36.367
Sanshiro!

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:41.367
"Who was the person leading the Black Ships
that came to Uraga in 1853?"

00:12:46.367 --> 00:12:48.367
Bon Jovi.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.400
"Who was the 5th Shogun of the Edo Bakufu who
established the Shorui Awaremi no Rei?"

00:12:57.367 --> 00:13:00.367
Tokugawa...

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:02.367
Ieie!

00:13:02.367 --> 00:13:04.367
Yosh!

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:09.367
How about that!

00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:14.367
Yes! All of them are wrong.

00:13:14.367 --> 00:13:18.367
Eh? You're lying, right?
I was so confident.

00:13:18.367 --> 00:13:20.367
But, it was close.

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:25.367
I understand the intention of your answer
in several parts. For example, this one.

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:28.367
Tokugawa Ieie...?

00:13:28.367 --> 00:13:36.367
Indeed, in the Tokugawa family, there are many
names using "Ie," but Ieie does not exist.

00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:40.367
Huh? Is that so?

00:13:40.367 --> 00:13:43.367
I feel like there was one.

00:13:43.367 --> 00:13:47.367
The correct answer
is Tokugawa Tsunayoshi.

00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:51.367
- Tsunayoshi? No way there is a person like that.
- There is.

00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:55.367
Tsunayoshi sounds...
like a dog's name.

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:57.367
Ooh, very sharp.

00:13:57.367 --> 00:14:01.367
Tsunayoshi indeed had the nickname
"Inu-Kubo."

00:14:01.367 --> 00:14:05.367
Eh! Ah, really?
See, it really is like a dog.

00:14:05.367 --> 00:14:11.367
The neighbor grandfather's dog has a similar name,
so it's easy to remember.

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:16.367
Toru-san has an interesting way of thinking.

00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:19.367
That is a very amazing thing, you know.

00:14:20.367 --> 00:14:23.367
What the heck...
Even if you praise me, you won't get anything.

00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:27.367
It's not that.
Toru-san has a talent for studying.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.367
Hah? No way!

00:14:30.367 --> 00:14:36.400
Studying is not just memorizing,
but understanding from that kind of thinking is also very important

00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:42.367
Please be confident, Toru-san.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.367
By the way,
can you stop calling me "Toru-san"?

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:55.400
- Why?
- I am younger...

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.967
Besides, I'm not used to being called that.
Just call me by name, it's fine.

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:03.367
I cannot do that.
You are a precious student.

00:15:03.367 --> 00:15:05.367
It's fine, really.

00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:11.367
In that case... how about "Toru-kun"?

00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:14.367
- Eh?
- Toru-kun.

00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:18.367
Hee!? To... Toru-kyun!?

00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:23.367
Dangerous...
My heart is pounding so easily.

00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:25.367
Is it not allowed?

00:15:25.367 --> 00:15:30.367
Aah no no... that is fine.

00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:35.367
In that case, don't call me
Sensei, just call me by name.

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.367
- Call by name?
- Yes.

00:15:37.367 --> 00:15:40.367
Just call me "Knight."

00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:44.367
His words are like a newly dating couple...

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:48.333
Aah no, I can't!

00:15:48.333 --> 00:15:51.367
Why?

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:58.367
I am a genuine delinquent,
so I am strict about seniority.

00:15:58.367 --> 00:16:01.367
Is that so.
Delinquents have neat rules, don't they.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.400
Dangerous, I must not be swayed!

00:16:12.367 --> 00:16:16.367
But Sensei's name is "Knight"?

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:18.367
Yes.

00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:21.367
What a strange name.
What is the kanji?

00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:24.367
This.

00:16:26.367 --> 00:16:29.367
Ki... Kishi!?

00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:32.367
It is written as "Kishi" but read as "Knight"!

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:36.367
I cannot handle that name!
This person... is strong...!

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:38.367
I apologize that the name is too sparkling.

00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:42.367
No, that is really strong in my opinion!

00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:45.367
- Is that so?
- The impact is huge.

00:16:45.367 --> 00:16:48.367
What have people called you so far?

00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:50.367
"Kishi-kun."

00:16:52.367 --> 00:16:54.367
The impact of "Knight" is totally gone!?

00:16:57.367 --> 00:17:01.367
What a waste!

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:06.367
Unfortunately, I do not have a nickname...

00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:09.367
What a waste...

00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:12.367
Ah!

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.333
In that case, how about "Kishikishi"?

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:20.367
Eh?

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:23.367
Eh? Not allowed?

00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:28.367
Because the kanji is "Kishi Kishi"...

00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:32.367
Oh no... was that a landmine?

00:17:37.367 --> 00:17:39.367
I am happy! Kishikishi!

00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:41.367
Ah... you like it?

00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:45.367
Yes!
This is the first time in my life
I have been given a nickname!

00:17:45.367 --> 00:17:47.367
Kishikishi, huh...!

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:50.367
Like the pandas Shinshin and Shan Shan, it's cute!

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:53.367
Ooh... he is that happy...

00:17:54.367 --> 00:17:56.367
Thank you.

00:17:56.367 --> 00:18:00.367
Toru-kun is a genius at giving nicknames!

00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:04.367
Nickname genius...

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:07.367
Next is Han-Cha, the leader.

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:10.367
Who is Han-Cha, hey.

00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:12.367
Come on, Maru-Bou.

00:18:13.367 --> 00:18:16.367
Why am I on the police side.

00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:19.367
You guys are all talk.

00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:22.367
Oh... not bad, Akabeko.

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:24.367
That is an insult, you know.

00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:31.367
Hah... Well...
Well, it's just normal?

00:18:31.367 --> 00:18:35.367
I was always envious of school friends
who were called by nicknames!

00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:37.367
Enken, Jumbo...

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:40.367
Key-bou, Gorirahanakuso!

00:18:40.367 --> 00:18:43.367
Ah... the last one seems like an insult.

00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:47.367
I see...

00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:52.367
It turns out he is different from the teachers
I have met so far...

00:18:52.367 --> 00:18:55.367
No no no!
Don't be fooled, me!

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:57.367
That teacher...

00:18:58.367 --> 00:19:03.367
If you keep going like that, you won't
have a proper future!

00:19:03.367 --> 00:19:08.367
Surely they are all the same...
I won't be fooled!

00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:10.367
Toru-kun.

00:19:14.367 --> 00:19:16.367
Eh what?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.367
Ah... Is he staring at me sharply?

00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:25.367
I won't lose!

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:31.333
His eyelashes are really long!
And, he smells nice!

00:19:34.367 --> 00:19:39.367
Toru-kun. You don't need to worry about anything.

00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:42.367
Don't need to worry about anything?

00:19:42.367 --> 00:19:46.367
I will definitely make you happy.

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:49.367
Definitely happy!?

00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:53.367
Leave everything to me.

00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:58.367
A... a confession of love!?

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:06.367
We just met today, no way...

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:10.367
You're lying, right...
This is the first time I've been confessed to!?

00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:16.367
I understand your feelings of anxiety.
But please rest assured!

00:20:16.367 --> 00:20:21.367
Wow... Such a leader aura!
Amazing, an older person...

00:20:21.367 --> 00:20:23.367
Entrust it to me!

00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:26.367
What should I do!?

00:20:30.367 --> 00:20:36.367
Being told that so suddenly...
I am not mentally prepared...

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:39.367
Study seriously and we will definitely pass!

00:20:40.367 --> 00:20:42.367
Eh?

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.367
Eh?

00:20:44.367 --> 00:20:48.433
Ah... Pass?
Talking about passing?

00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:50.433
Yes.

00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:56.367
What the heck...

00:20:56.367 --> 00:21:00.367
- Let's start studying!
- What is with this natural charmer!

00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:04.367
- Turns out this person... cannot be underestimated...
- Now, review the test from earlier.

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:07.367
Have you memorized the name of the 5th Tokugawa Shogun?

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:10.367
- Tokugawa Yoshiyoshi.
- Tsunayoshi.

00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:13.367
Toru-kun seems to like repeated words.

00:21:13.367 --> 00:21:15.367
Like a baby!

00:21:29.167 --> 00:21:32.167
Sensei... are you alright?

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:38.133
I heard sounds that didn't seem
like studying...

00:21:38.133 --> 00:21:43.133
I apologize, Mother.
I got carried away with Toru-kun.

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:48.133
That child has indeed been naughty since long ago.
I wonder who he resembles...

00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:54.167
Sensei must be troubled too, right?

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:57.133
Not at all.
Toru-kun is a very good child.

00:21:57.133 --> 00:22:00.133
- Really?
- Yes!

00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:04.167
In that case, Mother.
I will take my leave for today.

00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:06.167
Ah...

00:22:16.167 --> 00:22:19.200
"Let's do our best together," huh...

00:22:24.167 --> 00:22:26.167
No no no...

00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:29.167
I won't be fooled!

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:36.167
Come at me! Come at me!

00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:40.167
Toru, you're noisy!

00:22:43.167 --> 00:22:45.167
Starting today, Toru-kun's lessons begin.

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:48.167
He says he is good at Japanese History.

00:22:48.167 --> 00:22:53.133
I will help him as much as I can
so he can graduate properly.

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:56.167
Kishi.

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:16.133
Kishikishi.

00:23:25.133 --> 00:23:28.167
I really hate adults
who have the title "Sensei."

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:30.167
That is more natural for me.

00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:33.167
Eh what? This.
A kiss!? A kiss, huh!?

00:23:33.167 --> 00:23:36.200
Toru-kun indeed has a talent for studying!

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200
See, knowledge is important, you know!
