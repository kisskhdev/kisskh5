In the mid-1990s,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.560
in the Uninhabited Zone of Mazhi County

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.690
in the southwest of Qinghai Province,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.500
cases of Tibetan antelope poaching

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.160
and illegal mineral extraction
were frequent.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.640
The region was vast

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.050
and police forces were limited,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.090
so the Mazhi County Party Committee
and county government

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.090
decided to form an armed patrol unit

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.800
led by Deputy County Mayor Duojie,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.800
made up of personnel
from Mazhi Economic Development Company

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.300
and local militia.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.440
At the time,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.500
I had just graduated
from the police academy

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.650
and was seconded to the Mountain Patrol,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.400
responsible for supervising
law enforcement

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.000
and transferring suspects.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.690
Back then,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.500
I had no idea what this reassignment

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.560
would come to mean.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.100
That was the first time

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.130

Not black hair in the middle.

find a sheep but got the wrong one.

This time we were out for 12 days.

I even beat up two guys

passing Zhuoyuan Lake,

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.770
we saw them digging holes
to bury the pelts.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.350
They've already paid the fine.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.880
Take them

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.930
to the Public Security Bureau later.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.160
So you didn't catch any gunmen
this time either?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.130
If a gunman is caught,

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.190
he gets sentenced.

Why did you wash the door curtain?

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.170
It was filthy.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.110

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.960
pretty detailed.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.410

To get the money.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.420
Let's go.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.590
Lin,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.750
we agreed a long time ago

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.390
that the 30,000

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.990
can't be delayed any longer.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.030
The team hasn't been paid

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.140
for 3 months.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.550
We've been putting off
paying for the fuel.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.570
Now we can barely afford

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.500
to feed the men.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.790
Relying on fines to plug the hole

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.050
is not enough anymore.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.010
The funding requests
we submitted to the city

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:51.820
are all here.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.010
Yours is in there too. Not approved.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:54.860
Only one disaster relief request

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.660
got approved.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:56.770
Do you want that money?

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:57.960
Don't play this game with me.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.170
The Mountain Patrol's funding

00:14:59.170 --> 00:14:59.720
was promised

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.530
3 months ago.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.200
It was a collective decision
by the county.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.860
You can't go back on your word.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.840
If you're going to talk to me like that,

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.460
we'll have to

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.630
sort this out properly.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.290
Who was it

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.240
that went back on their word first?

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.480
Why was the establishment

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.170
of the Mountain Patrol approved
in the first place?

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:14.700
Why?

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.910
On the official seal given to you,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.700
what does it say?

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.230
Mazhi County Economic Development Company!

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.670
You made this pledge yourself—

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.100
in the first year,

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.240
the development company
would be established;

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:23.780
in the second year,

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.790
it would be weaned off county funding

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.670
and become self-sustaining;

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.270
in the third year,

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.940
it would start contributing
to the county's finances.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.080
Do those promises still count?

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.810
I'm asking you,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.020
do they still count?

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.520
Poaching in the mountains

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.380
is rampant now.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:33.890
If Tibetan antelopes

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.690
keep getting killed like this,

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.820
they'll go extinct.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.460
Are we just supposed to stand by

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.200
and do nothing?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.890
Then what about development?

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.090
Are we doing it or not?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:40.370
Yes.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.980
Alright.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.440
You need to do it

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.970
on the basis of protection.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.480
Last year,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.470
county revenue was 2 million,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.590
and expenditure was 10 million.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.930
I can't account for that at all.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.830
This time when I went to the city,

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.760
not only did I fail to get any money,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.840
but the city leaders also brought up

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.300
the animal husbandry tax.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.630
Didn't this year's proposal
to the National People's Congress

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.910
request a reduction?

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.160
It did,

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.670
but it's still going through the process.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.270
Then what about
the Mountain Patrol's funding?

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.030
I don't like the smell of smoke.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:28.830
Stop the car!

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.990
Deputy County Mayor Duo!

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.600
Deputy County Mayor Duo!

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.690
Deputy County Mayor Duo!

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.420
Is the County Mayor looking for me?

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.119
No.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.160
Deputy County Mayor Duo,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.220
the car broke down.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.530
Could you help push it?

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:15.210
Here.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.550
Just two people?

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:26.329
No pelts?

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:27.500
In a couple of days,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.830
they'll send them over.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.160
They haven't finished counting yet.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.960
Alright then.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.200
It's like this every time—

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.460
handing over people but not the pelts.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.310
But don't they always

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.770
send them to you in the end?

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.290
The point is they need to be aired out,

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.620
and rotten ones burned.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.290
We can bring them now if you want.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.220
We'll just pile them all here.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:42.940
As long as you don't mind the stink.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.510
There are hundreds.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.440
Do you want them?

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.850
Forget it.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.670
The problem is,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.800
you brought these two over,

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.110
but no pelts.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.050
We can't interrogate them,

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.310
and we still have to feed them.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.350
Look.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:17:59.820
These two

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.310
are starving like wolves.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:02.810
Next time,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.240
feed them before sending them over.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.110
Sign here.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.540
I haven't even eaten yet.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.220
This girl.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.880
Eat up.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.000
Tsampa tastes good.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.220
Thank you,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.050
Sir,

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.290
are you here looking for Duojie?

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.660
Yes, I am.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.210
Are you looking for him too?

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:49.660
Sir,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.960
how did you know Duojie
would be back today?

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.270
I don't know when Duojie will return.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.290
I come here to wait for him every day.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.870
Duojie is back.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.420
Don't rush. Sit down and wait.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.120
It will take him a while
to walk over here.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.090
I'm requesting a transfer

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.580
for work reasons.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.090
What work reasons?

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.060
I want to go into the mountains.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.440
There will be a chance.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.400
You're brushing me off again.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.050
It's been a year,

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.460
and I still haven't been allowed
into the mountains.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.480
When you picked me

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.160
from the Public Security Brigade,

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.420
I told you clearly—

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.210
since you're borrowing officers

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:55.940
to guide work

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:56.680
and combat poaching,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.350
I need to

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.240
go into the mountains with you,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.210
not just sitting around at the base.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.240
You promised me back then.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.300
But what happened?

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.640
You just had me handle logistics

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.700
and write reports.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.440
Yes,

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.310
you took me to the Qinghai-Tibet Highway

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.570
to inspect cars twice.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.550
Does that count
as going into the mountains?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.660
And you actually call that valuing me.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.240
Right.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.510
When writing reports,

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.230
I'm valued the most.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.770
Those guys

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.010
take turns keeping an eye on me,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:17.740
afraid I'd

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.630
write down

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.510
their misdeeds

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.770
and cause you trouble.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.460
What?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:25.960
Pen.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.690
[Agreed]

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.730
Is there anything else?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.740
No.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.020
Say hello to your mother for me.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.160
Why didn't you try to stop me?

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.040
What did you say?

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.350
Nothing.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:42.560
Sorry.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.010
I'm sorry.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.150
Finally, some herdsmen now know

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.770
to go to the hospital in time

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.420
when a woman is about to give birth.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.350
In the past,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.720
we had to ride horses to the pastures

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.250
to help deliver the babies.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.400
Yes.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:24.350
Now,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.640
more and more people know

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.270
[Zhang Qinqin, Director
of Mazhi County People's Hospital]

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.320
to come to the hospital when they're sick.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.790
It would be great if the hospital

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.770
could be expanded.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.260
Patients are living in tents

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.610
in the courtyard,

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.480
and the sanitary conditions aren't good.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.010
Ms. Kang.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.840
Ms. Kang.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.510
Thank you.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:37.180
-Here.
-No need.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:37.800
Take this.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.050
I have no money left.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:39.920
There isn't enough for medical expenses.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.590
You have to take...

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.790
You have to take this.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.070
Thank you.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.790
Okay.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.340
I just washed my hands.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.160
It's so big.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.440
Ma'am.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:55.560
I know

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.050
we're short-handed here.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.250
But my parents

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.850
want me to go back to the city.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.740
This permanent position

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.420
took them a lot of effort

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.150
to get for me.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:02.720
I...

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.000
Go.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.980
Thank you, ma'am.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.020
Take this meat with you.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.510
Consider it

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:30.510
your back pay.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.500
No need, ma'am.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.010
You should keep it

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:33.610
and share it with everyone.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.480
Take it.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.700
You haven't been paid for 3 months.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.460
I know

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.810
I shouldn't keep using these things

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:40.850
as compensation.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.500
Go now.

Okay.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.360
Let me.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.500
Let me.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:30.930
You're back?

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.220
I'm back.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.640
Director He,

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.090
you're off work?

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:37.980
Mom, I'm off work.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.480
You've been gone a long time

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.610
this trip.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:41.900
Yes.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.590
Twelve days, right?

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.350
Has it been that long, Mom?

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.040
I've been counting.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.220
Mom,

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.660
did you use the herbal medicine

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:51.440
I gave you last time?

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.240
I drank it.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.050
Mom,

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.330
that was supposed to be boiled

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.780
and applied warm to your knees.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.940
Why did you drink it?

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.310
That would be a waste.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.960
It was all good stuff.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.030
Why didn't you watch her?

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.090
It's fine.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.100
Let her drink it.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.500
It won't make her sick.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:12.880
Come.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.240
Sit.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.880
Have you eaten?

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.520
Not yet.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.930
I'm hungry.

What are you watering it

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.600
at this hour?

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:44.560
If you

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:45.930
kill the only tree

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.720
in our county,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.400
the County Mayor
will come looking for you.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:48.830
I've watered it

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.030
like this many times.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.330
This tree is tough.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.900
Everyone's here?

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:53.740
They bounced along for 3 hours

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.480
on the three-wheeled motorcycle.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.010
Mom.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.790
Why are you back so late?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.420
The bank manager made me work overtime.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.650
You only bought three cucumbers?

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.240
And they're so wilted.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.430
I went all over the county.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.050
At this hour,

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.260
there's no leafy greens left.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.060
These were the only 3 cucumbers.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.720
Cucumbers are fine.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.560
Aren't cucumbers green?

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:15.900
Thanks.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.740
Thanks.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:17.240
Thanks.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:17.750
Thanks.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.290
Just make do with this today.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.110
Come back tomorrow.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.910
I'll go buy some early tomorrow.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.200
Your clothes look nice.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.460
Where did you get them?

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.740
Pass me the newspaper.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.730
They were brought from the south.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.790
I wish you all

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.500
lived in the county.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.140
That way,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.280
you could come to

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.200
your Mrs. Zhang's house every day

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.140
to eat and drink,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.880
without having to spend 3 hours

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.080
on the road each time.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.320
Living in the county costs money.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.250
Plus,

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.130
Meiseng Village
is closer to the Uninhabited Zone.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.660
Only 3 hours closer.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.480
Driving into the Uninhabited Zone

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.770
still takes a whole day.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.140
The main problem
is the county government is too stingy.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.050
Is there enough meat?

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.010
We have plenty in our house.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:51.310
Anyway,

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.550
Mrs. Zhang's hospital

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.380
doesn't pay salaries.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.320
They only pay in meat.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.180
Get out of here.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.890
We can eat meat.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.850
There's one guy here who doesn't eat meat.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.110
I'm fine with noodles.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.610
I just bought some eggs.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:02.870
I'll poach one for you.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.790
Okay.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.790
Who else wants an egg?

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:05.510
I do.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.770
I want three!

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.050
Look at you guys.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.110
You can't even afford eggs.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.630
I wonder

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.880
when your development company

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.220
will actually open.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.790
Who knows?

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.040
During those trips into the mountains,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.240
we didn't do much mineral exploration.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.810
When the company opens,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.480
Duojie will definitely be the chairman.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.740
He Qingyuan will be the general manager.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.730
I'll just be the deputy manager.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.110
You only did 2 years of primary school.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.680
Have you ever seen

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.880
a manager with just two years of school?

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.140
Read it.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:38.250
Okay.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.580
Mrs. Nima's sheep

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:46.700
was missing.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.540
Bai found one,

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:51.720
but she said it wasn't that one.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.380
Alright, alright.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.330
I can do it.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:55.310
I finished primary school,

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.680
and I'm prepping
for the Self-taught Examinations.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.680
I'm definitely better than him.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.530
By that logic,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.420
my brother is more educated than you.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.620
High school dropout.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.280
Bai Ji.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.420
Bai Ji.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.400
I found you a new job.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.940
I'm not going to your place.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.720
Your place

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.240
can't even pay salaries.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.180
Ju,

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.870
I even went to middle school.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.610
Can I do it?

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.470
You can't.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.500
You're too young.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.400
Right.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.570
When the development company

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.500
is established,

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.640
we won't need police anymore.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.400
Bai,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:23.790
then you can go back

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.330
to your Public Security Bureau.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:25.810
Right.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.650
That won't happen.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.040
I won't wait that long.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.110
Duojie has already signed

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.930
my transfer application.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.700
When did that happen?

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.920
Just this afternoon.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.770
Once I submit it to the bureau

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.030
and the Chief signs it,

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.220
you won't

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.140
see me again.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.310
Of course,

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.180
the bureau will definitely

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.240
send someone else.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.750
Their reports

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.240
will definitely be better than mine.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.830
Are you satisfied?

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.120
Actually, everyone...

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.400
still likes...

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.330
you better.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.540
Yes, we all like you.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:27.770
Ju,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.290
I... I like you too.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.920
We all like you.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.310
Let me tell you,

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.350
it's too late.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:40.090
From now on,

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.790
you can't come to our house

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.100
for free food and drink anymore.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.730
Mom,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.220
you'll have some peace and quiet
from now on.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.430
Is that true?

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.800
Mrs. Zhang,

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.500
can we still come over?

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.640
She doesn't make the rules in our house.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.630
You know where the key is.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.440
Come anytime.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.400
Here.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.480
This is the last pot.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.920
Eat with us.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.750
I'm not eating.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:11.940
Dongzhiba. Dongzhiba.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.670
I'm leaving.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.590
Mom, I'm leaving.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.400
Where are you going?

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:15.900
I have things to do.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.900
I'll be away for a couple of days.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.920
Do you have money with you?

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.420
You need to carry some cash.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:18.720
I...

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.090
I have some.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:19.890
I'll give him some.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.920
Don't worry about it.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.120
Wait for your sister!

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.000
Bai Ji!

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.090
Stop right there!

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:25.850
What?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.680
What are you doing?

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.500
You're out running around all day.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.630
I told you I have things to do.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.380
I'm making money.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.700
You? Making money?

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:32.880
Mom said

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.140
you've hardly

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.180
ever been home lately.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.970
Can't you let her worry a little less?

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:37.580
Take this.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.150
Don't spend it all at once.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.110
I can make money now.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.120
Take it.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.700
Buy something for Mom.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:52.110
Where did you get all this money?

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:54.940
Just take it.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.250
I'm about to miss the bus.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:56.480
I'm leaving.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.140
Where are you going?

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.200
Go back inside. Go.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.030
Bye.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:51.530
Mom, I'm hungry.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:52.530
Is dinner ready?

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.730
Did you get into a fight?

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.040
Did you use a knife?

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.210
Did you win or lose?

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.770
I won.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.270
Get down.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.170
You mustn't fight with your classmates,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.760
especially not with a knife.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.200
Do you hear me?

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.220
Yes.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:37.850
Go inside and do your homework.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:39.250
Can I feed Jiongxi first?

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.940
Yes.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.700
Come and eat
after you finish feeding the horse.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.070
Okay.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.270
Did Duojie really sign it?

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.440
He signed it without hesitation.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.170
Didn't say a single extra word.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.350
You two are so alike.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.380
Both so stubborn.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:29.740
As long as you

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.140
have thought it through.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.280
Director Zhang,

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:33.770
it's just you and me here.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.500
Let's not beat around the bush.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.770
You sound like

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.180
you want me

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.990
to stay in the Mountain Patrol.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.190
I just want you

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.220
to work with Duojie.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.510
He is a reliable man.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.110
I'll be more at ease

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.280
if you work with him.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.790
You're always singing his praises.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.150
I don't feel like

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.640
he's reliable at all.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.550
It's been a year,

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.680
and every time he talks to me,

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.450
it's fewer than five sentences.

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:07.050
He couldn't be colder.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:10.110
I feel like...

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.010
he hates me.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.070
You just don't know him.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.460
Director Zhang!

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:17.320
Bai Ju!

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.300
He?

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.110
He.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.760
What took you so long?

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.639
Have you eaten?

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:24.760
I...

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.300
I came to tell them
to go back immediately.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.040
Something happened?

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.639
Yes!

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.170
Wake up!

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:31.380
Wake up!

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:32.850
Get up! Let's move!

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.120
Two cars.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.190
They have gunmen.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.440
They went in at sunset.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.260
If we leave now,

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.040
we should be able to catch them.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.420
We're exactly

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.570
half a day behind them.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.630
Is the information reliable?

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.420
It's from the herdsmen.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.280
It's pretty reliable.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.860
Han,

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:47.400
how's the car?

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.920
Two of the three steel plates are broken.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.030
We're out of the thick ones.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.190
I put the originals back on.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.840
It gets by.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.469
How long

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.460
will the fuel last?

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.300
For 2 cars,

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.400
it'll last 3 days.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.870
Dongzhiba!

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:59.210
Dongzhiba!

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.460
Captain!

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.480
Go borrow a car
from the animal husbandry station,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.380
buy 300 liters of gasoline,

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.380
and get some food.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.520
Tomorrow night,

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.170
we'll meet at Zhuoyuan Lake.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.130
The county approved a little funding.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.190
If it's not enough,

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.500
figure it out yourself.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.640
Got it. Don't worry.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.780
Leave him a gun.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.410
What are you doing?

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.400
You've been transferred away.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.570
Let me go into the mountains,

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.570
and I won't leave.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:40.720
Go back.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.510
Get in the car, now.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.630
Okay.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:49.730
Bai.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.920
The wind is too strong in the mountains.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.180
You'll get blown away.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.640
Take this.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:31.620
I'm begging you.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.250
Just give us a little more.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.230
Two hundred liters is too little.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.510
We need at least 300.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.840
How about this?

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.360
I'll give you

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.160
an extra box of instant noodles.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.630
It's on the house.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.500
I really can't let you run up a tab

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.670
for gasoline anymore.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.530
You're already

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.780
3 months behind on payment.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.550
When we buy gasoline
from the trading company,

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.210
we need to pay them on the spot.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:53.840
Wangmu.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.150
A spark plug on our car is broken.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.090
Do you have new ones?

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:57.740
No.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:36:59.840
They haven't arrived yet.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.070
Do you have any sandpaper?

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.030
I have sandpaper.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.230
I'll go get it for you.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.670
Fill it up for him.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.100
I'll pay for the 100 liters

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.430
of gasoline next month.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.170
Okay.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:25.710
Do I need to

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.630
write you an IOU?

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.340
No need.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.400
The gods heard what you said.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.390
Go get the gas.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.360
Done.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:38.460
Give it a try.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.650
Ju, it's done.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.940
Get in.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.110
You really have a knack for this.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.090
It's a shame

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.650
that someone with such ability

00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.310
stays at the base all the time.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:01.670
Here.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:05.430
Let's go.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.480
It should last through this trip,

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:09.070
but

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.820
it's best to replace it

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.020
with a new spark plug.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.190
Okay.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:18.960
Ju,

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.980
do you still want to go into
the mountains?

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.150
No.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.460
I find it hard to give you advice

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.800
about your transfer.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.650
You've grown up

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.490
and can make your own choices.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.560
You can choose your own post—

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.820
whether it's the Mountain Patrol,

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.730
public security,

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.890
or the household registration office.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:06.690
But I don't want you

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.420
to request a transfer

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.820
just because you think your current work

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.050
is meaningless.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.880
If it seems meaningless,

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.280
then go find its meaning.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.500
The reason Dad became

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.860
a hero in our eyes

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.470
is simply because he was

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.820
an ordinary person dedicated to

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.750
an ordinary job,

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.340
an ordinary police officer

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.540
who spent his whole life at the station.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:29.690
In the end,

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.090
no one said

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.640
he wasn't a good policeman.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.420
I won't be back for New Year this year.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.080
I have a training assignment.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.680
Take good care of Mom for me.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:39.710
Love,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:40.710
Bai Chun.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.290
Ju, look.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.010
Tibetan antelopes.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:55.870
So beautiful.

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.130
The Tibetan antelopes

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:58.280
are migrating now.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.510
It's also the time

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:01.170
when their wool is at its best.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:03.920
After the breeding season,

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.080
there will be so many antelopes.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:07.460
The poachers

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.750
will wait along

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:09.580
fixed routes.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.920
They kill hundreds of them every time.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.820
If we drive through tonight,

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:25.650
by tomorrow,

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.420
we'll reach Zhuoyuan Lake,

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.710
just as the sun rises.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.460
The lake

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.030
is incredibly beautiful.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.940
I always get up early to see it.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:38.920
If Duojie sees

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.050
you bring me in,

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.290
he'll definitely scold you.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.590
Let him scold me.

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:45.720
He even beat me once.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.420
It's fine.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.210
It seems

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.190
you're all willing to listen to him.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.860
Why?

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.940
Don't you think he's good?

00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:59.660
He's just so-so.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.410
He's a big shot

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.370
in Mazhi County.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:05.160
If I tell my friends

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.990
Captain Duojie beat or scold me,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:08.730
they'll be impressed.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.900
No way.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.590
It's true.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.340
You might not know,

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:16.920
but back in the township,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.780
every time he was distributing pastures

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.900
or disaster relief,

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.790
the herdsmen

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:20.640
would follow

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.670
whatever he said.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.510
He's fair.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.660
Your coat

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.070
won't do in the mountains.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:28.820
Wear this.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.490
It smells a bit, right?

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.080
Not at all.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.000
It's warm.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.530
Headache?

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.470
A little.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.430
If it's unbearable,

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.710
take this.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.850
It helps with blood circulation
in your brain.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.130
Thank you, Brother.

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:29.030
Once we cross this ridge,

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.030
we will...

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:39.870
What did we hit?

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:40.860
I don't know.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:41.730
Get out now!
