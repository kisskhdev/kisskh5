{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.065
I…

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:37.025
QINGQUAN, PALACE MAID

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:39.105
I know who killed Hanxiao.

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:42.185
Hongshao from
the Imperial Housekeeping Service.

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:43.985
Yesterday, I went there to notify them

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.665
of the lamp oil Consort Shu
will need next month.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:50.705
That's when I saw the red agate
gilded pendant on her chest.

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:52.825
You recognize it?

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:54.145
Of course.

00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.625
It belonged to Consort Shu.

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:58.145
Once, while Hanxiao was helping
Consort Shu get dressed,

00:01:58.225 --> 00:02:01.385
she accidentally dropped it
and was terrified.

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.345
But instead of blaming her,

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.385
Consort Shu gave her
the pendant as a reward.

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:09.265
Hanxiao was so grateful.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:12.385
No matter how short on money she was,
she'd never sell it,

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.025
let alone give it away.

00:02:14.825 --> 00:02:18.665
Hongshao must have killed her
and taken it.

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:22.105
Go to the Imperial Housekeeping Service.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:23.545
Yes.

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:25.025
Did I break the law?

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:27.385
Why should I tell you who gave it to me?

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.305
Why are you making things
so difficult for me?

00:02:34.065 --> 00:02:35.425
Clearly, you don't know much.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.345
This pendant is made

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:40.585
of the finest South red agate
from Jiannan Circuit.

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.105
It's one of a kind.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:44.105
It belonged to Consort Shu.

00:02:44.185 --> 00:02:46.865
You'd better explain where you got it.

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:47.905
If you don't,

00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:50.585
you'll be charged with stealing
from Consort Shu.

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:55.185
It was Hu Da.

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:58.705
Hu Da from the Palace Registry Bureau
gave it to me.

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:01.185
Why would Hu Da give you
something so valuable?

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:04.385
A few days ago,

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:06.665
after I'd delivered something
to Lady Zhang,

00:03:07.265 --> 00:03:09.625
someone stopped me on my way out.

00:03:09.705 --> 00:03:11.145
He said Hu Da

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:14.865
from the Palace Registry Bureau
wanted to get to know me

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:17.865
and sent this as a gift.

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.625
Hu Da is just
a secondary ninth-rank supervisor.

00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:23.785
Didn't you find it odd
he'd be so generous?

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:27.105
Everyone knows Hu Da
is free with his money.

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:30.425
Whenever palace maids
need funds, they go to him.

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:31.585
Besides--

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:35.945
That man kept saying…

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:39.745
Hu Da truly adored me.

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:43.105
Do you know the man
who relayed the message?

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:44.345
Can you recognize him?

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.225
It was so dark that night,
and he stood in the shadows.

00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:49.705
I couldn't see his face.

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:52.505
So no one can vouch for your story?

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:57.625
Not even in my wildest dreams

00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:00.065
would I dare steal from Consort Shu.

00:04:00.145 --> 00:04:01.625
If I had really stolen it,

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:04.225
I wouldn't dare parade it around, would I?

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.305
I'm not looking to get myself killed.

00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:18.825
There must be something
about him you remember.

00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:21.745
I remember now.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:25.465
He smelled of mugwort,

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:27.265
and his hands were rough.

00:04:27.345 --> 00:04:29.105
That's it.

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.545
That's all I can recall.

00:04:40.665 --> 00:04:42.985
Sweet olive balm.

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:46.065
Good taste, Sister.

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:53.065
Sister, aren't you going to sign
the promissory note?

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:56.225
I am.

00:05:01.585 --> 00:05:04.665
Sister, why is your hand shaking?

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:09.185
With your hand trembling like that,
you can hardly write.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.345
Let me help you.

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:21.625
Supervisor Hu,

00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:25.105
I've signed the note.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.545
When will I get the loan?

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:29.105
HU DA, SUPERVISOR
PALACE REGISTRY BUREAU

00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:30.745
"Supervisor Hu"?

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:34.985
That sounds so distant.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.025
I only lend money to friends.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:43.025
Hearing you call me that makes me sad.

00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:45.345
What do you want?

00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:47.745
I want you to treat me sincerely.

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:51.225
What are you afraid of?

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:56.145
Do you really think
I'd do anything to you?

00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:59.185
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:02.185
If you don't believe me, see for yourself.

00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:08.745
Blind fool, how dare you…!

00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:11.425
Princess of Fuchang County.

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:13.105
Supervisor Hu,
what refined taste you have.

00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:17.385
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:18.905
Outrageous.

00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:20.065
You insulted Her Ladyship

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:22.105
and even harassed
a palace maid in broad daylight.

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:24.705
Miss, don't slander me.

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:26.985
I thought someone barged in
without permission,

00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:28.785
so I lost my temper.

00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:31.905
Your Ladyship, you are merciful.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:32.905
Please forgive me.

00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:34.385
Besides,

00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:36.665
I didn't harass anyone.

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:40.625
She came to ask for help
and accidentally knocked over a scroll.

00:06:40.705 --> 00:06:41.505
Utter nonsense!

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:43.425
What were you doing on top of her?

00:06:43.505 --> 00:06:46.025
Miss, don't ruin
a good person's reputation.

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:49.265
Sister Birou fell, so I helped her up.

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:51.865
Don't believe me? Ask her.

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:55.345
Don't be afraid. Tell the truth.

00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:01.105
Enough.

00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:04.425
Supervisor Hu already said
it was a misunderstanding.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.625
I have questions for him. You may leave.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.465
Yes, Your Ladyship.

00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:11.865
Sister Birou,

00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:14.585
aren't you forgetting something?

00:07:14.665 --> 00:07:18.385
I've been wronged because of you today.

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:24.025
Your Ladyship,

00:07:24.665 --> 00:07:27.505
I came to borrow money from Supervisor Hu.

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:31.105
I slipped and fell just now,

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:34.105
and he helped me up.

00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:37.585
Please, Your Ladyship, don't blame him.

00:07:39.105 --> 00:07:41.665
The misunderstanding is cleared up, right?

00:07:41.745 --> 00:07:44.185
If Your Ladyship has questions for me,

00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:46.065
may I get up first?

00:07:46.145 --> 00:07:47.145
You…!

00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:04.225
Wait outside.

00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:09.785
Yes.

00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:14.505
- Who is this?
- None of your concern.

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:17.625
Did you know Hanxiao?

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:21.145
After that "flower on the wall" incident,
everyone does.

00:08:21.225 --> 00:08:22.465
And before that?

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:26.825
Before she left the palace,
I'd helped her out too.

00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:28.785
You lent her money?

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:30.705
That's right.

00:08:31.465 --> 00:08:33.105
She still owed me
a tidy sum before leaving.

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:37.185
Luckily, her resettlement payment
was just enough

00:08:37.264 --> 00:08:39.264
to cover the principal.

00:08:40.065 --> 00:08:40.904
What about the interest?

00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:42.625
I had to write it off.

00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:47.385
I lose money all the time.

00:08:48.665 --> 00:08:50.185
Then why do you keep lending?

00:08:50.265 --> 00:08:51.665
I'm softhearted.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:53.625
We're all unfortunate souls.

00:08:53.705 --> 00:08:56.185
If someone's in trouble, I help if I can.

00:08:58.865 --> 00:08:59.985
How kind of you.

00:09:00.865 --> 00:09:03.545
Did you help her after she left?

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:05.705
Your Ladyship must be joking.

00:09:05.785 --> 00:09:08.025
The Palace Registry Bureau only places

00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:09.425
palace maids in temples after they retire.

00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:11.265
Where they go afterward

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:14.705
is not our concern.

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.185
So how could I have seen her again?

00:09:18.745 --> 00:09:20.345
But come to think of it,

00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:21.865
I did see her one more time.

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.945
You mean in the palace wall that day?

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:28.465
It's just a joke.

00:09:28.545 --> 00:09:30.465
Do you want to be put in a wall
and turned into fertilizer too?

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.225
That was inappropriate.
Spare me, Your Ladyship.

00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:35.905
I can spare you.

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:37.825
But someone else wants you dead.

00:09:39.465 --> 00:09:41.265
You're trying to frighten me.

00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:46.505
Do you recognize this pendant?

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:50.625
That's a fine piece.

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:52.305
I've never seen it,

00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:54.945
but I'd wager it belongs to a consort.

00:09:55.025 --> 00:09:56.905
Hongshao from
the Imperial Housekeeping Service said

00:09:56.985 --> 00:09:58.345
you gave it to her.

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:00.465
Nonsense!

00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:02.585
That pathetic maid?

00:10:04.785 --> 00:10:05.865
This is priceless.

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.025
How could I have gotten my hands
on something like this?

00:10:08.105 --> 00:10:10.625
But she made it very clear.

00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:13.065
It was Hu Da
from the Palace Registry Bureau

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.025
who asked someone to give her this
as a token of affection.

00:10:17.505 --> 00:10:18.465
Your Ladyship,

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.585
I'll admit it.
I'm a greedy and lecherous man.

00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:23.985
But money comes before women for me,

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:26.665
and staying alive comes before all else.

00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:30.185
If you want, bring her here
to confront me.

00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:33.865
Have her meet every eunuch in the bureau

00:10:33.945 --> 00:10:36.105
until she finds this so-called go-between.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.225
It's getting late.

00:10:41.305 --> 00:10:43.625
Because of Miss Hanxiao's case,

00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:45.505
His Majesty is being extra lenient

00:10:45.585 --> 00:10:48.345
and will soon release
another group of palace maids.

00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:51.065
I still have plenty of work to do.

00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:52.985
I can't keep you company any longer.

00:10:53.505 --> 00:10:55.385
My apologies. Please understand.

00:10:56.905 --> 00:10:59.625
If you suddenly remember anything,

00:10:59.705 --> 00:11:01.505
be sure to come
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:03.985
I'll cooperate fully
with Your Ladyship's investigation.

00:11:04.625 --> 00:11:06.065
You don't like reading.

00:11:06.145 --> 00:11:07.625
Why keep so many books for show?

00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:13.265
I…

00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:14.945
Of course, I love to read.

00:11:15.545 --> 00:11:17.425
These are all books I read often.

00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:23.945
Your Ladyship, take care.

00:11:28.825 --> 00:11:30.225
BOOK OF RITES

00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:38.825
Hu Da has an errand outside the palace.

00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:42.505
You noticed his carriage
was ready to go too?

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:47.265
I checked.

00:11:47.345 --> 00:11:48.985
There's no mugwort in his courtyard.

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:50.945
And his room had only a delicate scent.

00:11:51.025 --> 00:11:52.305
He'd never use mugwort.

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:55.505
Someone's trying to pin
Hanxiao's death on Hu Da.

00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:57.225
Serves him right.

00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:59.545
Even I wanted to hit him.

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.025
He must've made a lot of enemies.

00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:03.145
He says he helps people out with loans,

00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:05.825
but it's really just private lending
with outrageous interest.

00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:07.305
I should look

00:12:07.385 --> 00:12:09.825
into how a secondary ninth-rank supervisor
got so much money.

00:12:11.225 --> 00:12:13.425
A copy of the Book of Rites
is on the third shelf of his bookcase.

00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:15.985
If we can get it,
there should be some leads inside.

00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:17.385
The Book of Rites?

00:12:17.465 --> 00:12:19.905
It's the only book on the shelves
that's been touched.

00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:21.745
I doubt it's because he likes reading it.

00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:28.425
Mr. Xiao, you may leave now.

00:12:28.505 --> 00:12:30.745
We won't trouble you with tailing Hu Da.

00:12:31.425 --> 00:12:33.705
I'm off duty tonight.
I'll go with Your Ladyship.

00:12:40.065 --> 00:12:41.265
Let's go.

00:13:01.705 --> 00:13:03.025
Welcome, sir.

00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:10.465
Shadowing people is tedious.

00:13:10.545 --> 00:13:12.345
Feel free to head back whenever you like.

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:14.425
Stargazing can be just as monotonous.

00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:16.985
Sometimes, it takes months
for a star to move even a little.

00:13:18.025 --> 00:13:19.745
Then I'm sure you'll be good at this.

00:13:21.025 --> 00:13:23.785
But Hu Da was in such a hurry
to come out and run errands.

00:13:23.865 --> 00:13:26.065
Why is he sitting down for a drink now?

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:32.585
Something's off!

00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:42.825
- Where's the man who sat here?
- I don't know.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.945
- Is there a back door?
- No.

00:13:58.225 --> 00:13:59.265
Something's off!

00:14:05.185 --> 00:14:06.145
That carriage.

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:13.425
This way.

00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:16.065
How do you know which way to go?

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:17.785
That carriage is wider than most.

00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:18.905
There are only so many lanes it can take.

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:20.785
We're now
in the northeast corner of the ward.

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:22.705
There's only one direction it can go.

00:14:25.145 --> 00:14:27.545
The carriage is quick,
but we can take shortcuts on foot.

00:14:27.625 --> 00:14:28.785
Even at our current pace,

00:14:28.865 --> 00:14:30.825
we can intercept him
at the entrance of Yanle Lane.

00:14:31.865 --> 00:14:32.945
In that case,

00:14:33.025 --> 00:14:35.145
let me show you an even faster route.

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:40.745
Come on.

00:14:41.745 --> 00:14:42.665
Please go first, Your Ladyship.

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:45.385
I forgot you didn't know martial arts.

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:47.865
Official business.
I'm borrowing your horse.

00:15:00.585 --> 00:15:01.465
Your Ladyship!

00:15:24.225 --> 00:15:25.585
HANGUANG LANE

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:29.625
Roosters for sale!

00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:31.425
Big roosters!

00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:32.345
‪CHEN'S SPICE SHOP

Roosters for sale!

00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:39.505
Who poured that slop? Come out here!

00:15:39.585 --> 00:15:41.545
How can you prove I poured it?

00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:43.585
It came from your shop.

00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:44.825
If not you, who?

00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:46.505
Look at my clothes! Pay for the damage!

00:15:46.585 --> 00:15:48.385
Blaming me for your own carelessness?

00:15:48.985 --> 00:15:50.985
- You heartless woman!
- Who are you calling heartless?

00:15:51.065 --> 00:15:52.265
You're ruining my business.

00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:53.185
You should be paying me!

00:15:53.265 --> 00:15:55.305
- Get lost! You stink.
- You!

00:15:55.385 --> 00:15:57.705
- You're not getting a coin from me.
- You can't…

00:15:58.545 --> 00:15:59.665
- Sir…
- What's wrong?

00:15:59.745 --> 00:16:01.705
She won't pay for the damage.
Please stand up for me!

00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:03.305
- He's the one who…
- Enough.

00:16:03.385 --> 00:16:04.905
- Sir…
- Get lost.

00:16:05.545 --> 00:16:06.305
HANGUANG LANE

00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:21.465
Stay away!

00:16:26.905 --> 00:16:27.865
Mugwort.

00:16:32.865 --> 00:16:34.025
Help! Help!

00:16:34.105 --> 00:16:35.465
Someone, help!

00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:36.985
Help!

00:16:40.825 --> 00:16:42.065
Step aside.

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:51.865
Step aside.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:54.465
Don't move.

00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:03.345
Hu Da.

00:17:03.425 --> 00:17:04.985
Hu Da. Hu Da?

00:17:06.385 --> 00:17:07.305
Hu Da!

00:17:09.065 --> 00:17:10.464
Roosters for sale!

00:17:10.545 --> 00:17:13.145
- Who poured that slop?
- How can you prove I poured it?

00:17:13.224 --> 00:17:14.905
- If not you, who?
- Can you prove it?

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:16.905
You are making a scene
and hurting my business.

00:17:16.985 --> 00:17:18.585
- You should pay me back!
- But I…

00:17:18.665 --> 00:17:20.265
- My clothings are ruined!
- Get lost!

00:17:20.345 --> 00:17:21.184
Who?

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:42.785
Where did you go?

00:17:45.585 --> 00:17:46.585
Someone tried to kill you.

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:47.585
Don't you want to know who?

00:17:47.665 --> 00:17:49.985
Plenty of people want me dead.

00:17:50.505 --> 00:17:53.505
Who knows which debtor it was this time?

00:17:53.585 --> 00:17:55.785
Where did you get the money
to lend out in the palace?

00:17:57.225 --> 00:17:58.985
The one after you
is either someone you've crossed

00:17:59.065 --> 00:17:59.905
or someone you depend on.

00:18:00.665 --> 00:18:03.545
You've already become
the scapegoat for Hanxiao's murder.

00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:05.385
I didn't…

00:18:05.465 --> 00:18:07.145
I didn't… I…

00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:12.705
Hu Da. Hu Da!

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:31.545
Struck on the head,
the coachman died instantly.

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:34.945
Witnesses said Hu Da
was bitten to death by bats.

00:18:35.025 --> 00:18:36.785
He wasn't bitten to death.

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:38.025
He was poisoned to death by the bats.

00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:41.505
Your Ladyship, we found this nearby.

00:18:45.665 --> 00:18:49.185
Why would bats attack people
in broad daylight for no reason?

00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:52.265
Hu Da smelled of linglong grass.

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.705
That's what drove the bats into a frenzy.

00:18:54.785 --> 00:18:55.985
Linglong grass?

00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:57.065
From incense in his room?

00:18:58.145 --> 00:19:01.465
No, there was linglong grass powder
on his clothes.

00:19:02.065 --> 00:19:03.465
Someone sprinkled it on him
during the commotion.

00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:06.985
But where could that many bats
have been hidden?

00:19:08.025 --> 00:19:08.905
HANGUANG LANE

00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:13.785
The rope was cut.

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:16.585
Interesting.

00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:19.825
From the moment that slop was poured,
Hu Da was in someone's trap.

00:19:22.425 --> 00:19:23.425
Mr. Xiao, did you go

00:19:23.505 --> 00:19:26.225
to chase after a tall man
in a black robe and hood?

00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:27.345
Yes.

00:19:27.865 --> 00:19:28.745
He was slightly hunched.

00:19:28.825 --> 00:19:30.065
He left deeper toe prints
than heel prints,

00:19:30.145 --> 00:19:31.865
probably from years
of hauling heavy loads.

00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:35.025
When you rushed to save Hu Da,
you brushed past him.

00:19:36.745 --> 00:19:37.665
Mugwort.

00:19:40.425 --> 00:19:41.985
I smelled mugwort on him.

00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:43.785
He's the one who set Hu Da up.

00:19:44.385 --> 00:19:46.465
It's a pity I couldn't catch up.
I overestimated myself.

00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:48.105
Don't sell yourself short.

00:19:48.185 --> 00:19:50.745
You picked out the culprit
with just a single glance.

00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:52.985
He clearly knows this area well.

00:19:53.065 --> 00:19:54.185
That's why he got away so fast.

00:19:54.785 --> 00:19:56.465
Take Hu Da's body back
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:57.785
The killer must be
someone from the palace.

00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.385
- He won't get far.
- Understood.

00:20:09.705 --> 00:20:11.345
Has Your Ladyship seen a mark like this?

00:20:11.425 --> 00:20:12.945
I saw it on that man's cart.

00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:15.945
You know the palace well.
Have you seen it there?

00:20:16.025 --> 00:20:16.985
The lavatories.

00:20:17.065 --> 00:20:19.945
Carts and barrels from
the palace lavatories all have this mark.

00:20:20.545 --> 00:20:21.985
That explains everything.

00:20:22.065 --> 00:20:24.265
Night-soil collectors
haul carts all year round,

00:20:24.345 --> 00:20:25.425
so their footprints
are deeper at the front.

00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:26.905
They have free access to the palace,

00:20:26.985 --> 00:20:28.305
and their status is so low
that no one notices them.

00:20:28.385 --> 00:20:31.505
And they often use mugwort incense
to get rid of the smell.

00:20:32.025 --> 00:20:32.905
Mr. Xiao, you really are sharp.

00:20:36.265 --> 00:20:37.185
Your Ladyship.

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:40.305
My apologies.

00:20:43.345 --> 00:20:44.985
We have a lead. Let's go catch someone.

00:20:45.065 --> 00:20:46.225
Your Ladyship,

00:20:46.305 --> 00:20:48.985
why were you holding Mr. Xiao's hand
in front of everyone?

00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:54.065
He was calculating
the killer's whereabouts.

00:20:55.985 --> 00:20:59.665
Did he really need her hand to do that?

00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:10.465
Your Ladyship.

00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:12.385
Among the night-soil collectors,

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:14.145
is there anyone who always
keeps to himself,

00:21:14.225 --> 00:21:17.065
covers himself up from head to toe,
and likes to wear a hood?

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:19.785
Your Ladyship, that's Lou Chuo for sure.

00:21:19.865 --> 00:21:20.785
Where is he?

00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:22.425
He should be out delivering

00:21:22.505 --> 00:21:24.025
golden soil from the palace

00:21:24.545 --> 00:21:25.705
to the eastern suburbs.

00:21:30.425 --> 00:21:31.385
You want it?

00:21:35.945 --> 00:21:36.985
Here.

00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:41.465
Sir,

00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:43.825
do you know a man named Lou Chuo?

00:21:43.905 --> 00:21:45.985
No. In this trade, we never ask names.

00:21:46.065 --> 00:21:47.465
He's a palace eunuch.

00:21:48.305 --> 00:21:51.505
Nine out of ten sellers
claim to be palace eunuchs

00:21:51.585 --> 00:21:52.785
just to get a better price.

00:21:52.865 --> 00:21:55.185
We're not fools.
We pay based on the quality.

00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:56.425
That's right.

00:21:58.665 --> 00:22:00.505
- Time to get back to work.
- We still have questions for you.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:02.945
This is an important seller.
We can't make him wait.

00:22:03.025 --> 00:22:04.465
He brings nothing but pure palace compost.

00:22:04.545 --> 00:22:06.345
It makes top-grade fertilizer.
Golden soil.

00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:11.465
- Let's go take a look.
- All right.

00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:23.865
Lou Chuo, right?

00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:25.025

00:22:28.105 --> 00:22:28.945
Lou Chuo.

00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:32.465
Boss!

00:22:34.305 --> 00:22:35.145
Linglong grass.

00:22:42.425 --> 00:22:43.865
Don't let him get away!

00:23:21.665 --> 00:23:22.785
You're coming with me.

00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:39.025
So ruthless to yourself?

00:23:50.385 --> 00:23:51.265
Boss!

00:24:09.505 --> 00:24:10.985
You can't escape now.

00:24:11.585 --> 00:24:13.065
Your Ladyship, where should we take him?

00:24:15.465 --> 00:24:16.825
The Palace Investigation Bureau's
cells are full.

00:24:16.905 --> 00:24:19.265
Please take him
to the Court of Judicial Review.

00:24:20.265 --> 00:24:22.905
Your Ladyship,
are you handing this case over to us?

00:24:25.145 --> 00:24:26.585
I'm just borrowing a cell.

00:24:36.345 --> 00:24:38.345
Lou Chuo has the same rash.

00:24:41.265 --> 00:24:44.905
Earlier, we found a hard object
in the victim's mouth.

00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:46.625
After soaking it in hot water,

00:24:46.705 --> 00:24:48.745
it turned out to be a ginger slice.

00:24:48.825 --> 00:24:50.185
Why would she have that?

00:24:51.825 --> 00:24:53.905
Night-soil collectors stuff jujubes
in their nostrils

00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:55.865
and keep ginger slices
in their mouths to fight the stench.

00:24:56.585 --> 00:24:59.465
Hanxiao was probably
with Lou Chuo before she died.

00:24:59.985 --> 00:25:03.225
COURT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW

00:25:08.745 --> 00:25:09.785
Your Ladyship,

00:25:09.865 --> 00:25:13.145
is it really proper for you
to be around him now?

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:16.625
This way, he can't commit suicide
or run away,

00:25:17.185 --> 00:25:19.145
and we don't have to deal with the smell.

00:25:19.225 --> 00:25:20.305
Isn't that perfect?

00:25:22.065 --> 00:25:23.305
Count your blessings.

00:25:23.385 --> 00:25:25.945
Her Ladyship is letting you
enjoy a hot bath.

00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:26.865
Now start talking.

00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:30.745
You…!

00:25:36.065 --> 00:25:38.785
Let me question him today.

00:25:42.185 --> 00:25:43.105
Please do, Mr. Xiao.

00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:55.425
Hu Da lent money and harassed women
in the palace.

00:25:55.505 --> 00:25:57.705
He made plenty of enemies.

00:25:58.785 --> 00:26:01.265
Did you kill Hu Da
because you couldn't repay your debt?

00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:05.345
No, that's not it.

00:26:06.105 --> 00:26:07.105
Was it because of a woman?

00:26:09.505 --> 00:26:10.745
You hated her?

00:26:12.745 --> 00:26:15.185
No, you loved her.

00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:18.225
Your love turned into resentment.

00:26:18.305 --> 00:26:21.345
You're lowly, dirty, and always reek.

00:26:21.425 --> 00:26:22.665
To her,

00:26:22.745 --> 00:26:25.065
you were like a fly or a rat,
something to avoid at all costs.

00:26:25.665 --> 00:26:28.945
The more you tried to get close,
the further she pulled away.

00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:32.905
But at the end of the day,
you were both servants.

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:36.025
Neither was nobler
or lowlier than the other.

00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:40.545
She was just a woman. She deserved to die.

00:26:44.865 --> 00:26:48.305
Hu Da was better-looking than you,
rich, and generous.

00:26:48.385 --> 00:26:50.665
The woman you loved was drawn to him.

00:26:50.745 --> 00:26:53.145
You could never be like him in this life,

00:26:53.825 --> 00:26:55.225
and you hated him for it.

00:26:55.305 --> 00:26:56.345
That's why you killed him.

00:26:57.065 --> 00:26:58.185
Kill…

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:00.745
Kill.

00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:02.585
Mr. Xiao,

00:27:02.665 --> 00:27:05.345
when did you get so good
at interrogations?

00:27:06.345 --> 00:27:07.305
I'm not.

00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:08.385
I just picked up a few tricks.

00:27:30.385 --> 00:27:32.865
What a shame. Hu Da isn't dead yet.

00:27:35.705 --> 00:27:36.745
How useless you are.

00:27:37.345 --> 00:27:38.985
You couldn't get the woman you wanted,

00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:40.305
and you couldn't kill the man you hated.

00:27:40.385 --> 00:27:42.025
Hu Da is alive and well.

00:27:42.105 --> 00:27:44.145
More beautiful women will fall for him.

00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:45.345
But you?

00:27:45.425 --> 00:27:47.545
The woman you loved is dead.

00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:48.505
You'll never get her back.

00:27:49.265 --> 00:27:50.265
You have nothing left.

00:27:54.905 --> 00:27:57.505
If you tell us how you killed Hanxiao,

00:27:57.585 --> 00:28:01.505
I'll let you kill Hu Da before you die.

00:28:01.585 --> 00:28:04.785
If you stay silent,
I'll still let you live,

00:28:04.865 --> 00:28:06.865
but it'll be a fate worse than death.

00:28:11.825 --> 00:28:12.985
Your choice.

00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:17.425
Fine,

00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:19.705
I'll talk.

00:28:20.305 --> 00:28:21.665
But if I confess,

00:28:22.425 --> 00:28:24.265
will you really report
everything as it is?

00:28:25.905 --> 00:28:27.785
There aren't many things I dare not do.

00:28:27.865 --> 00:28:28.705
Try me.

00:28:33.145 --> 00:28:34.425
Your Ladyship.

00:28:39.825 --> 00:28:40.785
Lou Chuo,

00:28:40.865 --> 00:28:43.345
you filthy wretch.

00:28:43.425 --> 00:28:45.265
What a spectacle you've made!

00:28:45.345 --> 00:28:47.345
How dare you waste so much
of Her Ladyship's time?

00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:50.305
Now, with ironclad evidence,

00:28:50.385 --> 00:28:51.945
your guilt is clear as day.

00:28:52.025 --> 00:28:54.305
Confess at once!

00:28:56.545 --> 00:28:57.585
Your Ladyship,

00:28:57.665 --> 00:28:59.305
this is certainly

00:28:59.385 --> 00:29:02.145
a unique spot for an interrogation.

00:29:06.265 --> 00:29:07.345
Lou Chuo,

00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:10.705
out with it!

00:29:13.745 --> 00:29:17.265
I put Hanxiao in the wall.

00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:41.065
I was born the son of a military officer.

00:29:42.065 --> 00:29:43.465
When I was little,

00:29:43.545 --> 00:29:47.545
my family got convicted,
and I was sent to the palace as a eunuch.

00:29:48.305 --> 00:29:51.025
I've worked as a night-soil collector
all these years.

00:29:51.105 --> 00:29:54.945
Dirty and smelly, I was shunned by all.

00:29:56.985 --> 00:30:01.265
The magnificence and splendor
of the palace

00:30:01.345 --> 00:30:02.625
meant nothing to me.

00:30:03.145 --> 00:30:05.385
No matter how beautiful the maids
or flowers were,

00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:08.305
I never looked at them twice.

00:30:09.345 --> 00:30:10.505
Every day after work,

00:30:11.305 --> 00:30:14.825
I'd return to my tiny room
that sunlight never reached.

00:30:15.625 --> 00:30:18.305
My only companions were the rats.

00:30:19.265 --> 00:30:22.745
But one day, I met Hanxiao.

00:30:23.345 --> 00:30:26.625
Night-soil collectors
rarely go to the Palace Registry Bureau.

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:29.945
Each month, one of us goes there

00:30:30.465 --> 00:30:33.585
to collect pay for everyone,

00:30:34.345 --> 00:30:37.705
so as not to draw attention
or upset others.

00:30:38.465 --> 00:30:41.145
- Ugh. What's that smell?
- He stinks.

00:30:42.865 --> 00:30:45.625
Are night-soil collectors allowed
to collect their pay here themselves?

00:30:46.345 --> 00:30:49.505
That was the pay
meant for all the night-soil collectors.

00:30:50.585 --> 00:30:51.785
I didn't dare lose a single coin,

00:30:51.865 --> 00:30:53.465
so I scrambled to pick them up.

00:30:56.065 --> 00:30:58.545
Hey, filthy rat,
where did you get all that money?

00:30:58.625 --> 00:30:59.985
Did you steal it?

00:31:03.305 --> 00:31:04.665
I'm talking to you.

00:31:04.745 --> 00:31:05.945
Where is all this money from?

00:31:08.865 --> 00:31:10.265
Do you have nothing better to do?

00:31:10.345 --> 00:31:12.465
If you're so free,
help me plant flowers for Consort Shu.

00:31:12.545 --> 00:31:14.945
Please, Sister Hanxiao, have mercy.

00:31:15.025 --> 00:31:17.145
It's too hot. I'll get heatstroke.

00:31:17.225 --> 00:31:18.625
- Then get lost!
- Yes.

00:31:21.105 --> 00:31:22.745
In all my years in the palace,

00:31:23.865 --> 00:31:26.025
that was the first time
anyone had stood up for me.

00:31:26.105 --> 00:31:27.465
What are you staring at?

00:31:27.545 --> 00:31:29.345
Pick up your money and head back.

00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:33.345
It was the first time
someone had smiled at me.

00:31:34.185 --> 00:31:35.465
That person was Hanxiao.

00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:38.265
After that,

00:31:39.225 --> 00:31:40.985
I'd try to find a way to see her

00:31:41.705 --> 00:31:44.065
whenever I finished work.

00:31:45.465 --> 00:31:47.145
She worked in Consort Shu's palace.

00:31:47.665 --> 00:31:49.585
It was hard to see her,

00:31:50.265 --> 00:31:51.585
but I had my ways.

00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:55.105
Even a glimpse from afar was enough.

00:31:57.065 --> 00:31:58.745
But later, I realized

00:31:59.265 --> 00:32:01.345
she looked down on me

00:32:01.945 --> 00:32:03.225
just like everyone else.

00:32:04.905 --> 00:32:06.105
Sister Hanxiao.

00:32:08.305 --> 00:32:09.385
Supervisor Hu.

00:32:09.465 --> 00:32:10.625
About the loan you took,

00:32:10.705 --> 00:32:12.945
I'll charge you the lowest interest rate.

00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:14.305
Thank you, Supervisor Hu.

00:32:14.385 --> 00:32:16.185
However…

00:32:18.065 --> 00:32:19.145
Come with me.

00:32:19.825 --> 00:32:20.745
All right.

00:32:29.345 --> 00:32:31.145
She was nothing special.

00:32:31.745 --> 00:32:35.185
She was just like the rest,
chasing wealth and scorning the poor.

00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:40.025
So you killed her for that?

00:32:40.105 --> 00:32:41.905
If you don't want to hear it,

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:43.585
I won't bother.

00:32:43.665 --> 00:32:44.665
You…!

00:32:44.745 --> 00:32:45.945
Chief Justice, please.

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:48.465
Chief Justice.

00:32:57.505 --> 00:32:59.865
Lou Chuo, continue.

00:33:00.865 --> 00:33:01.745
Later,

00:33:01.825 --> 00:33:03.705
I heard she was leaving the palace.

00:33:04.705 --> 00:33:07.025
I thought it would be my last chance,

00:33:07.705 --> 00:33:09.545
so I secretly wrote her a letter.

00:33:10.825 --> 00:33:12.745
She didn't even reply.

00:33:13.745 --> 00:33:16.425
I thought we'd never
meet again in this life.

00:33:18.545 --> 00:33:21.665
But fate is unpredictable.

00:33:23.105 --> 00:33:25.105
One day, I found her lying in a gutter,

00:33:25.185 --> 00:33:27.545
hair a mess and clothes in rags.

00:33:27.625 --> 00:33:29.225
She'd been brought right back to me.

00:34:18.665 --> 00:34:20.865
I saved her

00:34:21.585 --> 00:34:22.865
and treated her well,

00:34:22.945 --> 00:34:24.824
but she still despised me.

00:34:25.344 --> 00:34:26.865
I saved her.

00:34:26.945 --> 00:34:29.705
Without me,
she would've died by the roadside.

00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:33.985
I kept her in my room

00:34:35.344 --> 00:34:36.225
and made her stay with me.

00:34:36.985 --> 00:34:38.545
This time, she didn't resist.

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:40.185
She'd learned her lesson.

00:34:42.264 --> 00:34:43.105
And then?

00:34:44.145 --> 00:34:45.824
After ten days or so,

00:34:45.905 --> 00:34:47.344
she died.

00:34:49.385 --> 00:34:50.545
Even toward the end

00:34:51.585 --> 00:34:54.105
of her life,
all she could think about was Hu Da.

00:34:54.705 --> 00:34:57.145
She could never stop saying his name!

00:34:57.225 --> 00:35:00.385
But in the end,
wasn't I the one by her side?

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:03.625
You killed Hu Da out of jealousy.

00:35:05.585 --> 00:35:07.585
Didn't he deserve to die?

00:35:10.665 --> 00:35:12.625
But Hanxiao had already yielded to you.

00:35:12.705 --> 00:35:13.905
Why did you kill her?

00:35:17.345 --> 00:35:18.585
I didn't.

00:35:20.945 --> 00:35:22.305
She was too weak.

00:35:23.425 --> 00:35:26.385
One day, I came back from work

00:35:26.465 --> 00:35:28.105
and found her dead in my room.

00:35:30.465 --> 00:35:31.625
It was just as well she died.

00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:35.065
At least she'd never leave me again.

00:35:40.025 --> 00:35:41.385
But after only three days,

00:35:42.905 --> 00:35:46.465
her body started to stink
and break out in rashes.

00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:47.865
It was awful.

00:35:48.585 --> 00:35:52.425
I had no choice but to bury her.

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:57.545
You could've cremated her
or dumped her outside the palace.

00:35:58.065 --> 00:35:59.985
Why did you put her in a palace wall?

00:36:06.345 --> 00:36:07.545
That way,

00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:10.025
when I hauled waste
and passed by every day,

00:36:10.105 --> 00:36:11.265
I could see her.

00:36:23.345 --> 00:36:26.505
Could those wounds have formed
in just around ten days?

00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:31.385
The wounds vary in color.

00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:34.305
Clearly, there are both
old and new injuries.

00:36:34.385 --> 00:36:37.025
The oldest ones are over half a year old.

00:36:38.505 --> 00:36:41.105
Hanxiao must have been abused
ever since leaving the palace.

00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:43.145
Where did she go?

00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:45.785
Lou Chuo is still hiding a lot from us.

00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:47.505
Go look into Hu Da first.

00:36:47.585 --> 00:36:49.825
If it'd been truly just a jealousy murder,

00:36:49.905 --> 00:36:51.665
Lou Chuo wouldn't
have gone to all that trouble.

00:36:51.745 --> 00:36:52.785
Understood.

00:36:53.425 --> 00:36:56.385
Yes, a carriage picked them up.

00:36:56.465 --> 00:36:57.905
A few girls came out first.

00:36:57.985 --> 00:36:59.225
Then your sister ran after them.

00:36:59.305 --> 00:37:00.745
Do you know where they went?

00:37:01.545 --> 00:37:04.305
The Xuandu Temple only records
the departure time,

00:37:04.385 --> 00:37:06.345
not the destination.

00:37:07.705 --> 00:37:09.425
This should be the place.

00:37:12.145 --> 00:37:14.585
Taozhi, look how nice it is here.

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:16.265
Didn't I tell you it'd be fine?

00:37:16.345 --> 00:37:18.385
This must be a good place to work.

00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:19.505
BAIRONG, FORMER PALACE MAID
MULIAN, FORMER PALACE MAID

00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:20.465
It really is nice.

00:37:20.545 --> 00:37:22.945
LINLAN, FORMER PALACE MAID
CUIZHU, FORMER PALACE MAID

00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:25.385
What kind of good job
could Hu Da possibly find for us?

00:37:25.465 --> 00:37:27.105
We should still be careful.

00:37:28.385 --> 00:37:29.985
Anyway, now that you know where we are,

00:37:30.065 --> 00:37:31.225
you can stop worrying.

00:37:31.305 --> 00:37:32.305
Go see your brother now.

00:37:37.345 --> 00:37:39.305
Ladies, you're here. Come with me.

00:37:40.105 --> 00:37:40.985
Let's go.

00:37:56.865 --> 00:37:58.105
This place feels strange.

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:01.665
They provide food and lodging.

00:38:01.745 --> 00:38:02.865
Isn't that good?

00:38:02.945 --> 00:38:03.785
Yeah.

00:38:06.465 --> 00:38:07.905
But the room is so dark.

00:38:10.425 --> 00:38:12.545
You'll all be living here from now on.

00:38:13.145 --> 00:38:14.465
Now, hand over your travel passes.

00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:16.425
- Travel pass?
- Well.

00:38:16.505 --> 00:38:17.665
My travel pass…

00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:25.345
Sir, what kind of business
do you run here?

00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:27.625
You'll find out soon enough.

00:38:28.585 --> 00:38:29.625
Hand it over.

00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:32.225
If we're here to work,

00:38:32.305 --> 00:38:33.945
shouldn't we get
proof of employment first?

00:38:34.025 --> 00:38:35.665
Why are you taking our passes?

00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:37.265
Why so many questions?

00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:39.705
You're taking our passes
without explanation?

00:38:39.785 --> 00:38:40.665
Something's off!

00:38:43.425 --> 00:38:45.745
Does the wage you promised us still stand?

00:38:45.825 --> 00:38:47.065
Of course.

00:38:47.865 --> 00:38:49.025
As long as you work hard,

00:38:49.105 --> 00:38:51.105
you'll only earn more.

00:38:53.065 --> 00:38:55.265
No matter the pay, we shouldn't stay.

00:38:56.265 --> 00:38:57.225
Taozhi,

00:38:58.785 --> 00:38:59.665
I need the money.

00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:04.785
You really won't leave?

00:39:05.665 --> 00:39:07.065
I'm staying.

00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:09.785
Whatever the job is,
I have to try it for a few days at least.

00:39:20.185 --> 00:39:22.865
You think you can just come and go
as you please?

00:39:22.945 --> 00:39:24.265
I don't care what this place is,

00:39:24.345 --> 00:39:27.745
but in the Western Capital,
you can't just detain people.

00:39:31.705 --> 00:39:33.225
- Taozhi!
- Taozhi!

00:39:33.305 --> 00:39:34.425
How could you hit her?

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.865
Stop causing trouble.

00:39:36.785 --> 00:39:38.985
If you break the rules,
you take the punishment!

00:39:39.905 --> 00:39:41.785
But I never agreed to work for you.

00:39:41.865 --> 00:39:42.945
You want to leave?

00:39:43.025 --> 00:39:44.985
Fine. Ten guan.

00:39:45.065 --> 00:39:47.105
- Ten… Ten guan?
- Ten guan?

00:39:47.185 --> 00:39:48.225
Ten guan?

00:39:57.345 --> 00:39:58.465
What do we do now?

00:40:02.825 --> 00:40:07.105
Do you still think
this is a legitimate business?

00:40:19.145 --> 00:40:21.265
Where did you find Hanxiao?

00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:30.305
Didn't I tell you already?

00:40:31.225 --> 00:40:33.345
In an alley of Daozheng Ward.

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:35.825
She was lying by a gutter.

00:40:35.905 --> 00:40:37.825
There are many alleys in Daozheng Ward.

00:40:38.345 --> 00:40:39.585
Which one?

00:40:42.065 --> 00:40:42.985
I don't remember.

00:40:43.505 --> 00:40:46.505
Did you see anything else on the way back?

00:40:48.585 --> 00:40:49.505
Yes.

00:40:51.465 --> 00:40:54.145
That was the day
Hanxiao and I got married.

00:40:55.145 --> 00:40:56.425
How could I forget?

00:40:57.025 --> 00:41:00.225
Everyone along the way congratulated me.

00:41:00.905 --> 00:41:03.465
Groups of young women chattered,

00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:06.185
all gossiping about me.

00:41:06.825 --> 00:41:08.665
But they were all just ordinary girls,

00:41:09.825 --> 00:41:11.065
nothing like Hanxiao.

00:41:11.705 --> 00:41:13.425
She carried a subtle scent,

00:41:14.425 --> 00:41:16.385
fragrant from afar

00:41:17.305 --> 00:41:20.905
and sweet up close.

00:41:21.585 --> 00:41:23.825
That's why I always wanted to be near her.

00:41:24.385 --> 00:41:25.585
Anything else?

00:41:27.705 --> 00:41:28.665
Yes.

00:41:29.185 --> 00:41:30.825
There were flowers,

00:41:31.785 --> 00:41:33.145
so many flowers,

00:41:33.225 --> 00:41:35.585
more than I'd ever seen in my life.

00:41:35.665 --> 00:41:36.825
They were in all colors,

00:41:37.425 --> 00:41:39.865
even more beautiful than those
in Consort Shu's garden.

00:41:40.705 --> 00:41:41.825
Honestly,

00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:46.785
only Hanxiao could have made them
look so beautiful.

00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:51.105
There were also drumming, festive music,

00:41:51.185 --> 00:41:52.185
bells ringing,

00:41:52.905 --> 00:41:54.185
and people singing.

00:41:54.705 --> 00:41:55.945
It was lovely.

00:41:56.025 --> 00:41:58.905
Little kids ran over with baskets,

00:41:58.985 --> 00:42:00.905
asking for lucky money.

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:04.185
I handed out candy,
and they were all so happy.

00:42:16.145 --> 00:42:18.305
This is the only canal
that runs through Daozheng Ward.

00:42:18.385 --> 00:42:19.865
Let's search from north to south.

00:42:24.305 --> 00:42:26.105
We've walked so far,
but we still haven't seen

00:42:26.185 --> 00:42:27.585
flowers, children, or women.

00:42:30.385 --> 00:42:33.505
One or two wen for needles, thread,

00:42:33.585 --> 00:42:36.225
or floral cloth for your shoes!

00:42:37.065 --> 00:42:38.305
Come take a look!

00:42:39.945 --> 00:42:41.465
- I want it!
- Give it to me first!

00:42:42.145 --> 00:42:43.665
Could this be what Lou Chuo described?

00:42:43.745 --> 00:42:46.465
There were also drumming, festive music,
and bells ringing.

00:42:46.545 --> 00:42:50.865
Little kids ran over with baskets,
asking for lucky money.

00:42:51.985 --> 00:42:54.305
But where are the flowers and the ladies?

00:42:55.265 --> 00:42:56.905
If what he called "festive music"
wasn't really music,

00:42:56.985 --> 00:42:59.065
maybe the "flowers" weren't real either.

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:03.865
Sure. No problem. Take it.

00:43:07.825 --> 00:43:09.305
So these are the colorful "flowers."

00:43:09.385 --> 00:43:10.425
LANTERN SHOP

00:43:11.065 --> 00:43:13.825
Look. These lotus lanterns
do look like flowers.

00:43:14.545 --> 00:43:15.385
We've found the "flowers."

00:43:15.465 --> 00:43:17.265
That stall was the last place
Lou Chuo passed by.

00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:18.425
Before that, it was this lantern shop.

00:43:19.145 --> 00:43:20.185
Let's keep walking.

00:43:23.345 --> 00:43:25.705
This must be where he thought
people were talking about him.

00:43:26.305 --> 00:43:28.785
Groups of young women chattered,

00:43:29.425 --> 00:43:30.465
all gossiping about me.

00:43:30.545 --> 00:43:31.825
That's so funny.

00:43:31.905 --> 00:43:34.625
The gutter he mentioned should be nearby.

00:43:35.665 --> 00:43:37.265
‪Look at it! How nice.

00:43:52.305 --> 00:43:53.505
It's the smell of face powder.

00:43:54.025 --> 00:43:55.985
Strange. This alley is so narrow,

00:43:56.065 --> 00:43:57.185
and there are no mansions around.

00:43:57.265 --> 00:43:59.025
Who here would use so much powder?

00:43:59.105 --> 00:44:01.065
Unless there's a tavern or brothel nearby.

00:44:07.905 --> 00:44:08.865
We're here?

00:44:10.865 --> 00:44:11.705
Hanguang Lane?

00:44:11.785 --> 00:44:14.505
So Lou Chuo ran into Hanxiao near the spot
where he killed Hu Da?

00:44:18.385 --> 00:44:19.865
According to Hu Da's coachman,

00:44:19.945 --> 00:44:22.785
he was only gone
for less than an hour each time.

00:44:22.865 --> 00:44:25.825
To get back to Linglong Residence in time
without being noticed,

00:44:25.905 --> 00:44:28.225
he could only have come this far.

00:44:28.305 --> 00:44:29.945
This building is within this range.

00:44:30.025 --> 00:44:32.505
But the Inner Guards have already checked.

00:44:32.585 --> 00:44:35.105
All the taverns and residences
claimed they never received Hu Da.

00:44:35.905 --> 00:44:36.945
Let's go take a look.

00:44:44.545 --> 00:44:47.345
{\an8}XIUHONG HOUSE

00:45:06.425 --> 00:45:07.265
ZHENNIANG

00:45:07.345 --> 00:45:09.985
Madam, sir, what brings you here?

00:45:10.585 --> 00:45:13.185
Do you sell silk or embroidery here?

00:45:13.265 --> 00:45:14.505
Embroidery.

00:45:14.585 --> 00:45:16.745
But you don't come
to this ward often, do you?

00:45:17.945 --> 00:45:20.465
- How can you tell?
- We only do business with merchants,

00:45:20.545 --> 00:45:21.985
never private customers.

00:45:25.145 --> 00:45:27.225
No wonder you can afford
such fine benzoin resin incense.

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.345
We owe it all to our loyal clients.

00:45:30.545 --> 00:45:32.985
Supplying embroidery to merchants
must require a lot of embroiderers, right?

00:45:33.945 --> 00:45:35.905
- Seven or eight.
- That's not so many.

00:45:35.985 --> 00:45:38.625
A truly skilled embroiderer
can do the work

00:45:38.705 --> 00:45:39.745
of ten ordinary ones.

00:45:41.145 --> 00:45:42.185
How was Hanxiao?

00:45:44.785 --> 00:45:45.785
Who is that?

00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:48.225
You don't know her?

00:45:48.305 --> 00:45:49.345
Never heard of her.

00:45:49.425 --> 00:45:51.465
There was a murder
in Hanguang Lane a few days ago.

00:45:51.545 --> 00:45:52.785
Did you hear?

00:45:53.505 --> 00:45:55.785
Sir, stop. You're scaring me.

00:45:56.385 --> 00:45:58.025
- You knew the victim?
- No, I didn't.

00:46:00.545 --> 00:46:03.225
I've never seen
such a grand embroidery house.

00:46:03.305 --> 00:46:05.185
Would you mind showing us around?

00:46:05.785 --> 00:46:08.065
Though we're open for business,

00:46:08.145 --> 00:46:09.785
this is still a private residence.

00:46:09.865 --> 00:46:10.905
We only welcome regulars.

00:46:11.745 --> 00:46:12.985
We've been here for a while.

00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:14.465
Why haven't we seen a single embroiderer?

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:16.945
They just finished
a big job a few days ago.

00:46:17.025 --> 00:46:17.905
They're all resting.

00:46:18.545 --> 00:46:19.585
Do all your embroiderers live here?

00:46:20.545 --> 00:46:21.385
Yes.

00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:25.705
It's awfully quiet.

00:46:27.425 --> 00:46:30.025
They're all young ladies.
They're out enjoying themselves.

00:46:33.625 --> 00:46:34.585
Please, stay here.

00:46:35.305 --> 00:46:36.905
What are you doing?
You startled the guests!

00:46:36.985 --> 00:46:37.985
It's nothing!

00:46:39.145 --> 00:46:40.665
It was probably just a rat.
