00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:10.778
=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 12=

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.121
I extracted cerebrospinal fluid
and vitreous humor from the body,

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.841
and measured the potassium ion content.

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:26.160
The time of death was one week ago.

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:30.481
I also found a low diatom content
in the victim's internal organs,

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:34.841
because her blood circulation stopped
before she entered the water.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.800
So diatoms in the water couldn't
enter her organs via the bloodstream.

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:41.720
This precisely supports
the passive respiration hypothesis.

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:43.960
She was dumped
into the water after death.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.641
This case is a homicide.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.761
Autopsy showed cranial bone deformity.

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.201
Defensive-type wounds
are visible on her hands.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.520
There are skin cell residues
under her fingernails.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.561
DNA testing identified
it belongs to a male.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.281
But his identity remains unknown.

00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:58.528
What about the victim's identity?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.001
The victim isn't listed in the city's
missing persons database.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.160
Uploaded to the provincial base.

00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:07.201
But there's no feedback yet.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.320
Also, the victim was found
with little clothing.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040
The fabric was cheap.

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.096
(Autopsy Report)
Didn't find many valuable clues.

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:21.160
But I found much mineral oil residue
on the victim's face.

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:25.160
Mineral oil is a primary ingredient
in low-quality cosmetics.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.200
I suspect she used cheap cosmetics.

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:34.640
After a week submerged, the body
shows signs of postmortem bloating.

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.801
Her skin surface also has
heavy mineral oil residue.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.961
This suggests she habitually
wore heavy makeup.

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:45.160
The boat was found.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.081
My dad tipped me off.

00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:48.121
I'll forward it
to the maritime unit right now.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.760
Your dad?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.961
Little Qian didn't tell you?

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.561
I mentioned this to him earlier.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.001
Why didn't you report finding a body?

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:03.932
(Hu Yong, Sand Dredger Owner)
(Illegal sand dredger spotted)

00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:07.435
(The crew revealed they found
a female body one week prior)

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.880
Aren't sand dredging operations
banned now?

00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:12.600
And we were afraid of trouble.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.561
Afraid of trouble?

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.160
So you just dumped the body
back in the river?

00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:17.961
Do you think this is minor?

00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.840
Didn't sacrifice a chicken,
and this happened.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.081
Enough excuses.

00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:26.241
Where did you find the body?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.241
About two or three kilometers
east of Sishui Second Bridge.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.720
Encountering a river floater
like that is bad luck.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.320
Plus, the sand-suction pipe
seemed damaged.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.920
So we didn't dare continue

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920
and just went back.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.361
Any luck? Find anything over there?

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.600
Long, there's something.

00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:07.121
Let me see.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.840
(Huo's crew controls the third largest
supply chain for new drugs on border.)

00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:51.361
This woman is Huo's mistress.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.080
These two groups trust each other.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.200
Right now, it's just a matter of time.

00:05:58.361 --> 00:05:59.921
What's the sudden lunch about?

00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:02.041
I wanted to see you.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.152
Our operation this time aims

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.361
to take down both Huo's
and Bao Hei's drug gangs.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.320
This is your mission.

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.120

(To our beautiful reunion.)

00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:08.721
(Come on.)

00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:12.640
(The old Chen Yumo is gone.)

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.121
(His body can't handle any alcohol.)

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.081
(It could even be life-threatening.)

00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:19.040
(Let's add each other.)

00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:20.121
(Keep in touch.)

00:09:20.241 --> 00:09:21.361
(I'm warning you now.)

00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:22.361

- (Ye Qian.)

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.201
(break your promise,)

00:09:23.361 --> 00:09:26.321
- (I'll never talk to you again.)
- (Then I'll keep painting for you,)

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.961
(until I can't hold a brush.)

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.760
(What are you doing?)

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.056
(Now, I'm running)

00:09:33.464 --> 00:09:34.488
(a small business.)

00:09:34.488 --> 00:09:36.344
(How lucky must one be)

00:09:37.112 --> 00:09:38.400
(to always stand in the light.)

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.760
(Come on, let's grab a drink.)

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.520
(Why ask me to dinner so suddenly?)

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.520
(I wanted to see you.)

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:44.961
(Another day.)

00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:46.001
(Ye Qian,)

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.121
(when will you finish the picture
you promised me?)

00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:07.760
Ye Qian.

00:10:12.201 --> 00:10:13.001
Ye Qian.

00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:21.441
Ye Qian.

00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:27.961
Ye Qian, I know you're back.

00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:32.241
Open the door!

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:35.961
Are you in trouble?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.321
Long,

00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:32.760
the DNA on the socks matches the victim.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.481
Look at what these characters
on the sock say.

00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:38.640
I'm going blind. I can't take it.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.400
Let me see.

00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:44.400
This is...

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.441
Flower.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.680
Flower, right?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.961
The character for "flower".

00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:50.201
I also think it is "flower".

00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:51.841
The back...

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.160
I can't make out the back.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.880
Alright, "flower" is good enough.

00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.201
The fiber quality
of these socks is terrible.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.520
Given how worn it is, it's lucky for us
to identify the "flower" character.

00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:05.920
This type of sock is so thin.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.081
No one would want them
in stores or supermarkets.

00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:08.880
I just asked my mom.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.560
She said these socks
aren't meant for the retail market.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.121
They're specifically for places like
saunas, massage parlors, and foot baths.

00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:19.361
They buy these socks in bulk wholesale
for their customers.

00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:21.441
Some brands even partner with factories

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:23.241
to print their own logo on the socks.

00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:26.001
So if we follow this "flower" lead,
we might find the source.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.800
Your mom still does wholesale?

00:12:30.721 --> 00:12:32.680
Stop talking nonsense.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.800
The Changchun Road shop closed long ago.

00:12:36.081 --> 00:12:37.081
I need to take this call.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.640
Little Zhao.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.361
You're crying?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:00.920
Boss.

00:13:02.001 --> 00:13:02.880
It's been tested.

00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:05.272
'Meat', the drug,
was mixed into the wine.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.800
The purity isn't super high,

00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:08.241
but for a first time,

00:13:08.481 --> 00:13:09.640
the kick is pretty strong.

00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:14.640
This woman

00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:17.001
is interesting.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.880
After the body falls into water,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.601
water enters the lungs and stomach.

00:14:47.121 --> 00:14:48.280
Its density increases,

00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:51.321
causing the body to sink slowly.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.841
After decomposition causes bloating,
it slowly rises again.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.601
This creates
what boatmen call a river floater.

00:15:00.121 --> 00:15:02.441
According to the sand dredger
owner's statement,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.081
they were sand mining at night

00:15:06.601 --> 00:15:08.680
when the sand-suction pipe
suddenly malfunctioned,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.880
and soon after,
they discovered the body.

00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:14.280
You know, sand-suction pipes
go deep into the riverbed.

00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:17.160
If the body had already surfaced,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.241
the pipe couldn't have reached it.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.201
That means

00:15:21.481 --> 00:15:23.081
when the sand dredger was working,

00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:25.601
the victim had just been dumped
in the water.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.640
So, based on where the sand dredger
was moored that night,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.680
the dump site must be nearby.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.841
This is already the upper reaches
of the Sishui River.

00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:39.481
It's so remote, hardly any households.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:40.721
Not a tourist area either.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.441
I noticed something on the way here.

00:15:43.841 --> 00:15:45.121
The nearest surveillance camera

00:15:45.121 --> 00:15:47.560
is the last traffic light we passed.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.601
This riverbank area is quite large.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.601
Searching it all will take until dark.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.680
I'll contact the local police station.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.160
Get that footage Lei mentioned.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.721
I'll head down first.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.201
Master.

00:16:18.721 --> 00:16:21.001
Judging by the track width,
it should be an SUV.

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.280
See?

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.304
The tire marks

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.961
run from east to west

00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:31.361
at a varying speed.

00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:33.841
And, see?

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.520
Right there.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.121
In front of that small tree,
it made a U-turn,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.400
and then accelerated
up this small slope.

00:16:44.001 --> 00:16:45.880
The suspect drove to the riverbank

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.121
to choose a dump site,

00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:49.361
hence the varying speed.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.680
After dumping the body,
the suspect left quickly.

00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:57.961
Assuming these tire marks
are from the suspect,

00:16:58.241 --> 00:16:59.241
it should be about right.

00:17:01.841 --> 00:17:03.880
Seems the driver was nervous.

00:17:04.721 --> 00:17:06.681
There are lots of skid
and slide marks on site.

00:17:07.641 --> 00:17:09.441
Plenty of hard braking traces too.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.080
If he weren't a complete novice...

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.201
He had a corpse in the car.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.800
Guilty conscience.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.360
I told you to get checked
at the hospital yesterday.

00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:29.120
Why haven't you gone yet?

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.161
I'm fine.

00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:33.001
Don't push yourself.

00:17:34.201 --> 00:17:35.201
Health comes first.

00:17:43.241 --> 00:17:46.681
This ground and environment
make footprints nearly impossible.

00:17:47.641 --> 00:17:48.681
My guess is, the suspect

00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:50.401
left right after getting
rid of the body.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.241
Long.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.881
Come here.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.800
What is it?

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.881
Come smell this. Notice anything?

00:18:10.001 --> 00:18:10.721
Urine?

00:18:12.641 --> 00:18:13.961
Might not from human, though.

00:18:14.241 --> 00:18:15.401
Could be from an animal.

00:18:16.481 --> 00:18:18.280
Ants are particularly fond of sweets.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.401
So they're highly sensitive to sugar.

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.280
Animals in nature
can develop diabetes too.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.641
But the probability is low.

00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:28.201
If that's the case,

00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:32.441
this was likely left
by someone with diabetes.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.481
But it has been a while,

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:35.840
can we still collect DNA?

00:18:38.241 --> 00:18:39.721
We'll collect more samples.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.721
Even if we can't extract DNA,

00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:43.201
at least it gives us another lead.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.641
Where were you last night?

00:19:12.088 --> 00:19:13.681
Nothing, personal matters.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.216
Went on a date
with your unrequited love?

00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:18.360
You dared take time off?

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.201
If your master finds out,
you'll be in trouble.

00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:23.120
What stage are you two at now?

00:19:24.161 --> 00:19:25.401
Mind your own business.

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:29.961
Little Zhao called me yesterday.

00:19:30.881 --> 00:19:32.760
She didn't sound very happy.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.201
Does she know about this too?

00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:39.320
I told her to stay away from me.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.360
You should too.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.241
Jing.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.280
Bring your puppy out
for a walk sometime.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.681
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:20:10.681 --> 00:20:11.681
Ms. Li, you go ahead.

00:20:11.681 --> 00:20:13.441
Alright, we'll head over first.

00:20:13.641 --> 00:20:14.241
Let's go.

00:20:14.241 --> 00:20:15.641
Let's go. Okay, hurry up.

00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:17.080
Let's go, Beibei.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.881
Go play in the park.

00:20:17.881 --> 00:20:19.881
That puppy is barking anxiously.

00:20:19.881 --> 00:20:21.280
Okay, no more barking.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.600
I'll walk you right now.

00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:25.600
Why did you kick my dog?

00:20:25.961 --> 00:20:26.721
Don't you leave!

00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:28.360
How can you lie like that?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.481
I saw you kick my dog.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600
Are you blind?

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.401
You must be blind.

00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:33.481
I'm busy with deliveries.
No time to kick your dog.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.560
Let go now.

00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:36.721
Wait. I'm about to be late.

00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:37.800
- Let go.
- What's wrong, Ms. Li?

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.001
Being late doesn't mean
you can kick someone's dog.

00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:40.961
- What's wrong, Ms. Li?
- Who kicked your dog?

00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:41.961
You clearly did!

00:20:41.961 --> 00:20:43.241
- Just apologize.
- Did everyone see that?

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:44.320
What's going on?

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.320
What happened, Ms. Li?

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.360
He kicked my dog. Look.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.320
I didn't kick your dog.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.040
This delivery guy.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.441
My delivery is about to be late.

00:20:50.441 --> 00:20:52.001
She's holding me back.

00:21:45.681 --> 00:21:46.520
Hello?

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.001
Not going to pay the debt, huh?

00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:50.161
You can run, but you can't hide.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.320
You're paying back
every penny your brother owes.

00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:55.600
Don't consider escape.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.320
We can grab you anytime, understand?

00:22:00.376 --> 00:22:04.440
(Huadu Club)

00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:16.961
Look familiar?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.921
A bit.

00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:22.360
But I can't remember where.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.520
- Ms. Pang.
- Give me the office key.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.961
Okay, I'll leave my contact.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.840
Contact us if you remember anything.

00:22:27.961 --> 00:22:28.520
Okay.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.481
Man?

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.040
You know her?

00:22:39.481 --> 00:22:41.161
Through our visit to Huadu Club,

00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:43.280
we created a facial composite
of the victim

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.161
and verified the victim's true identity.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.800
The identity of the Sishui River
floater victim has been confirmed.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.040
The victim is Zhan Qiuman.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.001
Female, 20 years old, from Min City.

00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:53.881
She came to Yunxi City two years ago,

00:22:53.881 --> 00:22:56.401
and worked in service
at Huadu Club since then.

00:22:56.401 --> 00:22:59.120
Her identity was confirmed
by the supervisor Pang Xianglan.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.560
Pang Xianglan brought Zhan Qiuman here
from their hometown.

00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:06.320
Male DNA was also detected
in urine found at the riverbank.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.881
It matches DNA from skin cells
under the victim's nails.

00:23:09.961 --> 00:23:11.721
This individual has severe diabetes.

00:23:11.721 --> 00:23:13.360
No further information at this time.

00:23:14.241 --> 00:23:16.560
Zhan Qiuman had three bank accounts,

00:23:16.881 --> 00:23:19.120
holding 420,000 yuan total.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.520
Not a single yuan withdrawn
since the crime.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840
You're Pang Xianglan?

00:23:44.312 --> 00:23:45.280
We're from the police.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.401
Hello, I am.

00:23:47.921 --> 00:23:48.520
Hello.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.600
Have a seat.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.800
We're here today

00:24:02.201 --> 00:24:03.040
for Zhan Qiu...

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.520
It's about Man, right?

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.921
I can't believe someone so young

00:24:09.641 --> 00:24:10.961
could just be gone like that.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.961
When was the last time
you saw Zhan Qiuman?

00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:19.560
About ten or so days ago.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:20.961
I don't remember.

00:24:21.241 --> 00:24:22.681
Wasn't she brought out by you?

00:24:22.681 --> 00:24:23.840
And she works for you.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.280
Doesn't it strike you as odd
not to see her for so long?

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.161
Officer,

00:24:29.881 --> 00:24:31.961
I have 40 or 50 girls working under me.

00:24:32.401 --> 00:24:34.201
Even if I'm closer to some,

00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:36.201
it's not like I see them every day.

00:24:37.001 --> 00:24:38.840
Besides, that's just how Man is.

00:24:39.001 --> 00:24:40.840
She comes and goes as she pleases.

00:24:41.016 --> 00:24:43.641
If she doesn't want to talk to you,
she won't even bother calling.

00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:45.040
I'm used to it by now.

00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:48.001
Then tell me about her.

00:24:50.921 --> 00:24:52.961
Man's parents are both in poor health.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.600
She has a younger brother
still in school.

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.080
The whole family relies
on her mom's subsistence allowance,

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.760
barely making ends meet.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.800
She actually had good grades before,

00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:04.881
but to pay for her parents'
medical bills,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.080
and more importantly,
her brother's tuition,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.961
and save up for building a house
and his future marriage,

00:25:12.401 --> 00:25:16.201
she worked in an electronics factory
right after junior high.

00:25:16.961 --> 00:25:18.961
Later, she found her way to me,

00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:21.800
saying she wanted
to earn more money working for me.

00:25:22.201 --> 00:25:24.201
Considering she's a fellow villager

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.001
and her family's situation,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.320
I thought I should
lend a hand where I could.

00:25:28.481 --> 00:25:30.080
Lend a hand where you could?

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.401
Aren't you just
pushing her into the fire?

00:25:35.681 --> 00:25:36.961
It's not just Man.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.161
All the girls under me

00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:41.241
are carrying their entire family
on their shoulders.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.641
If they weren't truly desperate,

00:25:45.641 --> 00:25:50.441
who would willingly do those jobs
looked down on by everyone?

00:25:51.481 --> 00:25:52.481
Man's young,

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.760
pretty, and knows how to handle herself.

00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:56.881
Quite a few customers like her.

00:25:57.961 --> 00:25:59.201
But rest assured, officer,

00:25:59.201 --> 00:26:03.881
Huadu has absolutely none
of those messy, illegal operations.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.280
Do you know where Zhan Qiuman lived?

00:26:07.481 --> 00:26:10.201
I rented a few large apartments
nearby as dorms.

00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:11.840
Man had a bed in the dorm,

00:26:12.161 --> 00:26:14.001
but other girls sharing the room said

00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:16.921
she didn't stay overnight
most of the time.

00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:22.481
Seems like she rented a place

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:23.760
over in Baiyuan South Village.

00:26:24.721 --> 00:26:25.881
Did she have a boyfriend?

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.161
I don't know.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.080
What about customers close to her?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.241
Not clear.

00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:36.681
Not clear, huh?

00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:41.040
Do you think Zhan Qiuman might have...

00:26:42.776 --> 00:26:43.736
Started selling herself?

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.441
That I definitely don't know.

00:26:46.721 --> 00:26:48.681
But Yunxi is an energy city.

00:26:49.161 --> 00:26:51.161
There are more wealthy bosses
than you can count.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.241
They're generous too.

00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:55.401
If any of the girls develop
real feelings for a customer

00:26:55.401 --> 00:26:57.080
and want a long-term relationship,

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.401
it's not impossible.

00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:01.721
I can guarantee they follow
the rules inside the club.

00:27:02.201 --> 00:27:03.840
But outside working hours?

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.520
They are all adults.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.040
I neither want to nor can control that.

00:27:12.568 --> 00:27:16.152
(Sishui North Road)

00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:42.441
Lei, how's it going over here?

00:27:42.441 --> 00:27:43.401
Any progress?

00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:50.040
This is from the surveillance camera
closest to the crime scene.

00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:52.241
Four SUVs matching the criteria

00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:54.961
passed through this intersection
that night.

00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:57.881
Only this one came back. Look.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.520
I told you there was something fishy.

00:28:01.161 --> 00:28:02.721
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:28:02.721 --> 00:28:04.080
I'll contact the Traffic Police

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.560
to rule out those three vehicles
with plates.

00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:09.600
If it really
is this vehicle, unlicensed,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.881
with black and white footage,

00:28:10.881 --> 00:28:12.001
then it'll be tough.

00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:19.360
Hello?

00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:23.800
What? Don't panic.
Talk slowly. What happened?

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.280
Don't be afraid.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.161
Go straight to the hospital now.

00:28:34.641 --> 00:28:35.721
Don't panic.

00:28:35.721 --> 00:28:36.881
Be careful on the way.

00:28:39.921 --> 00:28:40.881
Everything alright, Lei?

00:28:42.641 --> 00:28:43.800
My puppy

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.481
might have eaten rat poison.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.800
T-Then send it to the hospital fast.

00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:48.961
Should be fine.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.161
Yeah, should be nothing serious.

00:29:18.881 --> 00:29:20.040
(Yingbin Apartment)
Given the income in her line of work,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.560
I feel Zhan Qiuman shouldn't
have been living so shabbily.

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:25.320
This place she lived in,
and the furniture inside.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.481
What junk.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.201
See that suitcase by the bed?

00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:29.520
Two of the wheels are broken,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.040
and the handle's all taped up.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.441
How's life been treating her?

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.961
All her cosmetics are cheap too.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.961
Apart from a few work uniforms,

00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:38.641
her clothes are mostly
street vendor stuff.

00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:40.641
Pang Xianglan said

00:29:41.161 --> 00:29:42.721
Zhan Qiuman had heavy family burden.

00:29:42.721 --> 00:29:44.120
She was also frugal herself.

00:29:44.401 --> 00:29:46.800
So she sent most of her income
back home on time.

00:29:47.241 --> 00:29:50.584
We found no money, no passbooks,
no bank cards on site.

00:29:50.584 --> 00:29:52.344
No sign of the cell phone or ID either.

00:29:52.681 --> 00:29:54.800
Check the victim's
financial flow immediately.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.441
If there's anything unusual,
pull the footage right away.

00:29:58.441 --> 00:29:59.040
Okay.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:29:59.961
Master.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.241
That Pang Xianglan...

00:30:02.241 --> 00:30:02.921
Dig deeper.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.241
Where's it?

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.520
Buried in the yard.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.560
You go home and rest first.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.560
I took the day off today.

00:30:41.881 --> 00:30:43.040
I'll watch over the place.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:43.961
No need.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.280
Aren't we saving up our days for Hainan?

00:30:46.641 --> 00:30:47.840
Those days are hard-earned.

00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:50.040
You should go back. It's fine.

00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:55.320
Really?

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.481
It's okay, really.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:30:59.800
Don't worry.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.201
Jing.

00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:05.360
Make two more dishes.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.401
Coming!

00:31:06.921 --> 00:31:07.840
It's fine. You go.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.840
Coming.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.001
What do you want?

00:31:14.161 --> 00:31:15.760
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:16.681
Okay.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.161
Captain Leng.

00:31:26.721 --> 00:31:30.681
Any findings on the fingerprints
in the victim's room?

00:31:31.401 --> 00:31:33.080
The fingerprints at the scene are messy.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.401
Still screening them.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.681
No valuable leads found so far.

00:31:39.192 --> 00:31:43.040
(Retrieving Fingerprints)

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.320
This Range Rover has no plate.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.001
Its color and model are also
the most common ones for that brand.

00:31:47.921 --> 00:31:49.641
It was in a collision before.

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:50.721
There's a dent in the rear.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.481
Exactly.

00:31:57.681 --> 00:32:00.800
The paint has
a high reflectivity to light.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.040
This nighttime video
is in black and white.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.721
This vehicle comes over here.

00:32:07.721 --> 00:32:09.784
(Sishui North Road)

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.320
So in the black and white photo,

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.320
it appears as a fluorescent white.

00:32:18.921 --> 00:32:21.961
This photo captures the rear of the car.

00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:25.401
Look. This part of the rear
has no reflection.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.921
It appears black.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.760
This indicates this area is concave.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.641
Doesn't catch light.

00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:35.120
Judging by the proportion,

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.760
this surface isn't small.

00:32:38.241 --> 00:32:38.921
Captain Leng,

00:32:39.001 --> 00:32:41.001
if the suspect's main motive is money,

00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:43.800
then the guy must have known
the victim's financial situation well.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.161
Based on what we know so far,

00:32:45.161 --> 00:32:48.201
Pang Xianglan is the one
who knew Zhan Qiuman best.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.641
Pang Xianglan's financial flow
shows no issues for now.

00:32:54.001 --> 00:32:56.881
Have all those staff at the club

00:32:56.881 --> 00:32:57.800
been vetted?

00:32:58.241 --> 00:32:58.921
Yes.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.800
It's roughly like
what Pang Xianglan said.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.760
The victim preferred
to act alone while alive.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.280
She moved out a long time ago.

00:33:04.721 --> 00:33:08.241
Have those people she had
private relationships with been checked?

00:33:08.241 --> 00:33:10.040
We're screening
their communication records.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.040
Captain Leng, there's another lead.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.241
The apartment in Baiyuan South Village
wasn't rented by Zhan Qiuman.

00:33:16.241 --> 00:33:18.161
A company signed the contract
with the agent.

00:33:18.161 --> 00:33:20.800
It's Huitongda Import
and Export Trading Co., Ltd.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.280
Finished?

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.681
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:33:37.681 --> 00:33:38.280
Thank you.

00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:41.681
So this is collecting DNA?

00:33:42.481 --> 00:33:43.961
Seen it plenty in movies and TV.

00:33:44.201 --> 00:33:46.001
It's my first time
experiencing it firsthand.

00:33:54.881 --> 00:33:55.961
You came to me

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.800
and asked for my DNA.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.721
Is it for Man?

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.961
What was your relationship
with Zhan Qiuman?

00:34:12.961 --> 00:34:14.200
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.801
You rented Room 305, Building 3,
Baiyuan South Village for her, right?

00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:21.441
Yes.

00:34:23.401 --> 00:34:25.321
Then why use the company name?

00:34:26.441 --> 00:34:28.761
Afraid your family would find out?

00:34:30.841 --> 00:34:34.321
My wife and son
have been abroad for years.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.441
There's nothing to be afraid now.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.761
As for renting under the company name,

00:34:39.841 --> 00:34:40.961
it offsets costs.

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.281
Legitimate tax avoidance.

00:34:44.441 --> 00:34:47.281
Let's talk about Zhan Qiuman.

00:34:51.761 --> 00:34:53.040
Man was a good girl.

00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:55.881
Not greedy, honest too.

00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:01.200
She wasn't into the jewelry
or designer bags like most

00:35:01.361 --> 00:35:02.120
young girls.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.160
I gave her money for rent.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.040
I was planning to get her a nicer place.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.761
She said a basic one would do.

00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:11.481
She saved whatever was left over.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.441
She even pinched

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.921
the pocket money I gave her.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.560
Her only focus
was supporting her parents

00:35:18.961 --> 00:35:19.881
and brother.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.441
She was quite smart.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.281
I'd thought about sending her
to school in a few years.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.520
She can't rely on youth forever.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.001
What a shame.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.761
Where were you when it happened?

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.441
A week ago.

00:35:44.961 --> 00:35:47.881
I was abroad on business
for almost a month.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.481
I just got back three days ago.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.240
How did you meet Man?

00:35:54.481 --> 00:35:57.441
I first saw her a few times at Huadu.

00:35:57.921 --> 00:35:59.120
Lan approached me first,

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.240
saying this girl
was going through hard times.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.921
She asked if I could help her.

00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:05.321
Pang Xianglan?

00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:08.761
She introduced Man to you?

00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:11.281
Later, I gave her a big red packet

00:36:11.921 --> 00:36:12.881
to show my gratitude.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.001
- Goodbye, Lan.
- Goodbye, Lan.

00:36:25.784 --> 00:36:31.096
(Huadu Club)

00:36:34.264 --> 00:36:35.281
- Goodbye, Lan.
- Thanks.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.441
Officer, you wanted to see me?

00:36:51.281 --> 00:36:52.961
Need to ask you a couple of things.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.001
Turn off the engine.

00:37:06.401 --> 00:37:07.881
Know Wang Meng from Huitongda?

00:37:09.761 --> 00:37:10.841
Mr. Wang?

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.321
I know him.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.120
But last time,
you insisted you didn't know

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.001
who Zhan Qiuman was close with.

00:37:19.001 --> 00:37:20.560
But what we heard

00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:23.720
is that you actively introduced her
to other clients.

00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:26.520
This kind of solicitation
is illegal, you know?

00:37:26.921 --> 00:37:28.401
Officer, don't scare me.

00:37:28.481 --> 00:37:30.801
I was just matchmaking.

00:37:31.361 --> 00:37:34.040
Matchmaking isn't a crime.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:36.881
Matchmaking?

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.080
Then why did you lie last time?

00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:46.321
I thought I should
show some respect for the dead.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.321
It was Man's private business,
after all.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.321
Besides,

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.560
Mr. Wang's a regular.
I couldn't offend him.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.680
Where were you that day?

00:37:57.321 --> 00:38:00.200
You suspect me?

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:02.600
Answer the question.

00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:05.961
Working at Huadu.

00:38:06.921 --> 00:38:08.441
Got there at 6 PM.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.321
Stayed until next morning.

00:38:10.841 --> 00:38:13.281
Around this time, actually.

00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:29.240
(DNA Test Report)

00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:36.801
Wang Meng's DNA doesn't match

00:38:36.801 --> 00:38:39.720
what was under the victim's nails
nor at the dump site.

00:38:42.961 --> 00:38:48.001
His travel records have proved
he had no time to commit the crime.

00:38:48.921 --> 00:38:53.761
His finances and family situation
all checked out.

00:38:54.361 --> 00:38:57.560
Motive-wise, he's likely cleared.

00:39:04.281 --> 00:39:04.881
Hello?

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.881
Yeah.

00:39:28.321 --> 00:39:29.080
Captain Leng.

00:39:30.321 --> 00:39:33.881
Ms. Chen, I rushed back
as soon as you called.

00:39:34.321 --> 00:39:35.240
It's okay. Don't worry.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.680
Your dad's fine.

00:39:36.761 --> 00:39:38.361
The delivery guy's alright too.

00:39:38.361 --> 00:39:40.080
Just scraped his skin a bit.

00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:42.441
But his deliveries are backed up now.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.520
Tell me how much he wants.
I'll cover it.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.640
Where is he?

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.761
Could you bring him over?

00:39:47.761 --> 00:39:49.120
I want to apologize properly.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.321
You handle compensation privately.

00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:52.881
I gave him your number.

00:39:52.881 --> 00:39:53.481
Okay.

00:39:53.481 --> 00:39:55.200
Right now, Zhang from the council

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.520
is taking him to the clinic
for ointment.

00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:00.961
I wanted your dad checked too.

00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:04.881
Please understand
about my dad's condition.

00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:07.841
This isn't about understanding.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.281
Even if he's confused, he couldn't just
accuse someone of spying on him.

00:40:11.281 --> 00:40:11.921
Right.

00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:13.240
As he spoke, he turned violent.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.680
Scared that young man half to death.

00:40:15.841 --> 00:40:17.080
At his age,

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.481
if something happened,

00:40:18.481 --> 00:40:20.080
he'd be blamed unfairly.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.281
Yes.

00:40:21.841 --> 00:40:23.080
I know you're busy.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.401
We all understand.

00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:24.841
Yes.

00:40:24.841 --> 00:40:27.080
But elderly care can't be neglected.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:27.680
Yes.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.600
With his condition,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.001
he really shouldn't be left alone.

00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:31.481
Yes.

00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:32.600
A caretaker helps,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.801
but family support is irreplaceable.

00:40:34.801 --> 00:40:35.120
Yes.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:35.680
Right?

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.441
Yes.

00:40:36.441 --> 00:40:37.481
That's settled then.

00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:37.921
Okay.

00:40:37.921 --> 00:40:38.720
I'll head out now.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.321
Thank you.

00:40:39.321 --> 00:40:40.001
It's okay.

00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:40.921
Mr. Wang.

00:40:40.921 --> 00:40:41.361
Leaving.

00:40:41.761 --> 00:40:42.321
Ms. Li.

00:40:42.401 --> 00:40:43.120
Okay.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.680
Ma'am.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.600
Take care.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.200
Take care.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:47.881
Leng,

00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:49.881
what a mess this is.

00:40:50.321 --> 00:40:52.120
I just stepped out to take out the trash

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.600
and chat with an acquaintance
for a moment.

00:40:54.801 --> 00:40:55.481
Then it...

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.361
But your dad's condition
has really worsened lately.

00:41:00.361 --> 00:41:00.921
Yes.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.361
He's getting confused.

00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:04.080
That's right.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.361
Don't you think you should take him
to the hospital when you have a chance?

00:41:08.361 --> 00:41:08.961
Okay.

00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:10.560
Well,

00:41:11.961 --> 00:41:15.200
when he has an episode,
he just acts without thinking.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.321
Honestly, today was terrifying.

00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:17.881
Yes.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.680
I'm not young anymore, you know.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.801
If something really happened,

00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:26.200
I couldn't bear
the responsibility, Leng.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.361
I understand, Ms. Wang.

00:41:27.361 --> 00:41:31.200
You see, our contract is almost up.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:31.761
Look.

00:41:31.761 --> 00:41:36.321
How about this? Ms. Wang,
could you do me one more favor?

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.600
I'll find a way
as soon as possible, okay?

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.200
Appreciate it.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.720
Whose car's in the middle of the road?

00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:42.520
Move it!

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.401
Okay, got it!

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:44.801
Sorry about it.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.160
It's fine.

00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:04.001
Hello?

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.281
Jiao.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.481
Jing mentioned she saw you heading back.

00:42:10.481 --> 00:42:11.560
Is your dad okay?

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:12.841
He's fine.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.600
I told her to drop by and check on him.

00:42:14.841 --> 00:42:15.841
He is alright now.

00:42:15.841 --> 00:42:18.080
Don't make Jing run around again.

00:42:18.881 --> 00:42:20.080
I'm driving. Talk later.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.720
Right, one more thing.

00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:23.481
Go ahead.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.281
We found that car.
