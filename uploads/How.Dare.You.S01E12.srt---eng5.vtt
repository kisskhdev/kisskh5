00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.950
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.979
[Episode 12]

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.720
I was waiting for the wrong person.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.220
But she came at the right time.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.620
If she hadn't come,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.810
I would've been dead long ago.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.890
Am I too stupid,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.340
or did you not make yourself clear?

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.770
You're too stupid.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.800
You like her, don't you?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.710
Calling it "like" would be too limiting.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.170
So you don't like her then?

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.070
If you don't like her,
that makes things easier.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.430
Since the Master won't let her stay
by your side,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.030
and you won't let me kill her,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.240
I'll just take her away. Problem solved.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.710
She won't go with you.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.400
Don't be so sure.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.910
With my charming good looks
and dashing style,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
no beauty could possibly resist me.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620
Just wait and see.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.080
Can I have this?

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.140
This one is already withered.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.310
Its leaves

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.060
still show some signs of life.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.560
Just as you said—

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.560
if someone makes an effort for it...

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.530
who's to say
it can't find the will to survive?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.460
Imperial Physician, please hurry.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.630
Her Highness has been coughing all night
and couldn't sleep.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.090
Coming.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.690
Your Highness,
the imperial physician is here.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.520
This subject...

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.800
This subject pays his respects to
Your Highness.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800
That rainy night,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.910
I failed to recognize Your Highness.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.190
I deserve to die for this offense.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.590
Please punish me
as Your Highness sees fit.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.090
If you keep kneeling there,

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.829
I'll never get better.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.920
I'm at fault.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.860
I shall take your pulse at once.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.600
Imperial Physician, please sit.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.200
Thank you.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.110
Your Highness.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.290
How's my condition?

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.000
Your Highness's pulse is stable.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Nothing serious.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.600
It's likely from
getting caught in the rain that day,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.720
which allowed external pathogens
to invade your lungs

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.270
and disrupt your defensive qi.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.750
I'll prepare some medicine

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.530
and have it delivered daily
for Your Highness to take.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.659
You should recover in a couple of days.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.530
Thank you.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.620
May I ask

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.730
your name, Imperial Physician?

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.830
My name is Xiao Tiancai.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.830
Tiny Genius?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.310
Yes.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.440
Your name

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.820
is quite unique.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.440
It's the first time anyone has said so.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.800
Thank you for the compliment,
Your Highness.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.240
Your Highness.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.070
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.560
You...

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.820
What...

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:41.510
Don't move!

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.730
Bai?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.800
What kind of move was that?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.240
Women's self-defense technique.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.159
Awesome.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.830
That's the only move I know.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.300
You all should practice hard.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.750
Your martial arts aren't even
as good as your mistress's.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.240
Weren't you with His Majesty?

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.280
Why are you here?

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.090
I originally

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.870
meant to spar with Master Bei,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.860
but I couldn't find him anywhere.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.840
So I had to

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.370
practice my martial arts
with them instead.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.450
Mr. Bei?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.120
He's in the backyard,

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.420
by the stone table.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.220
Isn't there only an old maid
by the stone table?

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.780
Mr. Bei.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.800
Wanyin.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.770
Come on, come on.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.500
Look at the embroidery I made—
mandarin ducks playing on the water.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:25.260
How is it?

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.930
You're "Mr. Bei"?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.680
Why are you dressed like this?

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.190
So you have

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.620
some secret hobbies, huh?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.120
Why are you here?

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.670
And this embroidery of yours.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.540
You call those mandarin ducks
playing on the water?

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.040
That's clearly a pair of chickens
flapping around.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.500
Am I right, Your Highness?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.070
Wanyin,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.450
let me teach

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.750
this disrespectful little disciple
a lesson.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.710
-Mr. Bei, I was only joking.
-Go.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.450
Not the face! Not the face!

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.870
Why were you being so sarcastic?

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.330
Just

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.630
trying to make you smile.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.620
Bai.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.360
You've been roaming the world
for so many years.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.940
You must have been to many places, right?

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.890
Of course.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.690
I've seen sunsets over long rivers,
clouds over high mountains,

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.830
thousand-year-old temples,
and beacon towers stretching for miles.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.950
Your Highness, just name a place.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.480
Let's see if there's anywhere
I haven't been.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.640
I envy you so much.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.470
What about you, Your Highness?

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.600
Where have you been?

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.630
I...

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.810
Apart from Zhaoyang Palace,
I've only been to Yongyan Hall

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.210
and the Imperial Garden.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.310
I don't think I've been outside the palace

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.900
since entering it.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.430
That's so boring.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.650
A spirited beauty like you

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.550
shouldn't be confined here.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.340
Why not come with me?

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.690
I'll take you to see mountains and waters,
to chase sunsets.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.770
Right now?

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.980
Your Highness,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.400
the world outside

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.559
is not only beautiful

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.440
but also full of the unknown.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.010
I once encountered wild men

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.510
in the dense forests of the Southwest.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.510
And on a small island in the East Sea,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.070
I came across giant beasts.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.320
Another time, passing through Wuling,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.030
I followed a stream into a cave,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.000
and when I came out,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.470
I found a village hidden

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.020
among flower-covered mountains.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.750
It was full of people

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.610
who had been isolated from the world
for centuries.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.190
"The Peach Blossom Spring"?

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.870
How did you know
those flowers were peach blossoms?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.560
Well...

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.540
Anyway, when the wind blew,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.530
petals fell everywhere

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.940
like pink snow.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.630
I'll never forget

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.300
that sight for the rest of my life.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.540
If I ever get the chance,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.340
I'd really love to see it myself.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.610
Wuling is far away,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.850
but I can show it to you right now.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.860
I will do my utmost

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.930
to stop the war and establish trade.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.730
I won't return

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.190
until I succeed.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.940
We are counting on you, Mr. Wang.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.300
[Camel Bell]

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.960
My Lady!

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.270
Just now, an unfamiliar young eunuch

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.320
shoved this into my hands.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.610
When I called out to him, he ran away,

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.410
and I couldn't catch up with him.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.720
A kindred spirit is hard to find—
why hesitate?

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.100
Let's meet at the flower house today.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.010
You may leave first.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.940
Yes.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.640
Prince Duan, you were in such a hurry
to see me.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.300
-What's...
-Wanyin, have you

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.700
seen anything lately?

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.590
Seen?

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.270
Didn't you tell me before

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.100
that you could use foresight
to predict the future?

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.040
Yes.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.010
I have...

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.360
indeed seen some things lately.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.270
Like what?

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.370
Like,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.850
in the dense forests of the Southwest,

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.180
footprints of wild men have appeared.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.430
And

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.670
on a small island in East Lake,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.400
there seem to be giants
swimming in the inner lake.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.670
Following the stream
toward the mountains in Wuling,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.780
I saw light ahead.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.850
Beyond the mountain are hillsides
covered with peach trees.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.000
I've heard

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.130
that the martial arts master
by the Emperor's side has appeared again—

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.290
and this time, inside the palace.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.780
He has discovered Bei Zhou?

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.920
It's very dangerous
if we don't eliminate this guy.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.510
Can you help me foresee

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.180
how we can get rid of him?

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:07.420
Is this information reliable?

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.770
How did Your Highness learn of it?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.040
I saw it in my dream

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.090
using my foresight as well.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.020
You just said you "heard" about it.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.960
You bastard—

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.470
lying without even
preparing your story properly.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.270
Is that Imperial Physician Xiao
competent or not?

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.130
When others are sick,
the physicians tell them to stay in bed,

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.860
yet he encourages you to go out.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.210
The sunshine is perfect.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.270
Some moderate sun exposure

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.870
is beneficial for recovery.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.580
Still, there's no need to come all the way
to the flower house.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.550
I dropped an earring when I was sheltering
from the rain the other day.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.880
It might be somewhere in the flower house.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.010
Let's go look for it.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.540
My Lady,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.310
isn't that Prince Duan and...

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.670
Why are they together?

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.190
Wanyin.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.340
Are you willing to help me?

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.580
Prince Duan, please wait a moment.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.640
Let me give it a try.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.810
Now both Bei Zhou and Bai are
in the palace,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.520
yet he only knows of one master,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.210
not two.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.410
I saw...

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.820
what seemed to be a tall man

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.040
appearing in a corridor.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.000
A corridor?

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.740
Which...

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.390
corridor?

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.130
It seemed to be in the Imperial Garden,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.190
but I can't be sure.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.270
It was too rushed to see clearly.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.100
Have you consulted Consort Xie about it?

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.520
I came to you first.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.240
If you can't foresee it within three days,

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.300
it won't be too late for me
to ask her then.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.390
Who leaked the information?

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.120
Could it be...

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.820
Just now, an unfamiliar young eunuch

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.020
shoved this into my hands.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.200
When I called out to him, he ran away,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.000
and I couldn't catch up with him.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.850
My Lady.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.820
This isn't the way back to the palace.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.150
I saw you walking this way
with your head down,

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.750
so I didn't dare disturb you.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.510
My Lady,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.270
this is flower tea I prepared myself

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.030
to clear internal heat and detoxify.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.360
Would you like to try it?

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.030
No need.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.070
My Lady, you've been looking worried

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.470
ever since you returned.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.430
Is something troubling you?

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.920
I just saw Prince Duan,

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.100
who apparently offended His Majesty

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.190
and was about to be caned.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.190
I overheard His Majesty
instructing the secret guards...

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.470
to be especially brutal
during the punishment.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.830
I wonder if Prince Duan

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.080
will survive this.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.240
How could this happen?

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.590
Should I go ask around?

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:22.650
Are you insane?

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.620
If His Majesty catches you at this time,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.680
how am I supposed to explain it to him?

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.020
I didn't think it through, My Lady.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
You may leave now.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.590
Let go of me!

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.390
Let go of me!

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:49.540
Kneel!

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.310
Your Highness is most perceptive.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.400
This maid snuck out

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.240
to pass information to a eunuch

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.240
bribed by Prince Duan.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.590
We apprehended her on the spot.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.570
You're lying!

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:00.640
My Lady.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.850
When did you start
consorting with Prince Duan?

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.320
I didn't!

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.510
How could I ever dare harbor such thoughts
toward His Highness?

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.510
Still denying it?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.750
My Lady,

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.510
I was worried
you were concerned about His Highness,

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.310
so I went out to find a way to help.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.440
My Lady,

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.260
how can you not trust me?

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.130
It's because I trusted you too much

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.010
that I gave you the chance to betray me.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.150
I've never betrayed you,

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.550
and my loyalty has never wavered.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.510
Tell the truth!

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.800
It was the Lantern Festival—

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.990
the Lantern Festival
before you entered the palace.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.900
I was by your side then,

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.270
when you first met His Highness.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.580
I watched the two of you
fall for each other.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.940
You were so happy back then.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.330
After entering the palace with you,

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.420
he occasionally came to chat with me.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.530
That's all.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.070
So you've been passing information
about me

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.400
to him all along?

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.730
I just don't understand...

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.270
why you didn't choose His Highness

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.000
but chose that tyrant instead.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.650
You used to despise the tyrant.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.100
You cried every day and couldn't eat.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.630
But ever since you suddenly started
attending the tyrant at night,

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.030
everything has changed.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.020
I understand even less

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.330
why you've clearly fallen for the tyrant

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.780
yet still string Prince Duan along,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.390
letting him waste away for you
day after day,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.860
while you only care about
enjoying yourself with the tyrant.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.950
So the day I left the palace in disguise—

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.670
it was also you who told Prince Duan?

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.690
It was me.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.440
But that day, Master Yu had just been
framed by Consort Shu's family,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.410
and then His Majesty immediately took you
out of the palace.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.320
I was worried about your safety.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.950
It just so happened
that His Highness sent someone to ask,

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.640
so I told them

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.560
which gate you left from.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.200
Your Highness,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200
shall we kill her?

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.130
My Lady...

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.220
My Lady!

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.110
I entered your household at age five

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.420
to serve you.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.740
We ate and slept together,
and I cared about everything about you.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.700
You must believe I would never harm you.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.820
Everything I did was for your sake,

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.880
My Lady.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.960
Take her back and lock her up.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.290
Without my permission,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.240
don't let her out.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.070
My Lady!

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.240
My Lady...

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.620
The tyrant demoted Master Yu
and neglected you!

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.440
My Lady, you need to come to your senses!

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.110
I've just returned to the palace

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.710
and heard about what happened with Mei.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.680
Are you alright?

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.710
I've been thinking for a long time

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.980
and just remembered.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.590
In the novel, the original female lead
lost her mother at a young age

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.320
and grew up without affection.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.890
When she was eight,

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.480
she caught highly contagious measles.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.130
Everyone in the household
kept their distance.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.700
They locked me in a cold,
damp side chamber

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.310
and just left me there.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.080
Only Mei voluntarily stayed with me

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.940
and took care of me.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.190
Wanyin.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.830
You didn't go through any of that.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.120
Don't think about it anymore.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.820
But I've been here for so long,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.520
and she's been really good to me.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.350
Listen to me,

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.910
you inexplicably entered this book,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.120
into a completely unfamiliar world.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.400
Not only did you have to adapt quickly,

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.010
but you also had to constantly think about

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.610
how to deal with Prince Duan,

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.260
handle the Empress Dowager,

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.010
and struggle to survive.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.500
You've already been doing very well.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.510
Better than I have, at least.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.140
Without you,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.520
I might not have made it this far.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.080
I completely understand why you're upset

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.050
about Mei.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.250
But don't ever

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.840
doubt yourself.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.430
Don't blame yourself.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.050
Alright?

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.130
Have I really done well enough?

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.120
But I'm so tired.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.920
Let me lean on you for a while.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.000
Just a moment,
and I'll be fully recharged.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.240
Mei can't stay in the palace anymore.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.520
I'll find a chance to send her away.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.040
What time is it now?

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.330
Just past 9 AM.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.570
How did I sleep for so long?

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.610
What about Mei?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:46.930
Has she been fed?

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.850
Yes, she has.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.160
Your Highness,

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.960
would you like to go check on Mei?

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.140
She kept saying this morning

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.310
that she wanted to see you again.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.790
She also left a letter for you.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.300
[To My Lady, personally]

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.810
[My Lady,
I know you're still angry with me.]

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.670
[Although you are my mistress,
all these years,]

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:18.420
[I've long regarded you as family—]

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:19.600
[the only person I care about
in this world.]

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.620
Your Highness,

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.480
I was ordered to
escort Mei out of the palace,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.080
but she...

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.090
is gone.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.010
My Lady,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.340
I know you're still angry with me.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.080
Please let me call you "My Lady"
one last time.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.570
From now on in this palace,

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.280
everyone will only address you as
"Your Highness,"

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.340
-and no one will call you "My Lady".
-My Lady, you're up.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.730
Although you are my mistress,

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.840
all these years,

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.179
I've long regarded you as family—

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.690
the only person I care about
in this world.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.030
This morning, His Majesty ordered me
to leave the palace.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.760
My Lady!

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.690
But without you,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.150
I'm nothing but

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.590
-a wandering soul with nowhere to go.
-My Lady!

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.360
Life has no meaning for me anymore.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:08.850
Before I die,

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.770
let this servant do one last thing for you

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.670
to repay your kindness.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.940
Whether I succeed or fail,

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.690
I can only be your maid again

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.590
in the next life.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.110
Yu Wanyin,

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.070
you actually let that maid of yours,

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.330
-M...
-The Empress Dowager has arrived!

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.130
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.960
Consort Shu,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.110
are you hurt?

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.100
Your Majesty, you must stand up for me.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.150
I was just strolling here

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.150
when that girl called...

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.920
Mei,

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.080
yes, Mei,

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.190
suddenly rushed out

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.030
with scissors, trying to stab me,

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.540
shouting something about

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.950
how I ordered my brother

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.540
to harm Noble Consort Yu's father.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:21.950
And just now, Juan

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.190
stepped in to protect me

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.990
and got this huge cut on her hand.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:30.690
How dare you, Noble Consort Yu.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.820
Do you have any idea
what kind of disaster you've caused?

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.590
Noble Consort Yu has become arrogant
from His Majesty's favor

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.250
and now disregards all rules.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.060
She shall be demoted from

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.280
Noble Consort to Concubine!

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:40.880
Guards,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.030
take her to the Cold Palace.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.280
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.010
Await the Emperor's judgment.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.540
Mei!

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.370
Zhang San's Diary.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.460
Your Highness, please hurry.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.050
Let go of me!

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.590
Let go of me!

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.750
Hold Her Majesty down firmly!

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.750
Don't let Her Majesty hurt herself!

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:17.630
Tie her tight!

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.130
Let go of me!

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.500
It hurts!

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.610
Let go of me!

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.730
The water is too cold! Change it!

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.610
Let go of me!

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:25.980
It hurts...

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:26.580
Hurry, hurry!

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.240
-Hold here!
-It's killing me!

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.990
Don't just stand there. Come help!

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.220
-Let go of me!
-Hold her down! Hold her down!

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.480
-Noble Consort.
-Hurry, hurry!

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.500
Crown Prince,

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:43.300
don't be afraid.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:46.060
Hold her down!

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.390
Mother,

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.360
Mother, are you alright?

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.690
When I came to pay my respects yesterday,

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:04.290
weren't you perfectly fine?

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.530
How did

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.100
your head condition suddenly flare up,

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.420
making you fall ill?

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:10.970
Could it be...

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.290
Could it be

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.580
that you consumed something

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.590
you shouldn't have?

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.330
It was you...

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:21.650
It was you.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.250
-It was you...
-Mother,

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.690
it was clearly your own carelessness.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.290
How can you blame me?

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.560
Mother,

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.230
do you still remember

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.400
saying

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.090
the exact same thing to me

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.730
back then

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.130
when I had my miscarriage?

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.980
You wicked...

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.770
wicked...

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:48.500
wicked...

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.730
Rest assured, Mother.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.790
If anything happens to you,

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.520
I'll help you

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.130
protect this empire.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.060
Rest assured, Mother.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.640
With me here,

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.020
you'll be fine.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.080
Rest well and recover.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.190
Crown Prince,

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.480
come here quickly.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.590
Your grandmother is calling you.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.810
[Memorial Tablet
of Empress Dowager Li Zhen]

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.380
Dan,

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.940
from now on,

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.900
I'm your mother.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.720
You must be

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.100
obedient.
