(Pillar of Righteousness)

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.340
You wouldn't leave me

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.220
just to lure me to find
Yin Dai's handbook, right?

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.950
What exactly is in the handbook?

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:52.750
I just want to help you
uncover the truth.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.940
Why don't you trust me?

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.305
I'll report to Master immediately.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.850
I'm looking for the handbook

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.170
to avenge my father.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.020
What does your revenge

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.820
have to do with Yin Dai's handbook?

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.890
It's said that the handbook

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.820
records the Disintegration,
a secret skill

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.380
passed down through generations

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.220
of Qingque lords.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.610
Disintegration?

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.220
Rumor has it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.260
that Nie Hengcheng

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.010
died from this technique.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.010
If I can master it,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.980
I'll surely avenge my father.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.410
You fabricated a name

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.890
and tried to deceive me.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.170
You've mostly recovered.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.290
Move out tomorrow.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.260
Disintegration

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.980
was created by Founder Beichen.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.540
It can instantly boost power

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.940
and make one invincible.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.410
Though formidable,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.690
it'll backfire on the user.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.780
(Young Cai Pingchun)

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.980
Meridians will collapse.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.850
(Young Ning Xiaofeng)

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.996
Martial skills will be lost.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.820
Ultimately,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.660
the user will be dead.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.850
Zhao, have you thought

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.370
why your aunt would practice this?

00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:31.033
If nothing were suspicious,

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.946
why is Yin Dai's handbook missing

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.580
in the secret room?

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.330
Zhao.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.980
Zhao?

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.700
Zhao,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.410
do you think I'm very bad?

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.700
My effort has been in vain.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.770
Xiaolan,

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.020
martial arts is like this.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.980
At first, progress is slow.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.700
You must be patient.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.060
Later,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.170
your power will grow steadily.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.580
I'll go to Herb Hut later

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.540
to find some herbs
to strengthen your foundation.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.660
Thanks, Zhao.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.930
Though I can't be famous in Jianghu

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.980
at a young age and slay

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.630
the Chief of the demon sect alone

00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.410
like Ms. Cai,

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.700
I'll take her as a role model

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.890
and never slack.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.140
But she paid a heavy price.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.330
The medicine for you.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.380
Thanks, Uncle Lei.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.890
Uncle Lei,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.250
have you heard
of the Disintegration?

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.210
Who told you?

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.540
Will the user face

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.370
meridians collapse

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.350
and lose martial skills?

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.930
This fatal move

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.460
is forbidden.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.100
Thus, successive Qingque lords

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.850
never taught it to outsiders.

00:06:09.026 --> 00:06:09.980
Then why did Yin Dai...

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.820
Everyone is gone.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.780
Why chase

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.180
old grudges?

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:19.100
This is a calming pouch for Chang Ning.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.010
Take it back for him.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.420
Yes.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.290
Where did you go last night?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.660
Did you go to the Library?

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.700
What's wrong?

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.540
I'm here for Chang.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.930
I asked Xingjia to verify.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.650
This calming powder

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.900
was developed by Uncle Lei for Chang.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.140
I don't know
how it ended up in the Library.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.370
I didn't get to deliver

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.810
the powder for Ning.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.810
Last night, in the Library,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.283
I accidentally spilled it.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.450
Zhao, last night,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.340
why go to the Library?

00:07:19.386 --> 00:07:20.940
To check recipes for a late-night snack.

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:22.466
But I didn't find the right one.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.770
What?

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.616
Something lost in the Library?

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.770
No.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.220
Just a plaque

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.660
fell inexplicably.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.130
In that case,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.210
I'll take my leave.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.490
Yuzhi, goodbye.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.610
I'll move out now.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.086
Find the handbook first.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.173
Yin Dai had only two daughters.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.980
Song Yuzhi's mother,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.370
Lady Qinglian, already passed.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.660
So, his relics should be
with Lady Sulian.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.593
I searched the sect thoroughly

00:08:00.386 --> 00:08:02.370
and thought it'd be
in the Library's secret room.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.180
Since it's not there,

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.580
it must be in Double Lotus Palace.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.100
Unfortunately, I found nothing
in Treasure Vault.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.370
In such a short time,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.780
you've found out so much.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.740
(Dusk Palace)

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.900
(Library)

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.780
Have you searched elsewhere?

00:08:25.893 --> 00:08:27.006
Have you tried the waterway?

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.210
Waterway?

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.810
They have many guards.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.820
If I recklessly dive in,

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.700
I might alert them.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.780
Mid-Autumn is coming.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.820
There should be

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:47.940
a celebration.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.850
I have an idea.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.890
Go find Lingbo and have another quarrel.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.220
Lighting lanterns for Mid-Autumn

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.130
is a century-old tradition here.

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:00.519
With so many people this year,

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.130
my mother prepared over 100 lanterns.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.530
It must be lively.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.130
It's just a way

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.250
to honor your grandfather

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.820
and sing praises of your family.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.663
My grandfather was a hero.

00:09:12.674 --> 00:09:13.580
What's wrong with that?

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.010
Should we honor your family instead?

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.700
Chang Ning, I warn you.

00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:18.445
This is a major event of the Six Sects.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.530
Don't write Chang

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.730
on the lanterns.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.700
Why not?

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.200
Father may not belong to the Six Sects,

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.010
but he is a hero.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.850
Ridiculous.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.820
Which hero hides sneakily

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.340
and sets traps?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.140
I heard

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.650
the turf in Chang Fort was dug up.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.370
What shameful thing

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.890
could you be hiding?

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.180
Ning,

00:09:43.303 --> 00:09:44.249
time to go to Herb Hut.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.850
I'll handle the lanterns.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.330
Just put them here.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.730
A little higher.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.820
Xingjia.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.580
What are you worried about?

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.490
Buying for the celebration

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.700
and the Patriarch's ceremony

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.770
cost a lot.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.940
Money

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.530
just flows away,

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.610
faster than water.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.820
Managing this is hard.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.940
But Double Lotus Palace

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.850
looks splendid.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.653
You don't seem short on money.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.820
Stop thinking.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.390
That is the Yins' private property,

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.530
not Qingque Sect's.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.010
Hu paper is light and strong,

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.610
the best choice for lanterns,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.980
but expensive.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.460
Lady Yin insists on 100 lanterns.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.770
Another large expense.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.250
Why not use Xuan paper?

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.770
Xuan paper costs similar to Hu paper.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.770
That was before.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.130
Because Xuan paper was made
from mulberry bark.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.460
Now, I heard

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.650
everyone uses Qingtan for Xuan paper,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.890
so it's much cheaper than Hu paper.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.820
That's perfect.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.370
I'll go to buy more Xuan paper.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.100

(Generation to Generation)

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.010
What's that?

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:56.490
It's the Guming Moth.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.970
Be careful.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.850

(Long Life)

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.980
This moth feeds on Qingtan,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.850
living in cool, secluded places.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.850
Why appear suddenly?

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:09.780
Oh, no.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.890
The lantern's paper contains Qingtan.

Ning!

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.700
Chang Ning was bitten?

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.060
Chang Ning, are you mad?

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.650
Those insulting my family

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.850
shall die!

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.530
Lingbo, run!

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.150
Chang's medicine contains Qingtan.

00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:12.490
He must've gone mad from the bite.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.180
Run!

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:28.570
Bad news!

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.490
Uncle Lei!

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.360
Bad news!

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.370
Chang Ning,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.650
bitten by the Guming Moth, went mad.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.730
He's shouting to kill Lingbo.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.250
Uncle Lei,

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.570
should we intervene?

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.220
Everything has a cause.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.940
Don't you understand why Chang Ning

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:47.650
acts against Lingbo?

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.130
A little suffering for Lingbo

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.600
is not necessarily bad.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.940
But Chang Ning has lost his mind.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.180
Will Lingbo be safe?

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.890
Will Chang be severely punished?

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.180
Bites from the Guming Moth can cause

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.893
hallucinations and madness,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.220
but poison fades quickly.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.220
It won't cause major trouble.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.250
Out of respect for Lord Yin,

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.820
Master never punishes Lingbo properly

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.850
for her mistakes.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.490
Similarly,

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.530
for the late Mr. Chang,

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.420
even if Chang Ning caused a mess,

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.180
Lord Qi won't severely punish

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.580
the orphan of the Chang family.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:35.970
Uncle Lei,

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.340
the blessing charms are copied.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.530
I'll leave first.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.530
Since you've understood,

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.220
why still go?

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:52.730
Lady Yin is still there.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:57.730
Stop him!

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.060
Stop him now!

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.450
Chang Ning!

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:50.570
Enough!

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.330
Zhao!

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.220
Have you had enough madness?

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.820
Come back with me.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.460
What do you want?

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.980
Help!

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.920
Help!

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.410
Help!

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:15.810
Help!

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.460
Yuzhi!

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.140
Someone wants to kill me!

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.540
It's him!

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.570
- Ning.
- It's him!

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.140
He tried to kill me!

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.170
Lady Yin,

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.860
Ning's been missing his family,

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.146
so he's lost his mind.

00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:37.033
I'll take him back to recover.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.420
He'll apologize later.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.410
Recovery comes first.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.460
They just left like that?

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.780
Where is Master?

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.660
(No Regrets)

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.140
(No Regrets)

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.130
Xiaolan,

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:23.610
thank you this time.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.460
Zhao, you're welcome.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.770
I didn't do much.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.103
There was no one by the lakeside.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.700
How did you fall into the water?

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.130
I know

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.050
you wanted to help us.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:37.870
I...

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.620
I don't know what happened.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.770
I just felt that Nanny Mao was fierce;

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.240
I didn't want her to trouble you.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.260
Zhao,

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.620
Mr. Chang is still injured.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.860
Take him back now.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.890
I'll go first.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.860
Siqi Sect is useless,

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.940
but Yang Heying has a good daughter.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.660
Sorry

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.740
about that.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.380
Were you worried

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.220
that I'd kill Qi Lingbo?

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.170
Would you?

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.530
So many martial arts secrets.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.050
Including Peiqiong Manor's swordsmanship

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.490
and our mindful ways.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.330
Isn't he already the Lord?

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.620
Why collect martial secrets
from all sects?

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.380
Naturally, to unify Jianghu

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:49.700
for generations.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.166
The fire is almost out.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.260
I'll get it.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.610
Let me.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.860
Control movement.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.050
Let the soul guard the body.

00:22:41.235 --> 00:22:42.749
Change between fullness and emptiness.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.420
Try to reverse.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.810
This is the Disintegration.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.700
It can stimulate all meridians

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.180
and boost power tenfold.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.460
Truly extraordinary.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.810
As you said,

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.010
Chang Ning

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.730
is crazy.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.460
He even attacked Cai Zhao.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.123
With Zhao's skill,

00:23:06.341 --> 00:23:08.103
how could she fall
into the water so easily?

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:18.610
Lady Yin,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.853
is the item hidden in the water

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.530
the one I brought as a child?

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.370
Exactly.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.250
It's your grandfather's handbook,

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.530
recording the supreme martial arts

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.420
and martial arts secrets that he spent

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.476
half his life collecting.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.730
But he was the former lord.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.940
Shouldn't his handbook
be handed to Master?

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.570
Your grandfather's belongings

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.290
stay with the Yin descendants.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.330
Your mother and I preserved them

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.740
for you.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.220
But it's gotten this far.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.093
We can no longer hide it from Master.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:53.940
During the battle,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:56.620
the Six Sects suffered heavy casualties.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.940
I'm old and injured,

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.250
powerless to oppose the enemy.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.050
Seeing the demons run rampant,

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:05.660
killing even more,

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.380
Pingshu of Luoying Valley

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.530
volunteered to slay Nie.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.810
I had no choice but to teach her
our forbidden secret:

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.090
Disintegration.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.740
(Young Cai Zhao, Luoying Valley)

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.180
(Disintegration)

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.940
If you wish to learn martial arts,

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.980
I'll spare no effort to teach you.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.380
(Righteous Spirit)
Why go to such lengths?

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.700
Master,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.090
did you know my aunt practiced

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.140
the Disintegration?

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.820
If I had known,

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.180
I would've risked
everything to stop her.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.860
I only discovered it
while treating her injuries,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.090
but it was too late.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.700
The Disintegration

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.050
is a secret of Qingque lords.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.490
My aunt is not your direct disciple,

00:26:07.501 --> 00:26:08.900
so how could it be for her to learn?

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.530
I asked Lord Yin about this.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.660
He said he was severely injured,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.853
and his disciples were
either dead or invalid,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.490
unable to resist the demons.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.660
Pingshu volunteered

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.220
for the greater good.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.069
He had no choice but to...

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.220
What?

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.250
To sacrifice my aunt
for the greater good?

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.380
I also

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.490
resented Master for this,

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:38.420
but soon after,

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.730
he was killed by the demon sect.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:43.370
Zhao,

00:26:43.956 --> 00:26:45.256
the previous generation's affairs

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.860
are for the previous generation
to bear and resolve.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:49.660
You need not interfere.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.940
No one is allowed

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.730
to practice this sinister move again.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.139
The Founder's death anniversary
is near.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.620
Master already exerts much effort.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.090
Stop causing trouble.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.940
The deceased are gone.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.140
Master will handle the rest.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.860
You must let go.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.460
Let go?

00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.462
Isn't this the consistent approach
of the Six Sects?

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.530
Is that how you see the Six Sects?

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.620
Isn't he right?

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.650
An unavoidable choice

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.770
shouldn't cost others' lives.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.770
You're noble and upright,

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.980
act with integrity,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.730
yet can let go easily.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.220
I really admire that.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.400
I don't intend to argue.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.420
If you ever need me

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.380
for difficulties,

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:40.900
I won't refuse.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.370
Yuzhi,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.180
Chang Ning ruined the lantern festival

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.072
and injured Fengchi,

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:49.250
yet Father didn't punish him.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.420
Does that mean it's over?

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.740
Originally,

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.073
he should've been punished,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.380
but Yuzhi felt Ning had no choice,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.290
so he pleaded for him.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.860
Then Master calmed down.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.840
Is that right,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.700
Yuzhi?

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.490
He had no choice

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.730
but bully me?

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.700
Yuzhi just values reason more.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.330
I'm grateful,

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.330
so I prepared sweet lotus congee.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.420
My cooking is exceptional.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.050
Yuzhi, why not come back

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:20.900
with us to try it?

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.220
Let's go.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.770
What are you doing, Cai Zhao?

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.250
It's one thing to be involved
with Chang Ning.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.250
Why drag my cousin?

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.220
I'll take you back first.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:39.980
Yuzhi.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.900
Yuzhi.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.420
Yuzhi,

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.570
why always protect Cai Zhao?

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.200
She's only been here a few days.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.810
We grew up together for over ten years.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.860
Today's matter has nothing
to do with Zhao.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.050
Don't trouble her again.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.900
We owe Zhao anyway.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.420
Owe her what?

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.460
You keep calling her Zhao.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.570
How intimate.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.330
She also has congee for you.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.090
Yuzhi,

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.490
do you like her?

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.330
Nonsense.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.660
Lingbo, you're no child.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.140
You must mind limits.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.530
Cai Zhao just held your hand.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.620
Did she mind her limits?

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.330
Knowing about our betrothal,

00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:26.240
she openly provoked me.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.140
How shameless.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:27.980
I'll say it again.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:29.530
Cai Zhao is Master's disciple,

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.940
our junior sister.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.330
If you continue slandering
and causing trouble,

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.730
forget our relationship.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.180
Yuzhi!

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.730
(Control movement.)

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:49.900
(Let the soul guard the body.)

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.800
(Change between fullness and emptiness.)

00:29:51.811 --> 00:29:52.620
(Try to reverse.)

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.740
Stop it.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:56.880
Why?

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.980
You know how dangerous

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.290
this move is.

00:30:00.763 --> 00:30:02.250
Those who practice it die in the end.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.110
It's not worth it.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.660
My life is for revenge.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.220
If revenge costs my life, so be it.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.010
When Ms. Cai went to meet Nie Hengcheng,

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:11.900
she knew she'd die.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.980
Those who practice the Disintegration

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.330
will have their meridians destroyed

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.140
and organs collapse.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.620
Do you know that pain?

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.860
She had suffered for 13 years.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.050
She was only 30,

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:44.860
younger than Yin Sulian,

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.530
and had wasted away.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:53.570
Nie Hengcheng is dead;

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.620
Yin Dai is dead.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.620
I don't know who to hate now.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.490
No matter who you are,

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:05.810
no matter your purpose,

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.980
you are forbidden to practice it.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.820
As I said,

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.420
I'll protect you.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.290
I'll never let you

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.380
die like my aunt.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.020
Promise me.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.410
Okay.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:27.650
Swear.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.490
I swear

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.770
never to practice the Disintegration.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:01.650
Chang Ning.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:08.980
I'm hungry.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.010
I want some wonton.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.490
Your disciple stole
my father's handbook.

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.090
It's been destroyed.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.860
Let this matter end here.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.180
You destroyed
my father's relics at will.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.900
What do you take me for?

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.660
Keeping it would have been a hazard.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.090
Do you want

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.660
the world to know

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.380
what your father did?

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.076
The martial arts knowledge inside

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.570
is all his life's work,

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.860
yet you've destroyed it?

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.010
What's the point of keeping it?

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.570
Lingbo is not suited for martial arts.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:53.570
We both know that.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:54.660
We have Yuzhi.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.860
He'll inherit the sect eventually.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.380
Once they marry,

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.220
we'll be family.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.620
We could've given it to him.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.050
If Lingbo continues to be so headstrong,

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.770
I fear Yuzhi

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.330
might not want to fulfill the betrothal.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:09.940
He will,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.780
and he won't dare,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.020
unless

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.460
he doesn't want to be the future lord.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.330
You made it?

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.180
Homemade cooking.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.220
I wonder

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.660
if you'll like it.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.010
It's just a bowl of wonton.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.980
No need to be so touched.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:24.820
This flavor

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.170
is exactly like my aunt's.

00:34:34.766 --> 00:34:36.266
I've thought about it for three years.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.300
Ning,

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.620
thank you.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:10.490
Is there more?

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:11.860
If you like it,

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.610
I'll make more

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.010
when Han wakes up.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.050
Wonderful.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.620
By the way,

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:20.740
you swore yesterday.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:21.940
No backing out.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.370
Got it.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.980
Your cooking is so good.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.300
Why not open a diner

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.660
in Luoying Valley?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:29.889
I'll be the shopkeeper;

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.820
you handle the kitchen.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.260
We'll have the place

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:33.530
at the street's end,

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.900
so when people stroll from head to tail

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.930
and get hungry,

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.686
they'll come for a bowl of wonton,

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.900
leaving a lasting taste.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.100
Perfect.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:43.370
Chang Ning.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.050
Why are you two here?

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.980
About the Mid-Autumn incident,

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:52.530
Master said not to pursue it further.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.210
That night, my skills were inferior.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.406
I have nothing more to say.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.610
But now, it's not about that.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:58.890
Chang,

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.010
Master orders you to go
to Dusk Palace now.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.010
While searching for clues,

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.300
I unexpectedly learned

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.860
the Changs had an old steward
surnamed Jiang.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:16.980
Five years ago,

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.650
the steward retired to his hometown

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.090
and took a boy with him.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:22.690
After much investigation,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.860
at Steward Jiang's grave,

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.050
I found Mr. Jiang,

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.210
who resembles the late Mr. Chang,

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.300
or rather,

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.610
the real Chang Ning.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:54.820
