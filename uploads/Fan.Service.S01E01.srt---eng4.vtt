WEBVTT

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.210
Let's break up.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.179
What?

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.429
Did I do something wrong?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.759
No...

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.069
It's just...

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.460
I don't feel the same way anymore.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.989
Is there another woman?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.689
It's not a woman.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.464
It's... another man...

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.252
Honey~

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:35.068
You're here?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.979
I'm pregnant with your child.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.860
What?

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:41.009
I can't just let you leave me.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.549
Liar.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.759
Who do you think you're kidding?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.129
I'm sterile.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.750
What?

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.319
Cut!

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.279
Yes, Geonwoo!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.189
Geonwoo, ever since you were a child actor,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.651
I knew you had a gift.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.399
The #1 actor everyone wants to embrace!

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.729
Number one!

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.690
Look at this.

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.512
All these people are here just for you!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.940
I know, right?

00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:22.282
Hey, kid, our ratings are
through the roof! Through the roof!

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:26.052
Geonwoo, you're a
jackpot! A total gold mine!

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:27.954
Look at him, so full of himself.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.669
Well, he's like a god to them...

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.059
The moment he shows up,
ratings for a dying show jump 10%.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.129
Is that why he's acting so high and mighty?

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.026
He's stealing the spotlight from the lead.

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:41.789
What can you do...

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.004
That's just the life of a nameless actor.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.769
Jackpot! Jackpot! Jackpot!

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.400
Let's get ready for the next scene.

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:48.667
Okay.

00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:50.668
Alright, alright!

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.317
Ready—and action!

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.239
There's no way a celebrity would
agree to an interview with me...

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.909
You'll just have to charge in.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.837
What am I, a bull? Dammit.

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:13.189
Given how aggressive you
usually are, it's a fair question.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.659
Want me to headbutt you first?

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.989
I'd just dodge it with style.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.440
Oh, how impressive.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.009
What about that guy?

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.480
(Box office star Kim
Geonwoo, new film premiere...)

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.635
(Box office star Kim Geonwoo, new film
premiere...) Does that even make sense?

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:30.719
Even if I sold everything I owned,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.099
I couldn't afford a second of his time.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.040
What should I do?

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.121
Want some help?

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.275
Should I pull some strings?

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:37.900
Stay out of it.

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:40.589
I'm already stressed enough as it is.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.179
I should've become a celebrity too.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.569
Then I could watch you beg me for a favor.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.219
This life is already a bust.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.070
Better luck in the next one.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.906
This isn't easy.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.852
Hello?

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.136
What? My car?

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.783
I only parked there for a second
because there were no spots.

00:03:16.757 --> 00:03:18.899
Fine, I got it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.999
What's wrong?

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.989
I think the car got towed.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.611
Wait, what?

00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:33.979
I'm so sorry.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.130
I guess we'll have to call a cab.

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.809
You know I can't get
in a car with a stranger.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.590
Right... I know.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.079
Whatever, the dorm isn't that far anyway.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.394
You're going to walk back?

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.541
Yeah.

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:51.997
What, am I supposed to just stand
here until you get the car back?

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.001
No, that won't work.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.865
Hey.

00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:06.078
Take them off.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.626
Huh?

00:04:07.627 --> 00:04:09.150
Do you want me to do it for you?

00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:11.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.086
Hey, hey!

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.965
You haven't changed
a bit since we were kids.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.679
Neither have you.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.370
Really?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.910
Yeah.

00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:30.409
Even your height is the same.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.330
You little...

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.819
Hmm?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.149
You have an older brother?

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.669
You didn't know?

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.219
I feel like I've never even seen him.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.307
I guess that makes sense...

00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:49.829
He's been busy since he was a kid.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.749
I barely saw him myself.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.059
Is it awkward between you two?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.820
Not really.

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.549
I just don't really like him.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.166
Why not?

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:00.949
It's just...

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.936
What do you mean?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.906
I guess it's jealousy.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.319
Growing up,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.699
I never once got a "Happy
Birthday" from them.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.880
They only cared about
him. I was always invisible.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.549
The day we first met,

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.758
you saved me when I was being
teased for my shabby clothes.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:27.959
No wonder... you weren't
even from a poor family,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.249
but you always looked like a mess.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.099
Back then, you were like a hero to me.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.239
You were literally glowing.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.603
And now?

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.472
Well... now you're just
glowing with insanity.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.249
I told you to stay out of my business.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.329
Hey, you!

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.940
I'm leaving.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.510
What a pain...

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.279
What do you think you're doing?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.400
"Fan Service"
(Episode 1)

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.379
There was a nightmare incident
during your time as a child actor, right?

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.749
Ah, yes.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.769
You're talking about when I was kidnapped.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.507
You must have been terrified.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.336
It's not a pleasant memory.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.689
I was eight years old at the time.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.442
I was playing the
younger version of Kangho.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.066
There was a scene where I
was in a car with a secretary.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.736
The route was just supposed to
be a loop around the neighborhood,

00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:41.561
but the driver wasn't actually an actor.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.569
He took off onto the main
road and kidnapped me.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.131
It was only for a short time, but...

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.294
How did you feel in that moment?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.980
Actually, I didn't even
realize I was being kidnapped.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.969
I asked, "Mister, where are we going?"

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.278
But he didn't say a word.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.789
If that person had been violent,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.019
it could have caused permanent trauma.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.656
It's a relief you were rescued so quickly.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.793
Yes, the car was surrounded
almost immediately.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.839
And the man...

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.912
He gave me up without much of a fight.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.529
Since then, you've done
PSAs for children-related crimes,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.289
and donated to children's hospitals.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.769
You've done a lot of good work.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.190
Does the trauma still linger?

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.219
Well...

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.949
I... do have one thing.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.463
I can't ride in a car driven by a stranger.

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:39.699
I see.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.919
Thank you for the interview, Geonwoo.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.148
Thank you.

00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:44.858
Good job, everyone.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.054
Who arranged this bottom-tier interview?

00:08:49.055 --> 00:08:50.270
Well...

00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:53.849
I heard the CEO's relative
inherited the station.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.259
He's so money-hungry, it's
no wonder he's going bald.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.739
Watch what you say...
