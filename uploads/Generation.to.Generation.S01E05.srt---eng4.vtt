00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.770
It's been three days.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.790
You haven't figured it out?

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.780
Yuanfeng.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.760
Did you go to Chang Fort that night?

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.690
Chang Ning, don't do this.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.080
Mr. Chang,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.450
look at Yuanfeng now.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.780
Why push him?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.760
Tell me.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.870
Yuanfeng...

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.690
Yuanfeng...

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.770
Where's Ms. Luo?

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.380
Yes.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.780
Yuanying,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.290
you've been avenged.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.850
You can rest easy.

Ms. Luo went to Chang Fort,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.070
so you recognized her early.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.720
Why didn't you tell me?

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.820
Why did you protect her?

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.260
What do you want?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.413
She wants to expose
Qiu Yuanfeng's true face.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.300
I must help her.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.900
Ms. Luo shouldn't have ended like that.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.180
If I could...

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.660
She used Thunderstorm so close to him.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.860
She was ready

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.580
to die with Qiu Yuanfeng.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:22.179
No one could've stopped her.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.020
We will remember the story

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.980
of Ms. Luo and Mr. Wu.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.340
So will the world.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.660
But what use is that?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.460
In the end, it's all in vain.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.620
Mr. Wu,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.220
my aunt,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.620
and Uncle Chang.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.780
They shed blood for Jianghu.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.380
And the result?

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.446
I never wanted to enter Jianghu,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.620
but as soon as I stepped outside,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.740
it was Jianghu.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.340
Fate is cruel, treating all as equals.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.140
You can choose

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.420
to change your fate

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.460
or do nothing.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.660
You can choose to avenge

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.380
and vent grievances.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.140
This was their choice.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.900
Lei Xiuming,

00:07:03.933 --> 00:07:05.793
I can understand your absence
at the memorial,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.940
but today, you didn't attend Yuanrong

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.140
and Wu's funeral?

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.700
Death is like a snuffed lamp.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.760
What's the point of going?

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.620
Besides, it's a cenotaph.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.940
So what?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.460
Lei Xiuming,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.700
you're still alive.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.380
Have you forgotten the time

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.620
we drank from the same bowl?

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.340
Breeze.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.300
Let's drink Breeze

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.580
and enjoy ourselves.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.540
Enjoy!

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.700
Come on, cheers!

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.060
Come on, drink!

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.910
Come on.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.070
Zhao said Yuanrong

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.020
went to the wine cellar
before the memorial

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.300
to find Breeze.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.460
Good!

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.380
I haven't forgotten.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.940
But my martial arts are ruined.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.900
Other than catching my breath,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.940
what else can I do?

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.260
Among us,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.660
some are dead,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.500
and some are maimed.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.540
Yet who caused all this?

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.300
Was it Nie Hengcheng? Or...

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.260
Now, they are all dead.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.500
Tell me.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.740
Who can I blame?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.780
Who can I hate?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.300
Xiuming,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.700
tomorrow,

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.900
Xiaofeng and I

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.460
will leave Qingque Sect.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.500
Tomorrow,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.500
I'll leave with Lord Cai.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.620
After this,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.460
let's forget each other.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.780
We won't meet again.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.020
We have treasures across the lands.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.340
- You...
- Donate them, please.

00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:34.607
I've loved literature, not martial arts.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.700
This life, being a teacher is enough.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.700
Even with a fortune,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.780
I'm still powerless.

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.939
Perhaps it's a misfortune
rather than a blessing.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.580
An innocent man bears guilt

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.160
because of the jewel he carries.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.980
Fine.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.340
Then, as he hoped,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.380
be an ordinary person.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.860
I heard

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.033
that before Qiu Yuanfeng died,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.740
you asked him.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.340
Was it him?

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.140
The culprit may be someone else.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.180
I'll find him

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.420
and cut him into pieces.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.260
Your parents are gone.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.940
I should've stayed for a few days,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.940
but my wife is ill.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.300
I must return to care for her.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.860
Zhao,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.180
Jianghu erupts again.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.820
With the successive tragedies.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.300
You and Yuqi's marriage

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.340
should be arranged.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.980
Uncle Zhou,

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.260
I still haven't figured everything out.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.340
I know you still think about Ms. Luo,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.740
but years of battle have caused

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.940
countless deaths and injuries.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.580
Many things can't be judged
by normal logic.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.860
However deep you probe,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.500
those who left will not return.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.620
The sooner you marry Yuqi,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.066
the sooner your parents and I

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.420
can rest easy.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.820
If Aunt were here,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.780
would she just stand by?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.340
She wouldn't,

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.380
but she'd hope

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.060
you would.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.300
She arranged your betrothal with Yuqi

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.060
to keep you

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.620
from Jianghu disputes.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.780
Master.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:47.860
Zhao,

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.900
after finishing the memorial,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.020
I came

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.860
to see you

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.700
and Ning.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.100
Where is Zhou?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.140
He just left.

00:11:57.151 --> 00:11:58.433
He always wants to trick you

00:11:58.444 --> 00:12:00.300
into going to Peiqiong Manor.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.620
I really feared

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.420
you might go with him.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.300
Master, rest assured.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.500
Now that I'm here,

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.060
I'll stay for a whole year.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.020
Keep your word.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.620
Ning,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.940
I didn't expect you

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.900
to recognize Thunderstorm at a glance.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.900
Watch out! It's Thunderstorm!

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.380
My father told me.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.700
So did my aunt.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.220
I never expected
a random demon sect weapon

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.060
to be so deadly.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.380
The demon sect is brutal.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.340
You've never experienced it.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.180
I hope

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.780
you never will.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.940
That's also Aunt's wish.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.260
Rest early.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.500
I'll take my leave.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.100
Zhao.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.500
Why are you practicing alone today?

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.060
After the memorial,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.030
everyone was deeply shaken,

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.520
both angry and confused.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.530
They felt unable to focus,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.970
unsure of the path ahead.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.500
So, Yuzhi let them return
to calm themselves.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.580
Then why do you keep practicing?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.580
Martial arts exist to uphold justice.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.820
Whether others act wrongly or not,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.940
upholding justice itself is not wrong.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.460
As long as it is right,

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.940
I won't regret it.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.820
Yes.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.220
Aunt also said this.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.780
There's nothing in life to regret.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.660
If you think it's right,

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.020
do it.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.620
Zhao!

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.900
What do you need?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.580
I just went to do acupuncture for Chang.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.540
Why isn't he there?

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.220
Master already suspects you.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.300
You can't continue to stay.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.580
Let's part here.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.060
Okay.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.606
All have taken poison.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.020
The Demonic Camp.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.700
You didn't kill them?

00:16:05.086 --> 00:16:06.966
An insider killed
the cliff-guarding disciples,

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.380
leading the Demonic Camp here.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.820
Before the swords were drawn,

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.540
they were ambushed and killed,

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.020
completely unprepared.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.380
To kill 8 disciples simultaneously,

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.720
there must be more than one insider.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.420
The sword marks are curved.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.446
Aunt said the 13th move

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.460
of the Taichu Swordsmanship

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.340
requires a lower body,

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.540
an upward thrust,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.140
and hilt rotation

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.340
after piercing into one's body.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.140
Oh, no.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.700
Wu Gang and Wu Xiong of Taichu Temple

00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:41.660
are recuperating here.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.700
And you left?

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.900
Forget it.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.100
Let it be.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.126
These volumes of mindful ways

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.140
were gifts from your brother long ago.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.540
Alas, the times have changed.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.820
Master, be careful!

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.500
Master!

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.860
Master,

00:17:50.453 --> 00:17:51.420
this dagger is poisoned.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.380
I guessed it,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.900
so I sealed the acupoints beforehand.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.426
Later, I'll force out the poison,
and I'll be fine.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.980
Master, this is Wu Xiong.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.100
Where is Wu Gang?

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.460
Wu Gang went to pay respects to Mr. Wu.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.060
I let Yuzhi go with him.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.340
Oh, no.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.940
Yuzhi is in danger.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.660
Master, heal first.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.540
I'll go save him.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.820
We've treated you both well.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.580
Why collude with the demon sect

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.100
to commit such vile acts?

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.573
Stop talking nonsense.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.700
If it weren't
for your grandfather's selfishness,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.180
refusing to use Elder Kaiyang
to save my brother,

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.700
he wouldn't have ended up

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.260
like that.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.500
What a so-called greatest sect.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.580
What a hypocrite.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.780
I did nothing to Mr. Wu.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.540
Why do this to me?

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.300
Because you are Yin's grandson.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.820
You deserve death too.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.460
You've been hit by my Nether Aura.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.340
Even if you don't die,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.900
you'll be invalid.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.260
Attack!

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.260
Xiong's blade!

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.860
Qi Yunke is not dead!

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.300
My master is fine!

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.180
Zhao, go now.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.100
Don't worry about me.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.380
As long as I live,

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:48.940
I won't let you die.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.260
Sunshine Blade.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.300
My Sunshine Blade

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.300
once killed Nie Hengcheng, your chief.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.700
If you want to test it,

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.180
come!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.900
Attack!

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.940
Zhao!

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:41.980
You didn't leave.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.900
My Smiley is spilled.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.500
You owe me a pack.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.700
Why protect Yin Dai's grandson?

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.660
If not for Yin Dai,

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.100
Cai Pingshu wouldn't have died.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.220
What did you say?

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.340
Back then,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.820
he deliberately...

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.100
Yuzhi!

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.940
Yuzhi!

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.220
Are you okay?

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.140
Yuzhi.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.460
Finish it.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.460
Wait a moment.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.340
Alright.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.220
How is it?

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.620
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.060
Here, drink the medicine.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.620
Endure it.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.746
Cold poison entered the veins;

00:22:43.757 --> 00:22:45.003
his internal energy was damaged.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.940
Yuzhi is afflicted by Nether Aura.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.820
I never expected

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.260
Wu Gang to have

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.580
such a sinister martial skill.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.580
Xiuming,

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.380
how confident are you?

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.860
Wenxun is suppressing his cold poison.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.580
However,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.340
even if controlled,

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.940
Yuzhi's power is left at less than 30%.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.620
Father, save Yuzhi!

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.020
He must not die!

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.100
Stop yelling!

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.460
If you keep yelling, Yuzhi will be gone.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.620
Xingjia,

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.440
tell all sects

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.580
to be vigilant,

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.220
lest the demon sect ambush them.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:30.900
Yes.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.140
He deliberately...

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.740
Pingchun!

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.220
Pingchun!

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.140
Come and save her!

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.220
Come!

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.700
Hurry!

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.500
Those cold-blooded hypocrites

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.100
just stood by.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.060
You've been overly protected
by your family.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.540
Once outside,

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.580
harden your heart.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.180
I know.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.900
Life and death are common.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.500
If someone is killed,

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.020
someone must pay.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.460
Spare a villain,

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.020
and more innocents suffer.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.740
Aunt trained me tirelessly
in martial arts,

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.660
so I could one day

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.460
protect myself and others.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.540
Ms. Cai's plan for you

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.900
was also far-reaching.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.180
But I didn't protect Master and Yuzhi.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.140
However strong,

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.860
one may still be overwhelmed.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.860
We can only do our best.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.100
Yes.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.160
We can only do our best.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.900
Aren't you leaving?

00:25:32.113 --> 00:25:33.060
Why are you still here?

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.140
The ones who attacked Qingque Sect

00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:41.660
were also from the Demonic Camp.

00:25:41.959 --> 00:25:43.453
I want to find them and take revenge.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.260
Lord Qi,

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.620
feeling guilty toward Ms. Luo,

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.940
let those two recover here.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.500
This must also be
part of the demon sect's plan.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.900
A subtle line

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.220
runs through.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.820
Ms. Luo came here

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.740
but brought these two pawns.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.500
Did Ms. Luo...

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.540
She didn't know.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.660
She must've been used.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.260
(A few days later, Chuitian Dock)

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.020
Yuzhi,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.960
this is Longjiao Incense

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.060
for calming the spirit.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.580
And this is

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.140
Blood Swallow Congee.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.700
Grandfather left this.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.260
It helps replenish qi.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:41.940
Yuzhi?

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:42.980
Lingbo,

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.980
I want to be alone for a while.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.660
Yuzhi,

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.140
I know you feel uneasy,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.660
but rest assured.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.020
I heard from Uncle Lei

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.460
that once Father uses
Tianhuo Dragon Aura

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.680
to channel energy and heal you,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.833
combined with these herbs,

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.860
your martial arts will slowly recover.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.980
Yuzhi,

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.980
you're blaming me.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.220
You think
I shouldn't have killed Wu Gang?

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.420
But if I hadn't,

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.540
would he have been allowed

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.780
to defame Grandfather?

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.220
Cai Zhao

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.900
always likes to stir up trouble.

00:27:32.206 --> 00:27:33.220
If she had heard about it,

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.373
she'd have caused more chaos.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.020
Forget the past.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.700
Yes.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.380
Recovery comes first.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.820
Yuzhi,

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.183
Nanny Mao prepared a herbal bath
in the hot spring,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.700
specially using Grandfather's

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.260
Revival Pill.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.340
Let's go.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.220
I'll take you.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.580
No need.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.860
It's been carefully prepared.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.100
Let's go.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.260
No need.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.300
Lingbo.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.390
Lingbo has been sincere with you,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.806
planning all this for you.

00:28:07.817 --> 00:28:08.923
And you treat her like this?

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.060
Fengchi,

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.740
Yuzhi didn't mean it.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.900
I'm fine.

00:28:14.346 --> 00:28:15.652
I want to recover in peace alone.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.500
Please go out first.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:21.900
Yuzhi,

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.820
I'm your senior brother.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.700
Today, just listen to me

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.300
and go with Lingbo to heal.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.340
What's the matter, Fengchi?

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.180
Usually, you can't beat Yuzhi,

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.180
so today,
taking advantage of his injury,

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.366
you show off your power, huh?

00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:39.925
Cai Zhao,

00:28:39.936 --> 00:28:41.100
what nonsense are you saying?

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.300
Yeah, that's nonsense.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.380
Stop stirring trouble here.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.380
We're just here to check on Yuzhi.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:47.620
Lingbo,

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.460
if nothing else,

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.500
you and Fengchi may leave.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.220
Lingbo.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.486
Lately, I've been recovering here,

00:29:05.723 --> 00:29:06.966
so I haven't been able to visit.

00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:08.940
Thank you both for saving my life.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.380
Your eyes

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.606
are better now, right?

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.260
Yeah.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.760
Yuzhi,

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.820
I came to tell you:

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.370
My aunt's friend

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.700
was once afflicted by Nether Aura

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.980
but later recovered.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.100
Really?

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.060
Really.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.140
How did it happen?

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.180
Apparently, my aunt found
a special herb.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.580
I already sent a letter to my parents.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.660
It should reach them in a few days.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.820
Thank you.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.900
Something's wrong!

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.660
After leaving, all sects

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.940
were ambushed by the demon sect.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.780
What?

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.020
Lord Song went to Yangzhou
to buy a golden tortoise

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.020
and avoided it.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.380
Taichu Temple broke apart halfway;

00:29:49.486 --> 00:29:51.035
Siqi Sect diverted to marry a concubine.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:51.980
They also avoided it.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.569
What about my parents?

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.940
Mr. Cai's group moved slowly,

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.413
so they weren't ambushed.

00:29:59.946 --> 00:30:00.692
But Peiqiong Manor

00:30:00.703 --> 00:30:02.226
collided directly with the demon sect.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.380
Lord Zhou was injured.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.540
How severe?

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.220
Minor scratches.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.780
Yuqi is also fine.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.340
They've returned to the manor.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.620
Fan,

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.700
can you speak in one go?

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.220
Look at Zhao, so scared.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.780
Right.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.020
Uncle Li said

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.540
we must strengthen defenses

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.180
and invited many external elites.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.460
Zhao,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.340
you know arrays.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.100
Tomorrow morning, accompany me

00:30:29.173 --> 00:30:31.159
to Qingque Town to collect
some array materials.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.740
It seems traveling is getting harder.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.140
Ning,

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.980
what's your plan?

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.820
I'll go down with you.

00:30:43.659 --> 00:30:44.799
There are about to be changes

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.820
in Qingque Sect.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.460
If you like it,

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.580
maybe there's still a chance...

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.420
No need.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.060
After you leave,

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.340
go handle your affairs.

00:31:14.899 --> 00:31:15.965
Only when free from worries

00:31:16.146 --> 00:31:17.453
can you succeed in all endeavors.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.260
Breeze?

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.420
I heard from Fan

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.860
that before your mother left,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.986
she took the last three jars of Breeze

00:31:30.997 --> 00:31:31.940
from the wine cellar.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.060
This is the last jar.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.780
I got it from Uncle Lei.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.220
I promised you before

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.420
to protect you

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.220
and not let you face

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:42.660
revenge alone.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.673
Now, I fear I'll break that promise.

00:31:46.873 --> 00:31:47.780
Please don't blame me.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.660
I won't.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.540
When Mr. Chang died because of me,

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.340
I was filled with hatred.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.620
All I wanted was revenge.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.940
But unexpectedly,

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.500
in just a few months,

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:19.900
I met you

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.980
and experienced things

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.460
I never had before.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.500
It's my fortune.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.740
Thank you.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.660
Zhao, rest assured.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.220
I'll avenge the Chang family,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.820
my father,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.740
and myself.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.600
Chang Ning,

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.540
no matter who it's for,

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:47.700
you swore

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.580
never to use the Disintegration.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.060
Your life

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.326
was saved by Uncle Chang,

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.860
Uncle Lei,

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.380
Jiang Ning,

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.420
and me,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.980
through great effort.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:32:59.820
Survive.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.140
Find every way to survive.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.580
If injured,

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.060
come back here.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.780
Come to Luoying Valley.

00:33:12.706 --> 00:33:13.813
My mother is a great healer.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:14.990
She's as good

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.880
as Uncle Lei.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.340
Sure.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.020
You told me to survive no matter what,

00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:27.986
but you should also remember:

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.180
No matter when or where,

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.140
finish things

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.220
when necessary.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.940
Otherwise,

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.140
lingering attachments

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.620
will lead to ruin.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.700
I'll remember.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.580
(Disciples' Dorm)

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.420
Xingjia!

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.500
Xingjia?

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.700
He's not here.

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.020
Zhuang,

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.020
where's Xingjia?

00:34:23.226 --> 00:34:24.580
I looked for him at the Mao hour,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.420
and he wasn't here.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.966
Did he go to Qingque Town?

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.500
(Zhuang Shu)
He said yesterday he'd go there.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.106
Xingjia must be in trouble.

00:34:36.838 --> 00:34:38.412
He comes from a wealthy merchant family,

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.500
a proper gentleman.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.660
He'd follow the routine
of making the bed,

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.140
but look at this bed.

00:34:43.873 --> 00:34:45.239
He must've been taken by someone.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.380
Zhao,

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.580
have you noticed?

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.820
Since just now,

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.940
someone has been watching us.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.060
Don't tell anyone

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.380
about Fan yet.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.500
Since he's gone,

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.860
let's go without him.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:12.540
Let's go.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.260
After the memorial,

00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:18.639
(Qingque Town)
many martial artists came here.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.780
Finding Fan

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.100
won't be easy.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.700
Outer disciples guard the town gate.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.660
Xingjia should still be in town.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.500
The inn is full of people,

00:35:29.813 --> 00:35:31.282
not a suitable place to hide someone.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.500
I think

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.060
he's hiding in a civilian house.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.322
There must be at least 100 houses

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:38.340
in Qingque Town.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.340
If we search recklessly,
it'll alert the enemy.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.820
I have a plan.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.140
Coming.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.820
Miss, what's the matter?

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.420
I'm Cuihua, new here.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.660
Last night, my mother
gave birth to a sister.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.260
My father said I should deliver
celebratory eggs.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.820
Miss, in Qingque Town,

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.786
celebratory eggs must be given
in even numbers.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.020
I just moved here.

00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:17.080
I didn't know the custom.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.140
Here's another one.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.580
Thank you.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.700
Take care, miss.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:26.420
Who is it?

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.853
I came to deliver celebratory eggs.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.460
My mother gave birth to a sister.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.380
Father said to deliver eggs.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.499
Good things come in pairs.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.700
- Who is it?
- I came to deliver eggs.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.420
Thank you.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.619
He doesn't know the custom.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.700
He must be new here.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.540
He has sharp eyes
and long-lasting energy.

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.940
He must be a master.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.460
Xingjia.

00:37:32.933 --> 00:37:34.940
(Qian Xueshen)
Are you trying to tire me to death?

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.700
Even a mule needs a break.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.160
These past 15 days have drained

00:37:38.171 --> 00:37:38.951
all my power.

00:37:39.086 --> 00:37:40.175
I just rested for two days,

00:37:40.186 --> 00:37:40.940
and you came again.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.260
Mr. Qian, don't worry.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.140
We wouldn't want to exhaust you.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.353
This time, it doesn't require precision.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.820
Please, Mr. Qian,

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.020
do your job.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.180
He looks delicate

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.633
and has fragile bones.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.980
He doesn't seem to be an elite.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.746
Why do you want to transform him?

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.540
This kid is cunning,

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.660
sneaking into the Disciples' Dorm

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.700
at night to check luggage.

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:14.213
If not replaced with our own...

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.900
Enough.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.060
Mr. Qian,

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.100
get to work.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.260
I'll transform you.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.780
The Face Shift.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.780
It reappears.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.540
You know again?

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.220
Don't look at me.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.260
It's not my business.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.580
The Body Shift is indeed wondrous,

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.820
perfectly executed.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.220
This person can be killed

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.953
to prevent future trouble.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.500
Please, spare me!

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.140
He just fainted?

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:41.660
Such a waste.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.300
I'll chop him up.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.540
I'm awake!

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.300
I'm awake.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.460
I'm awake.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.073
What's your connection to Qianmian Sect?

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.100
Who are you?

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.380
I'm Qian Xueshen,

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.340
the last descendant of Qianmian Sect.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.540
Please understand.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.140
They forced me to do this.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.020
I'm just a scholar,

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.195
with elders and children

00:40:01.206 --> 00:40:01.900
to care about.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:20.340
