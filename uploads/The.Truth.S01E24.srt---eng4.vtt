=Episode 24=

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:17.262
Ning Haiyang!

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:23.622
Don't worry.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:32.663
Ning Haiyang ran east
along the riverbank!

00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:33.262
After him!

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:42.182
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:00.542
What happened?

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:01.303
You, go that way.

00:02:13.863 --> 00:02:14.423
Stop!

00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:35.182
Stop!

00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:36.342
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:02:36.502 --> 00:02:36.983
Stop!

00:02:58.062 --> 00:02:59.462
Over there! He's over there!

00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:03.062
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:03:04.502 --> 00:03:05.182
Stop!

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:17.143
- Stop!
- That way!

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:18.062
After him! Hurry!

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:38.662
Stop!

00:03:40.502 --> 00:03:41.383
Stop!

00:03:55.383 --> 00:03:56.103
Go on, run.

00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:57.823
Keep running.

00:03:58.222 --> 00:03:59.143
Go on scaling the wall.

00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:37.982
Stop!

00:04:41.342 --> 00:04:41.943
Stop!

00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:43.943
- Stop!
- Still running?

00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:45.743
Stop!

00:04:46.422 --> 00:04:47.102
Give it up!

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:03.063
Stay back!

00:05:03.263 --> 00:05:04.342
One more step, and I jump.

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:07.102
Don't be rash.

00:05:07.462 --> 00:05:08.902
Don't be rash. Stay calm.

00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:10.743
Everyone step back.

00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:13.902
Easy. Take it easy.

00:05:13.902 --> 00:05:15.102
You won't survive that drop.

00:05:15.102 --> 00:05:15.662
It's too high.

00:05:16.302 --> 00:05:17.383
Don't underestimate me.

00:05:17.662 --> 00:05:19.342
Why would I underestimate you?

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:23.023
I just think you are so young.

00:05:23.743 --> 00:05:25.823
What a tragedy it'd be if you fell.

00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:27.902
My life's worthless. No tragedy at all.

00:05:28.143 --> 00:05:29.063
Stay calm.

00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:32.982
You're here to see your mom, right?

00:05:33.823 --> 00:05:34.823
You're already here.

00:05:34.823 --> 00:05:36.302
Why not just meet her?

00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:37.383
Come over here. Come on.

00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:38.102
Don't move.

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:39.982
Meeting her won't change anything.

00:05:40.143 --> 00:05:41.383
They've got new lives.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:42.143
New families.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:44.183
They don't want to see me
or care about me.

00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:46.143
Your mother's downstairs right now.

00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:47.102
Come over here.

00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:48.623
I'll take you to her. Come on.

00:05:48.823 --> 00:05:49.743
Stop lying.

00:05:50.263 --> 00:05:51.342
I'm not lying.

00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:52.462
See for yourself.

00:05:52.462 --> 00:05:53.503
She's right downstairs.

00:06:04.183 --> 00:06:05.222
That's not my mother.

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:06.503
My real mother died long ago.

00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:14.422
Help! Help!

00:06:14.743 --> 00:06:15.422
Hurry! Help me!

00:06:15.422 --> 00:06:16.703
- Don't let go!
- Hold on!

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.183
Help over here!

00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:20.222
Hold on tight!

00:06:20.703 --> 00:06:22.302
Stop struggling! Pull him up!

00:06:22.302 --> 00:06:22.862
Come on!

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:31.342
Great work.

00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:33.183
Need to take this.

00:06:38.342 --> 00:06:38.943
Master.

00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:42.902
We found him.

00:06:46.743 --> 00:06:47.902
We also found Xiao Lan.

00:06:49.183 --> 00:06:50.902
Okay. Head back immediately.

00:07:31.902 --> 00:07:33.662
You're quite the window climber.

00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:34.862
Where'd you learn it?

00:07:36.063 --> 00:07:36.862
Martial arts school.

00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:39.503
Why'd you learn that?

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:41.503
I never did well in school.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:42.862
Knew I wouldn't get into college.

00:07:43.183 --> 00:07:45.662
My mom worried I couldn't find a job

00:07:46.183 --> 00:07:47.302
and support myself.

00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:51.383
Your mom really thought it through.

00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:53.383
My dad died young.

00:07:53.902 --> 00:07:55.383
She could've remarried.

00:07:56.063 --> 00:07:57.183
But she had me to care for.

00:07:57.462 --> 00:07:58.542
So she never did.

00:07:59.342 --> 00:08:01.503
I knew I was adopted since childhood.

00:08:02.143 --> 00:08:04.063
But they always treated me well.

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:07.063
I never wanted to leave
to find my real parents.

00:08:07.902 --> 00:08:09.102
Then my mom got sick.

00:08:09.662 --> 00:08:10.703
That's when she told me

00:08:10.902 --> 00:08:12.263
I was actually born in Renshan.

00:08:12.823 --> 00:08:15.462
She said I should find
my birth parents someday.

00:08:16.823 --> 00:08:20.183
So you went to Baijia Village
and found Bai Youfu's family.

00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:24.302
When I found them,

00:08:25.263 --> 00:08:27.623
they already had a family
and a new life.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.743
I didn't fit in at all.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:32.182
Your father said you threatened him.

00:08:33.062 --> 00:08:33.902
Is that true?

00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:35.223
Yeah.

00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:37.062
I threatened to call the police.

00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:38.782
That's when he told me

00:08:38.822 --> 00:08:40.182
who those two traffickers are.

00:08:40.343 --> 00:08:41.582
Why didn't you call the police?

00:08:49.302 --> 00:08:50.182
Do you know?

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:53.702
We've been trying to catch them.

00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:55.822
They're wanted for many cases.

00:08:56.822 --> 00:08:59.302
Many families are waiting
for them to be caught,

00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:01.062
hoping to find their own children.

00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:05.263
I didn't mean to.

00:09:05.343 --> 00:09:06.662
I was just so angry.

00:09:07.103 --> 00:09:09.822
Those traffickers said
I wasn't taken away at all,

00:09:09.942 --> 00:09:11.582
but was sold by my own parents.

00:09:12.902 --> 00:09:14.343
I didn't believe it at first.

00:09:15.023 --> 00:09:17.463
So, when you ate in room 601
at the Rose Garden Hotel,

00:09:18.263 --> 00:09:20.062
was that before
or after you killed Liu Min?

00:09:22.422 --> 00:09:23.223
After.

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:25.503
I'd been watching them for a long time.

00:09:25.782 --> 00:09:26.902
No time to eat.

00:09:27.623 --> 00:09:28.302
I was starving.

00:09:28.942 --> 00:09:31.582
Why send Liu Min and Liu Jianyuan's
phones to the police station?

00:09:33.463 --> 00:09:34.782
They were using fake identities.

00:09:35.263 --> 00:09:36.743
It'd be hard for you to catch them.

00:09:37.863 --> 00:09:39.302
I wanted to bring them to justice.

00:09:39.582 --> 00:09:40.702
Don't you get it?

00:09:41.822 --> 00:09:45.023
This kid's mind
is completely set on revenge.

00:09:45.542 --> 00:09:48.103
He probably hasn't even considered
the consequences.

00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:52.062
Ning Haiyang just turned 18.

00:09:52.702 --> 00:09:56.383
By law, 18 is an adult.

00:09:56.702 --> 00:09:59.582
Premeditated murder
could get him the death penalty.

00:09:59.623 --> 00:10:01.983
At the very least, life imprisonment.

00:10:02.463 --> 00:10:05.542
The victims in this case
are quite unique.

00:10:05.983 --> 00:10:07.422
Maybe he'll get a lighter sentence.

00:10:09.263 --> 00:10:11.582
A kid's sense of right and wrong
isn't fully developed.

00:10:12.263 --> 00:10:13.902
And he has no family around him.

00:10:15.822 --> 00:10:18.782
He's been lost on this journey
to find his family.

00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:28.582
Chang, almost done?

00:10:28.702 --> 00:10:30.422
Tell me what you want to eat later.

00:10:30.902 --> 00:10:31.743
Thank you, Ms. Jing.

00:10:36.383 --> 00:10:37.623
Is the food okay?

00:10:37.623 --> 00:10:38.983
Yeah, it's fine.

00:10:38.983 --> 00:10:39.743
Okay.

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:01.302
Let me know if you want more dishes.

00:11:01.302 --> 00:11:02.143
- Got it!
- Okay!

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:05.782
Everyone's here today.

00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:06.942
Is the case closed?

00:11:07.422 --> 00:11:10.263
I said I'd treat Master
once the case was wrapped up.

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:11.623
It's still a way off.

00:11:11.623 --> 00:11:12.743
We ordered a lot. Dig in.

00:11:13.023 --> 00:11:13.863
Got reports to write.

00:11:16.103 --> 00:11:16.782
Come on.

00:11:16.902 --> 00:11:18.143
- Let's finish this.
- Good work, everyone.

00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:18.702
Yeah, good job.

00:11:18.702 --> 00:11:19.503
Let's toast.

00:11:20.582 --> 00:11:21.662
You okay here?

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:23.383
I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:28.062
(Dan Qing, why not reply to my message?)
I heard you almost lost that kid today.

00:11:30.182 --> 00:11:31.743
Why don't you try chasing him yourself?

00:11:36.143 --> 00:11:37.942
You just don't take kids
seriously enough.

00:11:38.662 --> 00:11:40.062
Kids these days are tough.

00:11:40.343 --> 00:11:41.143
Right, Xiaoyu?

00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:46.143
Eat.

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:48.062
Stop playing.

00:11:48.902 --> 00:11:51.143
He's been on his phone
since we got here.

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.143
Why don't you blame him?

00:11:53.662 --> 00:11:54.582
Stop playing.

00:11:54.983 --> 00:11:56.702
Set an example for Xiaoyu.

00:11:58.103 --> 00:11:59.023
Put it down.

00:11:59.103 --> 00:11:59.863
Anything happened?

00:11:59.863 --> 00:12:00.662
Go handle it.

00:12:00.662 --> 00:12:01.383
Anything happened?

00:12:02.503 --> 00:12:03.383
No, Master.

00:12:05.623 --> 00:12:08.302
Even selling your own child for profit

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:09.782
is still child trafficking.

00:12:09.782 --> 00:12:10.743
It's still a crime.

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:14.863
So shouldn't the child's real parents
be held legally responsible?

00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:17.983
The middleman is dead.

00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:20.902
The statute of limitations has expired.

00:12:27.743 --> 00:12:28.383
Gao!

00:12:28.383 --> 00:12:29.542
- Call an ambulance!
- Call an ambulance!

00:12:29.902 --> 00:12:30.942
- Gao!
- What's happening?

00:12:31.503 --> 00:12:33.182
Hello? This is No-Name Diner.

00:12:34.023 --> 00:12:35.182
Step back, everyone.

00:12:35.182 --> 00:12:36.343
Someone's fainted. Come now!

00:12:36.343 --> 00:12:37.463
What happened?

00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.103
Call an ambulance! Hurry up!

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:40.343
Did someone call?

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:40.983
It's done.

00:12:41.103 --> 00:12:42.103
You called?

00:12:42.143 --> 00:12:42.743
I don't know.

00:12:42.743 --> 00:12:43.983
He just collapsed suddenly.

00:12:43.983 --> 00:12:45.902
- How much did he drink?
- Does he need CPR?

00:12:45.902 --> 00:12:47.782
- He didn't drink.
- Didn't he? Then how...

00:12:48.623 --> 00:12:49.302
Be careful.

00:12:51.863 --> 00:12:52.383
Take it slow.

00:12:53.422 --> 00:12:54.182
Slowly.

00:12:54.702 --> 00:12:55.463
Lift him up.

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:57.343
Help lift from inside.

00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:00.983
Huang, you go.

00:13:01.463 --> 00:13:02.143
You may leave.

00:13:08.302 --> 00:13:09.343
Call his wife.

00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:10.223
Okay.

00:13:14.343 --> 00:13:15.863
Master, I'll take them to hospital.

00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:18.383
Take it easy.

00:13:19.062 --> 00:13:20.182
Go. I'll take you there.

00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:21.112
Thanks, Captain Leng.

00:13:23.582 --> 00:13:26.702
Gao isn't even 50 yet, is he?

00:13:26.983 --> 00:13:28.383
Cardiovascular issues already?

00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:30.662
Fortunately, it was caught in time.

00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:32.383
His daughter's taking the exam.

00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:38.702
Police work is inherently high-pressure.

00:13:38.942 --> 00:13:41.863
Especially in their unit, where tasks
are heavy and deadlines tight.

00:13:42.182 --> 00:13:44.182
But someone's got to do this job, right?

00:13:45.422 --> 00:13:46.822
Don't ever eat pork chops.

00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:48.062
- I won't.
- Cardiovascular disease.

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:49.422
I know.

00:13:49.422 --> 00:13:50.023
Let's go.

00:13:50.023 --> 00:13:51.302
Don't worry.

00:13:51.302 --> 00:13:52.383
No problem.

00:13:56.389 --> 00:14:00.024
(No-Name Diner)

00:14:21.983 --> 00:14:22.942
Right over there.

00:14:24.223 --> 00:14:25.023
- Ye, thank you.
- Ye.

00:14:25.023 --> 00:14:25.623
Thank you.

00:14:25.743 --> 00:14:26.902
Qian, thank you

00:14:26.902 --> 00:14:28.223
for staying here so late.

00:14:28.542 --> 00:14:28.983
How is he?

00:14:28.983 --> 00:14:29.542
Busy all day.

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:30.503
Go get some rest.

00:14:30.743 --> 00:14:31.422
- Thanks.
- Okay.

00:14:31.422 --> 00:14:32.503
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

00:14:32.863 --> 00:14:33.422
Okay.

00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:34.223
How is he?

00:14:34.422 --> 00:14:35.463
In the emergency room.

00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:38.383
The doctor's here.

00:14:39.223 --> 00:14:40.743
Doctor, how is he?

00:14:40.902 --> 00:14:41.743
Nothing too serious.

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:42.702
Doctor, doctor.

00:15:02.584 --> 00:15:04.280
(Dan Qing)

00:15:31.062 --> 00:15:31.623
Come on.

00:15:38.182 --> 00:15:38.902
Take a look.

00:15:44.702 --> 00:15:46.582
This is your grandpa's room.

00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:48.263
Haven't tidied it up much.

00:15:48.263 --> 00:15:49.702
I'll sleep in here tonight.

00:15:50.623 --> 00:15:52.263
My room has been cleaned up.

00:15:53.023 --> 00:15:53.743
You sleep there.

00:15:55.103 --> 00:15:55.702
Come.

00:16:02.343 --> 00:16:03.143
Hungry?

00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:04.062
Kind of.

00:16:05.103 --> 00:16:07.062
If you're not hungry, skip eating.

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:08.702
Lose some weight.

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.383
Actually, I quite like Ms. Ziwu.

00:16:15.782 --> 00:16:16.863
I mean

00:16:16.863 --> 00:16:18.702
I wouldn't mind if you married her.

00:16:18.942 --> 00:16:22.822
What's that little head of yours
pondering every day?

00:16:25.942 --> 00:16:27.822
If I were her,
I definitely wouldn't choose you.

00:16:28.182 --> 00:16:28.983
What do you mean?

00:16:29.343 --> 00:16:31.302
You think she looks down on me?

00:16:31.822 --> 00:16:32.942
That's not what I meant.

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:35.863
How's your mom?

00:16:36.623 --> 00:16:37.542
She's alright.

00:16:38.103 --> 00:16:41.302
Does she talk about me often with you?

00:16:46.302 --> 00:16:48.062
Can't we just see you on TV?

00:16:48.463 --> 00:16:49.463
What's that talk?

But the hospital
isn't allowing visitors lately.

00:19:19.743 --> 00:19:20.622
Next time.

00:19:20.983 --> 00:19:22.542
Alright, next time.

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:26.943
Lately, I've been pretty busy too.

00:19:26.943 --> 00:19:28.102
Not much time spent with you.

00:19:29.223 --> 00:19:30.062
You okay?

00:19:30.862 --> 00:19:32.703
It's fine. I'll come again

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:45.102
Mr. Long lost at video games
and can't accept losing to me,

00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:46.382
saying he'll beat me next time.

00:19:46.382 --> 00:19:47.142
Is that so?

00:19:47.862 --> 00:19:48.862

Thanks, son.

00:21:21.503 --> 00:21:24.302
You need to focus on your studies too.

Get plenty of exercise.

It's been several days now.

She hasn't replied to my messages.

00:22:10.023 --> 00:22:11.463
I wonder how she's doing there.

00:22:12.782 --> 00:22:14.503
Maybe she just doesn't want
to talk to you?

00:22:16.183 --> 00:22:16.983
Impossible.

00:22:18.782 --> 00:22:21.223
Could it be that Little Zhao
attracted someone's attention

Could be!

00:25:45.903 --> 00:25:49.023
That sense of accomplishment
money can't buy.

00:25:50.302 --> 00:25:53.023
I just want a simple life every day.

00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:55.423
With family, with friends,

00:25:56.142 --> 00:25:57.663
with work I enjoy,

00:25:59.102 --> 00:25:59.943
with brothers,

00:26:00.622 --> 00:26:01.423
that's enough.

00:26:07.223 --> 00:26:09.862
You asked me once
if being a cop makes me happy.

00:26:14.703 --> 00:26:15.943
Speaking of happiness,

00:26:16.423 --> 00:26:17.023
there is.

00:26:17.903 --> 00:26:21.102
But more importantly,
it gives me a sense of purpose.

00:26:23.703 --> 00:26:24.503
How so?

00:26:26.862 --> 00:26:28.183
Every time I catch a criminal,

00:26:29.782 --> 00:26:33.102
it makes me believe
I'm changing something.

00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:35.542
Maybe it's the people.

00:26:36.903 --> 00:26:37.903
Maybe it's situations.

00:26:40.622 --> 00:26:45.223
I always think if I work harder,

00:26:46.663 --> 00:26:48.622
fewer tragedies would happen,

00:26:49.983 --> 00:26:52.023
and the world might become
a better place.

00:26:57.983 --> 00:27:00.703
You really have
a strong sense of mission.

00:27:01.102 --> 00:27:02.263
You're right.

00:27:02.263 --> 00:27:03.903
It's just that some things...

00:27:04.062 --> 00:27:05.943
Once you have a goal and then act,

00:27:05.943 --> 00:27:07.463
the outcome might be different.

00:27:07.703 --> 00:27:08.703
It depends on what we do.

00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:09.423
Cheers.

00:27:31.622 --> 00:27:32.582
I'm so scared.

00:27:32.582 --> 00:27:34.302
What happened? How did he get killed?

00:27:34.622 --> 00:27:37.142
Heard it was a man from building 8.

00:27:37.142 --> 00:27:38.822
Usually, his wife and kids
aren't around.

00:27:38.822 --> 00:27:40.023
He lived alone.

00:27:40.023 --> 00:27:41.223
Do you know how he died?

00:27:41.423 --> 00:27:43.983
They say debt collectors broke in
and hacked him to death.

00:27:43.983 --> 00:27:44.983
How awful.

00:27:44.983 --> 00:27:46.102
Just gone like that.

00:27:46.102 --> 00:27:47.223
In broad daylight.

00:27:47.223 --> 00:27:48.023
Exactly.

00:27:57.503 --> 00:27:58.423
- Captain Leng.
- Captain Leng.

00:27:59.062 --> 00:27:59.663
How is it?

00:27:59.663 --> 00:28:00.263
What happened?

00:28:00.423 --> 00:28:02.862
Via property management,
we found the deceased was Zhao Sihui.

00:28:02.903 --> 00:28:04.503
Nicknamed Zhao Heizi, aged 55.

00:28:04.862 --> 00:28:07.102
He lived alone in room 208, building 8.

00:28:07.142 --> 00:28:08.822
His daughter married
to Shanghai in 2020.

00:28:09.142 --> 00:28:10.903
His wife also went
to Shanghai a year later.

00:28:10.903 --> 00:28:12.663
We've notified his daughter to return.

00:28:13.102 --> 00:28:15.862
Additionally,
our neighborhood canvass revealed

00:28:15.862 --> 00:28:17.183
that he had a poor reputation.

00:28:17.183 --> 00:28:18.503
Debt collectors often came.

00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:19.822
According to a neighbor,

00:28:19.822 --> 00:28:22.102
she heard loud knocking this morning,

00:28:22.183 --> 00:28:24.302
but was too scared to go check.

00:28:24.503 --> 00:28:25.503
When she looked out,

00:28:25.503 --> 00:28:27.023
she found the door opposite wide open.

00:28:27.983 --> 00:28:31.223
She went inside
and discovered Zhao Sihui murdered,

00:28:31.223 --> 00:28:32.183
lying in blood.

00:28:32.183 --> 00:28:33.263
So she called the police.

00:28:33.342 --> 00:28:34.663
Is the scene sampling done?

00:28:34.743 --> 00:28:35.663
Yes.

00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:43.503
Quickly!

00:28:46.542 --> 00:28:47.302
Which floor?

00:28:47.382 --> 00:28:48.663
Second floor. Ahead.

00:28:49.142 --> 00:28:49.663
Master.

00:28:49.983 --> 00:28:50.423
Hurry.

00:28:52.302 --> 00:28:53.102
Homicide.

00:28:54.142 --> 00:28:55.862
Heard there's blood everywhere
in the room.

00:28:55.862 --> 00:28:57.382
I will lose sleep tonight.

00:28:57.903 --> 00:28:59.023
Exactly.

00:28:59.023 --> 00:29:00.062
Well, this is just great.

00:29:00.062 --> 00:29:00.703
Who knows?

00:29:00.703 --> 00:29:02.582
Will this affect our property values?

00:29:02.582 --> 00:29:04.342
Why did we have to get
this awful trouble?

00:29:48.382 --> 00:29:49.503
Single perpetrator.

00:29:55.342 --> 00:29:56.503
Based on footprints,

00:29:57.542 --> 00:29:58.263
it appears so.

00:30:22.263 --> 00:30:22.822
This room.

00:30:25.943 --> 00:30:26.582
Captain Leng.

00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:41.183
Any findings?

00:30:47.423 --> 00:30:49.062
The deceased was wearing leather shoes.

00:30:49.903 --> 00:30:51.542
Slippers were still on the rack.

00:30:51.983 --> 00:30:55.782
Normally, he'd change
into slippers upon entering.

00:30:56.463 --> 00:30:58.782
So he hadn't changed yet

00:30:59.542 --> 00:31:00.983
when the killer attacked.

00:31:02.142 --> 00:31:04.463
The killer either followed him in

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.582
or was waiting inside.

00:31:16.223 --> 00:31:18.023
A kitchen knife is missing.

00:31:19.183 --> 00:31:20.463
Its pattern matches this one.

00:31:22.782 --> 00:31:27.463
The suspect definitely
took this knife from the kitchen.

00:31:28.582 --> 00:31:29.582
Look, Ye.

00:31:30.943 --> 00:31:33.463
See these neck wounds?

00:31:34.542 --> 00:31:38.463
Suspect must have struck twice
at the neck.

00:31:39.622 --> 00:31:43.183
Blood spatter concentrated here too,

00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:45.582
though less volume.

00:31:46.582 --> 00:31:50.903
If the suspect attacked from behind,

00:31:50.903 --> 00:31:52.263
catching him off guard,

00:31:52.263 --> 00:31:55.582
the spatter pattern
wouldn't look like this.

00:31:55.903 --> 00:31:57.703
This indicates

00:31:57.703 --> 00:32:01.023
the suspect faced the victim
during the attack.

00:32:01.822 --> 00:32:02.862
According to my analysis,

00:32:03.102 --> 00:32:03.983
two possibilities.

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:05.622
First,

00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:09.703
personal grudge.

00:32:10.903 --> 00:32:12.862
Suspect lay in wait

00:32:12.862 --> 00:32:13.943
and seized the opportunity.

00:32:14.342 --> 00:32:16.822
Or they were strangers.

00:32:18.382 --> 00:32:19.822
During the crime,

00:32:19.822 --> 00:32:21.342
suspect was discovered,

00:32:22.703 --> 00:32:24.663
so he killed and fled.

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:29.423
But we need to verify all this.

00:32:30.382 --> 00:32:31.023
Wang Tong,

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:34.743
examine the victim's connections
as soon as possible.

00:32:36.782 --> 00:32:37.582
Ye,

00:32:38.023 --> 00:32:39.183
take Liu Yang

00:32:40.183 --> 00:32:44.382
and identify the two individuals
at the scene this morning.

00:32:45.223 --> 00:32:48.423
We can't proceed without this.

00:32:48.582 --> 00:32:49.183
Yes.

00:32:49.503 --> 00:32:50.663
Get moving! Fast!

00:33:04.423 --> 00:33:05.622
Shanzai, Haozi.

00:33:05.862 --> 00:33:06.822
I-I'm here.

00:33:07.703 --> 00:33:09.183
We're from Yunxi Police Department.

00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:11.023
Here are our credentials.

00:33:14.423 --> 00:33:16.183
You're here for Zhao Heizi, right?

00:33:17.142 --> 00:33:21.703
Witnesses say you went to Building 8,
Lvyin Community for Zhao Heizi today.

00:33:22.223 --> 00:33:23.582
We did go there.

00:33:23.582 --> 00:33:25.622
But when we arrived,
he was already dead.

00:33:26.102 --> 00:33:26.943
How did you find him?

00:33:27.302 --> 00:33:29.822
I-I pried the door open.

00:33:29.822 --> 00:33:31.983
H-He was lying right there
when I entered.

00:33:34.102 --> 00:33:35.183
Come with us.

00:33:35.183 --> 00:33:36.183
Please cooperate.

00:33:41.782 --> 00:33:42.423
Officer,

00:33:43.302 --> 00:33:44.382
I know the drill.

00:33:44.903 --> 00:33:47.263
But we really didn't kill him.

00:33:48.423 --> 00:33:50.862
We're willing to cooperate
with the police investigation.

00:33:51.943 --> 00:33:53.822
Yes, we're very willing.

00:33:54.342 --> 00:33:55.183
Absolutely willing.

00:33:56.183 --> 00:33:56.983
Take them in.

00:33:57.903 --> 00:33:58.703
Follow me.

00:34:03.382 --> 00:34:04.183
Get in the back.

00:34:12.903 --> 00:34:13.702
Come inside.

00:34:15.943 --> 00:34:16.823
Have a seat.

00:34:29.783 --> 00:34:31.262
You know the situation already.

00:34:31.823 --> 00:34:32.863
Zhao Heizi is dead.

00:34:33.582 --> 00:34:35.262
We need your cooperation.

00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:38.303
Tell us everything you know.

00:34:38.783 --> 00:34:39.742
I'll cooperate fully.

00:34:39.742 --> 00:34:41.222
I'll give you my full cooperation.

00:34:42.463 --> 00:34:44.023
Did you know Zhao Heizi well?

00:34:44.423 --> 00:34:45.622
I knew him fairly well.

00:34:46.222 --> 00:34:48.383
He was notoriously addicted to gambling.

00:34:50.582 --> 00:34:51.222
Go on.

00:34:52.062 --> 00:34:53.262
Speaking of Zhao Heizi,

00:34:53.262 --> 00:34:54.463
he was a lucky man.

00:34:54.662 --> 00:34:56.662
His daughter was his personal cash cow.

00:34:57.023 --> 00:34:59.823
Otherwise, he'd have starved years ago.

00:35:00.062 --> 00:35:00.983
Get to the point.

00:35:02.463 --> 00:35:04.863
About six or seven years back,

00:35:04.863 --> 00:35:06.983
I met him during a card game
with friends.

00:35:07.222 --> 00:35:08.702
He was gambling heavily back then.

00:35:08.983 --> 00:35:10.343
He'd show up in every card game.

00:35:10.903 --> 00:35:12.062
Was Zhao Heizi wealthy?

00:35:12.463 --> 00:35:13.262
Him?

00:35:13.783 --> 00:35:16.383
How could a laid-off worker
have that kind of money?

00:35:16.662 --> 00:35:18.182
It all came from his daughter.

00:35:18.542 --> 00:35:20.023
His daughter was stunning.

00:35:20.423 --> 00:35:23.343
Rumor says she married
some rich southern businessman.

00:35:23.662 --> 00:35:26.343
Bought multiple properties
right here in Yunxi City alone.

00:35:26.863 --> 00:35:28.423
How do you know all this?

00:35:28.943 --> 00:35:30.662
Zhao Heizi bragged about it himself.

00:35:34.142 --> 00:35:35.983
Because of his gambling,

00:35:36.182 --> 00:35:39.622
his wife and daughter got fed up
and moved to Shanghai,

00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:41.423
leaving him here all alone.

00:35:42.262 --> 00:35:44.943
So how did he support himself?

00:35:45.903 --> 00:35:48.582
His daughter sent him
a few thousand yuan monthly.

00:35:49.343 --> 00:35:50.823
She also left him several properties.

00:35:51.222 --> 00:35:53.343
But the deeds were all in her name.

00:35:53.702 --> 00:35:55.142
So he couldn't sell them.

00:35:55.222 --> 00:35:57.742
He could just rent them out
for pocket money.

00:35:58.662 --> 00:36:01.823
The rest was decided by fate.

00:36:03.542 --> 00:36:04.463
Decided by fate?

00:36:05.222 --> 00:36:08.142
Playing Pai Gow, betting on dice rolls.

00:36:08.343 --> 00:36:10.182
Winning or losing was up to fate.

00:36:11.032 --> 00:36:16.521
(Hongfa Mahjong Parlor)

00:36:17.783 --> 00:36:19.343
Heizi, you're leaving?

00:36:35.128 --> 00:36:38.721
(Haibo Finance)

00:36:47.503 --> 00:36:48.303
Shanzai.

00:36:48.542 --> 00:36:49.983
What's Uncle Bo's word?

00:36:51.222 --> 00:36:54.463
He said to tag along with you.

00:36:54.983 --> 00:36:55.783
Got it.

00:36:56.343 --> 00:36:58.582
But did Uncle Bo mention anything

00:36:58.823 --> 00:36:59.983
about the money?

00:37:00.222 --> 00:37:01.863
Wait, sir, don't get me wrong.

00:37:01.863 --> 00:37:03.783
I know Uncle Bo always treats me right.

00:37:03.783 --> 00:37:05.542
I rushed over the second
I heard the news.

00:37:05.783 --> 00:37:07.943
Thinking I'd help Uncle Bo
collect that debt fast.

00:37:08.503 --> 00:37:09.742
Relax.

00:37:09.783 --> 00:37:11.783
Would Uncle Bo ever short you?

00:37:12.222 --> 00:37:13.222
Uncle Bo's orders are

00:37:13.222 --> 00:37:16.742
collecting the money,
and then following standard procedure.

00:37:17.503 --> 00:37:19.503
Gimme a minute. Got some business first.

00:37:19.823 --> 00:37:21.503
I need to handle something real quick.

00:37:22.262 --> 00:37:23.222
We'll head over later.

00:37:23.222 --> 00:37:24.062
Wait for my word.

00:37:24.903 --> 00:37:25.423
Okay, sir.

00:37:25.423 --> 00:37:26.062
You go ahead.

00:37:26.062 --> 00:37:26.943
Okay.

00:37:27.423 --> 00:37:28.023
Okay.

00:37:28.182 --> 00:37:28.702
Alright!

00:37:33.503 --> 00:37:36.983
So you were after him to collect a debt?

00:37:37.463 --> 00:37:40.823
Zhao Heizi borrowed 100 thousand
from Uncle Bo last month.

00:37:41.863 --> 00:37:43.823
He hasn't paid back a single cent since.

00:37:44.062 --> 00:37:46.383
Haozi told us

00:37:46.742 --> 00:37:48.823
that he won a lot yesterday
and sent us to collect.

00:37:49.943 --> 00:37:52.182
Getting that would clear his debt.

00:37:53.983 --> 00:37:56.742
Do you know who else
he owed money besides you?

00:37:57.983 --> 00:38:00.823
It was his first time
borrowing from Uncle Bo.

00:38:01.702 --> 00:38:05.383
We heard he had multiple creditors.

00:38:05.823 --> 00:38:08.303
His daughter covered
a lot of it already.

00:38:08.702 --> 00:38:10.622
So you fronted him the cash.

00:38:14.023 --> 00:38:16.662
Uncle Bo gave the green light.

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:18.182
Sir,

00:38:18.582 --> 00:38:20.383
what if he won't open the door later?

00:38:20.662 --> 00:38:21.383
Won't open?

00:38:21.783 --> 00:38:23.343
If he doesn't open, we'll pry it open.

00:38:24.463 --> 00:38:25.182
Okay.

00:38:26.863 --> 00:38:27.983
Wait, sir.

00:38:28.142 --> 00:38:30.062
He... Zhao Heizi knows me.

00:38:30.062 --> 00:38:31.463
This won't cause trouble, right?

00:38:31.463 --> 00:38:31.983
What trouble?

00:38:32.463 --> 00:38:33.702
What's he going to do to you?

00:38:34.542 --> 00:38:35.343
Afraid of what?

00:38:36.582 --> 00:38:38.783
Paying debts is only right and proper.

00:38:39.303 --> 00:38:40.542
Be smart later.

00:38:41.343 --> 00:38:43.943
Just learn how to talk

00:38:44.783 --> 00:38:45.582
and handle things.

00:38:45.742 --> 00:38:46.383
Okay.

00:38:48.463 --> 00:38:50.023
Know the unit number?

00:38:50.463 --> 00:38:52.343
Yes. His place is 208.

00:38:52.983 --> 00:38:53.783
You've been here?

00:38:53.943 --> 00:38:55.463
No, it's my first time too.

00:38:55.463 --> 00:38:56.542
A friend told me.

00:38:57.262 --> 00:38:58.423
He loves gambling, right?

00:38:58.423 --> 00:39:00.142
He's superstitious about numbers

00:39:00.142 --> 00:39:01.222
like 66 or 88.

00:39:01.222 --> 00:39:02.542
What 66 and 88?

00:39:02.542 --> 00:39:03.582
He's just a gambler.

00:39:03.943 --> 00:39:05.582
If the money isn't paid,

00:39:06.142 --> 00:39:06.903
he's dead.

00:39:07.423 --> 00:39:08.702
Okay. Dead.

00:39:18.343 --> 00:39:19.983
Sir, here.

00:39:27.983 --> 00:39:28.783
Zhao Heizi!

00:39:30.903 --> 00:39:32.343
Paying back the money or not?

00:39:34.582 --> 00:39:36.062
Playing dead in there, huh?

00:39:36.983 --> 00:39:39.142
Say something, or we're coming in!

00:39:40.062 --> 00:39:40.702
Sir,

00:39:40.983 --> 00:39:42.542
h-he's not opening. What now?

00:39:42.943 --> 00:39:44.463
Is he even inside?

00:39:44.622 --> 00:39:45.262
Yes.

00:39:45.423 --> 00:39:47.102
My friend saw him come back today.

00:39:47.102 --> 00:39:48.222
He's definitely home now.

00:39:50.702 --> 00:39:51.262
Pry it.

00:39:51.262 --> 00:39:51.903
Okay.

00:39:53.062 --> 00:39:53.863
Pry it.

00:39:54.023 --> 00:39:56.463
I told you to pry it! Pry the door!

00:39:57.582 --> 00:39:58.383
Okay, okay.

00:39:59.463 --> 00:39:59.983
Sir.

00:40:16.903 --> 00:40:19.823
What was this Uncle Bo of yours
doing this morning?

00:40:19.903 --> 00:40:21.662
Uncle Bo was at the company
the whole time.

00:40:22.622 --> 00:40:26.222
He sent us to cooperate with your work.

00:40:27.622 --> 00:40:30.142
This definitely has nothing
to do with Uncle Bo.

00:40:30.383 --> 00:40:33.463
No way. It's only 100,000.

00:40:33.943 --> 00:40:34.903
I'm telling you.

00:40:35.182 --> 00:40:37.023
You're involved
in illegal debt collection.

00:40:37.222 --> 00:40:39.343
We'll need you to cooperate later.

00:40:45.622 --> 00:40:46.622
Who is Uncle Bo?

00:40:48.182 --> 00:40:50.622
Uncle Bo's real name is Lv Haibo.

00:40:51.222 --> 00:40:52.222
In his fifties.

00:40:52.423 --> 00:40:53.742
About 1.7 meters tall.

00:40:54.423 --> 00:40:58.142
He runs a loan company.

00:40:59.222 --> 00:41:01.343
About a month ago,

00:41:01.702 --> 00:41:03.742
Zhao Heizi borrowed
100,000 yuan from him.

00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:05.262
He still hasn't paid it back.

00:41:05.823 --> 00:41:08.142
Yesterday, I heard from my friend

00:41:08.503 --> 00:41:11.662
that Zhao Heizi won 150,000 in cash
at another card game.

00:41:12.222 --> 00:41:14.582
Since I knew he owed Uncle Bo money,

00:41:14.863 --> 00:41:17.503
I thought I'd help Uncle Bo
get the money back.

00:41:17.943 --> 00:41:20.823
By the rules, I get a 10% commission.

00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:23.343
Did Zhao Heizi have enemies?

00:41:24.182 --> 00:41:26.142
I really don't know about it.

00:41:26.903 --> 00:41:28.742
He owed money to a lot of people.

00:41:29.222 --> 00:41:30.943
And he hung out
with all sorts of people.

00:41:31.343 --> 00:41:33.542
Uncle Bo is the only one I know about.

00:41:34.903 --> 00:41:39.423
So, do you think
Lv Haibo is involved in this?

00:41:41.943 --> 00:41:43.503
I think it's unlikely.

00:41:43.903 --> 00:41:45.983
Uncle Bo has over a dozen guys
working for him.

00:41:46.142 --> 00:41:47.503
And he's so rich.

00:41:47.783 --> 00:41:51.423
Killing someone over 100,000 yuan?
Probably not worth it for him.

00:41:53.303 --> 00:41:54.423
So who do you think it was?

00:41:55.903 --> 00:42:00.983
I think maybe after he won
that 150,000 at cards,

00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:03.343
he got targeted.

00:42:03.343 --> 00:42:05.702
Then someone broke in,
killed him, and robbed him.

00:42:06.702 --> 00:42:08.542
Do you know where he won the money?

00:42:08.903 --> 00:42:09.542
Yes.

00:42:09.742 --> 00:42:11.062
Not just the location,

00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:12.383
I can even find out

00:42:12.383 --> 00:42:13.783
how many people were there.
