00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.859
Your Majesty has long reached

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.419
the age to take an empress
and select consorts,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.860
yet the harem remains empty.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.540
I bear responsibility for this.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.099
I've heard Your Majesty

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.779
has reviewed

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.019
the portraits of the maidens
I submitted.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.739
Might I ask if any among them

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.700
has captured Your Majesty's favor?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.700
There is no need.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820
I already have someone in mind.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.460
It was my fault

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.580
for concealing Xiao Man's true gender.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.739
Years ago, when I was gravely ill,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.980
I wished to have her by my side
in the palace

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.340
so she might one day see me to my grave.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.619
That is why I disguised her
as a young eunuch.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.579
I never imagined

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.939
she would cross paths with
Your Majesty in that way.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.820
Once it happened,
there was no turning back.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.539
I deceived Your Majesty.
I beg Your Majesty to punish me.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.219
Jia Yi,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.939
come.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.900
Get up first.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420
Your illness was
contracted in my service.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.260
I haven't forgotten that.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.100
Yet, it was precisely
because of all this

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.380
that Xiao Man and I found
our way to each other.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.260
Right?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.780
Xiao Man?

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.940
Someone in mind?

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.500
Choosing an empress
is no trifling matter.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.300
Might I inquire as to
which family's daughter?

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.260
What is her lineage and appearance?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.860
As your aunt,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020
I must assess her suitability for you.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.580
Now isn't the right time to say.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.780
What do you mean by "the right time"?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.739
I, too, was

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.220
somewhat taken by surprise.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.180
Allow me more time to consider.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.420
By the way,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.499
my recent incognito outing

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.819
was most enlightening.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.620
It was my first time experiencing

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.220
the joy of sharing in
the people's lives.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.219
Your Majesty, you must put the
realm and your own safety first.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.939
You must never leave the palace
without authorization.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.899
Your Majesty,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.779
please prioritize your safety.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.340
Am I not perfectly fine?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.780
Come now, please rise.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.099
Your Majesty's wish to be close
to the people is,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.620
of course, commendable.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.019
But the places you
visited could be dangerous.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.540
If anything had happened...

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.900
Minister He, thank you for your concern.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.460
But that place

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.220
is nothing short of a heavenly paradise.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.620
How could there be any danger there?

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.179
If I may ask, Your Majesty,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.260
what place was it that you visited?

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.459
Why,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.100
the world-famous Yanbo Parlor,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.460
of course.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.100
Your Majesty,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.939
you're a ruler of the nation.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.979
How could you set foot
in such an establishment?

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.260
I've decided.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.939
I'm going to build my own

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.140
Yanbo Parlor inside the palace.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.459
It'll have

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.819
music halls and pleasure quarters,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.380
pleasures of the common world.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.740
Most importantly,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.260
I'll gather the finest talents
from across the land

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.419
to form

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.500
an imperial music troupe
unlike anything before or after.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.340
Your Majesty, you mustn't!

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.099
The borders are unstable.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.859
This is precisely
when we need funds the most.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.060
Why not?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.059
Every one of you has been
to Yanbo Parlor.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.500
Why am I alone forbidden?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.540
Besides,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.220
with all of you governing so efficiently,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.300
what is the harm in
my spending a mere pittance?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.180
His Majesty has always loved to dance.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.620
Minister Sun,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.739
the state coffers are ample.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.859
Allocate some funds

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.899
from the Ministry of War.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.180
It won't hurt.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.540
Thank you, Aunt.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.980
Minister Sun.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.740
Do you have any objection?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.980
As you wish, Your Highness.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.260
What are you doing here?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.220
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.140
I'm having
the Yanbo Parlor replica built.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.780
I came to look at some texts on
the Garden of Dreams performance.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.220
What are you doing?

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.580
Nothing.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.620
Xiao Congrong, merit so great it
overshadowed the throne.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.980
Zhen Xiujin, collusion
with the enemy and treason.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.260
You're reviewing the case
that shook the previous reign?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.660
When the enemy invaded,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.380
pushing all the way to the capital,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.179
Zhen Xiujin, the Crown Prince's tutor,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.380
though a civil official,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.300
led the army in a desperate defense
of the city.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.340
In the nation's darkest hour,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.579
General Xiao Congrong

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.739
raced back from the border
with the Xiao Army

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.939
to protect His Majesty,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.140
routing the invaders.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.460
This couple saved the Great Qian.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.820
Yet half a year later, they were accused
of plotting rebellion.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.099
Why would meritorious saviors

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.420
of the throne turn traitor?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.900
What does Your Majesty believe?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.020
When I later reviewed the case,

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.740
I found it strange as well.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.260
They all say

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.420
Father was a tyrant
who executed loyal ministers.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.060
Mother and I hid in the palace
for six years,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.900
and even then, I saw him once.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.420
I never knew

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.860
the full truth.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.380
Look here, Zhen Muyu,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.580
the Zhen family's
fugitive firstborn son.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.740
If he's still alive,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.100
he should now be my aunt's husband,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.780
which would make him my uncle.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.880
A loyal minister and a great general...

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.579
Gone just like that.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.360
They didn't even fare as
well as ordinary people.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.780
Look at this one, Zhen Mujun.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.180
This name is interesting.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.860
What name?

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.420
Your Majesty, say that again.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.060
Zhen Mujun.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.780
"Mu" as in devotion,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.100
"Jun" as in gentleman.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.460
Had it not been for that tragedy,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.540
she would have been my empress.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.740
What do you mean?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.660
I was told

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.220
that while she was still
in General Xiao's womb,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.460
my father decreed the match.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.420
If the General bore a daughter,

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.660
she would be the next empress
of Great Qian.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.300
However...

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.380
However?

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.220
The woman who will be my empress now

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.780
will be the one I truly love.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.980
Your Majesty,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.860
why do you know this case so well?

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.660
Because it was a miscarriage of justice.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.860
General Xiao Congrong stood at
the very peak of power in Great Qian,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.020
and Zhen Xiujin was Father's
childhood companion.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.380
Why would they rebel?

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.220
If they truly intended to,

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.019
all they had to do was nothing

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.500
when the enemy invaded.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.100
That's why I believe

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.460
this was a wrongful case.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.482
Xiao Congrong, hear the decree!

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.459
Xiao Congrong
and her husband, Zhen Xiujin,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.900
are charged with treason.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.880
She, along with the hundred
thousand soldiers of the Xiao Army,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.260
will be executed.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.780
Loyal ministers and good generals

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.419
should die for their country,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.620
buried on the battlefield.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.980
To be instead trapped in court intrigue

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.060
and killed in another's
power struggle...

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.740
How utterly tragic.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.940
The Zhen family served the state
and its people, winning the people's hearts.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.459
I've always hoped that one
day I could clear their name

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.780
and restore justice to the wronged.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.900
It's also my way

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.980
to redress the wrongs Father committed.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.900
But I am powerless.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.299
All evidence from that
time was destroyed.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.260
Even several senior officials
who pleaded for them were implicated.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.460
Too many paid an unbearable price.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.620
If Your Majesty requires it,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.480
I volunteer to investigate
this case in secret.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.300
Xiao Man, you said you came looking for
reference material for memorials.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.980
I don't believe there's any memorial

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.620
that requires digging up an old case
from the previous reign.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.400
Ever since you returned,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.880
you've been coming here again
and again, going through the archives.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.780
You're doing this

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.820
to uncover the truth behind
the Zhen family case, aren't you?

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.860
Yes.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.020
Why are you determined to
uncover the truth about the case?

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.580
Alright.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.660
Let me put it differently.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.420
Are you doing this

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.300
for Director Jia

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.940
or for yourself?

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.460
For myself.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.620
If it's for yourself...

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.340
Here.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.900
Take this.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.899
With this imperial token,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.380
you'll have free access
throughout the palace.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.060
Even if you are not ready
to tell me your reasons now,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.020
I will support you fully.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.480
I just hope that one day, we
can be honest with each other.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.060
Do you trust me?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.380
I do.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.300
Don't thank me.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.140
Xiao Man,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.019
you're the only person

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.220
in this world

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.260
I trust.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.580
Isn't this the sculpture
I made for you back then?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:56.819
Wait,

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.779
I... I was reaching for the token.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.820
Give it back.
