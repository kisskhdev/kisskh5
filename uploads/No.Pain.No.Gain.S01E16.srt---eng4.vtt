=Episode 16=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.550
- Off work!
- Off work!

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.390
Off work.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.670
I'm leaving.

00:02:02.502 --> 00:02:03.390
See you tomorrow.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.830
Bye-bye.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.470
Bye-bye.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.190
Lin Wan, I'm leaving first.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.940
My neck's a bit stiff.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.191
I'm going to get a massage.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.110
Go ahead.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.300
Don't stay too late.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.620
Leave early.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.350
Just leave the rest for tomorrow.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.390
Why are you alone?

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.140
Where's your team?

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.990
Hailu.

00:02:58.857 --> 00:03:00.110
The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.790
finally got to move forward.

00:03:01.813 --> 00:03:03.270
The concept art needs detail checks,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.959
all the requirements
need to be finalized,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.560
and I still have people
to coordinate with.

00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:09.350
Sky Fire is stirring things up,
saying we have no new games

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.620
and that we've run out of ideas.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.550
I just thought

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.580
I should do more while I still can.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.110
You look really stressed.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.350
Don't carry everything by yourself.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.740
Yeah, kind of.

00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:27.140
Even if the sky falls,
someone taller will hold it up.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.860
Work never ends.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.620
Once you're off the clock,
it's your own time.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.420
Come with me.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.350
Where are we going?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.670
♪I can't wait until the weekend♪

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.030
♪Wanna see you right now♪

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.910
♪You never answer when I call you♪

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.510
♪Tell me what is that about♪

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.510
♪I heard you've been talking
about me again♪

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.220
♪I heard you coming back to me
in my dream♪

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.070
Cheers.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.350
Cheers.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.390
Sugar-free.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.420
Hailu,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.740
I saw you

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.900
at a club before.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.790
I didn't expect you
to be like this in private.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.620
I thought you were the type

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.580
who put work before everything,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.620
steady,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.180
and never makes mistakes.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.150
But being that kind of person
all the time

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.150
is exhausting.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.670
One day, I realized

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.790
everyone around me was praising me
for being capable,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.790
but no one cared

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.470
how I became that way.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.790
That's when it hit me.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.740
Work is for earning money.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.300
Life is your own.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.110
But

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.300
your work style at Tengda

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.670
must be pretty happy, right?

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.180
Where did you work before?

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.110
Do you really like Tengda?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.060
I do.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.150
I really, really, really do.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.860
What if,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.620
just hypothetically,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.110
if one day, you found out

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.420
Tengda

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.550
or Mr. Pei

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.300
wasn't the way you thought,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.500
would you be disappointed?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.300
That's just a hypothetical.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.620
Impossible.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.550
By the way, did you know

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.260
Sky Fire tried to poach us before?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.391
I only wanted to find out

00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:21.110
what was going on,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.710
so I talked to a headhunter.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.740
And somehow,

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.790
he ended up wanting
to join Tengda instead.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.860
That's when I realized

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.670
Tengda really is that good.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.420
I don't think Mr. Pei would change.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.820
Do you?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.670
When he was at Sky Fire before,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.500
I actually went to see him.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.710
He was genuinely working there.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.890
Like a normal employee.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.530
There's no way

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.990
he went there to poach Wei, right?

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.170
But after he came back,
he started acting strange.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.820
Hailu, aren't you curious?

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.670
I just need to do my job well.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.791
No need to be overly curious.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.110
You're his special assistant.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.230
You must know things

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.670
the rest of us don't, right?

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.790
Lin Wan,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.470
don't take everything too seriously.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.260
Anyone can be different
from what you imagine.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.030
Come on.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.060
Let's go dancing.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.420
If ride-hailing is off the table,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.990
what else can I do to make money?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.857
Do you need a designated driver?

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.420
Yes,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.940
I do.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.420
Is your car over there? Follow me.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.110
Slow down.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.380
Mister, need a designated driver?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.380
Okay. Let's go.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.740
Mister, need a designated driver?

00:06:57.226 --> 00:06:59.420
(On Call Anytime)

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.860
Hello?

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.150
Qian,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.590
I stayed up all night thinking,

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.740
and I still couldn't find
a new blue ocean.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.550
Can you give me a bit more time?

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.940
Sure. OK. No problem.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.470
Hello?

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.380
Mr. Pei.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.380
I've been thinking.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.724
The CEO Has an Exclusive Crush on You

00:07:40.724 --> 00:07:42.180
is Feihuang Pictures' first production.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.346
The quality has to be solid
so we can build a reputation.

00:07:44.368 --> 00:07:45.790
So I want to hire the best team.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.910
Sure. OK. No problem.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.180
Sure. OK. No problem.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.910
Sure. OK. No problem.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.180
Sure. OK. No problem.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.260
Hello?

00:08:08.302 --> 00:08:10.213
Mr. Pei, the character
promotional video sample

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:11.524
for The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:12.570
has been sent to your email.

00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:13.740
Did you check it?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.030
Can we approve it?

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.420
Sure. OK. No problem.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.300
Sure. OK. No problem. Everything.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.820
What did Mr. Pei say?

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.620
Sure. OK. No problem.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.590
In one go again!

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.860
Who is it now?

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.900
Sir, where are you?

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.835
When will you arrive?
I've been waiting for ages.

00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:39.710
I'm so sorry.

00:08:39.768 --> 00:08:41.660
CC Designated Driving, at your service.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.500
Where are you?

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.380
Waiting by the roadside.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.260
Right away.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.380
Lin Wan, your ideas really helped.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.140
My original design
was pretty conventional,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.946
but after drawing inspiration
from you guys,

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:55.540
the characters became more distinctive

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.430
and really came to life.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.490
Like they grew straight
out of the ground naturally.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:00.230
Wait.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.310
Is that praise or an insult?

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.950
Grew out of the ground, huh?

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.110
Come.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:04.990
Tell me.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.830
This one.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.380
(Wayfarer)

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.540
This chubby guy is based on me, right?

00:09:10.568 --> 00:09:11.791
Why call him Wayfarer?

00:09:11.813 --> 00:09:15.140
This is the Divine Mountains and Seas,
and you still make me travel everywhere.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.380
That's too tragic.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.380
Are you targeting me?

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.168
Sorry, Bao. I don't know why.

00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:22.710
But whenever I use you as inspiration,
I think of traveling.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.190
Don't underestimate him.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.110
He's very strong.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.260
(We want)

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.380
(The Divine Mountains and Seas
to be an innovative)

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.260
(MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer
Online Role-Playing Game.)

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.230
(Players can switch between different
characters, explore the world,)

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.310
(and choose various classes
and strategies)

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.500
(to challenge dungeons.)

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.950
(For example,)

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.620
(the Wayfarer)

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.740
(comes from the Orient.)

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.620
(He's a powerful mage)

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.500
(with a unique passive skill)

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.500
(called The Unwilling Wayfarer.)

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.740
(This skill shows)

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.740
(that when he stands still,)

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.780
(he rapidly regenerates health and mana)

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.350
(without using recovery items.)

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.710
(Once he moves,)

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.620
(his health keeps dropping)

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.140
(while his rage meter keeps rising.)

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.430
(When the rage bar is full,
he enters berserk mode.)

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.620
Stand still to heal.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.740
Move to go berserk.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.020
That's literally me.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:43.860
This is me!

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:45.660
Let's look at the next one.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.060
(Literati of the Wind)

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.260
Ruan Guangjian,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.140
this character is based on you, right?

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.020
That's cheating.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.380
You made yourself so handsome.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.230
How is that cheating?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.310
Look at the name

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.950
Lin Wan came up with.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.990
Literati of the Wind.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.590
What a dashing name.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.110
Of course,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.350
he has to be handsome.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.620
(Literati of the Wind)

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.260
(is a painter and calligrapher.)

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.860
(He's also a romantic swordsman.)

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.230
(He pours his soul into his art,)

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.860
(and lives a reclusive life.)

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.590
(His weapon
is a giant calligraphy brush.)

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.230
(Through wild strokes,)

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.350
(he summons fierce winds.)

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.860
"Mount Emei towers beyond
the Western heavens.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.860
Mount Luofu stands intimately linked
to the Southern Sea.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.900
With a stroke of my brush,
the great painter

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.540
brings all the mountains and seas
into view."

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.700
(Literati of the Wind)

00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:10.140
Wait, this isn't right.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.350
Why does this character

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.860
feel way stronger than mine?

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:13.860
Not really.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.380
Every character has strengths

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.110
and weaknesses.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.470
They counter each other.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.740
But if we're talking about

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.168
the strongest one in this version...

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.710
It has to be...

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.940
(Guardian of Justice)

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.380
I actually

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.860
spent the most time

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.380
designing this one.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:33.830
First,

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.110
he's a tank.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.590
He shields

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.540
the team

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.620
and takes on everything.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.020
Second,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.380
his passive skill

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.860
lets him rapidly increase defense

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.590
when attacked.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.813
He also scatters gold coins

00:12:46.835 --> 00:12:48.190
that can damage enemies

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.020
as an active skill.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.380
Finally,

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.500
the ultimate move

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.470
is called Self-Motivation.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.950
- Guardian of Justice.
- Guardian of Justice.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.470
The more I listen to the description,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.830
the more familiar it sounds.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.190
Judging by the amount and speed
of coin-throwing,

00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:08.070
I think I already know
who this is based on.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.540
(Guardian of Justice)

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.740
Hello?

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.260
Did you order a designated driver?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:58.900
I'm almost there

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.900
after making a turn.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.470
Hello.

00:14:13.524 --> 00:14:15.950
Are you the author of
"The CEO Has an Exclusive Crush on You",

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.620
Chit & Chat?

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.190
I'm here.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.430
Chit & Chat?

00:14:37.568 --> 00:14:38.780
What are you talking about?

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.070
Aren't you

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.257
the author of
"The CEO Has an Exclusive Crush on You",

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:42.900
Chit & Chat?

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.990
We're supposed to meet here.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.110
What Chit & Chat?

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.070
Are you crazy?

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.540
Wu Sheng? Wu Xi?

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.230
What are you doing here?

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:31.660
What do you want to drink?

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.350
My treat.

00:15:35.146 --> 00:15:36.190
- We are...
- We are...

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.660
Chit...

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.350
And Chat...

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.540
Right now.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.590
Now.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.990
I'll book you a ticket.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.380
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:15:56.524 --> 00:15:59.110
She misses home, and he books her flight
and gives her time off.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.430
What a lovely couple.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.070
Sorry.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.190
Excuse us.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.540
Hero saving the beauty.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.430
They hold hands.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.620
A young and successful CEO,

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.590
and an independent and capable heiress.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.380
What a destined couple!

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.546
Wu Sheng, let's write a story
about Mr. Pei and Lin Wan

00:16:15.546 --> 00:16:16.590
Zhongdian Web Fiction.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.620
So you two are Chit & Chat?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.813
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.860
We didn't want Mr. Pei to find out

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.830
that we wrote stories during work hours.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.500
No way. He'd definitely understand

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.660
and strongly support you.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:33.430
Sure. OK.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.540
No problem.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.500
See?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.140
He said OK.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.500
We're colleagues here,

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.657
so I'll be straight with you.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.480
The main issue is

00:16:44.502 --> 00:16:46.260
that "The CEO Has
an Exclusive Crush on You"

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.740
hasn't been able to find a screenwriter.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.235
The good ones are fully booked,

00:16:49.257 --> 00:16:50.500
and the not-so-good ones

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.500
are not so good.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.900
So I wanted to ask

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.110
if you two could adapt it yourselves.

00:16:57.235 --> 00:16:59.260
We have a friend
who works as a screenwriter.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
He already lost his mind
after just a few years.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.310
He says

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.660
anyone who can read

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.670
thinks they're qualified
to give suggestions.

00:17:05.768 --> 00:17:07.568
We're earning pretty well at Tengda.

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:09.540
Why would we put ourselves through
that kind of suffering?

00:17:09.546 --> 00:17:11.740
Besides, we were writing it
based on Mr. Pei...

00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:13.870
I mean, based on a very
well-matched pair of friends.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.740
We were writing it for fun. It's fictional.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.990
We just want to
make a bit of money off Mr. Pei.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.710
Yeah.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:21.950
I see.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.190
But it's really hard

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.580
to find someone else.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.500
Huang,

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.340
didn't you do some ghostwriting before?

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.740
That

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.500
Ma...

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500
Ma Ma Ma Ma Ma, right?

00:17:34.813 --> 00:17:36.230
Ma Dubiao.
[*His pen name consists of five "Ma" characters]

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.580
Right, that's you.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.430
You've got writing experience.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.470
Why not write it yourself?

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.580
We'll authorize it.

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:44.580
As long as the couple's name
for the leads

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.910
stays "Qianyan Wanyu" .
[*So Much to Say]

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.580
Yes, Qianyan Wanyu.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.780
Qianyan Wanyu?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.260
(Mingyun Villa)

00:18:13.102 --> 00:18:13.870
Director Zhuang,

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.946
let's have another drink.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.630
Well, Mr. Pei...

00:18:18.702 --> 00:18:19.820
He just replied to the message.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.580
He's on the way.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.740
Traffic is terrible.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.460
(Mingyun Villa)

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.300
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:34.910
I'll park your scooter for you.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.150
This job is seriously affecting
my side job.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.500
He's here.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.670
I'm so sorry.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.020
Mr. Pei, let me introduce you.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.390
This is Mr. Pei.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.300
Mr. Pei Qian.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.500
This is Director Zhuang Dace.

00:18:48.657 --> 00:18:49.710
Hello, Director Zhuang.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:50.920
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

00:18:50.924 --> 00:18:52.340
My last order was far away.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.470
So I got delayed.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.430
Your last order?

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.910
I mean, my previous workplace.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.430
I was at a meeting somewhere else.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.190
Understandable.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.060
Sometimes my meetings
last a whole day too. Come.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.910
Sit.

00:19:04.524 --> 00:19:05.470
Please have a seat.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.230
Sibo,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.500
have you told Director Zhuang

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.990
about the project?

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.710
I read

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.470
the proposal

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.470
and the novel.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:28.150
The biggest issue

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.060
with this project is

00:19:30.124 --> 00:19:31.702
that its overall vision is too limited.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.230
It lacks a strong hook.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.780
An ordinary sweet romance

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.340
is very hard to compete in the market.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.740
Director Zhuang,

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.710
how can we make it competitive?

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.470
There are three key points
for a TV series.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.300
Pain point, emotional resonance,

00:19:51.546 --> 00:19:52.670
and discussion value.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.540
Content itself isn't the most important.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.540
The genre is.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.470
The audience

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.780
needs to feel emotional pain points

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.990
and resonance.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.990
Pain points?

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.780
Whose pain points? Resonating with whom?

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.580
I suggest

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.870
turning this project

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.580
into sci-fi.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.500
The grander the setting, the better.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.020
The larger the investment, the better.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.100
The production tier

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.540
must be at least S+.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.190
There's no room left in the market

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.740
for mid-tier shows now.

00:20:22.746 --> 00:20:23.880
And at minimum,

00:20:23.902 --> 00:20:25.870
shoot three seasons back-to-back.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.020
Director Zhuang,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.680
the novel is called

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:38.430
The CEO Has an Exclusive Crush on You.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.160
It doesn't seem big enough
for that scale.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.540
Maybe we should focus on

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.190
telling a good romance story.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.020
The title is just a name.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.300
It can be changed anytime.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.740
What matters is daring to be first.

00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:51.502
I've worked in TV for many years.

00:20:51.546 --> 00:20:52.950
I've seen it all.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.500
Sweet romance

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.260
has no future

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.580
in today's market.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.260
It has to be a blockbuster.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.100
And

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.540
it has to be sci-fi.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.500
Do you know the first book I read

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.630
after learning to read?

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.390
UFO Fantasies.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.100
Sci-fi is perfectly right up my alley.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.670
It's what I feel most strongly about.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.990
We'll use the cutting-edge
filming techniques

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:23.100
to open up a blue ocean

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.910
and be the first

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.950
to break into this genre.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.580
Well, let me tell you this.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.670
I've even thought of the new title.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:33.630
Let's call it

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.230
AI CEO:

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.150
With You to the End of the Universe.

00:21:39.213 --> 00:21:40.060
How does that sound?

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.060
Good?

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.580
No problem, right?

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.580
This is an artist's creative instinct.

00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:46.791
Nature calls.

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:48.020
Mr. Pei, I drank several cups

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.857
just waiting for you.

00:21:48.902 --> 00:21:49.791
You guys chat first.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.260
Mr. Pei, I think Director Zhuang seems

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.260
a bit unreliable.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.950
Didn't I tell you to hire the best team?

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.990
How did you end up with him?

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.190
Well,

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.950
this is Feihuang's first show.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.190
We have to build a reputation.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.260
I looked for directors

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.190
with notable works.

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.670
I first contacted Director Zhao.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.780
He agreed at first,

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.500
but then one of his shows blew up,

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.500
and he backed out.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.657
Didn't even reply to messages.

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:17.324
Then...

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.580
I tried this Director Liu.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.260
(Liu Wenyang)

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.340
This one?

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.740
Douhua reviews say

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.990
he's even less reliable.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.540
Right?

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.740
I think so too.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.870
But other directors
are even harder to book.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.260
At least, Director Zhuang

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.260
has an opening in his schedule.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.257
It's not like they have
tons of projects going on.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.740
Yeah.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.190
If there's really no better choice,

00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:42.780
then it has to be him.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.540
Mr. Pei,

00:22:45.168 --> 00:22:46.540
but what Director Zhuang just said

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.870
is completely different

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.260
from the original novel.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.530
It's not the same story at all.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.910
Mr. Pei,

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.780
I went to the restroom,

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.710
and suddenly my head was full of images.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:55.990
Inspiration just flooded in.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.990
Trust me.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.870
You must trust me.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:58.910
This project

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.230
is going to be a huge success.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.340
We just discussed it too.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.500
We hope that

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.870
as long as the core
of the original story is kept,

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.470
we'll fully support
your creative direction.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.390
The TV industry

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.630
needs bold, promising producers

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.740
like you.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.740
I believe this project

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.020
will leave a lasting mark

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.470
on television history.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:28.990
Well?

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.780
The producer has spoken.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.340
You must cooperate.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.740
Mr. Pei,

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.230
let me propose a toast.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.340
Sorry,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.430
I still have work later.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.950
If I drink alcohol, that'd be illegal.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.230
Illegal? How so?

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.870
I'll drink tea instead.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.740
Alright. Come on.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.630
I'm suddenly feeling excited.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.700
(It's completely fine
to drink coffee and slack off at work)

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.740
What's up, Huang?

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.260
Taking a sauna?

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:20.990
Mr. Ma.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.230
Nothing.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:25.950
Don't even ask.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:26.670
What happened?

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.260
My project

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.813
"The CEO Has an Exclusive Crush on You"

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:31.260
already has a director attached.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.470
Isn't that a good thing?

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.190
I just finished an outline,

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.500
and after the director read it,
he told me to start casting.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.780
He said if we want this project to work,

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.580
we need A-list actors.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.230
A-list?

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.100
I doubt this title

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.820
can land A-listers.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:46.580
Oh, right.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.670
He changed the title too.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.500
That's better.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.230
AI CEO:

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.150
With You to the End of the Universe.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:55.020
It's fine.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.990
I'll help you.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.990
Don't stress.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.380
(General Manager's Office)

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.540
We contacted so many agents.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.020
None of them is interested.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.500
Makes sense.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.260
Big-name actors

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.159
wouldn't be interested in a three-season

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.710
AI CEO: With You
to the End of the Universe, right?

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.870
Don't you think

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.060
the title sounds funny?

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.390
Enough.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.910
There's actually one person
who's interested.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:18.500
Who?

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:20.780
Lu Zhiyao.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.630
He's interested in the story?

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.190
He's interested in the paycheck.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.260
His acting skills are terrible.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.780
He's most famous for fighting
over the billing order, right?

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.500
Is there anyone else?

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.100
No.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.780
(Lu Zhiyao)

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.740
Mr. Lu,

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.910
and agents.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:50.870
His name is Tian.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.260
Tian.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.020
Mandy.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.430
We meet again.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.340
Mr. Huang,

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:57.910
you know,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.740
Yao usually takes

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.950
film projects.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.500
He doesn't take TV series.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.820
But since we worked together

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.190
quite pleasantly before,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.740
we're willing

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.020
to give you this opportunity.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:11.340
Well,

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.020
I'm so grateful for that.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:15.990
Mr. Lu,

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.780
have you read the proposal

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.950
and story outline?

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.990
Any thoughts?

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.990
We've read them.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.780
Yao feels that

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.100
the story's point of view

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.060
has a problem.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:31.500
Mr. Lu,

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.990
please feel free

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.390
to speak your mind.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.300
The core of AI CEO

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.150
is the CEO.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.950
But your perspective
starts from the female lead.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:46.910
That doesn't make sense.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.300
Romance isn't the focus.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.990
The focus should be

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.390
on the CEO's growth arc

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.020
and how he eventually governs
the entire universe.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.260
Hold on.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.300
Why would the CEO govern the universe?

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.990
Romance as the theme is too narrow.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.540
This is sci-fi.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.430
Sci-fi must explore
the mysteries of the universe.

00:27:13.724 --> 00:27:15.020
A.I. Artificial Intelligence.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:16.500
Have you seen that?

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.340
The protagonist's image
fits me perfectly.

00:27:20.035 --> 00:27:21.580
You can use that as a reference.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.100
Haven't you seen it, Mr. Huang?

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.150
It's our friend.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.430
Judy acted in it.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.910
People online say that Mr. Law
looks a lot like Yao.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.340
You should get him to star
in the remake.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.300
- That works.
- Yeah.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:32.990
Makes sense.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.670
Yeah.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.150
The fan forums

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.340
say the same, right?

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.230
- Exactly.
- Right.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.060
Yeah.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.060
Jude Law?

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.500
Pay attention.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:48.190
(This boy is named Handsome.)

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.470
(He's the world's
first emotional robot.)

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.190
(But he looks no different
from a real human.)

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.870
(Even the way he talks and behaves
is just like a person.)

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.300
(By the bridge, willows drape a stream.
Your home is just west of North Bridge.)

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.180
(AI CEO: With You
to the End of the Universe)

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.260
We all read the script.

00:28:05.346 --> 00:28:07.390
First, there are problems
with the story's core logic.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.500
Second,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.300
the character doesn't have depth.

00:28:10.346 --> 00:28:12.870
In the first six episodes,
there's nothing to hook the audience.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.540
Once you lose those hooks,

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.540
I'm skeptical whether this show

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.820
can go the distance.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.300
What are your thoughts about
the first six episodes in particular?

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.230
The beginning is pretty engaging.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.100
But later on,

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.540
the plot just keeps repeating itself.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.430
The writer probably
didn't think it through.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.020
He...

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.500
Mandy.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.300
Look, the script keeps recycling
the same thing.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.670
The whole story runs on plot armor.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.146
It gets tiring. How is the actor
supposed to act this out?

00:28:37.168 --> 00:28:39.060
Plus, the early setup
and later story direction

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.150
are completely disconnected.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.740
Sci-fi is too niche.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.300
Not niche at all.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.430
To be honest...

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.670
Director, excuse me.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.500
Hello, Director Wang?

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.430
Hi.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.430
Yes, I'm Mandy.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.300
We read your script,

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.260
and I have a few thoughts.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.300
First,

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.740
there are some problems

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.990
with the story's core logic.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.670
Second,

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.791
in the first six episodes,

00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:02.630
the character doesn't have depth.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.080
There's nothing to hook the audience.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.990
The beginning is pretty engaging.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.470
But later on, the plot
just keeps repeating itself.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.430
The whole story runs
on plot armor. It gets tiring.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.390
Plus, the earlier setup
and the later story direction

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.500
are completely disconnected.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.990
Pure love is still too niche.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.150
Wait.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:19.990
She's talking

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.430
about our show, isn't she?

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.390
No, but everything she said
is exactly the same.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.430
Actually, after thinking it over,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.670
I feel our story might work better

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.950
as a mysterious fantasy.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.910
Have you seen Game of Thrones?

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:36.990
Yes.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.740
I want to make something like that.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.910
(Pay attention. This handsome lad)

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.740
(is a security guard from the North.)

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.820
(One day,)

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.340
(he runs into a White Walker.)

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.300
Does he even know
what he's talking about?

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:53.780
Game of Thrones is fantasy,

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.780
not mysterious fantasy.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.300
(By the bridge, willows drape a stream.
Your home is just west of North Bridge.)

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.870
Demon Lord of the North:

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.230
I Love Only You for Three Lifetimes.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.150
Great title.

00:30:08.546 --> 00:30:10.500
Sibo revised this
for several nights straight.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.780
All based on your feedback.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.060
Look, he's exhausted.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.150
You see,

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.230
we can't just make shows

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.190
for ourselves these days.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.430
We have to watch market trends.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.990
Right.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.260
I saw fan feedback

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.870
saying there's too much
mysterious fantasy.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.150
Audiences are tired of it.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.740
Should we

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.300
upgrade the script again

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.300
and make it fantasy instead?

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.500
Think about it.

00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:40.060
(Pay attention. This handsome lad
is called Monkey.)

00:30:40.146 --> 00:30:41.670
(He started at the grassroots level.)

00:30:41.724 --> 00:30:43.919
(He once served as supervisor
at the Heavenly Stables,)

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.968
(later deputy director
of the Celestial Peach Garden.)

00:30:45.968 --> 00:30:47.060
(Due to a work mistake,)

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.699
(he was reassigned to Mount Five-Finger
for geological research,)

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.070
(and led the quest for
the scriptures in Journey to the West.)

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.580
Finished!

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:02.190
I finally finished writing it!

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.700
(By the bridge, willows drape a stream.
Your home is just west of North Bridge.)

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.190
Why isn't she picking up?

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.990
Hello, Mandy?

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.020
I'm waiting at our private kitchen.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.020
When are you arriving?

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.540
I'm sorry, Mr. Huang.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:30.150
Yao's new movie

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:31.260
is about to be released.

00:31:31.346 --> 00:31:33.435
He's shifting away
from being a hyped celebrity now,

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.670
so this project

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.230
doesn't fit his future career plan.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.710
He won't be taking the role.

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.540
Sorry about that.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.635
I have another call coming in.
Talk to you later.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.430
Mandy...

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.950
Mandy!

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.260
You can't do this, Mandy.

00:31:55.902 --> 00:31:57.740
What's going on? Are they coming or not?

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.150
Are they coming or not?

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.430
Lu Zhiyao dropped out.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.390
The show business

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.670
is way too ruthless.

00:32:12.724 --> 00:32:14.724
(Supreme Mage of the North Continent
Still Loves You)

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.820
Fine.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.190
Another one gone.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.670
I worked like a dog,

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:33.230
writing day and night,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.150
and he didn't show up.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.340
He dropped out?

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.020
Mr. Pei,

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.740
we can't start filming now.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.780
We can't start filming?

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.470
Sibo.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.150
When are we starting production?

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.910
Sibo.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.020
Calm down, Sibo.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.780
There's no need

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.540
to put all our eggs in one basket.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.260
If he can't come,

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.950
we'll switch male leads.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.670
We can't, Mr. Pei.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:58.540
We can't?

00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.740
There's no one left.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.990
If we replace him,
it'll be a completely new face.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.150
New faces are great.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.950
That's great.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.260
Who says unknown actors
can't attract viewers?

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.780
Acting skills are what really matter.

00:33:11.702 --> 00:33:14.020
I actually have a promising candidate
with big dreams.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:14.670
Who?

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.870
The one who pitched himself
at DreamForge Capital.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:17.740
His name is Shi Huo.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.540
Shi Huo?

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.780
He's not famous

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.060
and hasn't done any serious roles.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.710
But at least he won't try
to rewrite the script.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.230
What's the female lead's name again?

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.870
Mo Shan.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.300
Would she be willing to act with him?

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:29.950
Yes.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.870
Definitely.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:31.390
Listen.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.430
After what happened
with that frigging Lu Zhiyao,

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.430
Mo Shan texted saying

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.635
she'd even act with me as the made lead
if she had to.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:40.670
Then it's settled.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.630
Shi Huo it is.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:43.780
Everything

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.470
is the best possible arrangement.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.500
Sibo,

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.020
your hair

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.150
and that beard

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.230
need some trimming.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.870
You look like a caveman.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.740

Please process it.)

(Instant Order)

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.060
I need to be somewhere else.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.670
I'll get going.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:02.230
Alright.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.660
When did so many people get here?

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.940
(Shenhua International)

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.910
(DreamForge Capital)

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:14.950
New face?

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.620
How new is he?

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.540
Director,

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.390
to be honest, I've never seen him.

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:24.270
I heard from Mr. Ma,
he's extremely unknown.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.102
Like no one knows.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.060
Will it work?

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.220
I don't know.

00:34:28.946 --> 00:34:30.580
Hello, Director Zhuang.
Hello, Mr. Huang.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.140
Mr. Ma.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.990
This actor

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:34.270
is here to audition
for the male lead role.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:35.580
Shi Huo.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.270
Which one?

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.910
Hey.

00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:42.790
Where is he?

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.020
Uh...

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.180
Okay.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.180
Stop. That's enough.

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.270
Very good.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.140
Well, mister,

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.830
could we have a word?

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.100
On stage, please.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.220
Hello, sirs.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:06.620
Everyone.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.180
Over here.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.430
And those in the distance.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.470
Hello, everyone.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.700
My name is Shi Huo.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.620
My dream is to be truly famous.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.140
I want everyone to know

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.620
that I am an actor.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.750
Please remember my name.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.180
Shi Huo!

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.140
Good. Very good.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:25.660
Excellent.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.660
Please begin.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.350
Okay.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.700
Director,

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.750
what should I do?

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.100
Just do a random bit.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:33.990
No problem.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.020
What is this supposed to mean?

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.220
I'm holding a horse.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:55.910
Anything else?

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:56.660
Yes.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.140
And this one?

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.830
I'm lifting the curtain,

00:36:06.946 --> 00:36:08.470
waiting for the princess to step up.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:10.950
Anything else?

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.470
I have a more emotional performance.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.750
Let me get into the mood.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.950
Does he need that long?

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.500
You can start.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.390
I'm done, Director.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.580
What is this scene about?

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.270
I'm standing with ten thousand soldiers,

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.660
watching the protagonist leave.

00:36:50.443 --> 00:36:52.140
Any other candidates here?

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:54.270
Director,

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:57.700
maybe you should talk to Lu Zhiyao again.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.140
Well done.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.830
Very well done.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.060
You're cast.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:11.180
Director,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.620
did I hear that right?

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.700
Are you serious?

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.220
You're the next Lu Zhiyao.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.180
You'll be even more famous.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.180
Shi Huo. Truly famous.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.310
I'll report to Mr. Pei.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:40.950
Hello?

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:42.310
Did you order a designated driver?

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.220
Please wait a moment.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.140
I'm 500 meters away.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.430
Designated driver?

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.180
What?

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.430
What the heck is all this?
