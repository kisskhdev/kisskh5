00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:02.132
(Child actors were accompanied by a guardian...)

00:00:02.132 --> 00:00:03.832
(and filmed in a safe, supervised environment.)

00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:05.632
- You know what this is? - Let go.

00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:08.572
- Let go. - You wanted proof? Here it is!

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:09.642
Hurry up and take a picture.

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:11.672
My gosh, this is ridiculous. Let go of my phone.

00:00:11.742 --> 00:00:12.942
- You think this scares me? - My!

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.012
Let go, you jerk.

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:15.512
I can't believe you pulled this. Seriously.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.582
I'm an expert. I can tell everything just by holding your wrist.

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:20.952
- Let go of it! - What's this commotion so late?

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:25.952
Officer, these people are trying to forcibly take our property.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:30.622
Your wife posted my picture online and started a rumour about an affair!

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:34.732
- Listen, that's... - Wait. Let go, then we'll talk.

00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:38.102
The definitive proof is on this phone.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:40.602
We're pressing defamation charges. Got it?

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:43.872
My gosh! Please. Go right ahead. We'll counter-sue for false charges.

00:00:43.872 --> 00:00:45.242
- Do it. Go for it! - Goodness.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.312
- Can you shut your trap? - False accusations?

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:48.682
- You let go first! - Unbelievable.

00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:50.012
- You take your hands off. - Hey!

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:51.312
Seriously, why you...

00:00:54.152 --> 00:00:57.352
All right, I'm taking all of you in. Let's go to the police substation.

00:00:57.422 --> 00:01:01.052
- The substation? Why us? - But they're the ones at fault.

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.222
Why are you taking us in, too?

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:07.492
Possible assault, attempted robbery. If you refuse to cooperate,

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:10.062
I'll have no choice but to place you under arrest.

00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:21.342
I'm telling you, the proof is on that phone!

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:25.752
- Are you sure? - That's why they fought so hard.

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:27.412
Ma'am, let me see the phone.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.682
- Excuse me? - I just need to check it.

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:33.192
If you continue to refuse, you'll only make things worse.

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:44.832
(Police, Information)

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.532
(Respect for Human Rights, Fairness, and Kindness)

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:54.212
- What? - What's wrong?

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:55.512
The photo...

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.342
- It's not here. - What?

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.452
That's impossible.

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:03.222
- Keep scrolling. - Yes.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:06.152
It's really not here.

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:10.262
All I see are pictures of food, flowers, and landscapes.

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:11.922
See? He said it's not there.

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:14.192
He says it's not there.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:16.132
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?

00:02:17.102 --> 00:02:19.272
I am absolutely speechless.

00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:21.602
But you were in Seoul today!

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:23.502
Weren't you?

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:26.372
I'm way too busy to have gone to Seoul.

00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:29.242
What? Do you want me to prove my alibi?

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:32.582
Honey, she said she didn't go.

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:38.282
- I'm telling you. I saw her. - You're wrong. You have bad eyes.

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.422
Actually, that happens to me from time to time as well.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.732
I know you want to blame someone, but honestly.

00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:48.262
You can't just gang up on people like this.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.062
Part of me wants to demand an apology,

00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:53.632
but let's just leave it at that.

00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:58.072
Officer, are we free to go now?

00:02:58.372 --> 00:02:59.672
Yes, you may go.

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:01.712
Have a good night.

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:03.012
Unbelievable.

00:03:04.442 --> 00:03:05.452
Let's go.

00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:15.762
His family and my family...

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:18.292
are sworn enemies.

00:03:18.892 --> 00:03:21.162
It's a blood feud passed down through generations.

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:26.472
I see.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:30.272
Anyway, what's your real Korean name?

00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:33.642
My name.

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:36.112
My name is...

00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:38.382
Yang...

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:42.922
Yang, I know that much. What comes after?

00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:49.722
Hold on a second.

00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:51.462
Honestly.

00:03:52.192 --> 00:03:53.232
Woo Jae? What is it?

00:03:55.232 --> 00:03:56.232
What?

00:03:57.432 --> 00:03:58.532
What about Mom?

00:04:00.802 --> 00:04:02.642
Okay, I'm on my way now.

00:04:03.772 --> 00:04:07.442
Sir. Something urgent has come up, and I have to go.

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:08.712
- I'm really sorry. - What?

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.382
Darn it.

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:18.582
- You're back. - Yes.

00:04:18.582 --> 00:04:19.992
Se Ri.

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:23.062
Se Ri, you're the one who posted that photo, right?

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:25.792
My goodness, Dong Suk. What an awful thing to say.

00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:29.332
Come on. I know it was you. Why hide it from me?

00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:33.002
Don't you dare repeat that. Don't breathe a word of this, okay?

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:35.742
My goodness.

00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:40.142
What are you talking about, Auntie? What picture did my stepmom post?

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:42.242
- I don't know. - Auntie!

00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:44.582
Didn't you hear him? I'm not supposed to breathe a word.

00:04:46.282 --> 00:04:47.582
Good grief.

00:04:48.082 --> 00:04:49.922
What's so interesting on that darn phone of yours?

00:04:50.182 --> 00:04:52.792
Go to your room. Can't you read the room?

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.952
- Auntie. - I told you, I don't know.

00:04:55.352 --> 00:04:56.362
Seriously...

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:02.532
That was a close call.

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:06.472
I know. If I hadn't deleted it, we would've been in real trouble.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:09.072
I never imagined she would have seen me.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.942
Those people can never find out you were behind this.

00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:14.672
Don't worry. She'll just think she was seeing things.

00:05:15.742 --> 00:05:16.742
By the way...

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.912
Was the studio apartment you were getting for Hyun Bin near there?

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:23.282
Yes, it looks like her clinic is in that area, too.

00:05:30.392 --> 00:05:32.122
When on earth are you going to tell her who you are?

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:36.632
I don't know. I'm not sure I even need to.

00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:39.472
I'm leaving in one year anyway.

00:05:39.732 --> 00:05:41.832
Didn't you plan on seeing her at all when you came back to Korea?

00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:46.142
I thought of seeing her from afar. Like during my military service.

00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:49.612
But you met her like this,

00:05:49.612 --> 00:05:51.612
and you even asked to move her to your office.

00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:56.552
I told you. I didn't have some ulterior motive.

00:05:57.052 --> 00:05:58.252
So, what's it like seeing her again?

00:05:59.052 --> 00:06:00.092
Do you still like her?

00:06:01.252 --> 00:06:02.262
It's just...

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:04.622
It's nice to see her, I guess.

00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:07.862
I had a childhood crush on her because she seemed so cool,

00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:10.732
but I doubt that'll happen now.

00:06:11.232 --> 00:06:13.602
We're just coworkers.

00:06:15.532 --> 00:06:17.142
You never know.

00:06:18.402 --> 00:06:19.742
You might fall for her again.

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:30.382
People are going wild, aren't they?

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:31.782
Of course, they are.

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:33.852
My husband had an affair and ran off.

00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:35.992
They all say I'm so unlucky because...

00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:37.622
my daughter-in-law is cheating, too.

00:06:38.222 --> 00:06:41.092
My gosh. People will say anything, won't they?

00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:44.362
I wouldn't feel so wronged if it were true.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.602
I know.

00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:49.572
Your husband is always in trouble and doesn't even make good money.

00:06:49.872 --> 00:06:54.112
You're so young and pretty. I wouldn't blame you for cheating.

00:06:54.312 --> 00:06:56.942
Mother! Someone will hear you.

00:06:59.182 --> 00:07:00.252
Ju Ah.

00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:02.322
Mom, are you really cheating?

00:07:03.082 --> 00:07:05.552
- Ju Ah. - Are you cheating? Answer me!

00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:06.592
Hey.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.922
Have you been drinking again? Will you be like this every day?

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:12.532
Don't deflect, and tell me straight. Are you having an affair?

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.162
Hey, seriously... Will you keep your voice down?

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:17.202
Hey, Ju Ah, go on inside. It's late. Hurry up.

00:07:19.802 --> 00:07:21.772
Where do you think you're going? I asked if you're having an affair!

00:07:22.002 --> 00:07:23.002
Oh, dear.

00:07:25.202 --> 00:07:27.442
No! I told you. I'm not!

00:07:27.712 --> 00:07:29.312
Then what's with that photo?

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.682
Do you know what people are saying in the comments?

00:07:31.942 --> 00:07:34.112
They say you're "Adultery Evangelist,"

00:07:34.112 --> 00:07:35.652
not "Love Evangelist."

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:39.452
- Why, you... - My goodness. Hey!

00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:40.852
Hey.

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:43.222
Why are you misunderstanding your mom like this?

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:46.462
What misunderstanding, Grandma? Where there's smoke, there's fire.

00:07:47.892 --> 00:07:49.202
You've always been like this.

00:07:49.562 --> 00:07:52.432
You said you only married Dad because of me, right?

00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:56.702
You ignored Dad, mistreated him, and yelled at him over small things.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:08:00.042
Now, you're rich and famous, so you decide to cheat?

00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:03.342
- Is this why you moved out? - Hey.

00:08:03.612 --> 00:08:06.052
No, wait. Mom...

00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:08.112
Are you even really living alone?

00:08:08.412 --> 00:08:09.422
Ju Ah!

00:08:11.422 --> 00:08:13.992
The whole world can misunderstand me and curse my name,

00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:16.922
but shouldn't you be the one person who trusts me?

00:08:16.922 --> 00:08:19.492
You never believed in me. Why should I?

00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:22.502
Hey, get inside. Now. Go on, get in there.

00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:25.032
Have you been drinking?

00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:26.702
Have you?

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:38.642
Really.

00:08:40.712 --> 00:08:43.482
Who on earth talks to their mother like that?

00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:46.792
What mother says such awful things to her own child?

00:08:47.192 --> 00:08:51.222
She always said she only married Dad because of me.

00:08:52.162 --> 00:08:56.902
Your mom was younger than you are when she said that.

00:08:57.502 --> 00:09:01.072
Why take to heart what she said when she was young and naive?

00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:02.942
Because it cut me to the core.

00:09:04.672 --> 00:09:05.842
Honestly, I just can't...

00:09:07.642 --> 00:09:09.012
Are you okay, Grandma?

00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:13.252
While your mother was raising you,

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:16.152
I was afraid she'd regret quitting her studies,

00:09:17.052 --> 00:09:21.352
so I insisted on raising you myself. I barely let her touch you.

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:25.862
And I wonder if that's why you never bonded with your mother.

00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:29.832
It breaks my heart every time you act like this.

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:32.402
I'm sorry, Grandma.

00:09:33.302 --> 00:09:35.002
I know, I was wrong.

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:39.872
Don't hurt your mom's feelings. You'll regret it later.

00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:42.842
I won't.

00:09:45.682 --> 00:09:48.182
- Get some rest. - Okay.

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:53.492
Gosh, seriously...

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.962
(Taehan)

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:10.642
Mom. I was too harsh yesterday.

00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:13.972
Sorry.

00:10:14.042 --> 00:10:15.342
(Mom, I was too harsh yesterday. Sorry.)

00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:16.582
No...

00:10:16.642 --> 00:10:17.742
(Mom, I was too harsh yesterday. Sorry.)

00:10:18.712 --> 00:10:21.652
What was so harsh about it? It's not like I was wrong.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.492
Sorry, I'm late. I had an executive meeting.

00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:31.822
Why? Because of the product review and budget?

00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:33.262
Did they shoot everything down?

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.492
Oh, well...

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:37.832
The design team meeting is about to start,

00:10:38.362 --> 00:10:39.632
so let's talk about it then.

00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:43.202
That's okay.

00:10:44.202 --> 00:10:46.042
I hope everyone got home okay last night.

00:10:46.842 --> 00:10:49.182
Yes. It's a shame we couldn't stay out longer.

00:10:49.942 --> 00:10:52.752
How about we party all night at the workshop next week?

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.782
- Yes, I love that! - Sounds great!

00:10:55.682 --> 00:10:57.952
And the proposal from yesterday...

00:10:57.952 --> 00:11:00.022
It was approved at the executive meeting today.

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:01.452
- Nice. - That's awesome!

00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:03.092
The product review proposal...

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:07.232
- and the budget increase? Both? - Yes. But...

00:11:08.392 --> 00:11:09.732
there's one condition.

00:11:10.862 --> 00:11:12.672
What's the condition?

00:11:13.832 --> 00:11:17.002
At the upcoming Korea Fashion Design Competition,

00:11:17.342 --> 00:11:18.702
we need to have a winning design.

00:11:19.042 --> 00:11:21.812
What? But isn't its deadline just around the corner?

00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:24.642
Gosh, we also have to prepare for the Hot Summer collection.

00:11:24.912 --> 00:11:26.912
So won't we be a little pressed for time?

00:11:27.952 --> 00:11:31.952
Use designs from your portfolios, past competitions, or reviews.

00:11:32.022 --> 00:11:33.752
I want you to use designs that were previously rejected.

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:38.322
Submit a design you're confident in by tomorrow. The final selection...

00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:43.032
will be made by an internal vote from employees in other departments.

00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:45.832
- Okay. - Got it.

00:11:46.432 --> 00:11:47.472
Right.

00:11:47.732 --> 00:11:51.172
The winning design will be publicly credited to the designer.

00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:53.642
- It'll be credited? - Yes.

00:11:53.642 --> 00:11:55.812
The designer's name will be on the label.

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.482
- Really? - For real?

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:00.552
My gosh. What should I submit?

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:02.252
What about your Metro Classic one?

00:12:02.352 --> 00:12:04.752
Where did I put it? Please tell me I didn't delete it.

00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:27.112
Is this one better?

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:37.882
Wow, everyone's in full-on competition mode.

00:12:38.752 --> 00:12:41.752
I bet no one's going home or getting any sleep tonight.

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:45.962
Is it really that big of a deal to have your name on your design?

00:12:46.862 --> 00:12:50.962
Sir, you really have no idea what you've started, do you?

00:12:51.032 --> 00:12:54.172
Not really. I thought it was only natural.

00:12:54.802 --> 00:12:58.542
I always wondered why clothes only have the brand name on them.

00:12:58.742 --> 00:12:59.912
That's exactly it.

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.282
You've acknowledged the designer's worth.

00:13:04.142 --> 00:13:05.482
Is that how it comes across?

00:13:06.582 --> 00:13:09.652
Why else are designers so desperate to have their own labels?

00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:12.792
It's just a shame you don't realise...

00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:15.092
how truly exciting this is.

00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:18.622
I'll look forward to seeing your design, Ms. Gong.

00:13:18.922 --> 00:13:20.632
Yes. I'm looking forward to it, too.

00:13:22.032 --> 00:13:25.902
I'll design one with my name on it and have my grandma wear it.

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:30.072
I'll finally take my mom, who looks down on me, down a peg.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:31.242
Yes!

00:13:31.972 --> 00:13:33.272
Gosh, which one is better?

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.022
So, what's the update?

00:13:48.252 --> 00:13:50.862
For now, I've blocked the reporters' fact-checking calls.

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:53.392
So we're not going to issue a counter-statement?

00:13:53.992 --> 00:13:55.832
No, I mean, no articles have been published yet.

00:13:56.162 --> 00:13:57.502
And it's not even true.

00:13:57.802 --> 00:13:59.832
If we put out a statement now, it'll just exaggerate the situation.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:03.272
Hey. What about the contract that's on hold?

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:07.812
Oh, one of our writers had an idea for you and Jeong Han.

00:14:07.872 --> 00:14:10.082
We could film some content of you two getting along...

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.712
and use that to open the show.

00:14:14.682 --> 00:14:18.752
We are getting along fine. We just see each other on weekends.

00:14:18.982 --> 00:14:20.492
Yes, I know. I get it, but...

00:14:20.822 --> 00:14:23.362
we have to think about the viewers. That's why we should do it.

00:14:23.622 --> 00:14:26.962
They believe whatever they see. Just look at what's happening now.

00:14:29.862 --> 00:14:31.802
I hadn't considered that.

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:35.532
- Hello. Vote for number two! - Hello.

00:14:35.632 --> 00:14:38.072
- Hello. We're with Gong Jeong Han. - Hello.

00:14:38.142 --> 00:14:39.742
- We're counting on your vote! - For Candidate Number Two!

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:41.442
- Hey, Dae Han. - Yes, sir?

00:14:41.512 --> 00:14:45.842
Gong's wife, the TV doctor. I heard she had an affair?

00:14:46.512 --> 00:14:48.682
What? Who told you that? Who? That's not true!

00:14:48.752 --> 00:14:50.482
I'm very disappointed.

00:14:50.582 --> 00:14:53.922
I'm not voting for Dr. Gong.

00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:56.362
No, I'm telling you it's not true! Sir, please.

00:14:56.422 --> 00:14:58.762
Seriously, that's not what happened, everyone.

00:14:58.822 --> 00:15:03.402
But I heard people say Dr. Gong is going to drop out of the race.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:04.402
That's not true!

00:15:04.402 --> 00:15:05.902
- Who's behind these crazy rumours? - What?

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:08.132
Uncle, look.

00:15:11.972 --> 00:15:16.642
There she is. The source of these vicious rumours.

00:15:18.812 --> 00:15:20.112
I'm telling you. It's true.

00:15:20.412 --> 00:15:23.552
Everyone in Onjeong Market knows Dr. Gong's wife is cheating...

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:26.082
You evil-tongued gossip! I will be sure...

00:15:26.152 --> 00:15:27.952
- to teach you a lesson today. - Hey!

00:15:27.952 --> 00:15:28.992
Hey.

00:15:29.052 --> 00:15:30.322
What are you doing here?

00:15:32.322 --> 00:15:34.492
- I will shut you up for good today! - Let go!

00:15:34.732 --> 00:15:37.032
Hey! You're disgusting!

00:15:37.362 --> 00:15:38.932
What are you talking about? I didn't spread any rumours.

00:15:39.002 --> 00:15:42.272
It was you! You're the one spreading lies!

00:15:42.332 --> 00:15:44.902
What lies? I'm just saying what's in the photo.

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:46.342
- It's real? - It's real.

00:15:46.442 --> 00:15:48.872
Who would take such a photo and post it online?

00:15:49.142 --> 00:15:51.382
Yes, I wonder who could have done such a thing.

00:15:52.482 --> 00:15:54.612
- My stepmom did it. - What?

00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:57.182
So go ahead and sue her! I'll be the witness.

00:15:57.252 --> 00:15:58.882
Hey. Stop talking nonsense.

00:15:58.882 --> 00:16:00.622
It'll be chaos if the adults believe you.

00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:03.462
I'm telling you, it's true! For the doctor falsely accused,

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.092
I'm making a noble sacrifice.

00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:11.002
My gosh. Am I not like a tragic princess?

00:16:11.202 --> 00:16:14.932
You know... Who was it? The one who betrayed her father...

00:16:15.002 --> 00:16:17.502
- and chose love instead. - Princess Nakrang?

00:16:17.772 --> 00:16:20.012
My, so she was a princess?

00:16:20.242 --> 00:16:23.112
No wonder I felt such a kinship with her.

00:16:23.742 --> 00:16:27.382
Hey, Woo Jae! Call Dr. Han already!

00:16:27.452 --> 00:16:29.922
Why don't you believe the words of a princess?

00:16:49.572 --> 00:16:52.072
It seems Woo Jae really doesn't believe me.

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:54.412
In that case...

00:16:54.872 --> 00:16:56.982
I'll just have to take matters into my own hands.

00:16:59.882 --> 00:17:01.212
Sorry, who did you say this was again?

00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:04.452
Woo Jae's girlfriend?

00:17:06.082 --> 00:17:07.752
Woo Jae doesn't have a girlfriend.

00:17:08.722 --> 00:17:09.722
Who is this?

00:17:11.362 --> 00:17:13.232
Oh, Yang Dong Ik's daughter?

00:17:14.062 --> 00:17:15.292
What's this about?

00:17:16.162 --> 00:17:19.772
This is a very urgent matter, so I decided to call you directly.

00:17:20.102 --> 00:17:23.772
After all, whatever concerns you is my business, too.

00:17:25.102 --> 00:17:29.512
Dr. Han, about my stepmom, she really did go to Seoul.

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:31.342
What did you just say?

00:17:31.642 --> 00:17:34.912
I'm saying, she went to Seoul to find an apartment for my brother.

00:17:37.152 --> 00:17:40.422
You little brat! What do you think you're doing?

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:43.692
What? I'm just doing the right thing!

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.702
This is driving me crazy.

00:17:55.372 --> 00:17:57.572
And she had the nerve to play dumb?

00:17:58.402 --> 00:18:01.042
Wait a minute. The coffee shop.

00:18:02.712 --> 00:18:04.512
Why didn't I think of that?

00:18:06.782 --> 00:18:09.652
- Honey. - You're back? And your patients?

00:18:10.652 --> 00:18:13.292
Hey, what's going on, everyone?

00:18:13.422 --> 00:18:17.422
Here, let's all watch this. I got it from the coffee shop.

00:18:27.772 --> 00:18:28.772
What is this?

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:31.142
What's this?

00:18:36.512 --> 00:18:39.752
- What? - My goodness. Who is that?

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:40.982
Unbelievable.

00:18:41.382 --> 00:18:42.382
- What the... - No way.

00:18:44.452 --> 00:18:45.452
What?

00:18:46.922 --> 00:18:48.492
- Unbelievable! - Oh, my word.

00:18:49.352 --> 00:18:51.322
- That's... - Good grief!

00:18:51.962 --> 00:18:53.592
Who is that?

00:18:53.692 --> 00:18:56.562
Mom, what do you mean, who? It's Bucket's wife.

00:18:56.962 --> 00:18:59.832
So after all this, that woman just played dumb?

00:19:00.132 --> 00:19:02.902
See? I told you there was no way I was mistaken.

00:19:02.902 --> 00:19:07.142
My goodness. How could she? She's got some nerve, hasn't she?

00:19:07.612 --> 00:19:09.682
- That jerk! I ought to... - Hey!

00:19:09.682 --> 00:19:11.712
- Jeong Han. - Dad!

00:19:11.712 --> 00:19:14.712
- Jeong Han. - Mom! We can't let this go, can we?

00:19:14.852 --> 00:19:16.682
I am absolutely not letting this slide!

00:19:16.952 --> 00:19:19.582
Of course. We can sue her for this, Mom.

00:19:19.582 --> 00:19:20.752
- This is a lawsuit. - Yes!

00:19:22.192 --> 00:19:23.522
What should I do, Mother?

00:19:24.092 --> 00:19:25.662
I'll do whatever you say, Mother.

00:19:34.002 --> 00:19:35.002
Welcome.

00:19:44.742 --> 00:19:47.512
I figured you wouldn't want coffee this late,

00:19:47.782 --> 00:19:49.312
so I ordered tea instead.

00:19:50.852 --> 00:19:52.582
I assume you know why I asked you to meet.

00:19:53.722 --> 00:19:54.722
Yes.

00:19:56.092 --> 00:19:58.392
When I found out that Eun Bin had spoken to you,

00:19:58.592 --> 00:20:02.032
I called the coffee shop to try and smooth things over,

00:20:02.662 --> 00:20:07.372
but they said you'd already checked the CCTV footage.

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:12.872
- I was taking the CCTV to the cops. - Dr. Han, please.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:16.542
I may be sitting here right now,

00:20:16.912 --> 00:20:20.312
but in your mind, please picture me on my knees.

00:20:21.312 --> 00:20:22.312
Excuse me?

00:20:23.052 --> 00:20:26.522
If I were to actually kneel here, everyone would stare,

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:29.222
and that would put you in an awkward position, Dr. Han.

00:20:31.192 --> 00:20:32.462
What game are you playing?

00:20:32.562 --> 00:20:36.562
I am truly, sincerely sorry, Dr. Han.

00:20:36.632 --> 00:20:37.732
Sorry for what?

00:20:38.502 --> 00:20:40.002
For taking that photo and posting it,

00:20:40.532 --> 00:20:43.032
for deleting it to destroy the evidence,

00:20:43.142 --> 00:20:46.072
for tarnishing your reputation,

00:20:46.942 --> 00:20:49.442
and for nearly destroying your career.

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:51.142
At least you know what you did.

00:20:52.782 --> 00:20:54.152
I just really...

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:59.422
wanted my husband to become Merchants' Association President.

00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:04.222
He could use it as a stepping stone to run for city council.

00:21:06.222 --> 00:21:07.992
As you know,

00:21:08.292 --> 00:21:11.432
I'm my husband's second wife.

00:21:11.932 --> 00:21:13.702
All the love his first wife couldn't give him,

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:17.342
I want to be the one to give it all to him.

00:21:18.642 --> 00:21:22.542
I suppose if you can justify your wrongful actions with a motive,

00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:25.512
you think it'll feel less shameful. Is that it?

00:21:27.482 --> 00:21:28.482
Pardon?

00:21:28.552 --> 00:21:32.622
People who disregard moral standards to satisfy their own desires...

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:37.792
rarely feel guilty, and their apologies aren't sincere.

00:21:39.862 --> 00:21:41.462
My goodness.

00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:44.732
Are you saying my apology wasn't sincere?

00:21:45.102 --> 00:21:48.332
No, that's not it. I'm completely sincere, Dr. Han.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:51.042
You're skilled at manipulating people's feelings,

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:55.272
and you're more angry you got caught than sorry for what you did.

00:21:56.882 --> 00:21:57.982
That's not true.

00:21:58.912 --> 00:22:02.452
I'm really not that complicated.

00:22:04.152 --> 00:22:08.422
First of all, I've taken down all the photos and the post.

00:22:08.622 --> 00:22:10.462
And if you want to sue me for damages,

00:22:10.692 --> 00:22:13.662
I'm prepared to offer you a generous settlement.

00:22:14.162 --> 00:22:15.392
Well...

00:22:15.592 --> 00:22:18.702
Is there anything else...

00:22:19.262 --> 00:22:21.032
you might want?

00:22:21.602 --> 00:22:22.732
Like...

00:22:23.402 --> 00:22:24.602
withdrawing from the race?

00:22:25.472 --> 00:22:27.142
Is that what you're hoping for?

00:22:28.812 --> 00:22:31.742
Don't withdraw from the race.

00:22:32.382 --> 00:22:35.652
Winning by default just isn't my style.

00:22:37.152 --> 00:22:38.152
Oh, my.

00:22:39.182 --> 00:22:41.022
Thank you so much, Dr. Han.

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:46.762
So, I guess that means...

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:49.562
we've settled things today, right?

00:22:52.532 --> 00:22:53.532
Thank you.

00:23:04.482 --> 00:23:05.942
You forgave her, Seong Mi?

00:23:06.182 --> 00:23:09.612
I know, right? You should've torn her hair out.

00:23:09.882 --> 00:23:11.582
Seriously, are you just going to let it slide?

00:23:12.122 --> 00:23:15.222
Then what? Sue her and start a war? We live in the same neighbourhood.

00:23:16.092 --> 00:23:17.092
You did the right thing.

00:23:17.762 --> 00:23:19.192
Yes. You did the right thing.

00:23:19.522 --> 00:23:22.262
- You're staying for dinner, right? - Yes.

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:27.672
Let's put this behind us and win fair and square.

00:23:28.072 --> 00:23:31.702
Wait, they're not playing fair, so why should we?

00:23:32.042 --> 00:23:33.172
I said to forget it, didn't I?

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:35.542
Woo Jae, spare me a minute.

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:37.882
Okay.

00:23:40.112 --> 00:23:42.852
I'm heading out. I'm going to go study for a bit.

00:23:42.912 --> 00:23:46.022
Honey, I'll come pick you up at the bus stop later. Okay?

00:23:48.592 --> 00:23:50.762
- Hey. - Yes.

00:23:54.732 --> 00:23:55.792
Jeong Han.

00:23:56.832 --> 00:23:58.362
Are you really going to play fair?

00:23:59.432 --> 00:24:00.432
No.

00:24:01.532 --> 00:24:02.532
I knew it.

00:24:03.002 --> 00:24:04.242
You're not going to let this slide, are you?

00:24:05.572 --> 00:24:07.912
- Of course not. - Right.

00:24:09.842 --> 00:24:12.312
- How dare they... - The nerve.

00:24:17.052 --> 00:24:18.052
Are you...

00:24:18.852 --> 00:24:21.622
- dating Yang Dong Ik's daughter? - What?

00:24:22.152 --> 00:24:23.592
No, Mom.

00:24:23.822 --> 00:24:26.862
This isn't the "You should study, not date" lecture.

00:24:26.932 --> 00:24:28.092
You're old enough.

00:24:28.792 --> 00:24:30.802
You can date whoever you want.

00:24:31.432 --> 00:24:32.502
Just not her.

00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:35.872
Did Eun Bin tell you? That her stepmom was behind this?

00:24:35.972 --> 00:24:38.402
And how messed up is that?

00:24:38.942 --> 00:24:40.772
Stay away from them, son. I mean it.

00:24:41.412 --> 00:24:43.242
That woman, Eun Bin's stepmother...

00:24:43.642 --> 00:24:45.782
Psychoanalytically speaking,

00:24:45.782 --> 00:24:47.852
her emotional responses are abnormal.

00:24:47.852 --> 00:24:50.522
To put it simply, she's a crazy witch.

00:24:51.352 --> 00:24:53.352
- Mom. - Don't you forget it.

00:24:53.452 --> 00:24:55.952
Seong Mi, I need a word with you.

00:24:56.692 --> 00:24:59.322
Yes, Mother! Remember what I said.

00:24:59.762 --> 00:25:00.832
Yang Eun Bin, you!

00:25:01.362 --> 00:25:03.332
Do you have any idea what you've done?

00:25:04.632 --> 00:25:06.332
And you just had to go tattle to Dad?

00:25:06.662 --> 00:25:10.842
Hey, how could you? I know you hate her, but come on.

00:25:11.172 --> 00:25:12.272
Aren't you one of us?

00:25:12.602 --> 00:25:16.312
Why wouldn't I be? She's the outsider, not me.

00:25:16.372 --> 00:25:18.882
- What was that, you little brat? - What? Am I wrong?

00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:20.152
Yang Eun Bin!

00:25:21.082 --> 00:25:24.582
Didn't I tell you I'd kick you out if you disrespected your stepmother?

00:25:25.082 --> 00:25:26.652
Dad, please, just go inside.

00:25:26.922 --> 00:25:29.222
I'll give her a stern talking-to, okay?

00:25:31.392 --> 00:25:33.022
Please go inside and get some rest, Father.

00:25:33.362 --> 00:25:35.092
We're just talking.

00:25:37.662 --> 00:25:40.372
Raise your voice one more time, and I won't let it slide.

00:25:43.172 --> 00:25:46.912
Happy now? Are you satisfied that the whole family is yelling at me?

00:25:47.772 --> 00:25:48.842
Unbelievable.

00:25:57.982 --> 00:25:59.822
Hui Gyeong? Birth control pills?

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:04.192
My gosh, I just don't understand. Why would she do that?

00:26:04.622 --> 00:26:06.992
Apparently, she doesn't want to have a baby.

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:11.432
What? Dae Han's wanted a baby for five years.

00:26:12.832 --> 00:26:14.402
That's what I'm saying.

00:26:15.632 --> 00:26:17.702
I was just so flabbergasted.

00:26:18.342 --> 00:26:20.772
You think it's about money?

00:26:22.212 --> 00:26:24.642
She said no. I already asked her that.

00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:26.512
There's no way that's true.

00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:30.382
She was asking me about every detail of my contract,

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.422
and she keeps holding it over me that they had to move in...

00:26:32.422 --> 00:26:34.152
because they gave me their security deposit.

00:26:36.622 --> 00:26:37.662
You think so?

00:26:38.392 --> 00:26:40.992
Maybe she's just saying no, thinking it'll make me uncomfortable?

00:26:41.732 --> 00:26:42.932
That's possible.

00:26:44.332 --> 00:26:46.032
Oh, boy.

00:26:52.372 --> 00:26:56.142
Mom, I'll drive you and take the bus back.

00:26:56.442 --> 00:27:00.412
Why not come to my studio tomorrow and bring my things back here?

00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:03.152
Your things? What for?

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:05.882
I'm moving back here.

00:27:06.382 --> 00:27:11.062
- I put my studio on the market. - What? Really?

00:27:11.222 --> 00:27:12.892
Seong Mi.

00:27:13.692 --> 00:27:15.192
Seong Mi, are you sure about this?

00:27:15.762 --> 00:27:18.802
The commute might be tough, but I'll manage.

00:27:19.402 --> 00:27:22.002
Hey, shouldn't you have talked to me about this first?

00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:24.742
And when have you ever talked to me about anything?

00:27:25.372 --> 00:27:27.772
I'll make sure to get every last thing.

00:27:28.572 --> 00:27:30.212
Hey, are you sure you'll be okay?

00:27:30.542 --> 00:27:32.412
My room will be too cramped. Right?

00:27:32.412 --> 00:27:34.412
And you need space to write your book.

00:27:36.252 --> 00:27:40.622
Dae Han, once the studio is leased, I'll give you the security deposit,

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:41.952
so you can start looking for a place of your own.

00:27:42.252 --> 00:27:43.452
For you and your wife to move into.

00:27:44.862 --> 00:27:48.092
- Our own place? - Yes. You're newlyweds, after all.

00:27:48.362 --> 00:27:50.962
It's been weighing on me that you moved in because of me.

00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:55.472
Once your room is free, I'll use it as my office.

00:27:56.302 --> 00:27:58.602
Seong Mi, is this really because of us?

00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:00.102
It's for a number of reasons.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:03.442
I'm tired of people thinking we're separated or something,

00:28:03.612 --> 00:28:06.212
and I think I need to get along better with Ju Ah.

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:08.752
I'm so sorry, Seong Mi.

00:28:09.752 --> 00:28:11.122
But I bet my wife will be thrilled.

00:28:13.952 --> 00:28:15.092
I don't know how to face you.

00:28:17.622 --> 00:28:18.662
Thank you,

00:28:19.992 --> 00:28:21.492
and you made the right choice.

00:28:22.792 --> 00:28:25.232
In a way, I'm kind of grateful to that family.

00:28:26.262 --> 00:28:28.702
I think we made the right call deciding to let it go, Dad.

00:28:29.072 --> 00:28:32.472
Grateful? I'm still furious with them. You know?

00:32:48.692 --> 00:32:50.502
What have you done?

00:32:51.032 --> 00:32:52.132
It wasn't us. What?

00:32:52.402 --> 00:32:55.932
- We didn't do it, Dad. - You pathetic fools.

00:32:58.802 --> 00:33:01.772
Tell her I am very sorry.

00:33:02.442 --> 00:33:03.672
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:33:05.582 --> 00:33:07.952
- Dad. - No, wait.

00:33:08.782 --> 00:33:11.852
Hey, when someone lets you off easy, you should know when to quit.

00:33:11.922 --> 00:33:14.192
Have you guys ever heard of playing fair?

00:33:14.922 --> 00:33:15.922
Hey.

00:33:16.552 --> 00:33:17.592
Did you do this?

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:20.632
No! You know I'm not a morning person.

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.492
- You did it, didn't you? - No, I didn't.

00:33:23.792 --> 00:33:25.932
Then who could've done it? Who?

00:33:26.032 --> 00:33:28.802
You don't really think I'd do this to my own face, do you?

00:33:28.872 --> 00:33:32.972
Exactly. What kind of lunatic would do that?

00:33:33.772 --> 00:33:35.712
Look at that poor guy's face.

00:33:36.542 --> 00:33:40.412
- All this for an election? Crazy. - Seriously.

00:33:40.412 --> 00:33:41.412
Let's go.

00:33:42.152 --> 00:33:43.152
Did you hear that?

00:33:48.522 --> 00:33:52.562
It wasn't me! I swear I didn't do it!

00:33:57.362 --> 00:33:58.832
Yes.

00:34:01.972 --> 00:34:03.032
Good morning...

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:52.622
What? What the...

00:35:01.162 --> 00:35:03.962
- Oh, you're... You're here. - Yes.

00:35:04.932 --> 00:35:06.102
Good morning.

00:35:06.662 --> 00:35:08.632
I can't believe it's so late already.

00:35:09.272 --> 00:35:11.042
What? Did you sleep here?

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:15.072
My commute is so long, it just felt like a waste of time.

00:35:15.072 --> 00:35:18.642
Gosh, aren't you working too hard?

00:35:18.642 --> 00:35:20.112
I should get a bed put in here.

00:35:22.782 --> 00:35:23.782
Your eyes.

00:35:26.122 --> 00:35:27.622
They're totally bloodshot.

00:35:29.352 --> 00:35:30.892
No. I'm fine.

00:35:32.092 --> 00:35:34.432
I got a whole two hours of sleep.

00:35:35.492 --> 00:35:36.862
I figured as much, so I brought you something.

00:35:42.302 --> 00:35:46.242
The line here is always long, right? Did you go right when they opened?

00:35:46.302 --> 00:35:49.172
You know my hobby is hunting down good food.

00:35:49.472 --> 00:35:51.582
I gave the design team some, too. Have some.

00:35:52.982 --> 00:35:56.652
Thank you so much. You're seriously the sweetest.

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.192
Thank you!

00:36:03.992 --> 00:36:05.992
- How about this? - This is nice.

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.902
Wow, it's visually stunning.

00:36:13.962 --> 00:36:17.702
I went with some bold colours, focusing on an oversized silhouette.

00:36:18.972 --> 00:36:20.202
That's very on-trend.

00:36:22.172 --> 00:36:24.212
Director Yang, you should come take a look.

00:36:25.112 --> 00:36:27.582
What do I know? I'm no design expert.

00:36:28.082 --> 00:36:30.822
But we need a customer's viewpoint. Please share your opinion, Director.

00:36:38.192 --> 00:36:39.262
Let's see.

00:36:40.892 --> 00:36:42.432
How do I put this...

00:36:44.732 --> 00:36:45.762
(Work order)

00:36:46.162 --> 00:36:47.532
If this were a meal,

00:36:49.402 --> 00:36:52.142
it'd be like a full-course dinner for breakfast.

00:36:54.112 --> 00:36:56.312
I guess I did get a little too ambitious.

00:36:56.642 --> 00:36:59.342
It does seem a little over the top.

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:05.122
- Is this your top pick, Mr. Park? - Yes.

00:37:05.852 --> 00:37:08.592
The shirring is meant to give it a feminine touch.

00:37:08.922 --> 00:37:12.192
- It's for functionality. - Right, but it's a little...

00:37:14.592 --> 00:37:15.762
How should I say this...

00:37:17.262 --> 00:37:18.532
Like a vitamin supplement?

00:37:19.232 --> 00:37:20.232
Excuse me?

00:37:20.562 --> 00:37:21.802
A vitamin?

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:25.272
You know it's good for you, but you're never excited to take it.

00:37:29.442 --> 00:37:32.812
Should I stop? My opinion doesn't matter anyway.

00:37:32.882 --> 00:37:34.482
Please take a look at mine too, Director Yang.

00:37:35.582 --> 00:37:36.582
All right.

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:42.892
Casual sweaters.

00:37:42.892 --> 00:37:45.422
The yarn adds a special touch, so it allows for great mobility,

00:37:45.492 --> 00:37:47.322
and it's stylish, too.

00:37:48.692 --> 00:37:50.392
It looks very practical.

00:37:52.302 --> 00:37:53.302
But...

00:37:55.972 --> 00:37:57.742
it's missing that "wow" factor.

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:01.042
- Excuse me? - Well, it's like...

00:38:02.372 --> 00:38:04.512
If I had to make another analogy,

00:38:05.882 --> 00:38:08.582
it's like a well-made rolled omelet.

00:38:09.482 --> 00:38:10.612
A rolled omelet?

00:38:10.752 --> 00:38:13.182
It's familiar and easy enough for anyone to make,

00:38:13.452 --> 00:38:15.492
so it feels more like an everyday side dish.

00:38:17.292 --> 00:38:18.762
A side dish?

00:38:18.992 --> 00:38:21.992
To serve this as the main course...

00:38:22.092 --> 00:38:24.832
Don't you think it's lacking that visual hook?

00:38:25.132 --> 00:38:26.132
What does everyone else think?

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:35.972
You're giving me a death glare, aren't you?

00:38:37.412 --> 00:38:39.142
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:42.452
That "It's not even your field. What do you know?" kind of look.

00:38:48.692 --> 00:38:50.322
Savage.

00:38:56.892 --> 00:38:58.002
You're misunderstanding me.

00:38:59.032 --> 00:39:00.032
Sure.

00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:02.202
Bring on the next one. This is getting fun.

00:39:03.302 --> 00:39:04.402
Ms. Kim So Hye.

00:39:11.012 --> 00:39:15.712
All right. I've uploaded everything and shared the voting link.

00:39:16.812 --> 00:39:18.522
Was my design really that bad?

00:39:20.152 --> 00:39:25.092
Not bad, just... A bit ordinary.

00:39:26.092 --> 00:39:28.092
I was so embarrassed I wanted to die.

00:39:28.462 --> 00:39:32.232
What about me? A vitamin? Seriously? That's not even food!

00:39:32.232 --> 00:39:35.232
An omelet? He and his precious "visual hook."

00:39:35.302 --> 00:39:37.372
An omelet? Seriously? Unbelievable.

00:39:38.072 --> 00:39:41.142
I'm never eating an omelet again. I can't even look at one now.

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:44.912
Gosh, just wait for the results of the Home Shopping investigation.

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:47.012
Then I'm transferring straight to the design team.

00:39:48.212 --> 00:39:50.922
What are you talking about? They're investigating that incident?

00:39:51.652 --> 00:39:52.652
The higher-ups are.

00:39:54.652 --> 00:39:57.352
Why do you look so flustered?

00:39:58.222 --> 00:39:59.222
Are you hiding something?

00:40:00.122 --> 00:40:02.062
No! Why would I hide anything from you?

00:40:02.432 --> 00:40:04.262
No, that's not it. It's just... I mean...

00:40:04.262 --> 00:40:07.232
I just never thought someone would've done it on purpose.

00:40:08.102 --> 00:40:10.002
Maybe it wasn't on purpose.

00:40:10.532 --> 00:40:12.072
Still, we have to find out, don't we?

00:40:13.402 --> 00:40:14.672
And if someone did do it on purpose?

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:16.412
What are you going to do then?

00:40:16.842 --> 00:40:18.112
What do you think I'll do?

00:40:18.612 --> 00:40:20.742
I'll kill them.

00:40:25.922 --> 00:40:26.922
Woo Jae. Hey, what's up?

00:40:27.752 --> 00:40:28.992
Yes. I'm coming home tonight.

00:40:29.592 --> 00:40:30.852
Really? In that case...

00:40:31.222 --> 00:40:33.692
On your way home, can you stop by Mom's studio and grab a book for me?

00:40:33.962 --> 00:40:36.562
- In the built-in closet. - She says it's in the closet.

00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:38.732
I moved all her stuff out, but I must have forgotten that.

00:40:39.862 --> 00:40:41.972
What are you talking about? Why would Mom move her things out?

00:40:42.332 --> 00:40:45.642
Well... She decided to move back home.

00:40:53.712 --> 00:40:56.882
She was so against living with us, so why give up her place?

00:40:57.482 --> 00:41:01.192
See? She had an affair. She got caught and is crawling back.

00:41:17.702 --> 00:41:18.802
What the...

00:41:19.342 --> 00:41:20.972
So she really was having an affair?

00:41:27.412 --> 00:41:28.452
Unbelievable.

00:41:30.182 --> 00:41:32.622
The nerve of this shameless jerk.

00:41:50.672 --> 00:41:52.042
You jerk!

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:57.312
You think that hurts? This hurts me more, you jerk!

00:41:58.982 --> 00:42:00.942
Hey! How dare you...

00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:09.522
Ms. Gong Ju Ah?

00:42:10.352 --> 00:42:11.362
Director Yang?

00:42:11.822 --> 00:42:14.862
- Wait, what are you doing here? - What are you doing here...

00:42:15.562 --> 00:42:16.562
My gosh!

00:42:17.362 --> 00:42:18.362
Oh, man.

00:42:19.002 --> 00:42:21.632
How did you even get in here?

00:42:21.732 --> 00:42:23.732
I used the passcode, of course. I...

00:42:25.102 --> 00:42:27.142
More importantly, what are you doing here?

00:42:27.302 --> 00:42:28.512
I just moved in.

00:42:28.572 --> 00:42:32.382
- What? This is my mom's apartment. - What?

00:42:32.682 --> 00:42:35.282
Wait, so you're the one who...

00:42:35.812 --> 00:42:40.652
So you're the new tenant. Right.

00:42:40.722 --> 00:42:43.292
Yes. I guess that's the situation.

00:42:44.592 --> 00:42:49.192
Oh, no. Director Yang, I'm really sorry.

00:42:49.732 --> 00:42:51.132
Hey, it's fine. Things like this happen.

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:54.032
No, it's not that. Your forehead...

00:43:00.042 --> 00:43:01.112
Oh, no.

00:43:07.242 --> 00:43:09.612
- Here you go. - Thank you.

00:43:14.222 --> 00:43:15.992
I know it was a misunderstanding, but still...

00:43:16.552 --> 00:43:18.322
Do you have to just start wailing on someone like that?

00:43:18.922 --> 00:43:22.192
You should have changed the passcode then.

00:43:22.862 --> 00:43:26.002
And to top it off, you just had to be showering.

00:43:26.332 --> 00:43:29.772
I was a mess from moving everything.

00:43:38.512 --> 00:43:42.812
But Director Yang, are you okay? Take an anti-inflammatory.

00:43:45.252 --> 00:43:49.692
Hey, be honest with me. You recognised me, didn't you?

00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:53.492
You did that on purpose, right? Because I saw your design...

00:43:53.962 --> 00:43:55.432
and said it looked like a rolled omelet.

00:43:56.862 --> 00:43:58.032
Of course not!

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:00.962
I'm telling you, I thought you were my mom's boyfriend.

00:44:01.432 --> 00:44:02.432
My gosh.

00:44:03.472 --> 00:44:04.572
Your mom's boyfriend?

00:44:05.802 --> 00:44:07.102
Oh, it's...

00:44:07.472 --> 00:44:10.442
Gosh, it's a personal matter. Please just forget I said anything.

00:44:11.112 --> 00:44:12.312
Right.

00:44:15.752 --> 00:44:20.082
So if your mom has an affair, you get mad at her for it.

00:44:21.222 --> 00:44:23.252
Couldn't it be your father's fault, though?

00:44:25.962 --> 00:44:28.692
Well... In any case,

00:44:28.692 --> 00:44:31.332
there's no excuse for cheating.

00:44:33.902 --> 00:44:34.902
I see.

00:44:37.032 --> 00:44:40.072
My mom also had an affair and left.

00:44:41.372 --> 00:44:42.442
So why was I...

00:44:43.072 --> 00:44:44.882
always so resentful of my father?

00:44:50.882 --> 00:44:54.382
Maybe because it's easier to blame the person who stayed behind?

00:45:34.122 --> 00:45:35.132
What's this?

00:45:35.392 --> 00:45:37.762
"As of today, I'm no longer your daughter."

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:39.332
"Eun Bin."

00:45:40.132 --> 00:45:41.372
Did Eun Bin run away from home again?

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:44.972
I called Hyun Bin on a hunch, and he said she's there.

00:45:45.272 --> 00:45:46.572
At the studio apartment Hyun Bin just moved into?

00:45:46.972 --> 00:45:47.972
Yes.

00:45:53.082 --> 00:45:56.452
- Hey, Gong Woo Jae! - You scared me. Have some manners.

00:45:56.852 --> 00:45:59.122
You should've explained things properly.

00:45:59.422 --> 00:46:02.852
I went to Mom's apartment and ran into the new tenant.

00:46:02.952 --> 00:46:05.362
- You did? - "You did?"

00:46:06.392 --> 00:46:09.832
And guess what? The new tenant is my director!

00:46:10.662 --> 00:46:13.562
- What a weird coincidence. - "A weird coincidence?"

00:46:14.732 --> 00:46:18.672
Hey. I hit my director, okay? I thought he was Mom's boyfriend!

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:22.112
- I smacked him right on the head! - You've got to be kidding me.

00:46:22.712 --> 00:46:25.712
Since when did Mom get a boyfriend? Seriously, what's wrong with you?

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:28.212
What do you mean? Mom's having an affair right now.

00:46:28.282 --> 00:46:29.752
Those photos caused a huge scandal.

00:46:30.782 --> 00:46:33.922
That was the herbal clinic lady's smear campaign to win the election.

00:46:34.852 --> 00:46:36.522
- What? - The woman from that clinic...

00:46:36.522 --> 00:46:38.992
is the one who took and posted Mom's photo.

00:46:39.092 --> 00:46:43.632
- Seriously? - She was caught and apologised.

00:46:45.132 --> 00:46:46.902
That woman is completely insane.

00:46:48.032 --> 00:46:49.072
Unbelievable.

00:46:52.372 --> 00:46:54.272
Our stepmom is out of her mind, isn't she?

00:46:54.542 --> 00:46:57.042
How could she take a photo like that in secret...

00:46:57.042 --> 00:46:58.842
and try to frame Dr. Han for an affair?

00:46:59.342 --> 00:47:00.982
So that's what happened.

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:05.022
- Stepmom was clearly in the wrong. - Right?

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:06.852
Seriously.

00:47:10.022 --> 00:47:11.792
Wait, what happened to your forehead?

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:13.262
This?

00:47:15.432 --> 00:47:18.432
I guess I took the fall for what our stepmom did.

00:47:19.562 --> 00:47:20.562
What are you talking about?

00:47:20.902 --> 00:47:22.502
Is something wrong with your brain?

00:47:22.872 --> 00:47:23.872
Gosh, you're so annoying.

00:47:26.502 --> 00:47:27.602
This is for the deposit.

00:47:28.472 --> 00:47:31.812
Use this to find a place and put down a deposit.

00:47:32.682 --> 00:47:37.082
I figured Mother would tell you I'm on birth control.

00:47:37.712 --> 00:47:40.852
You two don't keep secrets, after all.

00:47:42.752 --> 00:47:47.022
It's not my place to say, but you know Dae Han wants a child.

00:47:47.922 --> 00:47:52.232
And at your age, it might be hard to conceive.

00:47:52.802 --> 00:47:53.802
I know.

00:47:54.262 --> 00:47:58.472
Thank you for being so thoughtful. We'll start trying once we move.

00:48:00.102 --> 00:48:02.672
Okay, let's do that. Thank you.

00:48:03.372 --> 00:48:04.572
But one more thing...

00:48:05.982 --> 00:48:08.782
Can I get the rest of the money in cash, too?

00:48:10.012 --> 00:48:12.182
That's a lot of cash to handle, isn't it?

00:48:12.852 --> 00:48:13.852
Why cash?

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:16.022
You see,

00:48:16.222 --> 00:48:20.522
I love the feel of holding cash. It's for the landlord anyway,

00:48:20.622 --> 00:48:23.662
so I can just feel it in my hands until then.

00:48:24.332 --> 00:48:27.462
Honestly. That's a strange fixation to have.

00:48:33.102 --> 00:48:36.042
Hey, what's this? Why is this door locked?

00:48:37.312 --> 00:48:40.482
What? Why don't you just leave your things there...

00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:41.812
until Dae Han's family moves out?

00:48:42.082 --> 00:48:45.282
Did you just lock the junk in here because you were too lazy to clean?

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:48.082
No, that's not it. I put something important in there.

00:48:48.152 --> 00:48:49.152
Just leave it alone.

00:48:49.922 --> 00:48:51.292
It's your father's stuff, isn't it?

00:48:51.792 --> 00:48:53.962
After you made such a scene telling your mom to throw it out.

00:48:54.262 --> 00:48:56.762
Hey, don't tell Mom. Okay?

00:49:00.262 --> 00:49:04.272
The commercial area...

00:49:07.942 --> 00:49:10.312
My goodness, this is so long-winded.

00:49:11.212 --> 00:49:13.542
Put the last sentence at the start.

00:49:13.542 --> 00:49:15.812
Hit them with the main point first. Be straightforward.

00:49:16.052 --> 00:49:18.282
Conclusion first, then explain. It's easier for people to follow.

00:49:18.482 --> 00:49:21.892
Oh, man. Why are you helping me? I appreciate it.

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:24.352
I'm trying to be a supportive wife.

00:49:24.622 --> 00:49:27.162
Just as much as Bucket's wife is.

00:49:27.992 --> 00:49:30.262
Look at you holding a grudge. Goodness.

00:49:31.262 --> 00:49:35.372
I'll make sure you're elected Merchants' Association President.

00:49:35.702 --> 00:49:38.902
Because that would be the best revenge against her.

00:49:39.742 --> 00:49:40.942
Gosh, that's scary.

00:49:41.302 --> 00:49:43.772
Whatever you do, don't make that face on TV.

00:49:44.812 --> 00:49:45.812
Oh, right.

00:49:46.442 --> 00:49:48.282
You should do a TV segment with me.

00:49:48.782 --> 00:49:52.152
Director Song wants to air a segment of us getting along well.

00:49:52.452 --> 00:49:55.722
No, forget it. I'm not cut out for TV.

00:49:55.922 --> 00:49:57.292
But they're paying a lot.

00:49:57.952 --> 00:50:00.292
Don't tempt me.

00:50:00.722 --> 00:50:04.932
How about a premium secondhand ECG machine?

00:50:05.462 --> 00:50:09.032
Due to the burden of rent and rising labour costs...

00:50:09.202 --> 00:50:11.872
- Premium! I said premium. - The commercial district...

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:12.942
Honey. Premium.

00:50:13.172 --> 00:50:16.312
Fine, okay! Deal! You said premium, right?

00:50:17.812 --> 00:50:20.042
I've really been wanting a premium ECG machine.

00:50:20.842 --> 00:50:23.112
- That's right. - Okay, I'm in.

00:50:23.552 --> 00:50:25.652
All right. A premium ECG machine.

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:31.392
- I'm off. - Okay.

00:50:31.792 --> 00:50:33.962
Here. I know you like these, Seong Mi.

00:50:34.462 --> 00:50:38.562
Amazing. I always skipped breakfast. This is like paradise.

00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:43.472
Listen, from now on, you and Ju Ah should take turns driving.

00:50:43.972 --> 00:50:46.672
- Did Ju Ah come home last night? - Yes.

00:50:49.242 --> 00:50:51.472
- I'm off. - Gong Ju Ah.

00:50:52.042 --> 00:50:54.382
- Yes? - Take your mom's car.

00:50:55.612 --> 00:50:57.712
- No, I don't want to. - Hey!

00:51:16.002 --> 00:51:17.002
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

00:51:17.272 --> 00:51:18.702
I thought you were having an affair.

00:51:19.272 --> 00:51:22.342
A misunderstanding? It wasn't one. I am having an affair.

00:51:22.672 --> 00:51:26.242
I preach adultery, not love. So what?

00:51:26.312 --> 00:51:30.112
Come on, I'm apologising. Don't be petty. Forgive me already.

00:51:30.252 --> 00:51:33.082
- I have something important today. - I don't feel like it.

00:51:33.382 --> 00:51:36.252
Whether I forgive you or not is my call.

00:51:36.252 --> 00:51:37.392
Unbelievable.

00:51:37.692 --> 00:51:40.822
- You accepted Ms. Cha's apology. - I did. So what?

00:51:40.892 --> 00:51:43.062
Why would you forgive her? After she humiliated you like that.

00:51:43.132 --> 00:51:47.162
Suing her would've taught a lesson. Seriously.

00:51:48.062 --> 00:51:51.102
If I did that, wouldn't I be stooping to her level?

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:55.342
Your mother is a better person than that woman.

00:51:56.142 --> 00:51:58.212
Gosh, what a hypocrite.

00:51:58.642 --> 00:52:02.012
Forgiveness isn't hypocrisy. It's a way to free yourself.

00:52:02.382 --> 00:52:06.222
It's not for them, but to move on from your own anger.

00:52:06.282 --> 00:52:08.052
It's a decision you make for self-preservation.

00:52:08.722 --> 00:52:10.022
In psychology,

00:52:10.622 --> 00:52:13.322
they call it "forgiveness as maturity."

00:52:14.122 --> 00:52:16.432
It means forgiving is a sign of being mature.

00:52:16.962 --> 00:52:19.162
Gosh, I'm sick of this.

00:52:19.502 --> 00:52:23.432
By the way, I hear Bucket's son is back in Korea.

00:52:24.502 --> 00:52:26.702
Really? You mean Yang Hyun Bin?

00:52:26.972 --> 00:52:30.712
Yes. That woman was looking for a studio apartment for him.

00:52:31.112 --> 00:52:33.412
His office must be somewhere near my clinic.

00:52:34.582 --> 00:52:37.812
Then that must be close to my office, too.

00:53:01.002 --> 00:53:02.012
What?

00:53:03.012 --> 00:53:04.012
It's up.

00:53:05.642 --> 00:53:06.642
All right, everyone.

00:53:07.242 --> 00:53:09.682
Our submission for the design competition...

00:53:10.382 --> 00:53:12.922
Drumroll, please...

00:53:14.152 --> 00:53:16.922
It will be revealed in 60 seconds...

00:53:23.232 --> 00:53:24.232
Okay.

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:26.402
All right.

00:53:28.132 --> 00:53:30.132
Our final submission for the competition...

00:53:32.172 --> 00:53:34.772
is Ms. Kim So Hye's design.

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:36.512
Really?

00:53:37.142 --> 00:53:39.282
- Wait, me? - Yes.

00:53:39.582 --> 00:53:41.542
In second place, by a very narrow margin,

00:53:42.682 --> 00:53:43.682
is Ms. Gong Ju Ah.

00:53:44.552 --> 00:53:45.552
Oh, man.

00:53:47.152 --> 00:53:48.692
Congratulations, So Hye.

00:53:49.692 --> 00:53:51.862
Thank you all so much.

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:53.662
Hey, now.

00:53:54.392 --> 00:53:56.362
Laugh or cry. Pick one.

00:53:57.132 --> 00:54:00.402
Wow, your name will be on the label for next season's line.

00:54:01.002 --> 00:54:03.702
My dad is going to be so happy.

00:54:04.032 --> 00:54:07.102
I've always wanted him to wear something with my name on it.

00:54:07.942 --> 00:54:10.042
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

00:54:10.842 --> 00:54:14.712
Should we have So Hye take the lead on the competition project?

00:54:14.912 --> 00:54:17.912
Well, I'll handle the colourways,

00:54:18.012 --> 00:54:21.222
and it'd be great if you all could divide up the flats for each item.

00:54:21.482 --> 00:54:24.422
You're doing the sweater and pants? Should I take the outerwear then?

00:54:24.492 --> 00:54:26.962
Yes. Ms. Gong?

00:54:27.392 --> 00:54:29.332
If you wouldn't mind, could you run the DTP test...

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:30.392
on the outerwear fabric...

00:54:30.462 --> 00:54:32.532
and also source the trims and materials?

00:54:33.262 --> 00:54:34.262
Of course.

00:55:03.232 --> 00:55:04.232
Are you okay?

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:07.362
No, I'm not.

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:10.632
I'm not going to lie.

00:55:17.972 --> 00:55:18.982
Yes.

00:55:23.952 --> 00:55:25.282
I understand, Vice President.

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:31.422
Looks like they found the culprit in the Home Shopping incident.

00:55:32.522 --> 00:55:33.522
Let's go.

00:55:37.332 --> 00:55:39.062
Tell Mr. Park Jun Hyeok to come, too.

00:55:49.042 --> 00:55:51.942
You think someone really did this on purpose?

00:55:52.512 --> 00:55:54.142
I'm afraid so.

00:55:55.582 --> 00:55:56.582
Who?

00:55:57.412 --> 00:55:58.412
It can't be.

00:56:00.252 --> 00:56:01.252
They're saying it was Kim So Hye.

00:56:03.792 --> 00:56:07.162
A staff member said they saw her swap out the clothes that morning.

00:56:07.362 --> 00:56:10.962
If we start disciplinary action, I'm not sure how they will respond.

00:56:11.362 --> 00:56:12.802
If word of this gets out,

00:56:13.302 --> 00:56:15.302
it'll be a huge blow to our brand's image.

00:56:15.902 --> 00:56:19.502
You can't ask me to forgive her, can you?

00:56:20.542 --> 00:56:22.972
Ma'am, I'll accept the disciplinary action.

00:56:24.012 --> 00:56:25.012
What? Why you?

00:56:25.342 --> 00:56:27.282
Because I'm also responsible for mismanaging my team member.

00:56:28.112 --> 00:56:30.652
- Isn't that why you called me in? - No.

00:56:31.552 --> 00:56:33.552
I'm leaving the decision on Kim So Hye's disciplinary action...

00:56:34.482 --> 00:56:36.122
to the two of you team leaders.

00:56:38.152 --> 00:56:39.622
It's not my place to decide.

00:56:40.892 --> 00:56:42.762
I'll go with whatever Ju Ah decides.

00:56:51.402 --> 00:56:52.402
Why did you do it?

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:55.812
Have you held a grudge against me all this time?

00:56:56.242 --> 00:56:57.312
I'm sorry.

00:56:58.842 --> 00:57:00.582
I was just so desperate...

00:57:00.842 --> 00:57:02.682
Did you really think you'd get away with this?

00:57:03.652 --> 00:57:04.652
Yes.

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:06.922
What?

00:57:07.022 --> 00:57:11.322
I've never thought of you as being desperate, Ms. Gong.

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:15.662
That's why I honestly had no idea you were looking into it like this.

00:57:16.462 --> 00:57:17.762
I thought if something like that happened,

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:20.802
you'd just quit.

00:57:21.862 --> 00:57:22.932
Why?

00:57:22.932 --> 00:57:26.442
You didn't major in design, and you have a medical license.

00:57:27.102 --> 00:57:29.612
You could quit, and you'd be fine,

00:57:31.042 --> 00:57:32.682
but this is all I have.

00:57:33.942 --> 00:57:36.952
I am so sick and tired of hearing that.

00:57:37.982 --> 00:57:40.622
You don't know how hard I've worked so I wouldn't have to hear that.

00:57:41.282 --> 00:57:43.092
You people are unbelievable.

00:57:44.952 --> 00:57:47.122
So Hye, for me,

00:57:47.362 --> 00:57:50.192
becoming a designer wasn't a choice.

00:57:50.192 --> 00:57:52.102
I wanted to be a designer so badly...

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:54.162
that I gave up everything else for it.

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:58.332
- I'm sorry. - And "sorry" makes it okay?

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:03.812
Unbelievable.

00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:04.272
Ms. Kim So Hye.

00:59:04.932 --> 00:59:05.942
Yes?

00:59:13.442 --> 00:59:15.212
What was it you asked me to do earlier?

00:59:15.612 --> 00:59:17.982
The DTP test on the outerwear, and what was the other thing?

00:59:18.982 --> 00:59:21.052
- What? - Ju Ah.

00:59:21.322 --> 00:59:23.122
I can't remember what else you asked for.

00:59:24.592 --> 00:59:27.022
Sourcing the trim and materials...

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:30.192
Ms. Gong...

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:34.962
What are you waiting for? Are you going to work or not?

00:59:35.602 --> 00:59:38.472
Yes. I'll get right on it. I'll work my hardest.

00:59:48.012 --> 00:59:50.212
(Taehan)

00:59:50.382 --> 00:59:52.382
(Managing Director Pacundo Ignacio de la Cruz Yang)

00:59:58.252 --> 01:00:00.262
(Taehan Group)

01:00:05.832 --> 01:00:09.132
So you're leaving me here alone to go back to the design office?

01:00:09.902 --> 01:00:11.902
You don't need me anymore, Director.

01:00:14.842 --> 01:00:18.372
So what should I do with this place? A meeting room or design space?

01:00:19.212 --> 01:00:20.812
Whatever you think is best, sir.

01:00:22.312 --> 01:00:25.412
- I'm going to get going... - Why...

01:00:25.882 --> 01:00:28.382
did you let Kim So Hye off the hook? You should've just fired her.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.522
Then, as the competition's runner-up,

01:00:33.062 --> 01:00:34.922
the collection would've been released under your name.

01:00:37.132 --> 01:00:39.202
Because Kim So Hye's design was good.

01:00:40.362 --> 01:00:43.602
My design might not have even placed in the competition.

01:00:44.072 --> 01:00:45.432
It looked like a rolled omelet.

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:52.112
I made the decision for the sake of the team.

01:00:57.182 --> 01:00:58.612
Even so, if it were me,

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.852
I don't think I could've forgiven her.

01:01:03.892 --> 01:01:07.362
My mom was wronged very badly once.

01:01:08.362 --> 01:01:13.332
She forgave the one who defamed her and accused her of an affair.

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:16.702
I couldn't understand how she could forgive them.

01:01:17.772 --> 01:01:20.602
But then, my mom told me something.

01:01:21.472 --> 01:01:24.572
"Forgiveness is about freeing yourself."

01:01:25.312 --> 01:01:28.982
"It's not for the other person, but to escape your own anger."

01:01:29.182 --> 01:01:31.052
"It's a way of protecting yourself."

01:01:34.252 --> 01:01:35.552
She sounds like an amazing person.

01:01:37.352 --> 01:01:39.922
I know. And even though I can't stand her,

01:01:39.992 --> 01:01:42.692
I want to be just like her, which is ironic.

01:01:49.302 --> 01:01:52.242
- I should get going. - Okay.

01:01:52.872 --> 01:01:54.872
(Taehan Group)

01:01:58.812 --> 01:02:00.582
- Thank you. - Sure.

01:02:13.622 --> 01:02:15.192
Way to fall for her again, Yang Hyun Bin.

01:02:17.832 --> 01:02:19.162
I shouldn't be feeling this way.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:27.102
- Here you go, Mom. - That's enough.

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:32.882
All right, everyone. The election is finally upon us.

01:02:36.112 --> 01:02:39.452
You've worked harder than anyone, pounding the pavement on a budget.

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:41.282
Come on, it's not over yet.

01:02:41.282 --> 01:02:43.652
Let's make a final push this weekend.

01:02:43.792 --> 01:02:45.192
- Let's do it! - Let's do it!

01:02:45.252 --> 01:02:47.462
- Let's have a toast. - A toast!

01:02:47.522 --> 01:02:50.292
- Great idea. - I'll lead the toast.

01:02:50.762 --> 01:02:54.262
To Gong Jeong Han's victory!

01:02:54.262 --> 01:02:55.772
- To victory! - To victory!

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.772
Wait. You can do better than that!

01:02:58.902 --> 01:03:02.372
Come on! To Gong Jeong Han's victory!

01:03:02.442 --> 01:03:05.342
- To victory! - To victory!

01:03:05.412 --> 01:03:07.342
- Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!

01:03:11.712 --> 01:03:14.452
- Take small sips, okay? - Dad, this is so good!

01:03:17.122 --> 01:03:21.462
Dispatch, this is Mackerel. Do you copy? Over.

01:03:23.262 --> 01:03:26.732
We read you loud and clear. This is Cutlassfish, over.

01:03:27.632 --> 01:03:28.662
Roger that.

01:03:29.532 --> 01:03:31.632
(Information, How may I help you?)

01:03:31.702 --> 01:03:33.672
(We are here to help with anything you need.)

01:03:34.842 --> 01:03:36.812
Sector A, campaign routes are overlapping.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.042
Sector B, expecting heavy crowd congestion.

01:03:41.642 --> 01:03:45.012
I'm deploying to the final rally to prepare for any contingencies.

01:03:45.152 --> 01:03:46.752
Stay sharp out there.

01:03:50.152 --> 01:03:52.662

(Number 1 Yang Dong Ik)

01:04:39.202 --> 01:04:42.172
Hyun Bin, can I please just live with you?

01:04:42.372 --> 01:04:44.942
I don't want to live with my stepmom.

01:04:45.012 --> 01:04:47.382
She's doing the best she can.

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:50.282
Even when she makes bad decisions,

01:04:50.682 --> 01:04:53.882
I try to understand that she's doing it for our family.

01:04:54.952 --> 01:04:56.192
I don't understand her.

01:04:57.992 --> 01:05:00.992
Eun Bin. But you like her, don't you?

01:05:01.322 --> 01:05:05.162
You're scared of getting hurt because you like her so much.

01:05:05.232 --> 01:05:07.032
So you're pushing her away on purpose, right?

01:05:07.602 --> 01:05:09.802
No, you're wrong! What do you know, anyway?

01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:15.742
I hate you!

01:05:25.652 --> 01:05:26.652
There.

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:28.922
All done with the workshop prep.

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:32.292
I'm starving. What should I get?

01:05:33.522 --> 01:05:34.522
Pork cutlet?

01:05:35.592 --> 01:05:38.332
That pork cutlet place I went to with Yang Hyun Bin...

01:05:38.392 --> 01:05:39.732
I should go there. It's been a while.

01:05:43.302 --> 01:05:44.972
But wait.

01:05:45.602 --> 01:05:48.342
Yang Hyun Bin... He's back but hasn't even called.

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:52.372
And his office is nearby, I think. I wonder which apartment he's in.

01:05:53.342 --> 01:05:54.342
Hold on.

01:05:55.082 --> 01:06:00.052
Come to think of it, He and the director are so alike.

01:06:01.322 --> 01:06:04.222
Okay, let's see. First of all, they both have the surname, Yang.

01:06:04.552 --> 01:06:07.692
They both studied abroad, their families are similar,

01:06:08.362 --> 01:06:10.862
they live in an apartment near my office,

01:06:11.792 --> 01:06:13.902
and their parents' house is also near here...

01:06:14.702 --> 01:06:16.202
Pork cutlet is my absolute favourite.

01:06:17.502 --> 01:06:20.742
Right, and they both love pork cutlet.

01:06:21.042 --> 01:06:23.512
- What else... - You look strangely familiar.

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:26.612
He said I looked familiar, too.

01:06:27.542 --> 01:06:28.682
No way...

01:06:28.982 --> 01:06:30.812
Director, what's your Korean name?

01:06:35.052 --> 01:06:36.192
Yang Hyun Bin.

(Love Pork Cutlet)

01:06:47.362 --> 01:06:49.062
This place hasn't changed a bit.

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:56.742
- One pork cutlet, please. - Okay.

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.122
I've decided to study abroad.

01:07:13.292 --> 01:07:14.522
I promise I'll come back.

01:07:15.962 --> 01:07:17.392
Don't you ever forget me.

01:07:18.162 --> 01:07:20.802
Yes. I'll remember.

01:07:34.442 --> 01:07:35.512
Liar.

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.482
As if you were going to remember anyway.

01:07:45.122 --> 01:07:47.262
- Can I get some water, please? - Yes.

01:08:31.172 --> 01:08:33.872
(Recipe for Love)

01:08:33.942 --> 01:08:36.572
- I studied abroad and never called. - Why?

01:08:36.642 --> 01:08:38.512
Because we were never meant to be.

01:08:38.512 --> 01:08:40.282
What? Are your families feuding?

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:41.512
- Yes. - What?

01:08:42.512 --> 01:08:43.952
- One more time. - One more time.

01:08:44.012 --> 01:08:47.522
- We prescribe... - Love!

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:50.252
Hello, everyone.

01:08:50.322 --> 01:08:53.892
- Bucket's son had a crush on you. - You knew?

01:08:54.022 --> 01:08:57.062
Marriage is never something you get to decide for yourself.

01:08:57.862 --> 01:09:01.132
- We'll begin the election vote... - Move.

01:09:01.202 --> 01:09:03.602
for the 16th President of the Onjeong Merchants' Association.
