Chen.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.800
It's me, Wang Li.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.240
Can you lend me money one last time?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.400
Just…

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.960
Hello?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.030
Sorry, the number you dialed

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.350
is currently unavailable.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.440
Ali.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.430
You know my mom's condition.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.320
Her medicine can't stop.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.520
My salary…

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.950
Don't worry.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.000
I won't owe you life-saving money.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.900
(Mr. Wang: Old friend, let's meet tonight.)

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.660
(Mr. Wang: Old friend, let's meet tonight.)

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.780
(Pay Up)

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.870
It's a mess here.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.350
- I got it, I got it.
- It's fine.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.400
I'll have them clean up.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.960
Sit.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.760
I borrowed from a lot of people.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.790
You're the only one who helped.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.230
We were classmates.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.350
I know things haven't been easy.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.710
Your daughter got sick so young.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.120
I really had no choice.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.190
I didn't know what I should do...

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.030
Bai,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.520
you lending me the money

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.310
means saving my daughter's life.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.840
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.680
My daughter and I will be grateful forever.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.640
I get it.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.710
I really do.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.590
Look.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.470
But the surgery costs too much.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.750
I know.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.750
Bai, how much can you lend me?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.360
Just say it.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.310
I'll figure out the rest.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.150
Same as you.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.750
I'm tight on cash right now.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.800
What do you mean?

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.310
You said on the phone

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.430
it wouldn't be a problem,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.840
that you had a way?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280
Right.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.590
But saving your daughter

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.120
depends on you.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.630
On me?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.200
What do you mean?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.000
Lately, I've been thinking

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.470
about running a banquet business.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.150
You own a restaurant.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.470
We work together.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.000
If it goes well,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.800
not just the surgery,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.470
your daughter will be set

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680
for the rest of her life.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.280
You must be Yimo.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.430
You've grown so much.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.590
You're Mr. Bai, right?

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.870
I saw my dad's graduation photo.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.710
You were in it.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.590
(Graduation Photo)
It's written on the back.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.080
Bai Qiming.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.240
Yeah.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.560
I've been working

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.750
out of town these years.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.270
Just got back.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.000
I remember

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.310
you were only this much taller

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.310
than the table.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.000
And in the blink of an eye,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.800
you're such a big girl now.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.760
Yimo,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.310
I'm talking business with Bai.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.480
You head back first.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.430
We've covered everything.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.160
Nothing else.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.070
I won't disturb you.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.800
Seeing you both doing well

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.430
puts my mind at ease.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.440
Yimo,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.680
next time I'll treat your dad to dinner.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.950
You should come too.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.840
Hungry?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.460
I'll cook.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.560
I'm not hungry.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.790
Dad.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.190
Light bulb's out again.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.440
Dad,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.070
what was Mr. Bai

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.000
here for today?

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.510
You didn't look so good.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.310
Business disagreement.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.270
Normal stuff.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.830
It'll be resolved soon.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.910
Dad,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.800
I was too young before.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.270
I couldn't help.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.750
But now I'm grown.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.920
If there's anything,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.630
I can share the burden with you.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.480
My daughter really has grown up.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.960
But, hey,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
don't worry.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.040
I can handle it.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.310
Dad, I trust you.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.800
But you have to trust me too.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.360
I'm the one closest to you.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.510
You can tell me anything.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.870
About Mr. Bai,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.000
we were classmates,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.480
but we haven't seen each other in years.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.560
He left a long time ago

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.600
and suddenly came back.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.360
I really don't know him anymore.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.920
If you run into him,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.190
and he says anything to you,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.950
tell me right away.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.070
Sound him out for me.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.000
In business,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.120
even with old friends,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.430
you have to stay alert.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.150
Okay.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.310
But why would he look for me anyway?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.440
Dad,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.120
if you're this worried,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.480
I might as well not go anywhere.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.750
You can tie me to your belt

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.190
and watch me all day.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.960
Oh, by the way,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.000
Officer Tang came by the restaurant today.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.270
He seems to care about you.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.190
Dad, no.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.600
Officer Tang's helped me a lot.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.240
It's not what you think.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.000
Honestly, I think he's a good guy.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.600
He's a cop.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.390
With him around you,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.870
I feel at ease.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.200
I hope you spend more time

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.840
with him.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.280
Dad.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.710
Who is it?

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.120
- Who?
- Ali, it's me.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.550
Ms. Tong.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.390
Yimo.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.270
You made food for my dad again?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.790
It's for you.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.510
Your dad's just tagging along.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.480
I'll put it in the fridge.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.390
For breakfast tomorrow.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.230
Alright.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.840
You look tired.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.320
It's okay.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.320
Just busy at the restaurant.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.080
Dad's got secrets now.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.600
Nonsense.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.550
Dad, since your friend is here,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.670
I'll leave you to it.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.200
Stay.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.320
Your dad says

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.440
you've been helping

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.480
since you came back.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.550
Not a day off.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.080
This weekend,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.440
I'll take you shopping.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.560
Sure.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.600
But give me a couple days.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.670
You two chat.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.790
I'll go to my room.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.600
I won't disturb your 'alone time'.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.390
What alone time?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.510
Your daughter

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.390
is just like you.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.870
That she is.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.940
(Hongyun Restaurant)

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.160
Xiaoqian.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.750
Yimo, you're really back.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.800
Hello, Mr. Wang.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.120
Last month I saw someone on the street

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.270
who looked just like you.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.870
You were vague in your messages.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.270
What did you want to talk about?

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.790
Don't just stand out here,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.840
come inside and talk.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.390
I'll go ahead.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.000
Yimo, I...

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.120
Let's talk inside.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.080
Okay.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.800
Sit.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.800
What's wrong?

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.030
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.150
I got scammed.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.030
Days ago, I was setting up my livestream,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.390
and there was an order.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.600
The buyer was from the south.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.360
We chatted.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.280
And then…

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.150
What happened?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.390
He said my DIY jewelry looked great

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.390
and wanted me to supply

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.360
so he could distribute.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.360
The order size was huge.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.840
I wanted to turn it down.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.200
But he just

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.120
sent the deposit right away.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.390
I thought

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.080
it was a stable way to make money.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.200
So I accepted.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.910
That sounds good.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.080
He paid.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.000
You just fulfill the order.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.150
I got excited

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.790
and ordered materials

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.960
and paid everything upfront.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.030
When I checked the backend this morning,

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.390
it was canceled.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.430
He didn't even want the deposit.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.630
He vanished.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.960
Did you call the police?

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.510
I did.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.120
They said

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.720
the account was overseas

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.120
and already shut down.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.320
No way to track him.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.440
How much did you order?

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.120
Over 200,000.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.840
Some of it was borrowed.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.390
That was all the money I had.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.390
And I've spent it all.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.870
Can't you refund online orders?

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.030
It's been a short time,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.720
you should be able to return it, right?

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.590
Normally yes.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.000
But I contacted

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.360
my suppliers privately.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.390
We've worked together for years.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.960
It was cheaper than online.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.510
When I asked

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.790
for refunds this morning,

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.600
they refused.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.600
The police said

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.360
it was a legal transaction.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.150
Nothing they could do.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.790
That was careless.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.030
You should never

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.550
transfer money privately.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.550
I didn't want to.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.200
I just wanted to make money.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.270
Who knew I'd meet a scammer?

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:29.600
I'm sorry.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.910
I didn't mean it like that.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.080
I'll think of a way.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.510
We'll solve it.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.390
Did you tell your family?

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.870
I was too scared.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.870
My dad's been sick for years.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.240
There's no money at home.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.030
That's why I was so desperate

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.270
to make money.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.390
I even took online loans for the materials.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.270
Yimo, help me.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.550
I just got back.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.030
I don't have money either.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.120
You gotta help me figure it out.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.360
I'm really out of options.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.030
I don't know who else to turn to.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.720
Don't worry.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.200
Let me think.

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.270
I do have an idea.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.240
But...

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.360
Don't "but".

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.750
Just tell me.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.120
I have a classmate.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.240
He might have a powerful brother.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.270
I need to ask first.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.000
That works.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.150
Please ask him.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.240
As long as it gets solved,

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.550
I'll thank him any way I can.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.360
Okay. I'll call him.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.630
Is this the place?

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.200
Let's go.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.750
You're here. Have a seat.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.510
Yimo?

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.560
Hello, Li Xu.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.600
Xiaoqian?

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.750
Yes.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.390
How did this happen?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.960
You actually got scammed?

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.630
You know,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.550
I hate scammers more than anything.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.000
At a time like this,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.910
there are still people pulling this crap.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.870
Don't worry.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.630
Since the call came to me,

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.240
I can't just ignore it.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.750
You're here now.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.870
Put your hearts at ease.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.030
Tonight's on me.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.630
We'll have a simple meal.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.240
Calm your nerves.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.240
Still scared?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.390
Don't be.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.750
Once it's with me,

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.440
it's not a problem.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.510
Relax.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.320
Thank you.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.630
We'll repay you little by little.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.120
What are you talking about?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.790
You're very welcome.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.120
You don't need to.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.630
Make yourselves at home.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.790
Come, have some tea.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.630
Thanks.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.440
Excuse us. We'll have a quick word.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.840
Sure.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.030
You've already helped me a lot.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.750
I'll handle the rest.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.880
You should go.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.240
I'll stay with you.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.440
It doesn't feel safe here.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.280
You go first.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.390
I'll stay for dinner

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.550
and talk things through.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.360
Sorry, Li Xu.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.390
My friend don't want to trouble you.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.320
She's not staying for dinner,

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.510
and her dad wants her home tonight.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.390
How about I stay and eat with you?

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.360
- What do you say?
- That's fine.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.670
You can just say it openly.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.960
If you both have things to do,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.890
you can leave.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:00.820
We'll meet another day.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:01.960
No, I'm fine.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.200
Li Xu,

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.200
I'll walk my friend out

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.510
and come back.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.760
Alright.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.270
Thank you, Li Xu.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.200
It's the shopping street challenge.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.510
Put your hands up.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:27.590
Alright, guys.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.830
This is Dalong and Xiaohu.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.880
Yeah, just the two of us.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.790
Got a fan here.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.880
Hey everyone, hit follow.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.720
(Dalong and Xiaohu)
Follow us.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.790
- Live streaming?
- Yeah.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.000
Family, got gifts? Send gifts.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.640
No gifts? Drop a fan badge.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.270
At least tap some hearts.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.640
Ms. Wang's here.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.160
Thanks for the hot-air balloon.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.830
Thank you.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.640
Dalong bows to you.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.030
Thank you.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.070
Stop it.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.400
Why?

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.240
Stop. Turn around.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.480
There's a thief.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.350
Put it down.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.720
Drop it.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.950
Stop.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.000
Stop it.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.590
Stop running.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.800
Stop it.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.270
Stop right there.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.280
Stop.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.520
Stop it.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.910
Get him.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.000
He's getting away. Somebody help.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.880
Stop! Don't run!

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.160
Get him! Get him!

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.800
Stop right there.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920
That phone thief!

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.160
Don't run!

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160
He's fast!

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.110
Block him!

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.720
Catch the thief! My phone!

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.750
Look. Those two are kinda funny.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.510
Fake. It's all scripted.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.790
Let's eat.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.480
- Eat.
- Come on. Dig in.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.070
You two done showing off?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.880
Shut the stream off. Now.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.280
Stop there.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.680
Gentlemen, welcome.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:35.630
Alright.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.930
Xiaohu.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.400
I don't think we're earth signs.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.310
'Cause we're on fire.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.000
You're wood, and I'm fire.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.550
We burn strong together.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.030
Our fire was pretty weak before.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.480
We keep fueling each other's energy.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.160
The fire's blazing now.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:03.160
So strong...

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.960
Come here.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.680
Big tip for you.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.320
Thank you.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.640
You too. Come here.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.830
Lean in.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.240
There you go.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.790
More tips coming.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.790
Liu, check their backgrounds.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.830
What's up with Xiaoqian?

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.790
You looked panicked.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.440
Nothing.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.350
Just a small issue with her shop order.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.480
No big deal.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.590
That's good.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640
You kids

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.960
grew up too sheltered.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.590
Gotta stay alert.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.640
There are bad people out there.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.030
Dad, you've been saying that

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.790
since I was little.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.440
I remember.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.150
Alright.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.310
No more nagging. I'm heading out.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.320
Take care.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.270
(Xiaoqian)
Yimo, come to my shop.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.070
I'm done for.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.870
Xiaoqian.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.040
What happened?

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.150
What's wrong?

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.310
Say something.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.190
I'm finished.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.440
What happened?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.920
Last night,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.440
wasn't it just dinner?

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.160
- Eight Bamboo.
- Five Dots.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.950
I win.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.680
At first,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.440
my luck was insane.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:53.920
I kept winning.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.240
I'd never had such good luck

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.070
at the table before.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.160
I really thought

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.070
my streak had come.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.240
But later, somehow,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.200
one round

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.550
went bad.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.070
After that, everything went wrong.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.000
I kept losing to everyone.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.270
But at that moment,

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.000
I'd already won a lot.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.310
So I thought,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.480
it was just a few bad rounds.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.920
My luck would come back.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.480
Who could've guessed...

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.640
I win again.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.110
Come on.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.830
Pay up.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.550
Unbelievable.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.550
I need to use the restroom.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.640
I wanted to leave.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.960
But by then, I couldn't get away.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.400
Yimo, what do I do?

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.350
I'm really finished.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.750
Let's call the police.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.720
Gambling's illegal.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.960
And this is gambling debt.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.110
Police will help.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.720
I'm scared.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.720
Even if we call the cops,

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.000
they won't catch them all.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.350
What if they come after me?

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.590
Don't panic.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.790
Let me think.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.720
Yimo, you're all I got.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.960
Come with me again, okay?

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.200
He said

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.000
if the three of us sit down and talk,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.480
there might be a way.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:26.680
Alright.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.160
But I need someone with us.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.640
I don't trust Li Xu.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.350
Anyone's fine.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.790
Thank you, Yimo.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.880
Hello, Qiang.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.110
You here?

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.080
Over here.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.270
Thank you, Qiang.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.680
Sorry to drag you into this.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.520
It's fine.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.270
My dad...

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.110
I took care of things.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.560
I didn't tell your dad.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.880
Thank you, Qiang.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.910
You're here.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.720
Why bring a guy?

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.440
You don't trust me?

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.800
Li Xu,

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.030
we were just nearby.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.070
Xiaoqian told me about last night.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.000
We wanted to talk

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.880
and see how this can be resolved.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.590
She told you already?

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.160
So do you agree or not?

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.510
Agree to what?

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:08.510
You set a trap to scam her.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.550
What am I agreeing to?

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.830
Careful with your words, girl.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:12.750
As you can see,

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.920
it's just a tea room.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.760
A card room.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.640
What trap? What scam?

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.790
You know me.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.070
I hate scammers the most.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.350
Right, Xiaoqian?

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.160
Just say what you want.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.030
How much? We'll pay.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.880
You make it sound easy.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.240
Do you know

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.240
how much she lost last night?

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.960
What are you paying with?

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.340
(IOU – Borrower: Sun Xiaoqian.
Amount: 200,000)

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.350
Two hundred thousand?

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.240
How did you lose that much?

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.720
Didn't I tell you

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.880
once you lose your stake, stop playing?

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.680
I was gone for a bit

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.200
and you went wild?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.680
I didn't want to gamble.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.960
I had already won it back.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.070
I kept winning.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.310
I thought I wouldn't have
to borrow from you.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.720
Wouldn't trouble you.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.640
You're my friend.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.440
How would I mind?

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920
The real problem now is,

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.680
there are rules at the table.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.070
This is getting tricky.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.800
Li Xu.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.350
Please help me.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.110
I'm begging you.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.640
I can't come up with 200,000.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640
That's too much.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.960
Please?

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.190
Okay?

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.000
Don't cry.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.030
Call your best friend out.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.440
Let's all sit down and talk.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:53.960
Maybe there's a way.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.720
To be fair,

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.440
I've already done plenty.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.240
And that money,

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.590
she doesn't owe it to me.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.640
The only reason I'm still helping

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.920
is I don't want to push things

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.070
too far.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.310
Cut the fake kindness.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.590
You saw Xiaoqian panic

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.750
and set her up on purpose.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.790
You don't have to see me as a good guy.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.070
But I'll say this.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.960
I'm not a bad guy.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.000
Alright.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.480
Since you said that,

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.000
I'll take a step back.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.720
You two stay

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.240
for dinner tonight.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.880
We'll call it even.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880
In your dreams.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.920
Gambling's illegal.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.880
We're not paying a cent.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.270
I've called the police.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.910
Let's go.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.590
How dare you?

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.550
Now let's see

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.550
how you get out of here today.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.350
Get them.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.350
Yimo!

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.800
Qiang!

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.480
Run. Why not?

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.750
Tell your people to back off!

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.070
Nobody move!

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.680
Watch it.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.590
If you hurt me,

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.830
I'll call the police on you.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.780
(Police)

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.880
Police! Help!

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.400
He's trying to kill me!

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.270
Help!

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.120
Police. Don't move!

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.030
Help!

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:42.110
Drop the weapon.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:43.480
Drop the knife.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.640
Drop it.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:48.200
Drop it, now.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.000
Calm down. Drop it.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.920
Qiang, drop it.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.720
You can go now.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:10.780
(Case Processing Area)

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.040
Xiaoqian?

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.160
You're Yimo's close friend?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.270
You grew up together?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.560
Yeah.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.310
I've got a few more questions.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:31.750
Officer,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.350
I already told you everything.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.960
I didn't hide anything.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.680
Sorry, Tang Tang.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.070
I caused trouble again.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.030
I was scared something would happen.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.750
That's why I texted you.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.590
It's fine. As long as you're safe.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.110
Yimo.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.800
Yimo.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.630
- Dad.
- You okay?

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:56.670
I'm fine.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.270
You go ahead.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.350
Don't blame Qiang.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.550
I told him not to tell you.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.440
I was scared,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.920
so I asked him to come.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.800
I'm not blaming him.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.960
We'll talk later.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.320
Tang Tang saved me again today.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:18.000
Officer Tang, thank you so much.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.920
You saved my daughter again.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.840
Thank you.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.000
No need. Just doing my job.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.200
See you.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.470
You hurt?

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.720
Yimo,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.360
go upstairs first.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.710
I'll say a few words to Xu Qiang.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.360
Dad, this was my fault.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.000
Qiang was helping me.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.240
It's fine.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.280
I'll talk business with him.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.390
Go home.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.920
Qiang, thanks today.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.670
If my dad gives you trouble,

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.360
tell me. I'll yell at him for you.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.680
I'm heading up.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.800
Bye.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.720
Qiang.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.070
Thank you

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.480
for today.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.880
Our families go way back.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.510
(Police; Reception)
He claims Yimo's his biological daughter.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.590
But I know

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.510
that she's adopted.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.360
We don't talk about it.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.480
Mr. Wang treats her

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.000
exactly like his own.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.590
Sometimes I envy her.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.840
Happy family,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.920
great education,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.670
and she's beautiful too.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.190
She has everything.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.710
How old was she when adopted?

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.480
Seven or eight.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.320
When we were kids.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.920
I don't really remember much.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.550
Do you remember

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.920
anything specific?

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.360
We played and went to school together.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.760
When I first met her,

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.230
she barely talked.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.760
Barely talked?

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.960
Yeah. We got close

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.920
after a long time.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.670
But Yimo

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.230
is always been overly polite.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.480
So reserved

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.320
it makes me feel

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.070
we're not that close.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:25.840
Tang.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.880
Did you come

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.590
because it isn't over?

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.920
Need to go to the station?

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.550
No.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:34.840
I'm just wondering

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.440
if you have time.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.150
We could take a walk.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.190
Perfect timing for a late snack.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.400
I was gonna

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.030
treat you someday.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.440
Guess you beat me to it.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.400
I'm not here for a thank-you meal.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.360
I've got a few questions.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.630
Ask anything.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.030
I'll tell you what I know.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.280
You've saved me twice already.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.150
I never got the chance to thank you.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.880
We're cops.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.510
Protecting is our job.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.760
Don't keep thanking me.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.110
Still, thanks are due.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.150
My dad wants

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:13.230
to treat you too.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.230
Our restaurant's really good.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.440
I've been there

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:18.760
and met your dad.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.630
It really is good.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.560
By the way,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.670
your cashier's called

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.110
Zhang Ming?

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.630
Yes, Ming.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.030
He doesn't talk much,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.110
but he's a good guy.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.360
Very attentive to customers.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.480
Why?

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.160
Nothing.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.800
That's your turf, right?

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.710
I'm counting on you for Intel.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.590
If you hear anything, tell me right away.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.710
Yes, Officer Tang.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.190
So where are we going?

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440
You'll see.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.280
Come on.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.220
Have you been here before?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.150
Can't really remember.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.960
Doesn't ring a bell.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.630
Honestly,

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.030
I don't know why,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.320
but I've forgotten

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:28.880
a lot from childhood.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.800
Why do you care so much

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.960
whether I've been here?

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.440
Remember I told you

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.030
about my best friend

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.760
from the welfare home?

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.840
The girl with the same birthmark as me?

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.320
She wasn't just my best friend.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.400
She was the most important person to me.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.800
When I first got there,

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.070
my parents had just passed away.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800
I was scared

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.920
and always getting picked on.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.030
Every time, she stood up for me.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.800
We came here as kids too.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.000
We had no money back then.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.670
But I promised her

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.800
when we grew up,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.920
I'd bring her on the Ferris wheel.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.510
It's so high.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.800
At the top,

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.670
you can probably see the whole city.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:45.680
Thanks.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.720
You're welcome.
