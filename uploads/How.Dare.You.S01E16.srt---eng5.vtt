00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.979
[Episode 16]

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.350
[Taiji Hall]

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.820
Your Highness,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.890
these are all gifts
bestowed by His Majesty.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.470
Just looking at them irritates me.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.680
Her Highness doesn't like them.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.540
Take them away.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.750
Yes.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.090
How on earth did she manage to do that?

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.750
I told you long ago—

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.590
don't provoke Yu Wanyin.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.660
But you just wouldn't listen.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.750
Your Highness Consort Xie,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.079
you dropped something.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.590
This is a remedy

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.240
that His Highness Prince Duan found
for Your Highness.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.350
Take it all at once.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.680
It will take effect within four hours.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680
But Her Highness has already...

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.030
Ling.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.270
Take it for me.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.850
Eunuch, please deliver

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.640
a message to Prince Duan for me.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.950
Please tell him to rest assured.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.530
Then this servant will take his leave.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.190
Your Highness,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.470
why didn't you let me tell His Highness

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.400
that the matter has been resolved?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.850
Physician Xiao risked his life to save me.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.720
I don't want to drag him into this.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.850
Give me that.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.480
Dan,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.660
today's Grand Longevity Banquet

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.190
is so lively

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.010
with songs and dances.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.310
The Yan delegation you've been
thinking about has also come.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.560
Are you satisfied?

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.790
Mother, you're thoughtful.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.110
I was worried

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.159
that if we turned them away,

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.260
it would only invite gossip.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.750
And in the end,

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.050
it would hurt your reputation as well,
wouldn't it?

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.120
In that case,

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.430
I should thank you?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.360
My son, you thought of everything.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.090
Whether I'm thorough or not...

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.340
I still need to rely on my brother.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.560
[Taiji Hall]

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.690
The Yan State delegation has arrived!

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.370
He's an expert fighter.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.270
Really?

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.330
Mr. Bei,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.800
I'm not really the focus
of tonight's banquet.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.330
You should go watch over
His Majesty instead.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.070
Who knows what unexpected things
might happen?

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.120
It's always good to have you
protecting him discreetly.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.010
Mr. Bei, you...

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.600
Not even a token protest?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.930
As expected, your mind isn't on me.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.430
I am Haqina, Envoy of Yan!

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.070
We wish Your Majesty longevity

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.950
and the Empress Dowager good health!

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.770
May friendship between our two nations
last for generations!

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.600
You've come

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.960
from afar.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.120
The journey

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.570
must have been tiring.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.120
At our Emperor's instruction,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.120
we've specially brought dancers
from our country

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.410
to perform for Your Majesty

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.200
as a token of our good wishes.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.340
Excellent.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.720
Please be seated.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.270
Yong'er.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.840
Lady Yu?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.940
Why did you arrive so late?

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.440
Forgive me, Lady Yu.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.450
My...

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.520
stomach has been unsettled,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.430
so I was delayed in my palace.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.930
I haven't yet congratulated you
on regaining your title as Noble Consort.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.430
I don't care about that at all.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.800
When a man loves you,
he wants you to live well.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.430
When he hates you, he wants you dead.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.920
Men—

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.730
not a single one of them is any good.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.800
Her Majesty the Empress Dowager specially
bestows upon Your Highnesses

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.660
the grape wine brought
by the envoys from Yan State.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.970
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.860
This is so good.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.320
I haven't had enough.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.540
Noble Consort Yu,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.960
this is a very precious wine
bestowed by Her Majesty.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.960
Only one cup each.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:58.910
You drank hers up...

00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:59.640
Why don't you

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.490
go complain to His Majesty?

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.910
Ms. Tonghao,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.120
I was ill a few days ago.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.510
My stomach hasn't fully recovered,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.110
so I really shouldn't drink.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.210
Her Majesty was also very concerned

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.240
about Your Highness's vomiting last time.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.630
She asked me to summon
the most experienced physician,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.870
Physician Zhang,
from the Imperial Medical Bureau.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.430
After the banquet ends,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.690
I'll bring him to examine you again.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.840
Your Highness Noble Consort Yu,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.370
please return to your seat.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.440
Mind the protocol.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.510
Power-abusing wretch.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.270
They say everyone from Yan State
is skilled at dancing.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.730
Their reputation is indeed well-deserved.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.500
Though they are stunning beauties,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.480
they still can't compare to
Beautiful Lady Shanyi back then.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.790
Indeed.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.550
Bravo!

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.520
Truly, you're beauties

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.920
with exotic charm!

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.600
Mr. Wang,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.480
the delegation from Yan State
has come from afar

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.270
to present dances
for His Majesty's birthday.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.730
Does the Ministry of Rites

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.800
have no reciprocal gift prepared?

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.790
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.510
the Imperial Music Bureau
has specially prepared a musical pageant

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.170
to present to the delegation.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.120
A musical pageant?

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.720
Then what are we waiting for?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.840
Begin.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.360
Yes.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.000
[Zhaluowahan, Emperor of Yan]

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.930
Zhaluowahan is the Emperor of Yan,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.750
sinister and cunning behind his smile.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.940
This is clearly mocking our country.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.680
A man can be killed but not humiliated.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.630
Even if we are at odds with our Emperor,

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.670
it's not for these Xia people
to mock us so casually.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.300
Can't you see

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.380
they're trying to provoke us?

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.390
Bravo!

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.500
Excellent!

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.780
Your Majesty the Emperor,

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.930
we people of Yan love dancing!

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.880
May we join in?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.100
Certainly!

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.240
Joy shared is joy doubled.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.070
I'll beat the drum for you myself!

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.470
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.330
Keep the music playing!

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.680
Keep the dance going!

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.180
Your Highness,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.030
you've already taken the medicine
that Physician Xiao prescribed.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.360
You must not take any other medicines now.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.200
Physician Xiao's medicine won't
take effect for another three days.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.730
But the Empress Dowager...

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.080
will send an imperial physician
the moment the banquet ends.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.010
There's no time.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.010
Your Highness, you mustn't!

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.140
Physician Xiao said

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.150
all fast-acting medicines are
too harsh on the body.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.130
If anything happens to you,

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:17.840
how am I supposed to go on living,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.700
Your Highness?

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.230
Then I'll only take one pill.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.100
If it's not effective enough,

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.960
I'll take the other two.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.840
Go find Physician Xiao immediately

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.640
and ask him how to counteract it.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.320
Where is Consort Xie?

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.200
She just left.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.960
She looked unsteady on her feet

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.720
and pale.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.040
Her maid wasn't with her either.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:04.670
What?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.130
Their dancing isn't that impressive.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.200
Let's split up and search.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.270
But Your Highness, you...

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.120
What's there to fear?

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.550
Nothing will happen to me.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.240
Finding Xie Yong'er is what matters now.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.500
I'm afraid something will happen to her.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:51.920
Lord Cao,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.670
let me toast to you.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:54.890
To you!

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.900
Sorry.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.360
Pardon me.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.560
Where's my jade pendant?

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:16.230
Where is the jade pendant
I wear at my waist?

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.440
If you suspect him,

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.790
just search him.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.000
The jade pendant really is on him!

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.020
Quickly check

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.200
if we still have our jade pendants!

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.550
How strange.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.720
How did the pendant

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.960
I wear at my waist end up with this envoy?

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.090
Could it be that you stole it when no one

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.580
was looking...

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.610
I...

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.270
I didn't!

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.230
You're framing me!

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.680
Let go of me...

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:24.960
Your Majesty the Emperor,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.690
we are people

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.020
from a humble land.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.600
We've never seen such splendor before.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.680
Perhaps greed momentarily overcame him.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.920
We beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.040
Your Majesty,

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.050
you must uphold justice for this subject.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.630
Your Majesty,

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:48.490
this person

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.960
is yours to deal with as you see fit.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.170
Alright, alright!

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.710
It's just a jade pendant.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.810
Why make such a fuss?

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.640
Since the envoy likes it,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.080
just gift it to him.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.690
Don't let a small jade pendant

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.010
damage the friendship
between our two nations.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.350
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager is
absolutely right.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.240
I was inconsiderate.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.880
Mr. Wang.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.110
Where exactly

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.820
did you find the pendant just now?

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.090
Inside his robe.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.950
Where specifically?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.200
Where specifically?

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.830
The place...

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680
Around his chest.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.110
From what I see,
the Yan delegation's clothing

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.110
is designed differently from ours.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.200
Such a small object,

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.080
placed inside the robe,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.980
would actually remain
near the chest...

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.510
How interesting.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:13.970
Mr. Wang,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.200
try it.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.250
Well...

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.810
Uh...

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.070
Uh...

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.160
No,

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.790
that's not how it was just now!

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.070
It was clearly at his chest just now!

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:41.090
How did it suddenly...

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.890
Well... um...

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.810
No, it wasn't like that just now!

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.670
No, it wasn't like that. No, no...

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.240
Mr. Wang, there seems to be

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.330
something unusual about your sleeve.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.390
I wouldn't want to wrong you.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.450
Quickly,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.510
show it to everyone

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.600
to prove your innocence.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.420
Your Maj...

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:08.270
Your...

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.840
Just now,

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.500
I drank too much,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.370
so my mind was unclear.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.310
Please spare me, Your Majesty.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.510
Please spare my life!

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.340
Please!

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.240
Fine.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.270
Take Mr. Wang away

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.500
and help him sober up.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.160
Your Majesty! Your...

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.190
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.350
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.950
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.510
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager!

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.110
Empress Dowager, please save me!

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.110
Empress Dowager!

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.440
Empress Dowager, save me!

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.030
Your Majesty is wise.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.590
It was all just a misunderstanding.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.190
Be seated.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.670
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.690
Mother,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.920
allow me to toast you.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.220
You displayed

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.560
quite the authority today.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.770
Mother, you flatter me.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.240
You don't

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.000
need me anymore.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.880
My son,

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.510
you can host
the birthday banquet yourself now.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.650
Where is she?

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.910
Where on earth did she run off to?

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.890
Yong'er,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:17.550
are you all right?

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.010
I'm fine.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.200
This is...

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.100
Don't look.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.930
Don't look.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.500
I'm begging you.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.360
Go now.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.630
Just leave me.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.240
You need to go back
and change your clothes.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.370
Can you still stand?

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.110
I can't stand up.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.810
Come on,

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.300
I'll carry you.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.880
Why is it you?

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.700
Stop talking.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.050
Save your strength.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.810
I'm going to stand up now.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.450
Your Highness,

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:40.320
it's exactly as you predicted.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.790
Proceed to Kunyu Palace!

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.700
Where is everyone?

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.540
Help!

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.400
Maids!

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.700
Where is everyone?

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.120
Where is everyone? Where did you all go?

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.120
Yong'er!

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:14.680
Where is everyone?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.810
Where did you all go?

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.320
Who dares make such noise here?

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.160
How improper!

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.750
Aren't those Consort Xie

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:31.130
and Noble Consort Yu, who left

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.440
[Kunyu Palace]

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.500
the banquet early?

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.070
I've been waiting here for you two
for quite some time.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.810
I happened to encounter Consort Xie
outside the hall just now.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.460
Seeing she was unwell,

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.130
I brought her back.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:47.930
[Kunyu Palace]

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.070
There're so many servants in the palace,

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.560
and yet you, a noble consort,

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.510
had to carry her back?

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.200
Enough.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.480
You two,

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.790
stop trying to deceive me.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:03.770
Tonghao,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.070
go and see

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.960
what they're up to!

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.500
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.440
Your Majesty,

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.430
there are bloodstains on

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.240
Her Highness Consort Xie's skirt.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.380
Bloodstains?

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.520
Consort Xie,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.060
what happened?

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.680
I...

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.510
Perhaps her time of the month came early.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.510
It soiled her hem.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.510
I feared it would be improper,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.530
so I

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.080
brought her back alone.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.560
Consort Xie?

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.400
Consort Xie!

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.350
Lift your head and look at me!

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.420
Is that truly the case?

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.040
Your Majesty...

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.440
I...

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.330
Yong'er?

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.380
Yong'er?

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.370
Xie Yong'er!

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.410
Xie Yong'er?

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.110
Your Majesty,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.510
Her Highness Consort Xie has awakened.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.830
How is Consort Xie?

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.560
Her Highness has deficient kidney qi.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.760
Her pulse is weak and unstable.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.030
And she experienced massive bleeding.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.090
It appears to be...

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.860
a miscarriage.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.820
A miscarriage?

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.510
Quick,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.010
go inform the Emperor!

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.400
Yes.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.480
Wait!

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.640
Didn't an imperial physician say before

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.550
that Consort Xie was not pregnant?

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:40.000
Yes,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.000
Physician Xiao did say so.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.260
Well...

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.590
Perhaps

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.070
the pregnancy was too early,

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.670
so her pulse was not obvious.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.330
This subject only inferred it

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.280
from her other symptoms.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.660
What symptoms?

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.990
Her Highness Consort Xie

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.520
appears to have taken...

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.410
an abortifacient.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.980
An abortifacient?

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.750
Leave.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.440
Yes.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.200
Consort Xie,

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.730
you have quite the audacity!

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.280
The Emperor has few heirs.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.420
We finally had hope of having a prince,

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.170
and you dared to
commit such an outrageous act!

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.260
I didn't take any abortifacient!

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.070
Please investigate thoroughly,
Your Majesty!

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.310
Your Majesty,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.140
I was hoping

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.110
to give you another grandson

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.310
to keep the little prince company.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.840
How could I possibly
take any abortifacient?

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.190
Oh, Your Majesty,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.220
perhaps it was because

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.520
I vomited in public,

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.340
making people think I was pregnant.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.040
Someone became jealous,

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.830
so...

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.590
You mean

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.960
you were drugged.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.640
Tell me,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.520
who drugged you?

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.160
I don't know.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.040
Is it that you don't know,

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.640
or that you dare not say?

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.140
Tell me!

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.110
Why are you looking at me?

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.790
Noble Consort Yu?

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.130
It seems this matter

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.690
has everything to do with you.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.640
How could it possibly be me?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.770
If not you, then who?

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.310
You previously sent someone
to assassinate Consort Shu,

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.720
and now you've drugged Consort Xie!

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.000
You'll stop at nothing
to win the Emperor's favor!

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.910
All my son's affection for you
has been wasted!

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.620
Guards!

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.410
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.010
Seize this demonic consort!

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.340
It wasn't me!

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.940
Say something!

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.470
Why is Your Majesty so certain it was me?

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.010
If I really did drug her,

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.570
why would I bring her back?

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.400
Wouldn't it be better to leave her there?

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.550
You were just trying to cover your tracks!

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.160
I just came out of the Cold Palace.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.400
How could I have had the chance
to drug her?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.730
Perhaps the real culprit is someone else!

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.880
Say something!

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.670
My stomach hurts so much.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.850
I haven't eaten anything today.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.680
Like Consort Xie,

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.680
I also only drank the cup of wine
that Ms. Tonghao brought.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.490
Why is my stomach cramping too?

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.450
Your Majesty,

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:02.510
please

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.310
seek justice for Consort Xie and me!

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.070
Your Highness!

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:06.190
Your Highness!

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.440
You cannot wrongly accuse this lowly maid!

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.000
Your Majesty, please be fair!

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.290
This maid did nothing!

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.160
This maid would never dare!

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.180
This maid would never dare!

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.040
Your Highness, are you alright?

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.820
It hurts so much!

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.260
Your Highness, please slow down.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.740
Your Highness,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.690
the Empress Dowager has left.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.110
Turn around.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.240
Let's go settle this with Xie Yong'er.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.100
Your Highness,

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.590
the medicine is ready.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:01.650
Please take it.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.030
The medicine was prepared
by Physician Xiao.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.890
It's very safe.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.310
Has the fetus been taken care of?

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.670
I found a tree far away

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.260
and buried it there...

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.060
Don't tell me.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.540
Your Highness.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.480
Do you know, Ling?

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.270
I used to think I was the chosen one,

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.630
and that with the script in hand,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.610
I could change the course
and everything myself.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.610
But in the end, I couldn't do anything.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.270
I couldn't even protect my own child.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.560
I've failed myself.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.280
I've failed him too.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.570
No, Your Highness. Don't think that way.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.880
There are many people you've failed,

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.210
but he's not one of them.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.550
Please calm down, Your Highness.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.720
Her Highness Consort Xie is ill...

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.000
Chu Qi, take Ling out.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.310
Yes.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.320
Let's go.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.480
You also suspect
Prince Duan is full of lies, don't you?

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.280
Otherwise, why do you keep
making excuses for him?

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.050
What about Prince Duan?

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.430
I know everything about you two.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.630
How long are you going to keep hiding it?

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.160
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.970
You were almost dead.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.330
Are you still going to deceive yourself?

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.110
Let me ask you:

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.310
the new Commander of the Imperial Guards,

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.110
Zhao Wucheng—

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.100
whose man is he?

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.030
Even the Imperial Guards
protecting the entire Imperial City

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.890
are under Prince Duan's command.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.960
How could he fail to protect

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.360
your small Kunyu Palace?

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.400
Was he truly powerless,
or did he do it deliberately?

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.600
Don't you know the answer in your heart?

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.570
He keeps saying he loves you
and will protect you.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.110
But when you were carrying his child,

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.800
he gave you no protection at all.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.030
If that wasn't using you as bait

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.480
to divert the Empress Dowager,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.409
then what was it?

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.480
If you don't believe

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.810
that Yu Wanyin would say such things
to Xie Yong'er,

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:36.540
that's fine.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.020
Let me ask you as someone else.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:46.679
How...

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:48.000
are...

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:50.469
you? [spoken in English]

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.230
Answer me!

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.989
How are you? [spoken in English]

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.570
Zhang San's Diary.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.150
I've caused you all to be punished.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.030
I feel terrible about it.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.670
Today,

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.550
I've specially invited you all here,

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:12.810
hoping these pastries

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.520
might make amends.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.720
Crown Prince,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.320
what's the meaning of this?

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.920
This is rotten swill for pigs!

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.380
Do you take us for beggars?

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.610
This is impossible.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.840
I didn't!

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:47.150
Come here!

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.160
They were perfectly good pastries
just moments ago!

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.070
How did they become rotten scraps?

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.000
I watched them being put in myself!

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:53.630
Speak!

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.050
Please calm down, Your Highness!

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.550
This servant did follow

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.110
Your Highness's instructions.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:35:59.980
You're lying!

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.220
Who put you up to framing me?

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.000
Tell me!

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.800
Please calm down, Crown Prince.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.960
This eunuch's offense
doesn't warrant death.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.820
Please show mercy, Crown Prince.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:21.970
So it was him.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.560
Since this is your kind gesture,

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.630
I shall

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.360
accept it

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.590
on behalf of all the other princes.
