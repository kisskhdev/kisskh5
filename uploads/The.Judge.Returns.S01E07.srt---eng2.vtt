WEBVTT

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:35.013
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.350
EPISODE 7

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.060
Move your foot.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:42.187
Your foot!

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.695
The thing is, Dong-gi has to stay healthy

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:51.446
without a single paper cut

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.198
or a random bruise.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.118
Because if he doesn't pay me back,
I own him.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.744
So

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.873
don't you dare lay a finger on him,
or else...

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:02.708
Alright?

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:16.805
I want him

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:19.683
to die.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.144
Kill him.

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:23.520
Kill him!

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:27.024
I can finally hear you.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:42.956
No!

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.059
Defendant Chu Yong-jin

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:05.062
the court hereby sentences you to death.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:13.987
No!

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.282
Wait!

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.043
Let him out.

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:30.045
Just let him go.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.256
Let him go!

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.716
Let him out...

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:04.955
Are you sure you won't regret it?

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:10.210
He never apologized to my son sincerely.

00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:14.047
He'd apologize a million times
as long as he doesn't have to mean it.

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:17.175
He'd also beg a billion times
if it played in his favor.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.260
I'm not asking

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:21.471
for him to be freed
for an insincere apology, either.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:23.724
What I want is

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.060
for him and the world to know

00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:30.564
the crimes he has committed.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.861
Do you really want Mr. Chu to be tried?

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:39.740
Do you believe in the law?

00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:43.785
Even when we've

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:46.788
finally got him in a sinkhole?

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:52.669
I can't help but think

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.131
about what good would come

00:03:56.214 --> 00:03:57.674
from just burying him alive.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.429
I guess we'll take him to the court, then.

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:06.558
I'm glad.

00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:09.519
I know the law very well.

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:14.358
Nice to meet you.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.318
I'm Judge Lee Han Young

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.695
at the Seoul Central District Court.

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:30.207
Are you okay, boss?

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:32.876
It stings!

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:35.295
Sorry, sir.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.256
Be more gentle with it!

00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:39.883
Damn it.

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:43.720
I can still feel sand in my mouth.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:46.098
Hak-su.

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:47.557
Yes, boss.

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.477
Keep an eye on Dong-gi
at all times from now on.

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:53.271
Those bastards are loansharks.

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:55.148
When they come to take his money

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:58.735
chop off a limb or something

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.487
and bring them here, alright?

00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:02.823
Yes, boss.

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:14.167
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:21.425
Yes, Mr. Kang.

00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:27.597
Hot!

00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:28.807
Ta-da!

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.600
Wow, this is...

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:31.685
I know, right?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.353
I'm sorry.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:35.105
I only cooked this for myself.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.648
Want me to cook some more?

00:05:36.898 --> 00:05:38.358
Of course! This is nothing!

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:39.860
Right? We need more?

00:05:40.152 --> 00:05:41.236
I have leftover rice.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.487
It's fine.

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:45.782
Gosh, this looks so good.

00:05:51.204 --> 00:05:52.414
How's Na-yeong doing?

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.504
She's doing well, right?

00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:03.967
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

00:06:06.636 --> 00:06:08.805
She insisted on working
just until midnight.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.182
I lost to her.

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:12.476
She thinks she owns the place.

00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:14.186
So, you got shown up by a kid?

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:15.520
Does she look like a kid?

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:16.771
She'll beat you anytime.

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:18.231
I'm a judge.

00:06:18.315 --> 00:06:20.442
Other people's words can't sway me.

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:22.527
- Sure, whatever.
- Hello.

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:25.947
You can't be around drunk people.
It's not safe.

00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:27.073
Just work on weekdays.

00:06:27.657 --> 00:06:30.202
If I move to another province for college,
I'll have to rent.

00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:31.703
I don't have money for that

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:33.622
meaning I have to go
to a college in Seoul.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:35.749
And night shifts are perfect for studying.

00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:37.459
But it's still dangerous.

00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:39.711
But going to an out-of-state college is
more dangerous.

00:06:39.794 --> 00:06:41.254
Yeah, it is.

00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:43.131
Did your grandma approve?

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:45.926
I told her I'd have to move for college
if I didn't study now

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.302
and she immediately said okay.

00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:52.057
You have a permit
for her to work at night?

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.892
Oh, man, that's too complicated.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.186
So, you don't have it?

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:01.149
NIGHT WORK PERMIT FOR MINORS

00:07:01.983 --> 00:07:04.903
No, we went through the complicated stuff
and got it.

00:07:04.986 --> 00:07:06.488
Yeah, complicated, baby!

00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:08.990
You're even worse.

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:10.825
A judge is only human, huh?

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:21.336
Walk Na-yeong home.

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:23.296
People are drunk. It's dangerous.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.714
Do you need a bag?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.553
Sir, do you need a bag?

00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:41.106
Grandma sleeps with the lights on

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:42.899
so it's safer for me to walk home.

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:46.361
She doesn't even turn the fan on

00:07:46.444 --> 00:07:48.780
to save on electricity bills
when she's alone.

00:07:49.948 --> 00:07:52.450
There's an air conditioner
at my parents' junkyard.

00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:53.952
Should I set that up at yours?

00:07:54.327 --> 00:07:57.122
She doesn't even use the fan
because electricity is expensive.

00:07:57.872 --> 00:08:00.041
Oh, right.

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:03.420
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodbye.

00:08:03.503 --> 00:08:04.671
Goodnight.

00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:31.364
Grandma.

00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:35.410
Hey.

00:08:35.493 --> 00:08:38.038
There's my little puppy.

00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:40.707
- Grandma.
- Yeah?

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.585
You know what I love most
about having a part-time job?

00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:47.464
Making money?

00:08:48.214 --> 00:08:51.968
No, having the store owner walk me home.

00:08:53.762 --> 00:08:55.680
Knowing that there's an adult with me

00:08:55.764 --> 00:08:57.849
as I walk in the dark

00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:00.602
makes me want to be a better person.

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:10.654
Grandma.

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:34.678
Looks like you won't need to sleep
with the lights on anymore.

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:52.112
Hey, don't push!

00:09:56.366 --> 00:09:57.575
Why are you pulling?

00:09:57.659 --> 00:09:58.910
Stop pushing me!

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:00.245
When did I do that?

00:10:00.537 --> 00:10:01.621
Let's go again.

00:10:10.004 --> 00:10:11.131
What's that, anyway?

00:10:11.214 --> 00:10:12.841
Huh? This?

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:14.801
I didn't know what would fit.

00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:17.512
You're an idiot.

00:10:17.595 --> 00:10:19.681
You're a judge,
and a teenager beat you, so...

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.185
By the way, it looks like the repair
will cost more than the car.

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:29.107
Let me know if you can't afford it.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.358
Your friend's a loan shark.

00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:42.412
- Your Honor!
- Oh, gosh.

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:44.080
Good morning!

00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:46.082
Who are you?

00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:48.042
Angel!

00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:50.754
Oh, you brought the car
from the Chungnam Court!

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:52.756
What brings you here?

00:10:54.966 --> 00:10:57.635
I got it right from the dealership.
It's an express delivery.

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:04.392
Damn, Jeong-ho.

00:11:05.643 --> 00:11:07.729
So, how do you like it?

00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:11.191
I love it.

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:13.526
It's so spacious,
and the seat is so cushy.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.611
Hey

00:11:14.694 --> 00:11:17.530
you can pay in 60 installments.
That's doable on your meager salary.

00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:18.990
Over 60 months?

00:11:21.659 --> 00:11:23.495
You're hilarious.

00:11:24.496 --> 00:11:26.080
Good job.

00:11:26.164 --> 00:11:28.875
So, why did you choose such a big car?

00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:39.010
Are you still handling things
with your fists?

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:41.596
No, sir.

00:11:42.222 --> 00:11:44.390
I've never done that
since you helped me become

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:46.226
the District Mayor.

00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:47.769
Exactly!

00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:50.688
I made you the District Mayor

00:11:51.397 --> 00:11:53.274
so you owe me, big time.

00:11:54.234 --> 00:11:55.276
Yes, sir.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.695
So, why is it so hard to get the victims

00:11:57.987 --> 00:11:59.572
to sign a damn settlement deal?

00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:02.492
Sorry, sir.

00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:04.619
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

00:12:05.787 --> 00:12:08.998
Don't you go trying to play lawyer

00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:12.168
and act like a real District Mayor
because you think you're one.

00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:14.963
Just stick to your best expertise.

00:12:15.964 --> 00:12:17.507
You know what I mean!

00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:19.968
Yes, sir.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.761
I'll do that.

00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:24.097
CALL RECORD FROM THE SECOND CALL TO 911

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.891
911: HELLO, 911 EMERGENCY
CALLER: OH... THIS IS...UH...

00:12:44.242 --> 00:12:46.286
How's it going with the sinkhole case?

00:12:49.414 --> 00:12:51.165
If it were going well, how would it look?

00:12:53.751 --> 00:12:55.003
There'd be nothing to consider

00:12:55.086 --> 00:12:57.088
and no questions unanswered.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.799
I guess it's not going well, then.

00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:04.596
Let me know if I can help you.

00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:21.529
How's Judge Lee doing?

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:27.535
He's busy with the sinkhole case.

00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:30.496
He hasn't done much else.

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:40.882
WOO GYO-HUN

00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:42.759
AN INTENSE CONFIRMATION HEARING EXPECTED

00:13:42.842 --> 00:13:44.093
WOO GYO-HUN STAYS SILENT
ABOUT STOCK PARKING ALLEGATIONS

00:13:44.177 --> 00:13:45.386
ARGUMENTS OVER FALSIFIED RESIDENCY

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.055
WOO GYO-HUN REVEALS
HIS QUESTIONABLE FINANCES

00:13:47.138 --> 00:13:49.223
ALLEGATIONS OF UNFAIR HIRING PRACTICES
BY WOO GYO-HUN

00:13:49.682 --> 00:13:52.810
Still no movement
from Prosecutor General Eom.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.441
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a
from the Central District Office.

00:13:58.775 --> 00:14:01.736
She recently arrested Jang Tae-sik,
the CEO of S Shopping.

00:14:02.362 --> 00:14:05.281
She'd also tear Mr. Woo apart
in a heartbeat.

00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:12.997
Mr. Woo!

00:14:13.081 --> 00:14:14.958
Did you falsify your residence?

00:14:22.423 --> 00:14:24.133
My daughter had depression

00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:26.928
in middle school.

00:14:27.845 --> 00:14:30.431
She had one friend whom she could trust

00:14:30.515 --> 00:14:33.768
but they ended up at different schools
for high school.

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:37.313
To help her move to her friend's school...

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.156
Regardless of my reason

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.826
I shouldn't have done so
as a public servant.

00:14:50.535 --> 00:14:54.872
I'd like to take this chance
to apologize to the nation sincerely.

00:15:01.087 --> 00:15:02.088
Coming through.

00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:04.132
Do you admit to stock parking

00:15:04.215 --> 00:15:06.175
making your brother-in-law keep
your stocks?

00:15:06.592 --> 00:15:07.844
Where are you from?

00:15:07.927 --> 00:15:09.679
I'm Reporter Han Jeong-won from YTM.

00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:12.432
And you believe in fake news

00:15:12.515 --> 00:15:14.600
when you're
from such an established agency?

00:15:14.976 --> 00:15:16.394
I don't know what to say.

00:15:16.477 --> 00:15:18.354
WOO GYO-HUN DISMISSES "STOCK PARKING"
CONTROVERSY AS FAKE NEWS

00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:21.190
Anyway, I'll clarify everything

00:15:21.274 --> 00:15:23.234
at the confirmation hearing. Bye.

00:15:23.317 --> 00:15:25.111
- Excuse me!
- Mr. Woo!

00:15:26.195 --> 00:15:27.655
Did you come up with that?

00:15:28.781 --> 00:15:30.783
No, he's quick enough to answer that much.

00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:32.118
What about the stock parking?

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:35.663
I had a civil organization expose him

00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:37.707
so he can just say
it's under investigation.

00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:40.501
Once he gets named the Minister of Justice

00:15:41.335 --> 00:15:42.712
they'll drop the charges.

00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:44.047
Sin-jin

00:15:44.714 --> 00:15:47.633
why do you think I've chosen Gyo-hun?

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:51.429
Gyo-hun is full of flaws
but also full of greed.

00:15:52.055 --> 00:15:54.057
He'll strike or keep whomever you choose

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.393
in the next presidential election season.

00:15:58.519 --> 00:15:59.604
In return

00:16:00.313 --> 00:16:02.940
you'll keep quiet about his shortcomings

00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:04.650
and give him what he wants.

00:16:08.946 --> 00:16:10.281
And what do you want?

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.037
Justice in the Judiciary.

00:16:18.456 --> 00:16:19.791
That's very ambitious.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.467
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:36.057
Judge Lee lived

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.935
in Mak-dong, Yeongdeungpo District
throughout his school years.

00:16:39.644 --> 00:16:40.645
His grades were alright

00:16:40.728 --> 00:16:42.939
up to 11th grade

00:16:43.481 --> 00:16:44.482
but in 12th grade

00:16:45.024 --> 00:16:47.652
he suddenly started getting top grades.

00:16:48.236 --> 00:16:50.988
Thanks to that, he was accepted
into a small, regional law school.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.951
There's always a reason

00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:57.245
for anyone's dramatic change.

00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:58.913
Yes, sir.

00:16:58.996 --> 00:17:00.414
When he entered 12th grade

00:17:00.498 --> 00:17:03.126
Mak-dong was designated
as a redevelopment zone.

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:05.586
It was then that his father fought

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.588
a guard from the construction company

00:17:07.672 --> 00:17:10.341
and was sentenced to 1.5 years in jail
for aggravated assault.

00:17:13.052 --> 00:17:14.387
YEONGDEUNGPO DISTRICT, A SUSTAINABLE CITY

00:17:15.304 --> 00:17:17.306
CONTRACTOR FOR PROJECT

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.851
CONTRACTOR: S CONSTRUCTION

00:17:27.775 --> 00:17:29.152
What a coincidence.

00:17:30.653 --> 00:17:32.905
To think it was Judge Lee's father,
of all people.

00:17:49.589 --> 00:17:52.133
Case Number 2007GH5432.

00:17:52.216 --> 00:17:53.968
The verdict for Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:17:54.051 --> 00:17:56.387
on his violation
of the Punishment of Violences Act

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.473
in an incident
of a mass weaponized assault is ready.

00:18:00.057 --> 00:18:01.559
I hereby announce

00:18:03.269 --> 00:18:06.314
that the Defendant used a weapon

00:18:06.856 --> 00:18:08.441
to cause fractures to the hired guards

00:18:08.524 --> 00:18:11.527
in his conflict with them.

00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:13.070
Furthermore

00:18:14.155 --> 00:18:16.449
the witnesses' stories match

00:18:16.949 --> 00:18:20.161
and the Defendant was confirmed
to have fled the site.

00:18:22.663 --> 00:18:25.291
While the Defendant does not have
relevant prior convictions

00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:27.668
the witnesses' testimonies match

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:29.712
the facts of the indictment

00:18:29.795 --> 00:18:31.672
and despite many witnesses' statements

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:33.216
and evidence to prove them

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:34.550
the Defendant is presenting

00:18:34.634 --> 00:18:37.637
excuses that are difficult to understand.

00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:39.180
On top of that

00:18:39.847 --> 00:18:41.599
despite there being many residents

00:18:41.682 --> 00:18:43.559
and other witnesses on site

00:18:44.018 --> 00:18:46.520
no evidence has been submitted

00:18:46.979 --> 00:18:48.439
to support the Defendant's claims.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.274
And despite the victim

00:18:50.358 --> 00:18:52.360
suffering from a serious fracture

00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:55.363
the Defendant did not make
any sincere effort

00:18:55.863 --> 00:18:56.864
to take responsibility

00:18:56.948 --> 00:18:59.617
or to reach a settlement.

00:19:00.117 --> 00:19:03.037
Therefore, the court has reached
the following decision.

00:19:03.371 --> 00:19:04.580
The court hereby orders

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:06.415
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:19:06.499 --> 00:19:09.627
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

00:19:18.928 --> 00:19:20.888
The Defendant has one week to appeal

00:19:21.847 --> 00:19:23.224
to the court's decision

00:19:23.307 --> 00:19:25.017
from the day of the announcement.

00:19:25.726 --> 00:19:27.436
If an appeal is not filed

00:19:28.354 --> 00:19:29.855
the decision will be carried out

00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:31.440
as announced.

00:19:53.713 --> 00:19:54.714
Yeah.

00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:56.549
Let's get lunch together.

00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:07.393
You think Mr. Eom will do as you want?

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.438
He will.

00:20:11.647 --> 00:20:13.107
Because he's already signed

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.234
to be Haenal's legal advisor.

00:20:15.776 --> 00:20:18.279
You already have your results
before even submitting the test?

00:20:21.365 --> 00:20:23.909
Mr. Eom has no way out now.

00:20:23.993 --> 00:20:24.994
Mr. Woo thinks

00:20:25.077 --> 00:20:27.788
he just needs to get
through the confirmation hearing

00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:30.791
but he'll be more humiliated
than he ever imagined.

00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:32.918
So, I can stop Gyo-hun.

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:36.630
And Haenal Law Firm gets Mr. Eom.

00:20:36.714 --> 00:20:37.757
But what about you?

00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:41.677
I just needed something

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.598
to bring to the table
to become Mr. Yu's son-in-law, anyway.

00:20:47.558 --> 00:20:48.559
Interesting.

00:20:51.062 --> 00:20:53.064
You also handed the list of draft dodgers

00:20:53.147 --> 00:20:55.483
to Yi-seok without anything in return.

00:20:56.525 --> 00:20:59.153
You said it was to get revenge
on your buddy from law school

00:20:59.487 --> 00:21:00.946
but that can't be the real reason.

00:21:07.078 --> 00:21:08.245
Judge Lee

00:21:09.246 --> 00:21:11.165
what's your real reason
behind approaching me?

00:21:16.837 --> 00:21:18.339
I've already told you.

00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:20.007
What do you think I'm like?

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:22.968
You look like someone who can lead me.

00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:25.763
I only hope to serve my rightful purpose.

00:21:26.764 --> 00:21:27.973
But what do you want from me?

00:21:29.975 --> 00:21:31.435
I'll tell you another time.

00:21:34.814 --> 00:21:36.273
So, you do want something?

00:21:44.198 --> 00:21:46.367
You've lived
in a redevelopment zone, right?

00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:47.535
Yes, sir.

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:49.620
Didn't that lead to any issues?

00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:52.540
Like compensation issues for demolition.

00:21:53.707 --> 00:21:54.708
And maybe

00:21:55.251 --> 00:21:56.377
such issues

00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:58.921
led to bigger disasters of sorts.

00:22:00.589 --> 00:22:02.842
Kang Sin-jin knows about what happened.

00:22:08.722 --> 00:22:09.723
To be frank

00:22:13.102 --> 00:22:14.437
my father had

00:22:15.104 --> 00:22:16.480
an issue.

00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:21.652
He was protesting against the demolition

00:22:22.528 --> 00:22:23.988
and was imprisoned

00:22:24.655 --> 00:22:25.990
for aggravated assault.

00:22:27.825 --> 00:22:28.826
How unfortunate.

00:22:32.705 --> 00:22:33.914
But that's all in the past.

00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:39.587
MANWOL

00:22:40.921 --> 00:22:42.423
Alright, see you around, then.

00:22:58.439 --> 00:22:59.690
What a ridiculous combo.

00:23:02.818 --> 00:23:05.404
I have a bad feeling about Judge Lee.

00:23:06.864 --> 00:23:09.366
Why? Because of the sinkhole case?

00:23:10.993 --> 00:23:12.703
No, he'll be good in court.

00:23:12.786 --> 00:23:14.455
You've seen him in the Chungnam Court.

00:23:14.663 --> 00:23:15.706
What else, then?

00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:18.959
The first day
Judge Lee came to work in Seoul

00:23:19.043 --> 00:23:21.754
I saw him coming out of Mr. Kang's office.

00:23:22.963 --> 00:23:24.006
And it seems

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.091
that they had lunch together today.

00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:33.766
I'm sure he has a good reason.

00:23:42.566 --> 00:23:44.818
Would you like me to do it?

00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:45.903
Look here, Byeon.

00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:50.115
You think I'm doing this
because I have too much free time?

00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:53.494
With every letter I glue down

00:23:53.577 --> 00:23:56.038
with all my might

00:23:56.872 --> 00:23:58.415
it feels like I'm stuffing trash

00:23:58.499 --> 00:24:00.834
down that bitch's throat.

00:24:01.502 --> 00:24:03.337
You have no idea how satisfying it is.

00:24:04.213 --> 00:24:06.173
Why would I leave such a fun job to you?

00:24:07.424 --> 00:24:08.425
But wait.

00:24:08.842 --> 00:24:11.554
People these days
don't spell out the word "you."

00:24:11.637 --> 00:24:12.930
Don't they just write "u"?

00:24:13.013 --> 00:24:15.266
Yes, that's short for "you."

00:24:15.349 --> 00:24:17.810
Right? I knew it.

00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:21.063
Nobody has time to spell everything right.

00:24:21.897 --> 00:24:23.023
That's how it should be.

00:24:25.651 --> 00:24:27.903
Alright, I'm all done.

00:24:27.987 --> 00:24:29.822
- Glove off.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:32.449 --> 00:24:33.492
What?

00:24:34.118 --> 00:24:35.286
What's this?

00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:41.959
You know Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

00:24:42.918 --> 00:24:43.961
Leave it to her.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.755
I know she's crazy

00:24:47.047 --> 00:24:49.592
but a Minister of Justice candidate is...

00:24:50.426 --> 00:24:52.219
I'll take full responsibility.

00:24:53.887 --> 00:24:55.806
Yes, sir.

00:25:04.106 --> 00:25:06.233
Can't believe
I sent my kid abroad to study

00:25:06.317 --> 00:25:07.526
for this bullshit.

00:25:36.805 --> 00:25:37.890
Honey.

00:25:37.973 --> 00:25:38.974
Honey!

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:42.227
There are suspicious cars outside.

00:25:42.311 --> 00:25:43.520
What's going on?

00:25:49.026 --> 00:25:50.194
Yes, Mr. Chu.

00:25:51.904 --> 00:25:52.905
I don't think

00:25:53.447 --> 00:25:54.990
they're coming tonight.

00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:56.116
Is that so?

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.452
Time to cast the bait, then.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.954
Offer double the settlement money.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.749
If that's not enough, keep doubling it.

00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:06.377
They're greedy for cash.

00:26:06.835 --> 00:26:08.754
They'll come when they smell it.

00:26:10.047 --> 00:26:11.048
Are you busy?

00:26:11.131 --> 00:26:13.884
How many times do I have to tell you
you have to say hello first?

00:26:14.343 --> 00:26:15.386
Let's meet.

00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:17.012
Aren't you going to say hi?

00:26:17.262 --> 00:26:19.807
It's about time you thank me
for helping you move to Seoul.

00:26:20.557 --> 00:26:21.892
I'll thank you, alright?

00:26:21.975 --> 00:26:25.521
Well, I can't break or manipulate the law,
so there's basically nothing I can do.

00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:27.606
Let's get dinner together.

00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:29.358
You're giving me the creeps.

00:26:29.441 --> 00:26:31.944
Have dinner with me,
and we'll call it even.

00:26:32.486 --> 00:26:33.487
Really?

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:35.447
You can't take it back, okay?

00:26:35.531 --> 00:26:36.949
I won't.

00:26:37.241 --> 00:26:38.325
But

00:26:40.244 --> 00:26:42.705
you know that junior colleague
in the prosecution?

00:26:47.459 --> 00:26:48.502
Come and sit.

00:26:53.382 --> 00:26:56.427
There's no way I'm closing
CEO Jang's offshore tax evasion case.

00:26:58.429 --> 00:26:59.430
Do whatever you want.

00:26:59.972 --> 00:27:01.098
Love your spirit.

00:27:07.438 --> 00:27:08.439
What's this?

00:27:09.732 --> 00:27:10.858
A part of the set.

00:27:11.442 --> 00:27:12.901
Do your thing with this, too.

00:27:13.193 --> 00:27:14.403
You're the only one

00:27:15.446 --> 00:27:16.447
I can trust.

00:27:25.164 --> 00:27:27.708
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A

00:27:28.751 --> 00:27:29.793
Drugs?

00:27:32.129 --> 00:27:33.505
Damn it.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.093
She's well-educated.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.556
LETTER OF ADMISSION

00:27:43.265 --> 00:27:44.641
Woo Hee-young?

00:27:48.812 --> 00:27:50.773
FATHER, WOO GYO-HUN
MOTHER, HAN YEON-HWA

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.191
Woo Gyo-hun?

00:27:54.026 --> 00:27:55.152
Woo Gyo-hun...

00:27:59.948 --> 00:28:02.367
Woo Gyo-hun,
the Minister of Justice candidate?

00:28:05.996 --> 00:28:08.540
Why is he handing me a ticking time bomb?

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:11.418
Damn it.

00:28:14.379 --> 00:28:15.798
PARK CHEOL-WOO

00:28:16.882 --> 00:28:18.008
Hey, Cheol-woo.

00:28:19.343 --> 00:28:21.053
Are you free after work tonight?

00:28:21.136 --> 00:28:22.179
Tonight?

00:28:22.262 --> 00:28:23.430
Do you have plans already?

00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:28.060
No, not really.

00:28:29.436 --> 00:28:30.437
Where should we meet?

00:28:30.521 --> 00:28:32.272
About the road collapse.

00:28:32.648 --> 00:28:34.274
Taemyeong Construction built it

00:28:34.566 --> 00:28:37.903
and rumors say Mayor Chu is
the real boss there.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.115
I expected as much
from someone of his caliber.

00:28:42.199 --> 00:28:43.826
I guess he's a gangster, after all.

00:28:50.624 --> 00:28:52.960
Are both Defendant and Plaintiff here?

00:28:53.043 --> 00:28:55.295
I'm Hong Sang-gi,
the Plaintiff's representative.

00:28:57.464 --> 00:29:00.676
Hello, I'm Attorney Yu Ha-na
from Haenal Law Firm.

00:29:02.219 --> 00:29:04.471
It's been a hot minute,
my dear sister-in-law.

00:29:11.979 --> 00:29:13.063
Hello.

00:29:17.901 --> 00:29:18.902
Oh.

00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:20.529
Se-hee's blind date?

00:29:20.612 --> 00:29:21.613
Yes.

00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:26.159
A single judge in a civil division?

00:29:26.618 --> 00:29:28.745
- Yes.
- Great, then.

00:29:29.872 --> 00:29:32.332
We needed someone in the civil division.

00:29:33.917 --> 00:29:35.252
Going forward, run your verdicts by me

00:29:35.335 --> 00:29:37.963
before finalizing them
for any cases represented by Haenal.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.341
Sorry?

00:29:43.886 --> 00:29:45.387
Why are you so surprised?

00:29:46.305 --> 00:29:49.182
You don't expect me
to write the verdict, too, do you?

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:50.851
Oh...

00:29:50.934 --> 00:29:52.311
You got fast-tracked to Seoul

00:29:52.394 --> 00:29:54.354
as soon as you became
my family's son-in-law.

00:29:54.438 --> 00:29:55.939
That wasn't for free.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.068
At least we don't care
about your education or family.

00:30:00.152 --> 00:30:01.945
Just as long as you're obedient.

00:30:13.582 --> 00:30:16.084
Firstly, I'd like to express deep regret

00:30:16.168 --> 00:30:18.045
to all the victims in the sinkhole case...

00:30:18.128 --> 00:30:19.379
What victims?

00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:21.882
Sorry?

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:25.886
One died

00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:28.221
and some

00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:30.098
got injured

00:30:30.724 --> 00:30:31.850
right?

00:30:32.225 --> 00:30:34.227
Are you asking me, the judge,
to answer that?

00:30:36.188 --> 00:30:38.398
No, it's nothing like that.

00:30:38.482 --> 00:30:39.775
You just caught me off-guard.

00:30:39.858 --> 00:30:41.151
PLAINTIFF

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:51.244
MEDIATION ROOM

00:30:59.127 --> 00:31:00.128
It's me.

00:31:00.212 --> 00:31:01.546
The court date will be scheduled soon.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.758
This is a special request
from Assemblyman Kang of the ruling party.

00:31:05.342 --> 00:31:06.510
You sure you can win?

00:31:06.969 --> 00:31:08.178
Don't worry.

00:31:08.595 --> 00:31:10.138
I even have an insurance policy.

00:31:12.474 --> 00:31:14.559
Mr. Heo, you said you'd work with me

00:31:14.643 --> 00:31:16.979
to spread the word about this case.

00:31:17.604 --> 00:31:20.732
You have to tell me
exactly what happened that day.

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:23.276
I'm sorry.

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:28.115
- Sir.
- Honey

00:31:28.198 --> 00:31:30.367
- they must be back again.
- Mr. Heo!

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.245
- Mr. Heo!
- I'll call the police.

00:31:33.328 --> 00:31:35.288
- Wait, Ms. Song.
- Are you inside?

00:31:39.126 --> 00:31:40.711
They'll definitely return.

00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:42.921
Don't fight them. Just agree to settle.

00:31:43.005 --> 00:31:44.172
I'll expose Yong-jin

00:31:44.256 --> 00:31:46.717
and all his illegal acts in court.

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:49.344
I'm going to settle.

00:31:50.804 --> 00:31:52.723
- What?
- Honey!

00:31:54.016 --> 00:31:56.143
It's okay. You can open the door.

00:31:56.226 --> 00:31:58.311
- Dong-gi.
- It's fine.

00:31:59.271 --> 00:32:00.313
Let them in.

00:32:07.904 --> 00:32:10.157
I don't want to be hurt anymore

00:32:10.323 --> 00:32:12.617
and my Min-gu will understand.

00:32:13.785 --> 00:32:16.705
You might regret this later.

00:32:16.788 --> 00:32:18.331
I'll call the cops

00:32:18.415 --> 00:32:19.708
and write all about this.

00:32:19.791 --> 00:32:20.876
Ms. Song

00:32:22.127 --> 00:32:25.422
thanks for everything. I mean it.

00:32:28.175 --> 00:32:31.636
But please respect my decision this time.

00:32:32.387 --> 00:32:33.638
Please.

00:32:34.514 --> 00:32:36.058
Please don't say anything.

00:32:37.434 --> 00:32:38.560
Mr. Heo...

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.647
My, my.

00:32:42.731 --> 00:32:45.192
I'm tired of coming back, alright?

00:32:52.741 --> 00:32:54.284
Count carefully.

00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:56.036
That's 100 million right there.

00:32:57.579 --> 00:33:00.248
Is 100 million won enough?

00:33:00.582 --> 00:33:02.209
From the looks of those thugs

00:33:02.292 --> 00:33:03.835
they'd skin you from head to toe

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:05.378
if you don't pay them back.

00:33:06.046 --> 00:33:08.340
Dong-gi, what is he talking about?

00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:10.217
Mr. Heo!

00:33:10.592 --> 00:33:11.635
It's okay.

00:33:12.135 --> 00:33:15.013
You think those loansharks took him

00:33:15.097 --> 00:33:16.890
on a sweet little picnic or what?

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:18.809
Man, you’re clueless.

00:33:23.939 --> 00:33:24.981
All good now?

00:33:33.698 --> 00:33:34.908
When you see them

00:33:35.492 --> 00:33:37.202
tell them I miss them dearly.

00:33:37.828 --> 00:33:38.912
Don't forget.

00:33:42.207 --> 00:33:43.250
Goodbye, then.

00:33:47.963 --> 00:33:49.005
Mr. Heo.

00:33:49.381 --> 00:33:51.341
No, I'll report them to the police.

00:33:51.424 --> 00:33:52.467
Honey!

00:33:56.847 --> 00:33:57.973
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

00:33:58.265 --> 00:34:01.685
PLAINTIFF HEO DONG-GI

00:34:05.063 --> 00:34:06.731
Mr. Kang!

00:34:06.815 --> 00:34:07.858
Yes.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.486
I closed the last settlement deal.

00:34:12.112 --> 00:34:13.113
Yes.

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:24.207
Ms. Kim?

00:34:33.133 --> 00:34:34.134
Oh...

00:34:40.015 --> 00:34:41.057
Where are you?

00:34:47.856 --> 00:34:49.691
- Jin-a!
- Hey, Cheol-woo.

00:34:53.278 --> 00:34:55.572
He's a judge I've known
since Chungcheongnam-do.

00:34:55.655 --> 00:34:57.240
She's Kim Jin-a, the upright prosecutor

00:34:57.324 --> 00:34:59.242
a junior prosecutor
at the Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

00:35:00.035 --> 00:35:01.453
Hello, I'm Lee Han-young.

00:35:01.536 --> 00:35:03.163
I'm Kim Jin-a.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.373
What's going on?

00:35:05.457 --> 00:35:08.418
Sorry, I double-booked myself.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.049
I've actually come today
to discuss something with you.

00:35:14.132 --> 00:35:16.176
- Huh?
- Let's meet another time.

00:35:16.676 --> 00:35:18.970
I guess you can't tell him around a judge?

00:35:19.888 --> 00:35:20.931
Sorry?

00:35:21.348 --> 00:35:23.808
You can't say what you want
around a judge?

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.105
Isn't it a bit early to be crossing lines?

00:35:29.189 --> 00:35:30.273
What are you doing?

00:35:30.357 --> 00:35:32.150
- Me?
- Cheol-woo

00:35:32.859 --> 00:35:34.736
- see you next time.
- Okay.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.197
I guess it's something shameful?

00:35:46.373 --> 00:35:47.374
Hey!

00:35:47.999 --> 00:35:49.501
We've met before.

00:35:53.046 --> 00:35:54.047
In our previous lives?

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.675
Oh

00:35:57.509 --> 00:35:59.219
you pretended to know me

00:36:00.011 --> 00:36:01.721
a few mornings ago, right?

00:36:01.805 --> 00:36:03.640
- Nope.
- No?

00:36:03.723 --> 00:36:06.559
Whoever he thought I was,
he waved at me like we were old pals.

00:36:06.643 --> 00:36:09.187
I was waving at my friend
who also moved from the Chungnam Court.

00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:10.647
No, you two were so awkward.

00:36:11.481 --> 00:36:14.276
You know what's really awkward?

00:36:14.359 --> 00:36:17.445
A nobody prosecutor going
after the Ministry of Justice candidate.

00:36:21.783 --> 00:36:23.618
You double-booked yourself on purpose,
huh?

00:36:23.702 --> 00:36:25.036
What do you think you're doing?

00:36:25.537 --> 00:36:27.163
You just said you wanted to say hi.

00:36:27.247 --> 00:36:28.248
Prosecutor Park!

00:36:28.331 --> 00:36:29.416
I'm sorry.

00:36:30.834 --> 00:36:33.420
Prosecutor Park owes me one.

00:36:33.795 --> 00:36:34.796
I see.

00:36:36.006 --> 00:36:38.216
I'd really better get going.

00:36:38.842 --> 00:36:40.510
Enjoy your dinner.

00:36:44.931 --> 00:36:46.808
- What are you...
- "I love u"?

00:36:49.185 --> 00:36:50.979
"I love u"!

00:36:51.855 --> 00:36:54.024
I hope

00:36:54.399 --> 00:36:56.443
my dear Prosecutor Kim Jin-a realizes

00:36:56.818 --> 00:36:58.653
how much I love her.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.368
Isn't this blood?

00:37:05.785 --> 00:37:06.870
Wow.

00:37:07.412 --> 00:37:09.998
He loves you so much
that he vomited blood.

00:37:15.003 --> 00:37:16.004
Oh.

00:37:16.629 --> 00:37:19.090
Must be from one of those guys
I locked up in jail.

00:37:19.758 --> 00:37:20.967
It's made with love.

00:37:21.051 --> 00:37:22.802
Not a bad souvenir.

00:37:23.219 --> 00:37:25.930
Looks like it's from someone
you failed to lock up in jail.

00:37:27.807 --> 00:37:31.102
How long are you going to let CEO Jang
send these little souvenirs?

00:37:31.853 --> 00:37:33.646
CEO Jang Tae-sik of S Shopping?

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.190
Bust Woo Gyo-hun's daughter.

00:37:35.273 --> 00:37:37.442
Then, I'll help you bust Jang Tae-sik.

00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:40.362
Didn't know you were a pathological liar.

00:37:40.445 --> 00:37:43.156
Bust Woo Hee-young and stop her daddy
from becoming the Minister.

00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:44.699
I'm the mastermind behind it.

00:37:50.163 --> 00:37:52.499
Didn't you want to bust Jang Tae-sik?

00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:56.586
Mr. Woo's confirmation hearing would be
the perfect day for it.

00:38:05.053 --> 00:38:07.097
I'd like to pay, please.

00:38:08.264 --> 00:38:09.849
Oh, Mr. Lee!

00:38:10.308 --> 00:38:11.309
Hey.

00:38:14.687 --> 00:38:15.730
I'm hungry.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.949
Mr. Lee, are you hungry?

00:38:29.536 --> 00:38:30.620
Your credit card, please.

00:38:37.127 --> 00:38:38.128
Wow!

00:38:38.211 --> 00:38:40.422
I made it for you. It looks like you.

00:38:40.505 --> 00:38:42.799
Me? Is that why he's smiling?

00:38:43.383 --> 00:38:44.843
So, Judge Lee.

00:38:45.218 --> 00:38:46.344
What's he really like?

00:38:48.388 --> 00:38:49.556
I don't know much, either.

00:38:50.348 --> 00:38:54.018
But I think I know what lies in his heart.

00:38:55.603 --> 00:38:56.980
It's not justice.

00:38:57.522 --> 00:38:59.107
Instead, there's animosity.

00:39:00.608 --> 00:39:02.777
He empathizes with the victims
a little too much.

00:39:06.156 --> 00:39:07.699
That's dangerous.

00:39:18.668 --> 00:39:20.545
This bastard!

00:40:04.005 --> 00:40:06.633
This is for you. I know you're into this.

00:40:16.142 --> 00:40:19.187
Didn't know you were so cute, Mr. Jang.

00:40:24.984 --> 00:40:26.986
I wanted something bolder.

00:40:30.907 --> 00:40:31.991
I'm disappointed.

00:40:36.996 --> 00:40:40.041
Guess you didn't like my love letter.

00:40:41.292 --> 00:40:44.128
Should I have gone
with something more normal?

00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:48.174
Here.

00:40:49.175 --> 00:40:50.176
Finish it.

00:40:52.762 --> 00:40:54.764
- Let's go, Byeon.
- Yes, sir.

00:41:15.201 --> 00:41:17.662
So, that prosecutor bitch's dad is
in the hospital?

00:41:17.745 --> 00:41:18.746
Yes, sir.

00:41:19.038 --> 00:41:21.666
Most of her salary goes to pay
for his hospital bills

00:41:21.749 --> 00:41:23.793
so she just lives in a shoebox apartment.

00:41:25.003 --> 00:41:27.005
What a crazy bitch.

00:41:27.088 --> 00:41:29.007
She thinks she can live off her wage

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.509
just by being a prosecutor?

00:41:31.593 --> 00:41:32.927
I know, right?

00:41:34.596 --> 00:41:35.597
What should I do?

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.931
What else?

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:41.436
Time to shove money down her throat
until she chokes.

00:41:42.312 --> 00:41:44.522
She's just not tasted
the power of money yet.

00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:49.277
What a funny bitch.

00:41:53.406 --> 00:41:56.075
Hey, why aren't they coming?

00:41:56.618 --> 00:41:58.119
What if he already paid them off?

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.164
Nobody from the family has stepped
out of the house.

00:42:03.499 --> 00:42:06.336
Why aren't those bastards getting to work?

00:42:06.419 --> 00:42:08.087
How do they get all their money?

00:42:10.632 --> 00:42:13.468
Hey, are you sure you paid him right?

00:42:14.761 --> 00:42:15.762
Yes, sir.

00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:29.025
A civic group should've filed a case

00:42:29.609 --> 00:42:31.819
regarding your stock parking by now.

00:42:34.447 --> 00:42:35.657
What did you just say?

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.033
Who would do that?

00:42:38.743 --> 00:42:41.537
Wait, today is Saturday.

00:42:42.914 --> 00:42:44.332
They have until 1 p.m.

00:42:51.881 --> 00:42:53.174
So, what do I do now?

00:42:54.634 --> 00:42:58.638
"It's not appropriate for me
to comment on an ongoing investigation."

00:43:00.223 --> 00:43:01.849
Just say that.

00:43:10.024 --> 00:43:12.360
What a pain.

00:43:18.866 --> 00:43:20.743
Okay.

00:43:24.288 --> 00:43:26.332
WOO GYO-HUN REFUSES TO COMMENT
ON STOCK PARKING ALLEGATIONS

00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:28.209
SAYING IT'S AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION

00:43:28.292 --> 00:43:30.712
It already smells like a set-up.

00:43:34.924 --> 00:43:36.050
Alright!

00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:39.095
It's rent collection day, so it's on me.

00:43:39.429 --> 00:43:40.972
What, you own a whole building now?

00:43:42.932 --> 00:43:43.933
This is mine.

00:43:48.396 --> 00:43:50.148
Huh? You actually own this building?

00:43:50.231 --> 00:43:51.357
You didn't know?

00:43:51.441 --> 00:43:52.483
Of course not!

00:43:55.111 --> 00:43:57.947
You could've even paid for my car.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.616
I can't do that.
That'd cause you big trouble.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.493
Isn't there a law against that?

00:44:03.911 --> 00:44:06.497
MY SON HAS FALLEN,
AND I AM STILL STANDING THERE

00:44:08.082 --> 00:44:09.667
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:44:14.714 --> 00:44:15.798
Hello.

00:44:15.882 --> 00:44:17.049
Hi, Ms. Song.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:19.385
One of the victims in the sinkhole case

00:44:19.844 --> 00:44:22.764
lost his pet dog.
Would you like to see him?

00:44:23.723 --> 00:44:25.057
No.

00:44:25.433 --> 00:44:27.560
The only sinkhole victim I'm focusing on

00:44:27.643 --> 00:44:30.772
is the one who lost his son.

00:44:30.855 --> 00:44:32.482
That's why I'm telling you to see him.

00:44:32.565 --> 00:44:33.816
It'll help you.

00:44:36.444 --> 00:44:39.155
Aren't you a team with Ms. Yu Se-hee?

00:44:39.238 --> 00:44:41.741
Haenal wouldn't appreciate you doing this.

00:44:41.824 --> 00:44:43.618
Judges don't take sides.

00:44:43.701 --> 00:44:44.827
I'll send you the address.

00:44:47.497 --> 00:44:49.457
Who is it? A woman?

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.833
No, a reporter.

00:44:51.167 --> 00:44:54.086
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG:
12, CHOLIM-RO, NAMMYEON DISTRICT, SEOUL

00:44:54.879 --> 00:44:57.173
Does he really think I'd go?

00:44:57.548 --> 00:44:59.050
He's not even on my side.

00:45:00.593 --> 00:45:02.261
Judges don't take sides.

00:45:02.553 --> 00:45:04.514
My gosh.

00:45:08.684 --> 00:45:09.727
You know what?

00:45:10.311 --> 00:45:12.313
Reporters don't take sides, either.

00:45:12.688 --> 00:45:14.023
Let's go.

00:45:23.616 --> 00:45:24.700
Who's there?

00:45:25.493 --> 00:45:28.955
Hello, I'm Song Na-yeon,
a reporter at Daejin Daily.

00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:33.584
BAMTOL

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:40.758
Nice to meet you.

00:45:42.176 --> 00:45:43.427
What brings you here?

00:45:45.054 --> 00:45:48.266
HAND-PULLED SUJEBI AND KALGUKSU

00:46:03.197 --> 00:46:05.032
Could you tell me

00:46:05.116 --> 00:46:07.285
what happened?

00:46:10.955 --> 00:46:15.543
I spotted an odd crack in the road
the day before the accident

00:46:15.626 --> 00:46:19.005
so I reported it to the District Office.

00:46:19.088 --> 00:46:20.298
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

00:46:20.381 --> 00:46:21.507
PLAINTIFF LEE JANG-SEOK

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.514
DEFENDANT

00:46:30.266 --> 00:46:33.895
The Plaintiffs and the Defendant seem
to have reached an agreement.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:38.482
Yes, Your Honor.
All 12 Plaintiffs agreed on a settlement.

00:46:39.817 --> 00:46:40.902
Okay, then.

00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:43.738
I'll respect the mutual agreement

00:46:44.864 --> 00:46:46.324
and conclude the case.

00:46:47.408 --> 00:46:48.492
Good work.

00:46:50.244 --> 00:46:51.370
Your Honor!

00:46:51.746 --> 00:46:54.582
There's proof
that the Defendant coerced a settlement.

00:46:56.667 --> 00:46:57.752
Wait!

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:03.674
Hello, you represent Mr. Heo Dong-gi,
right?

00:47:04.467 --> 00:47:05.635
Yes.

00:47:05.718 --> 00:47:08.012
This is a video
of a Nammyeon District officer

00:47:08.095 --> 00:47:10.306
coercing the victim to settle.

00:47:11.766 --> 00:47:13.476
- Your Honor!
- Overruled.

00:47:14.602 --> 00:47:16.187
- What?
- Sit.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:26.197
A million won is plenty
for a damn dog's death.

00:47:26.697 --> 00:47:28.282
What more do you want?

00:47:28.366 --> 00:47:30.034
The sinkhole didn't kill just a dog.

00:47:30.117 --> 00:47:32.328
It killed my family!

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:34.872
You got a dog stroller, too?

00:47:34.956 --> 00:47:37.124
- That's right!
- Serve the nation. Have kids instead.

00:47:37.208 --> 00:47:38.960
You're doing a disservice to the country!

00:47:39.502 --> 00:47:40.628
What, you bastard?

00:47:40.711 --> 00:47:42.254
Where did they get that?

00:47:48.052 --> 00:47:49.553
What's that doing there?

00:47:49.637 --> 00:47:50.846
Turn it off right now!

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:51.931
Just be quiet!

00:47:53.724 --> 00:47:54.934
What the hell?

00:47:57.687 --> 00:48:00.606
Seems like there was an agreement,
but it wasn't consensual.

00:48:01.524 --> 00:48:03.776
Your Honor, based on the video

00:48:03.859 --> 00:48:06.529
we cannot deny
that there were some unfortunate acts.

00:48:06.612 --> 00:48:09.615
However, that's just one officer
going rogue.

00:48:09.699 --> 00:48:10.700
You cannot assume

00:48:10.783 --> 00:48:12.618
all other victims were also coerced

00:48:12.702 --> 00:48:13.869
based on just one video.

00:48:13.953 --> 00:48:15.496
It's not just one case.

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:17.164
I've confirmed

00:48:17.248 --> 00:48:19.417
the restaurant owner behind the complaint
was also threatened.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.503
What did the District Office employees
come and say to you?

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.380
What else?

00:48:24.839 --> 00:48:26.173
They didn't even come.

00:48:26.257 --> 00:48:28.718
What? They didn't even come?

00:48:28.801 --> 00:48:29.927
To assess the situation?

00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:32.138
Not at all. No officers here.

00:48:33.597 --> 00:48:35.975
Not anyone who looked
even remotely connected to the District.

00:48:36.058 --> 00:48:39.103
The office claims they checked the site
upon receiving the report

00:48:39.186 --> 00:48:41.689
and didn't find any issues.

00:48:43.357 --> 00:48:47.236
You haven't told this to anyone, have you?

00:48:47.319 --> 00:48:49.155
I tried!

00:48:50.114 --> 00:48:53.993
I saw Mayor Chu lying bluntly on TV

00:48:54.618 --> 00:48:55.911
so I got mad.

00:48:55.995 --> 00:48:59.248
I tried to tell the reporters
who came to see the sinkhole

00:48:59.331 --> 00:49:02.376
that Mayor Chu was lying

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.712
but someone came from behind

00:49:05.546 --> 00:49:07.673
and grabbed my shoulders.

00:49:08.299 --> 00:49:09.550
This guy came

00:49:10.092 --> 00:49:11.719
and stared right through me.

00:49:12.053 --> 00:49:13.095
I got so scared

00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:15.056
that I couldn't say anything.

00:49:16.807 --> 00:49:17.808
Is that so?

00:49:24.148 --> 00:49:27.193
This means we'll have to see

00:49:27.276 --> 00:49:30.780
if the other Plaintiffs were also coerced
into settling.

00:49:31.614 --> 00:49:32.865
Your Honor!

00:49:32.948 --> 00:49:33.991
Overruled.

00:49:37.078 --> 00:49:39.455
What the officer did in the clip was

00:49:39.872 --> 00:49:42.208
an act of assault and coercion.

00:49:42.875 --> 00:49:44.668
This constitutes a criminal offense

00:49:44.752 --> 00:49:46.462
and there is clear proof of it.

00:49:48.547 --> 00:49:50.341
Please face your criminal charges first.

00:49:51.342 --> 00:49:53.636
A criminal trial?
What are you going to do now?

00:49:54.053 --> 00:49:56.472
It's on you for threatening the victims!

00:49:56.555 --> 00:49:57.598
No, I...

00:49:59.308 --> 00:50:01.352
You're kidding me!

00:50:03.187 --> 00:50:05.856
This is only the start.

00:50:06.565 --> 00:50:07.983
As the trial's outcome depends

00:50:08.067 --> 00:50:10.194
on the outcome of the criminal case

00:50:10.277 --> 00:50:11.862
this civil case will be postponed

00:50:11.946 --> 00:50:15.074
until the criminal case is concluded.

00:50:15.866 --> 00:50:17.993
We'll soon find out

00:50:18.077 --> 00:50:19.745
why he had to resort to violence and rush

00:50:20.204 --> 00:50:23.290
just to settle mere 500 million won.

00:50:24.708 --> 00:50:26.836
To start, go to the prosecution
for your investigation.

00:50:27.711 --> 00:50:28.712
That is all.

00:50:48.983 --> 00:50:50.025
Good work.

00:50:50.651 --> 00:50:51.652
It's nothing.

00:50:59.118 --> 00:51:01.954
Someone played a clip
of a district employee beating a victim.

00:51:02.037 --> 00:51:04.248
Judge Lee requested
the prosecution to investigate.

00:51:05.291 --> 00:51:07.793
But the prosecutor in charge is

00:51:08.544 --> 00:51:11.338
Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo

00:51:11.755 --> 00:51:13.132
who helped Judge Lee catch
the serial killer.

00:51:14.216 --> 00:51:16.552
They were hired in Seoul
around the same time.

00:51:18.012 --> 00:51:19.305
If Mayor Chu gets busted

00:51:19.388 --> 00:51:21.432
it'll put Assemblyman Kang at risk.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.436
How much money went into Kang's funds?

00:51:26.395 --> 00:51:27.855
Around two billion won.

00:51:29.899 --> 00:51:31.400
Tell Assemblyman Kang

00:51:31.483 --> 00:51:33.027
to cut off all ties with Mayor Chu

00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:34.778
and to erase all traces.

00:51:35.613 --> 00:51:36.739
Yes, sir.

00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:38.699
But

00:51:40.075 --> 00:51:42.453
what are you going to do with Judge Lee?

00:51:44.622 --> 00:51:46.040
I don't believe

00:51:46.749 --> 00:51:48.584
Judge Lee is one of us.

00:51:51.253 --> 00:51:52.796
You think I don't know that?

00:51:55.049 --> 00:51:56.508
They found a video of the victims

00:51:56.592 --> 00:51:58.636
being coerced into settlement
by the officers.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:01.639
I guess it'll be a criminal case, then.

00:52:01.722 --> 00:52:02.932
Yes, Mr. Baek.

00:52:03.265 --> 00:52:04.308
That's enough of that.

00:52:07.728 --> 00:52:09.480
Don't you have something to tell me?

00:52:10.272 --> 00:52:11.315
What does he mean?

00:52:11.649 --> 00:52:13.192
Is he suspecting something?

00:52:16.946 --> 00:52:18.906
I apologize
for not concluding the case myself

00:52:19.698 --> 00:52:21.784
when you trusted me with it.

00:52:23.702 --> 00:52:24.912
That's okay.

00:52:25.246 --> 00:52:27.164
Come anytime
if you have anything to tell me.

00:52:27.706 --> 00:52:29.124
Or a favor to ask me.

00:52:31.293 --> 00:52:33.587
CHIEF JUDGE OFFICE

00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:39.510
It's too early to tell him the truth.

00:52:47.476 --> 00:52:49.812
How did this end up playing
in the middle of the trial?

00:52:51.689 --> 00:52:53.440
Mayor Chu is in a gang.

00:52:54.066 --> 00:52:56.735
He must've used his guys
to coerce the victims into settling.

00:52:59.196 --> 00:53:01.782
All our clients are veteran criminals.

00:53:02.157 --> 00:53:04.326
It doesn't matter
if he's a gangster or a murderer.

00:53:04.535 --> 00:53:06.203
You should've been more prepared.

00:53:06.287 --> 00:53:07.454
Zip it.

00:53:07.538 --> 00:53:08.789
Handle it, alright?

00:53:09.331 --> 00:53:10.708
While minimizing the risk.

00:53:11.083 --> 00:53:12.209
Okay.

00:53:15.754 --> 00:53:18.132
Oh, my, what's with the glum faces?

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:21.302
Don't I look great?

00:53:21.969 --> 00:53:23.429
The insurance was no help.

00:53:23.762 --> 00:53:24.972
Clean it and put it back.

00:53:25.055 --> 00:53:26.265
Whatever.

00:53:26.348 --> 00:53:29.310
You know
how expensive the cancellation fee is.

00:53:31.353 --> 00:53:32.396
Well...

00:53:35.274 --> 00:53:36.358
Hello.

00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:40.487
I figured you must be quite stressed
about Mayor Chu's case.

00:53:41.488 --> 00:53:44.158
That's nothing to stress over.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:48.370
That's Judge Lee Han-young.

00:53:49.038 --> 00:53:50.664
He'll be our family soon.

00:53:51.415 --> 00:53:52.624
Family? Who says?

00:53:54.168 --> 00:53:56.545
- Yu Jin-gwang.
- Lee Han-young.

00:53:56.628 --> 00:53:57.963
It's been a minute, Jin-gwang.

00:53:58.047 --> 00:54:00.049
Presiding Judge Lee Han-young.

00:54:01.008 --> 00:54:02.801
Here's a delivery for you.

00:54:03.218 --> 00:54:04.219
What is it?

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.555
The final verdict for S Group's case.

00:54:07.348 --> 00:54:09.475
You'll have to write
the final verdict of your life

00:54:09.725 --> 00:54:11.393
in prison.

00:54:11.477 --> 00:54:12.686
What a handsome guy.

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:13.854
Have a seat.

00:54:21.904 --> 00:54:23.197
If you're so worried about us

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.158
you shouldn't have accepted
the victim's video as proof.

00:54:28.035 --> 00:54:31.080
If I dismissed the case,
even with a clip of the coercion

00:54:31.622 --> 00:54:33.040
the press and the Plaintiffs

00:54:33.123 --> 00:54:36.085
would've questioned
my ties to Haenal Law Firm.

00:54:37.169 --> 00:54:39.505
A judge has to be fair, indeed.

00:54:40.297 --> 00:54:41.423
Dad!

00:54:43.258 --> 00:54:44.968
Mayor Chu will be exposed

00:54:45.052 --> 00:54:46.970
for funneling illegal funds soon.

00:54:48.305 --> 00:54:49.515
Are you sure?

00:54:49.598 --> 00:54:50.766
Cutting him off will be

00:54:50.849 --> 00:54:53.560
the firm's best way
of minimizing the risks.

00:54:58.649 --> 00:55:01.944
That's unfortunate for my client.

00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:06.073
BEEF ENTRAILS

00:55:12.371 --> 00:55:15.332
I wondered why people ever chose this
over all the good food

00:55:15.416 --> 00:55:16.959
but this is seriously good.

00:55:25.217 --> 00:55:26.218
Eat up.

00:55:26.301 --> 00:55:27.428
Don't worry.

00:55:29.096 --> 00:55:30.889
Two more orders of the intestines!

00:55:30.973 --> 00:55:32.683
Okay, coming!

00:55:35.227 --> 00:55:36.228
Please!

00:55:46.905 --> 00:55:48.866
Drink slowly.

00:55:49.616 --> 00:55:50.826
Do you come here often?

00:55:51.493 --> 00:55:53.620
This is where Se-hee said
she'd only have one piece

00:55:53.704 --> 00:55:55.998
and had three servings
in our previous lives.

00:55:56.457 --> 00:55:57.499
Have some.

00:55:58.417 --> 00:56:00.544
I've been here with a colleague.

00:56:02.379 --> 00:56:03.380
Colleen?

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.924
Talk about a ladies' man.

00:56:07.217 --> 00:56:09.011
- What's for Round Two?
- I have plans.

00:56:09.094 --> 00:56:10.304
Don't be such a snob!

00:56:11.221 --> 00:56:12.723
Where are my intestines?

00:56:14.433 --> 00:56:15.601
Is it a girl?

00:56:15.684 --> 00:56:16.727
A colleague.

00:56:17.102 --> 00:56:18.562
Did I ask for her name?

00:56:18.979 --> 00:56:21.607
Why the hell do you keep mentioning
this Colleen girl?

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:22.733
A colleague.

00:56:24.568 --> 00:56:25.736
Yeah, so...

00:56:27.279 --> 00:56:28.489
Someone he knows.

00:56:30.574 --> 00:56:31.825
Someone he knows...

00:56:32.784 --> 00:56:33.827
A colleague.

00:56:36.246 --> 00:56:37.372
Someone he knows...

00:56:40.834 --> 00:56:41.835
This is embarrassing.

00:56:42.878 --> 00:56:44.213
I feel like an idiot!

00:56:49.468 --> 00:56:53.764
PROSECUTION SERVICE

00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:19.957
Mayor Chu is backed by Assemblyman Kang.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.001
If you aren't prepared to take both down,
don't even bother starting.

00:57:35.055 --> 00:57:36.848
You own Taemyeong Construction, don't you?

00:57:41.103 --> 00:57:43.021
It's time for me to take my meds.

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.565
Go ahead.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.028
I don't have any health conditions.

00:57:50.112 --> 00:57:51.405
They're just supplements.

00:57:52.155 --> 00:57:54.283
We, Koreans, can't skip any meal.

00:57:54.908 --> 00:57:57.953
But I've skipped too many
because I was busy doing my mayor work.

00:57:58.036 --> 00:57:59.621
That's what the supplements are for.

00:58:01.999 --> 00:58:03.000
Why do you think

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:05.544
I've called you before Mr. Cheon Hak-su

00:58:06.128 --> 00:58:07.421
who actually beat up people?

00:58:09.464 --> 00:58:11.008
I know Assemblyman Kang

00:58:12.092 --> 00:58:14.094
scrubbed your record
as the Obok gang's boss

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:16.263
to get you elected.

00:58:23.687 --> 00:58:25.647
I didn't know
Mr. Kang ran a cleaning service.

00:58:25.731 --> 00:58:29.067
It was game over for you
the moment you sat down.

00:58:29.151 --> 00:58:30.944
Choose me

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.362
before they abandon you.

00:58:32.696 --> 00:58:34.114
Don't you want to be re-elected?

00:58:45.042 --> 00:58:48.170
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:58:59.056 --> 00:59:00.515
Mr. Chu just left.

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:02.934
Mr. Kang will have a lot on his mind

00:59:03.018 --> 00:59:05.145
once he sees Chu's easy release.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.526
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG JEONG-TAE

00:59:12.527 --> 00:59:13.654
Yes, Mr. Kang.

00:59:13.737 --> 00:59:15.238
Jeong-tae is already calling him.

00:59:16.823 --> 00:59:19.576
Seems like their trust will break
sooner than I expected.

00:59:20.327 --> 00:59:21.328
Did he mention me?

00:59:21.411 --> 00:59:23.372
No, he didn't mention your name.

00:59:23.747 --> 00:59:25.082
You sure about that?

00:59:25.457 --> 00:59:26.541
Of course.

00:59:26.625 --> 00:59:27.751
Alright, then.

00:59:28.585 --> 00:59:31.546
Don't do anything
and wait until I call you.

00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:33.632
Sorry?

00:59:37.552 --> 00:59:38.845
"Wait"?

00:59:39.513 --> 00:59:41.264
What am I, his lapdog?

00:59:42.057 --> 00:59:43.308
Gosh.

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:59.491
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

00:59:59.783 --> 01:00:06.832
SEONHWAGAK

01:00:15.424 --> 01:00:17.968
Mayor Chu should be fine.

01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:21.722
Jeong-tae

01:00:22.222 --> 01:00:25.475
make sure Yong-jin is the only one
getting prosecuted here.

01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:27.227
Yes, sir.

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:28.979
If this affects you, too

01:00:29.062 --> 01:00:31.898
it'll affect your support base
in the next election.

01:00:33.108 --> 01:00:34.192
Sin-jin

01:00:34.276 --> 01:00:36.027
Chu's trial shouldn't affect us, right?

01:00:36.111 --> 01:00:38.822
I hear he was in a gang.

01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:39.990
Is that true?

01:00:42.951 --> 01:00:45.203
Yes, but not anymore.

01:00:45.287 --> 01:00:48.123
He's now just an earnest mayor
who works for the district.

01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:53.962
Why is he the boss
of Taemyeong Construction

01:00:54.045 --> 01:00:56.047
that's full of gangsters, then?

01:00:57.966 --> 01:00:59.634
Oh, man.

01:01:02.596 --> 01:01:05.474
Even the tail can wag the dog
when it’s desperate.

01:01:07.184 --> 01:01:08.226
You mean...

01:01:27.788 --> 01:01:29.706
You have to cut it off before it wags you.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.765
Yes, Mr. Kang.

01:01:47.599 --> 01:01:49.893
Just consider it a holiday

01:01:49.976 --> 01:01:51.478
until things calm down.

01:01:51.895 --> 01:01:52.938
Yes, sir.

01:01:53.396 --> 01:01:55.482
I got it. Okay.

01:02:00.946 --> 01:02:02.405
- It's all good.
- Okay.

01:02:02.948 --> 01:02:04.783
- Everything's ready?
- Yes.

01:02:04.866 --> 01:02:06.159
But

01:02:06.785 --> 01:02:08.286
what if we're stuck there forever?

01:02:08.787 --> 01:02:09.871
You're funny.

01:02:11.498 --> 01:02:13.333
Gosh.

01:02:15.252 --> 01:02:19.422
This is a ledger of all the kickbacks
I've paid Jeong-tae.

01:02:19.506 --> 01:02:20.799
What's he going to do?

01:02:20.882 --> 01:02:23.426
He'd better treat me well

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:27.389
if he wants to stay out of jail
and keep his seat in the government.

01:02:30.517 --> 01:02:32.894
Hak-su, when's the ferry leaving again?

01:02:32.978 --> 01:02:34.855
It departs at 3 a.m.

01:02:34.938 --> 01:02:36.022
Okay.

01:02:36.106 --> 01:02:38.358
I can't be a Mayor again

01:02:38.441 --> 01:02:40.902
so I might as well stick to being
Jeong-tae's upper hand.

01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:43.488
You know how much I've been through

01:02:43.572 --> 01:02:44.948
to save him from trouble.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.075
You're right, boss.

01:02:47.284 --> 01:02:48.451
Hey, Han-young.

01:02:48.535 --> 01:02:51.037
Yong-jin is taking a ferry
in Incheon tonight.

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:53.582
I'll send you the meeting location.

01:02:53.665 --> 01:02:54.666
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE

01:02:54.749 --> 01:02:56.209
I'll get on my way now

01:02:56.293 --> 01:02:58.503
so don't approach him first, okay?

01:03:27.449 --> 01:03:31.870
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE
WE BUY AND SELL USED BOOKS

01:03:44.883 --> 01:03:46.301
Gross.

01:03:46.384 --> 01:03:49.429
The dust in this place will kill me
before I even get on the ferry.

01:03:50.096 --> 01:03:52.474
Just wait a sec.

01:03:53.058 --> 01:03:55.435
- Why?
- I know you get seasick.

01:03:57.312 --> 01:03:58.438
Good boy.

01:03:59.022 --> 01:04:00.023
You can go.

01:04:05.487 --> 01:04:07.447
Gosh.

01:04:41.898 --> 01:04:45.443
LIGHTHOUSE BOOKSTORE
WE BUY AND SELL USED BOOKS

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.703
I knew it.

01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:17.934
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:43.626
How much do you trust me?

01:05:43.793 --> 01:05:46.212
Kang Sin-jin, the Senior Presiding Judge.
He has a bad reputation.

01:05:46.296 --> 01:05:47.338
You know Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo, right?

01:05:47.422 --> 01:05:49.382
Fieldwork is for prosecutors,
not for judges.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.676
Hurry, Prosecutor Kim.

01:05:51.843 --> 01:05:54.763
You'll need to fight for your life
if you choose to start.

01:05:55.055 --> 01:05:57.348
Seems like you've already put your life
on the line.

01:05:59.559 --> 01:06:01.686
I told you I was the mastermind behind it.

01:06:01.936 --> 01:06:04.314
Judge Lee isn't one of us yet.

01:06:04.564 --> 01:06:05.732
I really wonder

01:06:05.815 --> 01:06:07.567
why you approached me.

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:09.861
How much do you trust me?

01:06:13.073 --> 01:06:15.075
