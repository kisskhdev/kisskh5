[Episode 11]
Hold it!

00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:48.505
I have an objection to the contest results.

00:00:49.538 --> 00:00:52.838
I apologize, but during the judging process,

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:55.672
allegations have surfaced
that President Kang Du Jun

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:59.305
gave special treatment
to a specific participant.

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:02.472
That's absurd. In this judging session, I...

00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:05.505
That female employee
President Kang Du Jun is seeing.

00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:10.805
He deliberately gave
first place to that employee.

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:12.901
What?

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.872
- Oh, my.
- Is it real?

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:16.938
Du Jun.

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:21.472
No matter what, you should have
separated business from personal matters.

00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:24.738
Don't you agree, sister-in-law?

00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:27.438
- Sister-in-law?
- They're in-laws?

00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:30.181
- What?
- No way!

00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:31.238
- Jeez.
- How?

00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:32.572
That woman is Manager Jang?

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.505
- Then...
- I mean they are...

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:36.372
The President and her...

00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:08.772
- What?
- What happened?

00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:09.905
Is he hurt?

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:10.938
Oh, dear.

00:02:10.938 --> 00:02:13.905
Call! Call 911!

00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:16.372
- Call them!
- Stay calm.

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.045
I'm on it.

00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:23.672
The examination shows
a slight fracture in the scapula.

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:26.472
There's also some bruising
and swelling in the surrounding muscles.

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:28.838
If you move it abruptly,
the fracture could worsen,

00:02:28.838 --> 00:02:31.038
so you must keep your arm
as still as possible today.

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:32.305
Is it that serious?

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.205
It doesn't require surgery,

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:35.405
but the initial pain is strong,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.238
and we need to check for
any possible complications.

00:02:37.238 --> 00:02:39.405
Please stay hospitalized
for a day or two for observation.

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:40.405
Okay.

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:41.438
Hospitalization is really necessary?

00:02:41.438 --> 00:02:43.438
It'll heal over time.

00:02:52.197 --> 00:02:53.445
Hey.

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:56.405
I told you not to move your arm.

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:57.938
I'm fine, really.

00:02:57.938 --> 00:02:59.805
I don't have time to be lying around here.

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:00.805
There's so much to handle.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.372
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:05.672
For at least a week, you shouldn't
strain or move your arm.

00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:06.972
If you want to heal quickly,

00:03:06.972 --> 00:03:09.381
you absolutely must rest.

00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:11.138
Don't you remember that?

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.638
I'll go to the office tomorrow
and fix everything.

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:16.605
I'll restore your reputation,

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:18.605
so don't worry too much.

00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:21.072
By the way, will you be okay?

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:23.872
Everyone knows about our relationship now.

00:03:23.872 --> 00:03:25.272
I feel relieved.

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:29.405
I was always wondering when we'd
be exposed and what I should say.

00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:31.905
Now we don't have to hide it.

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:33.338
I imagined countless times

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.272
how I should handle it
when something like this happened.

00:03:37.272 --> 00:03:40.805
Each time, I always ran away.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.072
But now that it's actually happened,

00:03:45.072 --> 00:03:48.005
I just felt confident, you know.

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:53.438
I think I've become
a different person from yesterday.

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:02.572
Wow, what is all this?

00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:04.472
The President's woman is Manager Jang?

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:05.572
Exactly!

00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:08.838
So until now, she deceived
everyone perfectly?

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:11.505
No, she didn't deceive us.

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:12.972
She just couldn't speak about it.

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:15.605
Then Manager Jang being pregnant...

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:17.172
So that's why she didn't drink.

00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:18.872
What about it?

00:04:18.872 --> 00:04:22.405
Do you think Manager Jang achieved those
just because she's the President's woman?

00:04:22.405 --> 00:04:23.772
- No.
- But I still feel disappointed.

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:25.905
Hiding her pregnancy while working.

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:27.605
Then should she have announced 'I'm pregnant'

00:04:27.605 --> 00:04:29.372
and spread the news all over?

00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:33.138
Has Manager Jang ever once let the team down
because of her pregnancy?

00:04:33.138 --> 00:04:34.138
- No.
- Exactly, she hasn't.

00:04:34.138 --> 00:04:38.038
We're just fascinated
because it's Manager Jang.

00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:40.138
Then what about the contest
first place issue?

00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:43.305
Manager Jang never received help
from the President even once.

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:45.272
Manager Nah and I can vouch for that.

00:04:45.272 --> 00:04:46.872
- Right?
- Huh? Yeah.

00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:49.538
Everyone saw how hard Manager Jang worked.

00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:52.205
But Team Leader, did you know about it?

00:04:52.205 --> 00:04:54.538
That Manager Jang is the President's woman?

00:04:54.538 --> 00:04:55.572
Huh?

00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:58.938
Right? I noticed she started siding with her.

00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:02.172
Huh? That's just natural instinct.

00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:04.505
Oh my, how can anyone be so oblivious?

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:07.372
Alright, let's get back to work.

00:05:07.372 --> 00:05:09.305
- She's quick to catch on.
- She seems very flustered.

00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:10.505
She already knew.

00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:13.038
Her shift in stance is so quick.

00:06:00.805 --> 00:06:02.138
Why are you here?

00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:04.133

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:06.138
You must be very tired.

00:06:06.138 --> 00:06:08.453

- Yes.

No, just leave it.

No.

You need to take your medicine first,

00:06:36.238 --> 00:06:38.338
so eat quickly.

I want to eat together.

00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:47.038
It's my first time eating with my left hand,
and it's not going well.

00:06:47.038 --> 00:06:49.438
Oh, here, let me help you.

00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:56.672
Here, open it.

00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:00.472
- Ah.
- I'll eat it myself.

00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:02.672
But you said it's hard
to eat with your left hand.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.005

Du Jun, I brought...

00:07:53.338 --> 00:07:56.905
I brought your underwear
and socks just in case.

00:07:56.905 --> 00:08:00.238
Why did he bring underwear and socks?
I didn't even ask him to.

00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:02.705
Should I step out for a bit? About an hour.

00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:05.072
- Oh, no.
- No, no, is that food?

00:08:05.072 --> 00:08:06.272
You probably haven't eaten, right?

00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:07.838

- Come on.

who can stop Mom.

Mom wants so badly.

I know how much effort
you put into preparing for the contest.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:08.972
Why are you apologizing?

00:09:08.972 --> 00:09:10.972
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:09:10.972 --> 00:09:12.105
I'm okay.

Of course, absolutely.

00:10:45.638 --> 00:10:47.505
What?

00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:49.438
It's already been deleted?

00:10:51.172 --> 00:10:53.038
The CCTV footage has all been taken care of.

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:55.805
- Good work.
- What about the contest winner?

00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:56.872
Pretend it never happened.

00:10:56.872 --> 00:10:59.237
We'll pin it on corruption anyway.

00:10:59.237 --> 00:11:02.772
While we're at it, invalidate the 2nd
and 3rd places completely too.

00:11:02.772 --> 00:11:04.605
Pardon? Why the 2nd and 3rd places...

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:10.105
Because nothing is more troublesome
than making enemies.

00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:18.072
- I have no choice.
- Hello.

00:11:18.072 --> 00:11:21.072
- Are you okay?
- Well, I could have won first place.

00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:22.938
That's the woman, right?

00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:23.938
The one with the President?

00:11:23.938 --> 00:11:25.705
Right? She's really shameless.

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:26.872
I heard she even got pregnant.

00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:28.238
She's really something else.

00:11:28.238 --> 00:11:31.705
Still, giving her first place in the contest
is a bit over the top, don't you think?

00:11:31.705 --> 00:11:33.072
She came to work again.

00:11:33.072 --> 00:11:34.572
I thought she'd be
too embarrassed to show up.

00:11:34.572 --> 00:11:37.272
Jeez, I could never do that.

00:11:37.272 --> 00:11:39.272
- Let's go.
- Yes.

00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:45.372
Ride the next one with me.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.838
You go ahead first.

00:11:49.938 --> 00:11:54.005
Were you shocked that day?
What about Yeol Mu?

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.605
This much won't bother me.

00:11:55.605 --> 00:11:57.205
Right, Yeol Mu?

00:11:57.205 --> 00:11:59.305
You almost got yourself in big trouble.

00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:03.372
Do you know how scared I was
thinking you were hurt?

00:12:03.372 --> 00:12:05.705
This won't do.

00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:07.872
If it's tough being next to the President,
tell me right away.

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:09.472
I'll just squeeze in like this and...

00:12:09.472 --> 00:12:11.972
Ah, not again.

00:12:12.905 --> 00:12:15.538
Yeah, it was just a joke to get you laugh.

00:12:15.538 --> 00:12:18.472
I know it's a joke.

00:12:20.613 --> 00:12:22.117
Let's go, let's go.

00:12:23.038 --> 00:12:24.605
How should we treat Manager Jang?

00:12:24.605 --> 00:12:26.638
- What do you mean?
- Should we call her Madam?

00:12:26.638 --> 00:12:27.638
Madam?

00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:30.372
Why? If she marries the President,
she might not even share a table with us.

00:12:30.372 --> 00:12:32.872
You think Manager Jang would really do that?

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:36.172
It wouldn't hurt to make
a good impression in advance, though.

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.405
Team Leader Bang!

00:12:37.405 --> 00:12:39.305
Team Leader Bang!

00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:41.905
Come out.

00:12:44.105 --> 00:12:45.538
What is this?

00:12:45.538 --> 00:12:47.005
I heard the contest is void.

00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:49.072
Why are you coming
to our team and doing this?

00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:50.505
It's not like we asked for it.

00:12:50.505 --> 00:12:52.405
It's because you team is involved.

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:55.005
This whole thing started
because of that one female employee.

00:12:55.005 --> 00:12:56.938
Because we promoted
the contest so extensively,

00:12:56.938 --> 00:12:59.205
now the company's image
is ruined with consumers.

00:12:59.205 --> 00:13:01.838
Come on, just because they're dating,
doesn't mean she got any special treatment.

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:04.505
Exactly, our Manager Jang
isn't that kind of person.

00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:06.505
Whether she is or isn't that kind of person,

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:09.438
our team winners are crying
and in chaos right now.

00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:10.805
Well, if she's the President's girlfriend,

00:13:10.805 --> 00:13:12.838
whether she stops the contest
from being voided or takes responsibility,

00:13:12.838 --> 00:13:14.472
she should do something, right?

00:13:14.472 --> 00:13:18.405
So why are you coming to our team
and doing this now?

00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:19.772
Jeez.

00:13:19.772 --> 00:13:22.072
What are you talking about?

00:13:22.072 --> 00:13:23.338
Void?

00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:26.438
Are you saying the awards have been canceled?

00:13:38.372 --> 00:13:41.138
Change everything before Kang Du Jun arrives.

00:13:48.405 --> 00:13:49.972
Wasn't I the target?

00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:52.738
Was there any reason to do this
to the other winners too?

00:13:52.738 --> 00:13:56.805
Well, it doesn't seem like what the person
at the center of the controversy should say.

00:13:56.805 --> 00:13:58.738
I never received any special treatment.

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:00.638
Just because I'm seeing the President,

00:14:00.638 --> 00:14:02.172
you shouldn't do this without any proof.

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:05.438
Even you confronting me like this could be
seen as a special treatment, couldn't it?

00:14:05.438 --> 00:14:09.972
Other employees wouldn't dare
think of confronting the President directly.

00:14:09.972 --> 00:14:12.938
Since you're dating President Kang Du Jun,

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:16.338
you don't seem to understand
what counts as special treatment.

00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:21.238
If you have something to say,
go through the secretary's office.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:27.638
You're the one who needs to keep
business and personal matters separate.

00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:33.905
It was you who called me your sister-in-law
in front of everyone at the ceremony.

00:14:35.372 --> 00:14:40.305
I will formally raise an objection
regarding this contest's judging process.

00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:44.672
Whether I received special treatment or not
is something you need to clarify.

00:14:55.238 --> 00:14:59.572
What can we do to increase
the reach of the new campaign?

00:14:59.572 --> 00:15:02.972
Our team has been
working on the brand slogan...

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:07.405
Who decided to void the contest?

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:09.405
I thought you were taking a few days off.

00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:11.572
Even if you're the co-president,

00:15:11.572 --> 00:15:14.405
how can I trust you to hold down
the fort if you handle things like this?

00:15:16.338 --> 00:15:17.838
Everyone, could you give us a moment?

00:15:17.838 --> 00:15:19.805
We need to talk privately.

00:15:21.138 --> 00:15:23.672
Can't you see we're
in the middle of a meeting?

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:24.738
Then shall we all discuss

00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:28.738
the stunt you pulled
at the ceremony right here?

00:15:33.172 --> 00:15:35.038
If Hui Won had got hurt,

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:37.138
I wouldn't have stood idly by.

00:15:37.138 --> 00:15:39.272
Why do you think I did it?

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.305
Do you have any proof?

00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:43.572
And what proof do you have, sister-in-law,
to slander me and Hui Won like that?

00:15:43.572 --> 00:15:45.438
If my name was on the judging sheet,

00:15:45.438 --> 00:15:46.905
does that mean I gave special treatment?

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.805
Then prove it.

00:15:48.805 --> 00:15:52.238
Prove that you didn't participate.

00:15:54.738 --> 00:15:57.372
Seo Myeong Ho, CEO of Hidden Partners,

00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:59.038
was on the list of judges.

00:15:59.038 --> 00:16:01.405
Are you familiar with him?

00:16:01.405 --> 00:16:04.672
The firms on the list were included
based on executive recommendations.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:05.705
What's the problem?

00:16:05.705 --> 00:16:06.738
Yeah?

00:16:06.738 --> 00:16:09.738
I just had a feeling you might know him well.

00:16:14.238 --> 00:16:16.038
You shouldn't mention the company.

00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:18.338
It's not even confirmed yet.

00:16:18.338 --> 00:16:20.338
And if you acted like we knew something,

00:16:20.338 --> 00:16:22.138
they might try to interfere in advance.

00:16:22.138 --> 00:16:23.605
That's why I said it.

00:16:23.605 --> 00:16:24.938
- Huh?
- So they'd move.

00:16:24.938 --> 00:16:28.505
Because if they interfere,
it's like admitting guilt.

00:16:29.138 --> 00:16:31.472
Let's just wait and see
how it plays out first.

00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:32.472
And, Si Hyeong,

00:16:32.472 --> 00:16:35.272
call in the contest winners.

00:16:35.272 --> 00:16:36.972
Okay.

00:16:37.938 --> 00:16:39.905
Huh? Here?

00:16:39.905 --> 00:16:41.605
Yes.

00:16:51.838 --> 00:16:56.172
First, I sincerely apologize
for upsetting you

00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:57.705
regarding this competition.

00:16:57.705 --> 00:16:59.238
Oh, no, it's okay.

00:16:59.238 --> 00:17:01.438
The reason I called you here today is

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.805
because there have been
a few misunderstandings.

00:17:03.805 --> 00:17:06.772
I never participated in this judging process.

00:17:06.772 --> 00:17:10.172
And I never gave any benefits whatsoever
to Manager Jang Hui Won here.

00:17:10.172 --> 00:17:12.338
After belatedly
reviewing the judging process,

00:17:12.338 --> 00:17:14.972
we found issues with the judging criteria.

00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:18.038
So I'd like to make a proposal to you all.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.605
A proposal?

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.905
There are two options.

00:17:20.905 --> 00:17:22.638
Although the competition has been canceled,

00:17:22.638 --> 00:17:24.238
we can provide partial compensation

00:17:24.238 --> 00:17:26.305
to the winners, that's the first.

00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:28.538
The second is to conduct
a re-judging of the competition.

00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:30.072
- A re-judging?
- A re-judging?

00:17:30.072 --> 00:17:35.438
I believe it's only right to get
the winners' consent regarding this matter.

00:17:35.438 --> 00:17:38.205
Whether you get another chance
through re-judging,

00:17:38.205 --> 00:17:42.572
or take the compensation and stop,
is your choice.

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:47.472
Instead of taking compensation
and pretending it never happened,

00:17:47.472 --> 00:17:49.072
isn't re-judging better?

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:50.538
But from our perspective,

00:17:50.538 --> 00:17:53.405
if we fail the re-judging,
won't it feel even more unfair?

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:57.672
We don't know if we'll win an award
or fail in the re-judging.

00:17:57.672 --> 00:18:00.172
Still, we worked hard, right?

00:18:00.172 --> 00:18:01.538
It wasn't even our fault,

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:04.972
so canceling the entire contest
feels really unfair, doesn't it?

00:18:04.972 --> 00:18:06.138
I feel wronged.

00:18:06.138 --> 00:18:08.872
I worked day and night preparing for this.

00:18:08.872 --> 00:18:10.405
I don't want it to just vanish

00:18:10.405 --> 00:18:12.138
into thin air.

00:18:13.405 --> 00:18:14.738
Exactly.

00:18:14.738 --> 00:18:16.938
Well, I was thinking of giving up anyway,

00:18:16.938 --> 00:18:18.038
so should we just go ahead
with the re-judging?

00:18:18.038 --> 00:18:20.538
Let's try it. But then,
how will the judging work?

00:18:20.538 --> 00:18:25.738
The first document screening will be done
by a mix of internal and external judges.

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:30.538
For the second round, we're still
figuring out the fairest method.

00:18:30.538 --> 00:18:35.205
Previously the judging was blind,

00:18:35.205 --> 00:18:37.938
but now the products are already revealed.

00:18:37.938 --> 00:18:42.338
What about incorporating public evaluation?

00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:44.472
- Public evaluation?
- Public evaluation?

00:18:49.372 --> 00:18:51.038
But would that be okay?

00:18:51.038 --> 00:18:54.772
Posting the pitching videos online
to reflect public opinion.

00:18:54.772 --> 00:18:57.238
Some people might still misunderstand you.

00:18:57.238 --> 00:18:59.005
That's why I chose the direct approach.

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:01.105
If I make my proposal public

00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:03.705
and prove it has real potential,

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:06.905
at least people won't say
I received special treatment.

00:19:07.538 --> 00:19:08.538
That makes sense.

00:19:08.538 --> 00:19:10.172
Once everything's out in the open,

00:19:10.172 --> 00:19:11.772
no one will be able to say anything.

00:19:11.772 --> 00:19:14.438
Because you are capable enough.

00:19:14.438 --> 00:19:16.638
I hope so.

00:19:22.705 --> 00:19:25.221
But may I ask why it's non-alcoholic?

00:19:25.221 --> 00:19:27.305
Oh.

00:19:27.305 --> 00:19:29.205
Well,

00:19:29.205 --> 00:19:30.872
it reminds me of my mom.

00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:32.072
I'm not sure.

00:19:32.072 --> 00:19:35.105
Maybe it's because I'm about to become a mom,

00:19:35.105 --> 00:19:40.505
or because I worry about my mom
turning to alcohol when things get hard.

00:19:40.505 --> 00:19:41.538
It sounds silly, right?

00:19:41.538 --> 00:19:43.672

it'd be good to have a meal together.

Please eat.

I'm really sorry, but I have an urgent call.

Please excuse me for a moment.

00:20:14.072 --> 00:20:15.972
I heard you met with the President.

00:20:15.972 --> 00:20:17.705
Why didn't you tell me?

00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:20.305
You didn't even call me once.

00:20:20.305 --> 00:20:24.272
No matter what I say to you now,
you just call it nagging.

00:20:24.938 --> 00:20:26.908
I have to talk directly
to my future son-in-law,

00:20:26.908 --> 00:20:28.472
so he knows his mother-in-law is scary.

00:20:28.472 --> 00:20:30.005
Son-in-law?

00:20:30.005 --> 00:20:31.905
You're getting married, aren't you?

00:20:31.905 --> 00:20:33.572
Huh?

00:20:33.572 --> 00:20:36.472
Oh, right.

00:20:36.472 --> 00:20:37.705
Am I the one getting married?

00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:40.638
It's your marriage.
If you two are happy, that's fine.

00:20:41.705 --> 00:20:44.172
Thought you'd object.

00:20:45.538 --> 00:20:47.172

Are you feeling unwell?

00:20:55.105 --> 00:20:56.105
Just a cold.

00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:57.972
If you're sick, just rest.

00:20:57.972 --> 00:20:59.905
You're not mixing medicine
and alcohol again, are you?

00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:01.305
I told you not to do that.

00:21:01.305 --> 00:21:03.605
- And not where I can see...
- Ugh, stop nagging.

00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:05.472
I got it.

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:08.672
So don't get sick.

00:21:08.672 --> 00:21:10.038
Do I have any other family?

Hello, I'm Jang Hui Won from Taehan Liquor's
New Product Development Team.

00:25:50.138 --> 00:25:52.605
What does beer mean to you?

00:25:52.605 --> 00:25:56.772
To me, beer was a small comfort
at the end of a long day.

00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:58.605
Ah, not great.

00:26:00.972 --> 00:26:02.205
Hey, Jang Hui Won.

00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:04.805
What? I'm fine. Why'd you come?

00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:09.405
You know voice care is everything
before a presentation, right?

00:26:09.405 --> 00:26:10.938
Here.

00:26:10.938 --> 00:26:13.172
Drink it.

00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:14.705
- What is this?
- This is

00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:16.838
a concoction made with
everything good for the throat.

00:26:16.838 --> 00:26:18.472
- Pear-and-bellflower root ginger tea.
- Ta-da!

00:26:18.472 --> 00:26:21.605
We boiled this for four hours.

00:26:21.605 --> 00:26:24.372
- Drink it all.
- Exactly four hours and forty-nine minutes.

00:26:24.372 --> 00:26:25.905
- Yeah.
- You need to drink this tomorrow.

00:26:25.905 --> 00:26:28.205
- Ugh, it's bitter.
- Come here.

00:26:28.205 --> 00:26:30.838
Keep your throat warm
until the presentation. Okay?

00:26:30.838 --> 00:26:33.372
- Thanks.
- Is your presentation prep going well?

00:26:33.372 --> 00:26:34.705
Hmm, it's okay.

00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:36.838
But I'm struggling with the concept.

00:26:36.838 --> 00:26:38.872
If you only have about two minutes,

00:26:38.872 --> 00:26:40.672
you need to grab the public's attention fast.

00:26:40.672 --> 00:26:42.272
Then the concept really is important.

00:26:42.272 --> 00:26:45.305
Just presenting plainly feels flat.

00:26:45.305 --> 00:26:46.538
I need something distinctive.

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:49.005
If it's public evaluation,
it's like an audition, right?

00:26:49.005 --> 00:26:52.972
In auditions, individual talent
and skill are important,

00:26:52.972 --> 00:26:57.272
but I think their charm is determined
by their personal story.

00:26:57.272 --> 00:26:58.505
Yeah, that's right.

00:26:58.505 --> 00:27:03.538
Telling your own story about the beer
you want to make might be good.

00:27:04.872 --> 00:27:06.638
A story.

00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:10.172
My own story.

00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:17.372
But it seems like it helped a bit, right?

00:27:17.372 --> 00:27:19.005
I hope so.

00:27:19.005 --> 00:27:20.772
Hui Won will do well.

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.138
She's always strong in real situations.

00:27:22.138 --> 00:27:25.061
Right, that's who she is.

00:27:25.061 --> 00:27:27.705
What about you? Are you okay?

00:27:27.705 --> 00:27:30.138
- About what?
- Just wondering

00:27:30.138 --> 00:27:33.272
if you're feeling any better.

00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:38.438
I'm fine.

00:27:45.338 --> 00:27:47.472
You're the one who said you were fine, okay?

00:27:47.472 --> 00:27:49.272
Huh?

00:27:49.272 --> 00:27:50.605
Buy me dinner.

00:27:50.605 --> 00:27:52.638
And cake for dessert.

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:54.772
What are you doing?

00:27:54.772 --> 00:27:59.338
Last time you didn't have your wallet,
I bought you dinner and dessert.

00:28:00.505 --> 00:28:02.138
Buying isn't a problem, but...

00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:04.872
From now on, I'm going straight for you.

I think I was too stuck in the past.

I should've asked her why she said
those things back then.

But thanks to you, President,
I found the courage.

00:44:01.738 --> 00:44:03.605
an option of preference

00:44:03.605 --> 00:44:05.772
that expands everyone's choices.

00:44:05.772 --> 00:44:07.838
When this beer comes out into the world,

00:44:07.838 --> 00:44:11.838
I want to drink it first with my mom.

00:44:11.838 --> 00:44:14.838
I want to say, 'Let's drink this together
for a long, healthy time,'

00:44:14.838 --> 00:44:16.305
as we toast.

00:44:16.305 --> 00:44:19.472
Is there someone you want to comfort, too?

00:44:19.472 --> 00:44:21.505
I created this beer

00:44:21.505 --> 00:44:24.138
to support that warmth.

00:44:24.138 --> 00:44:26.372
For my non-alcoholic beer,

00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:30.305
please show lots of expectation and interest.

Thank you.

Oh.

00:44:36.805 --> 00:44:38.172
I'm seriously about to cry.

00:44:38.172 --> 00:44:40.338
It's made so well, really.

00:44:41.905 --> 00:44:44.205
Nice, good job.

00:44:44.205 --> 00:44:45.938
What did you think?

00:44:46.572 --> 00:44:49.038
You worked hard.

[A glass of comforting beer]

00:44:50.105 --> 00:44:52.938

and likes are blowing up!

00:44:52.938 --> 00:44:53.938
Really?

That's way too different from mine.

Tak Soo, did you click it?

00:45:04.238 --> 00:45:05.372
Yes, I clicked twice.

00:45:05.372 --> 00:45:06.372

Should I greet you in advance?

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:17.272
I'll make sure to lead Taehan Liquor well,

00:46:17.272 --> 00:46:19.338
so please don't worry.

00:46:26.072 --> 00:46:28.905
Then, we will now move to the voting stage.

00:46:28.905 --> 00:46:32.972
Voting will be done by a show of hands
to confirm approval or disapproval.

00:46:32.972 --> 00:46:37.672
First, for those in favor of the motion
to dismiss President Kang Du Jun,

00:46:37.672 --> 00:46:39.938
please raise your hands.

00:46:51.338 --> 00:46:54.672
Yes, the count is complete.

00:46:54.672 --> 00:46:55.872
What are you doing?

00:46:55.872 --> 00:47:00.605
Then, for those opposed to the motion
to dismiss President Kang Du Jun,

00:47:00.605 --> 00:47:03.005
please raise your hands.

00:47:21.072 --> 00:47:24.105
Yes, the count is complete.

00:47:24.105 --> 00:47:28.138
The tally results show a majority opposed,

00:47:28.138 --> 00:47:31.238
so I declare this dismissal motion rejected.

00:47:31.238 --> 00:47:33.738
This is ridiculous!

00:47:52.805 --> 00:47:54.772
Kang Du Jun!

What on earth did you do?

What exactly did you say to the directors?

00:48:20.138 --> 00:48:22.338
- Please take your seat.
- Yes.

[Prescription records]
As you can see,

00:48:41.472 --> 00:48:43.338
I've never abused drugs

00:48:43.338 --> 00:48:45.905
nor received excessive prescriptions.

00:48:45.905 --> 00:48:46.972
I reiterate that.

00:48:46.972 --> 00:48:48.538
And if you look at the back page,

What is this?

00:49:02.238 --> 00:49:04.172
I agonized over this quite a bit.

00:49:04.172 --> 00:49:06.772
Should I take this to the police?

00:49:06.772 --> 00:49:09.005
Then I suddenly became curious.

00:49:09.005 --> 00:49:12.572
What would your judgment be
if I showed you this?

00:49:12.572 --> 00:49:17.005
I already have evidence of President Han's
bribery, breach of trust, and embezzlement

00:49:17.005 --> 00:49:18.872
in my hands.

00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:20.938
If this dismissal motion is rejected,

00:49:20.938 --> 00:49:23.105
I might overlook all the bribes you received

00:49:23.105 --> 00:49:27.338
and the atrocities you committed against me.

00:49:27.338 --> 00:49:29.029
So,

what's your decision?

00:49:42.705 --> 00:49:44.372
What are you in such a hurry for?

00:49:44.372 --> 00:49:46.205
Honestly, I barely restrained myself

00:49:46.205 --> 00:49:49.872
from publicly exposing your criminal record
in front of everyone.

What?

00:49:51.005 --> 00:49:54.038
Just 4 billion won in fabricated service fees
through paper companies so far.

00:49:54.038 --> 00:49:58.872
And you pocketed 2 billion won in rebates
from hotel advertising with RM Entertainment.

[Documents related to slush funds

You bribed reporters to spread
malicious articles about me.

00:50:04.138 --> 00:50:06.305
And you gave bribes
and illicit payments to board members.

Oh, about the tabloids, an artist
named Mr. Lee came to see me.

He seemed to hold quite a grudge against you.

00:50:12.738 --> 00:50:15.572
You should have treated people better
while you had the chance.

It seems my uncle believed
you could discard him at any moment.

I'm satisfied.

00:54:34.572 --> 00:54:37.972
A second place recognized by the public
is better than a dishonorable first place.

Seriously, you're amazing.

Second and third place both came from us!

00:55:15.738 --> 00:55:19.272
Honestly, I feel a bit disappointed
the first place came from the Marketing Team.

00:55:19.272 --> 00:55:20.438
Our non-alcoholic and high-proof beers

00:55:20.438 --> 00:55:23.072
are way better than
their low-carb one, right?

00:55:23.072 --> 00:55:24.205
Exactly.

00:55:24.205 --> 00:55:25.472
Even people from other teams

00:55:25.472 --> 00:55:29.472
say your idea should've won first place.

00:55:29.472 --> 00:55:32.738
Honestly, if it weren't for the limitations
of the non-alcoholic concept,

00:55:32.738 --> 00:55:35.438
it would've ranked first
in product viability too.

00:55:35.438 --> 00:55:36.638
So close!

00:55:36.638 --> 00:55:37.705
In that case,

your card in front of the team leader?

00:56:01.372 --> 00:56:03.838
- Okay.
- Then, dismissed.

00:56:04.838 --> 00:56:08.138
- Really, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:56:10.472 --> 00:56:12.072
You worked hard.

00:56:12.072 --> 00:56:14.838
It must have been tough fighting alone.

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:16.372
No.

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.938
It's all over now.

00:56:18.938 --> 00:56:21.672
What about President Han?

00:56:21.672 --> 00:56:23.738
She's probably under arrest
and being investigated.

00:56:23.738 --> 00:56:29.172
It seems Father also prepared a lot
because of my sister-in-law and uncle.

00:56:29.172 --> 00:56:30.772
I see.

00:56:30.772 --> 00:56:32.672
I don't feel good about it.

00:56:32.672 --> 00:56:35.405
I think you feel the same.

00:56:38.605 --> 00:56:40.605
Now that everything is back in place,

00:56:40.605 --> 00:56:42.472
just think positively, Hui Won.

00:56:42.472 --> 00:56:44.572
For our Yeol Mu.

00:56:45.438 --> 00:56:47.272
Is that okay?

00:56:47.272 --> 00:56:50.405
But seriously, how long are you
going to keep calling me President?

00:56:50.405 --> 00:56:53.072
- What?
- Isn't it about time you get used to it?

00:56:53.072 --> 00:56:55.538
And we're about to meet the parents soon too.

00:56:56.172 --> 00:56:57.572
Then what should I call you?

00:56:57.572 --> 00:56:58.838
Call me oppa.

00:56:58.838 --> 00:57:00.138
Try calling me 'Du Jun oppa.'

00:57:00.138 --> 00:57:02.005
What? That's weird.

00:57:02.005 --> 00:57:03.005
What's weird about it?

00:57:03.005 --> 00:57:04.605
They say if there's a four-year age gap,
you don't even need to check compatibility.

00:57:04.605 --> 00:57:05.972
Calling me 'oppa' feels natural.

00:57:05.972 --> 00:57:08.638
Just try calling me 'oppa' once.

00:57:08.638 --> 00:57:11.472
Just give it a try.

00:57:12.238 --> 00:57:13.938
O...

00:57:14.938 --> 00:57:16.638
O...

00:57:17.538 --> 00:57:18.885
Ugh, I can't do it.

00:57:18.885 --> 00:57:22.072
Oh, President suits you perfectly.

00:57:22.072 --> 00:57:24.405
It's not like I was born President.

00:57:24.405 --> 00:57:25.805
Okay, then.

00:57:25.805 --> 00:57:28.772
If you don't like 'oppa', then,

00:57:29.541 --> 00:57:32.005
there's also 'darling,'

00:57:32.005 --> 00:57:33.805
or 'honey.'

00:57:33.805 --> 00:57:37.705
Ugh, I've got goosebumps. Look!

00:57:37.705 --> 00:57:39.605
Why would that give you goosebumps?

00:57:39.605 --> 00:57:41.705
Other people call each other that just fine.

00:57:41.705 --> 00:57:42.872
That's...

00:57:42.872 --> 00:57:46.005
That's for people who were
natural about it from the start.

00:57:46.005 --> 00:57:48.238
No one's natural from the beginning.

00:57:48.238 --> 00:57:50.505
You get used to it over time.

00:57:52.505 --> 00:57:55.338
Come here, let's get
you used to it gradually.

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:57.238
What if someone sees us?

00:57:57.238 --> 00:57:59.405
So what if someone sees?

00:58:01.872 --> 00:58:04.005
- Oppa.
- Huh?

00:58:04.005 --> 00:58:05.672
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.

00:58:05.672 --> 00:58:07.038
I think you said 'oppa'?

00:58:07.038 --> 00:58:08.772
No.

00:58:09.905 --> 00:58:11.638
Du Jun oppa.

00:58:12.338 --> 00:58:13.338
What was that?

00:58:13.338 --> 00:58:14.372
- Say it one more time.
- No, no.

00:58:14.372 --> 00:58:15.972
Ah, it's warm.

00:58:15.972 --> 00:58:18.472
Why are you so shy?

00:58:18.472 --> 00:58:20.072
- Dummy.
- Huh?

00:58:20.072 --> 00:58:21.205
I think you said something else just now?

00:58:21.205 --> 00:58:23.438
No, no.

00:58:24.472 --> 00:58:27.072
Ah, it's warm and nice.

00:58:27.838 --> 00:58:32.372
I was a bit sensitive last time.

00:58:32.372 --> 00:58:36.005
It turns out our bond wasn't
just some casual thing.

00:58:36.005 --> 00:58:37.005
Pardon?

00:58:37.005 --> 00:58:38.972
In a world where people

00:58:38.972 --> 00:58:41.372
only think of themselves,

00:58:41.372 --> 00:58:45.038
you truly raised your daughter
well and properly.

00:58:45.038 --> 00:58:49.138
I didn't realize what a wonderful
character she has.

00:58:49.872 --> 00:58:51.972
She still has much to learn,

00:58:51.972 --> 00:58:53.238
so please guide her.

00:58:53.238 --> 00:58:54.672
No, not at all.

00:58:54.672 --> 00:58:58.305
These days, there's much
to learn from young people.

00:58:58.305 --> 00:58:59.438
Hui Won.

00:58:59.438 --> 00:59:03.672
Don't think of me as your mother-in-law,
just treat me comfortably.

00:59:03.672 --> 00:59:07.272
Just think of it as having another mom.

00:59:11.072 --> 00:59:14.272
You speak your mind about everything
even in front of your in-law.

00:59:14.272 --> 00:59:15.505
Why?

00:59:15.505 --> 00:59:17.138
Because I don't have a daughter.

00:59:17.138 --> 00:59:20.705
I intend to think of Hui Won
like my own daughter.

00:59:20.705 --> 00:59:21.872
That's alright, right?

00:59:21.872 --> 00:59:24.138
Of course, I...

00:59:28.505 --> 00:59:30.505
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

01:00:17.372 --> 01:00:19.905
I can't even imagine how extravagant
his proposal must have been.

01:00:19.905 --> 01:00:20.972
When is the wedding?

01:00:20.972 --> 01:00:22.438
- You don't have the ring?
- So you really wouldn't mind

01:00:22.438 --> 01:00:23.738
not getting a proposal?

01:00:23.738 --> 01:00:26.738
Is the dead son's wife not family?

01:00:26.738 --> 01:00:29.405
Everyone in this household will regret it.

01:00:29.405 --> 01:00:30.805
No matter what happens,

01:00:30.805 --> 01:00:33.072
I will protect you
unconditionally, to the end.

01:00:33.072 --> 01:00:34.238
Please, just stop!

01:00:34.238 --> 01:00:36.072
If that's family, I don't need you!

01:00:36.072 --> 01:00:38.472
Why can't you see that you're
the one who betrayed our family?

01:00:38.472 --> 01:00:41.905
Kang Du Jun, this is all your fault.

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:43.909
Because of you!
