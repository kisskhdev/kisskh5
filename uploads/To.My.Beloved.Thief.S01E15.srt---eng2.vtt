WEBVTT

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.449
{\an8}If you show up at the palace
as Gil-dong, you're dead!

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.742
{\an8}Must you really go?

00:00:58.288 --> 00:00:59.747
{\an8}Then I'm coming with you.

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:01.124
{\an8}Deok-jung.

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:03.835
{\an8}I'm coming with you too.

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:05.879
{\an8}I'm joining too.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:07.255
{\an8}May I…

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:08.673
{\an8}May I join you as well?

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.133
{\an8}- Me too.
- I want to join you too.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:11.342
{\an8}- I'll join as well.
- Me too!

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:14.637
{\an8}- I want to join you too!
- I'm coming too!

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.618
I have somewhere to go first.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.788
The king is addicted to a toxic herb?

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:42.582
Yes, Lady Sukeui.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.418
Please share this with the ministers
and bring them together,

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.962
and post the notices far and wide.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.220
Everyone in this land must know.

00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:58.681
I will muster our troops.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:01.351
They won't reach the capital
until tomorrow,

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:02.936
so we'll wait until…

00:02:06.397 --> 00:02:07.774
You must go, I see.

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:10.276
It will be fine.

00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:12.570
Because we're not alone.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.449
This is going to be an intense night.

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:21.162
I'll see you in the new Joseon.

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:32.173
Gil-dong came.

00:02:32.257 --> 00:02:34.550
He's bound to die, but he came anyway.

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:36.886
He's not so bright, after all.

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.847
Why throw your life away for some widow?

00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.933
He even stole rice for her.

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:43.726
Everything she had was stolen,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.145
and she was too starved
to nurse her child.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.647
I feel so bad for her.

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.234
If those feelings are a crime,

00:02:51.317 --> 00:02:52.694
they should arrest me as well.

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:55.113
Then they should arrest me as well.

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:56.197
Me too.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.824
- Me too.
- Me too.

00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.785
We can't do what Gil-dong does,

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:03.913
but at least we can show our support.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.082
- Of course.
- Yes.

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:21.389
I never deserved the name, Gil-dong,

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:26.477
much less the name of righteous thief.

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:30.606
I'm sorry.

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:36.904
Of course you can't take medicine
on an empty stomach.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:40.450
I was just a nosy physician,

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:42.577
nothing more, nothing less.

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.621
You're far more peculiar than I thought.

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:48.791
But if weren't for Gil-dong,
I wouldn't have met him.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:50.126
From now on,

00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:51.794
stay within my expectations.

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:54.088
Just stay within

00:03:54.172 --> 00:03:55.548
what I can handle.

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:56.841
The Grand Prince

00:03:56.924 --> 00:03:59.093
shielded my thievery,

00:04:01.262 --> 00:04:03.431
and fought for the things
that I wanted to protect

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:05.058
on my behalf.

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:08.144
And meanwhile,

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:09.604
while I was in his body,

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:13.733
I came to bear
another purpose in my heart.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.200
Treason.

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.911
- Is this true?
- This is unbelievable!

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.913
What are we to do?

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:28.331
Hence,

00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:29.540
the rebellion.

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:37.006
And I told myself I would not hesitate

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:40.927
when this moment came.

00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:43.679
What about me?

00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:46.391
What can I do
if you're not there tomorrow?

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:50.353
But why am I thinking about that time now?

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:51.521
Let's run away.

00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:54.357
Once you're caught as a traitor,
you'll be torn limb from limb.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.566
I'm prepared for that.

00:04:56.192 --> 00:04:58.486
Why am I seeing

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.613
your disheartened face now?

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:02.073
How could you

00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:04.450
speak of your death so lightly
in front of me?

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:07.620
Only now does the look in his eyes
break my heart.

00:05:08.663 --> 00:05:10.331
What am I to do?

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:13.000
Hong Eun-jo, I…

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:15.378
I know.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.425
I…

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:28.307
I know.

00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:31.686
If I live to see tomorrow…

00:05:33.354 --> 00:05:34.313
I should go.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:38.484
I will see you again.

00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:45.700
…I will make sure to say

00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:48.119
what I held back today.

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:22.755
I'll lure them out of the alley.

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:28.886
The old me would have listened to you.

00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:32.723
But now,
those words carry no weight with me.

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:36.310
I will not run away anymore.

00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:45.111
One.

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:46.696
Two…

00:07:57.456 --> 00:07:59.208
You must be here to see me.

00:08:02.878 --> 00:08:04.630
Aren't you Min-jik's…

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.050
Why are the two of you here?

00:08:08.134 --> 00:08:09.802
I was on my way to Your Majesty

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.139
to deliver something meant for you.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:16.559
Something meant for me?

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.353
I'm talking about Yeonsukhwa.

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:21.689
What is that?

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:28.863
You didn't even know what it was called?

00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:31.240
Your Majesty!

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.410
- What's wrong?
- We should go to that alley.

00:08:34.493 --> 00:08:35.995
- Gil-dong is--
- Chase him!

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.877
Gil-dong is caught.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:51.761
Where's Gil-dong?

00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:53.512
We're looking for him, Your Majesty.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:55.723
What happened?

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:57.350
We're trying to figure it out.

00:08:59.268 --> 00:09:00.936
Please stop this.

00:09:04.857 --> 00:09:05.775
Hong Eun-jo.

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:23.709
What is

00:09:24.794 --> 00:09:25.961
all this?

00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:40.017
Baekjeong masks?

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.602
That's right.

00:09:41.686 --> 00:09:44.814
Baekjeong masks are hanging
all over the crossroads in the market.

00:09:45.731 --> 00:09:47.233
What does that mean?

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:49.819
Are they showing support for Gil-dong?

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.574
It's too early to cry.

00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:58.953
This movement is spreading
across the capital.

00:10:18.764 --> 00:10:20.975
How is this…

00:10:32.194 --> 00:10:34.363
Find everyone
who has hung the Baekjeong masks

00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:37.116
and kill them all!

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:40.995
All of them, Your Majesty?

00:10:41.662 --> 00:10:43.080
They're innocent people.

00:10:43.998 --> 00:10:47.001
Anyone who claims to be Gil-dong
is Gil-dong.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.631
Your Majesty.

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:54.633
Here's the notice Gil-dong wrote.

00:10:56.135 --> 00:10:57.428
Read it.

00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:01.974
I dare not read…

00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:09.148
"The king was deceived by a flatterer
and took poison."

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.900
How insolent!

00:11:10.983 --> 00:11:12.568
"He ended up a madman."

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:20.034
Yeonsukhwa is

00:11:20.743 --> 00:11:23.329
the name of the toxic herb
planted in your body.

00:11:24.955 --> 00:11:27.500
{\an8}Do you realize
you're in a state of madness?

00:11:47.728 --> 00:11:48.896
It's here.

00:11:54.276 --> 00:11:56.362
Chase the tiger!

00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.453
He's hallucinating.

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:07.790
If we let His Majesty
roam the streets like this,

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:09.250
he will hunt the people.

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:13.295
Lure His Majesty through the quiet alleys
and then into the palace.

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:16.882
Drive him west, and follow the wall north.

00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:22.096
Pass by Mount Inwang and Mount Baegak,
and enter through Sinmumun Gate.

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:23.973
Follow His Highness' command!

00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:25.558
Yes, sir!

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.434
I'll come with you.

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:35.192
Jae-i!

00:12:38.237 --> 00:12:39.572
Were any of the Gil-dongs caught?

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:42.366
How are we supposed to catch them?
They're all over the place.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.619
I see.

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:47.788
You…

00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:49.123
You haven't seen it, have you?

00:12:49.707 --> 00:12:50.874
I haven't seen what?

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.299
Is this related to the bedchamber matter?

00:12:58.382 --> 00:13:01.010
I will await His Majesty's order.

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:04.430
Find out where my father is right now.

00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:07.308
You should confess now.

00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:10.019
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.146
Do you have evidence?

00:13:12.229 --> 00:13:13.397
Yes.

00:13:16.984 --> 00:13:17.818
Here's the evidence,

00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:19.528
and the witness.

00:13:26.577 --> 00:13:27.870
You look great.

00:13:28.954 --> 00:13:30.164
If this is the evidence,

00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:33.500
it must be
the poisonous herb the king took.

00:13:35.836 --> 00:13:37.087
And where's the witness?

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.882
Lady Jang here
will testify to everything--

00:13:39.965 --> 00:13:42.051
A lowborn can't be a witness.

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:46.096
She's an animal.

00:13:48.057 --> 00:13:50.309
All of this was that animal's scheme.

00:13:54.855 --> 00:13:56.732
You're the Left State Councilor
of this realm,

00:13:56.815 --> 00:13:58.776
and you're shifting the blame
onto a woman.

00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:00.653
Have you no shame as a man?

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:06.742
The ministers will decide
whether she can be a witness or not.

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:12.498
Have you forgotten?

00:14:13.248 --> 00:14:16.043
The ministers in the main hall

00:14:18.003 --> 00:14:19.254
were handpicked by me.

00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:26.053
They are an extension of me.

00:14:26.136 --> 00:14:28.555
The extensions of a flatterer.

00:14:31.183 --> 00:14:33.143
Responsibility means nothing to them.

00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:34.979
Those shameless men

00:14:35.938 --> 00:14:37.773
always put their own gain first.

00:14:38.774 --> 00:14:40.192
The fate of this realm is at stake.

00:14:40.275 --> 00:14:41.485
We must make a decision.

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:42.778
It's too early.

00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:44.738
If it goes wrong, we'll be traitors.

00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:48.033
I agree. We must be cautious.

00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:52.204
It's not like the Left State Councilor
admitted the existence of the toxic herb.

00:14:53.664 --> 00:14:55.290
How could you…

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:58.377
It doesn't seem easy
to convince the ministers.

00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:02.715
I wouldn't expect Im Sa-hyeong's puppets
to care about purpose.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.508
Did you expect this?

00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:07.011
We have the cause on our side.

00:15:07.094 --> 00:15:07.970
And the troops?

00:15:08.053 --> 00:15:10.139
They'll arrive in the morning
at the earliest.

00:15:11.932 --> 00:15:14.476
The gatekeeper we paid
will open the gate for them.

00:15:16.645 --> 00:15:19.732
Tell them to head straight to the palace
and take the king's head.

00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:23.444
If necessary, have the ministers
killed as well to leave no loose ends.

00:15:23.527 --> 00:15:26.155
Gil-dong and the Grand Prince
will not want any bloodshed.

00:15:26.238 --> 00:15:28.866
At worst, it can put
the people in the market at risk--

00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:31.076
A bloodless overthrow does not exist.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.953
No throne was ever won without bloodshed.

00:15:35.998 --> 00:15:37.249
The bloodstains will fade

00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:40.961
when a new sun rises.

00:15:43.297 --> 00:15:44.798
To the palace!

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.728
Let us join too.

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:01.899
I thought you were recovering.

00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:03.567
I'm fine.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.361
We can't miss Gil-dong's historic moment.

00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:11.200
Let's go!

00:16:11.867 --> 00:16:15.204
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.424
Where are the other court ladies?

00:16:27.508 --> 00:16:30.886
We've sent them all out of the palace,
saying it's for health reasons.

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:32.012
Good.

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.477
You may leave now, Your Majesty.

00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:42.314
Why is there only one palanquin?

00:16:46.443 --> 00:16:47.778
No.

00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:49.571
I will stay in the palace as well.

00:16:50.364 --> 00:16:52.574
If what's written in the notice is true,

00:16:52.658 --> 00:16:55.911
we don't know what the king's madness
might drive him to do.

00:16:55.994 --> 00:16:57.621
You must protect the Crown Prince.

00:16:59.581 --> 00:17:00.457
Your Majesty.

00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:07.214
A mother must protect her child.

00:17:07.297 --> 00:17:10.134
I'm staying to protect my child as well.

00:17:13.804 --> 00:17:14.763
You should make haste.

00:17:15.347 --> 00:17:16.849
Please

00:17:16.932 --> 00:17:18.517
stay safe tonight.

00:17:36.994 --> 00:17:38.954
It's the tiger, Your Majesty!

00:17:51.383 --> 00:17:52.926
It's this way, Your Majesty!

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.894
Your Majesty! It's here!

00:18:10.027 --> 00:18:11.069
This way!

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:18.785
That way!

00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:25.292
It went this way!

00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:28.962
That way!

00:18:35.093 --> 00:18:36.887
It's the tiger, Your Majesty!

00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:43.060
This way!

00:18:51.276 --> 00:18:52.986
Open the gate!

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.545
When did I get to the palace?

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:48.834
Did you lure me here?

00:19:51.628 --> 00:19:53.046
Guards!

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.841
Drag the Grand Prince out!

00:20:01.471 --> 00:20:03.598
Where did you hide my soldiers?

00:20:07.728 --> 00:20:08.854
Of course.

00:20:09.646 --> 00:20:12.107
You're after my throne.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:15.402
I should have seen your true colors

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.072
back in the Gyeongo year.

00:20:19.156 --> 00:20:20.574
Mother!

00:20:21.283 --> 00:20:22.117
Mother.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.375
Now, who wishes to follow my father

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:31.877
into death?

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:40.802
Please stop this.

00:20:42.554 --> 00:20:44.056
Will you die in their stead?

00:20:44.723 --> 00:20:46.683
Can you handle the consequences?

00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:48.852
The prince is unwell,

00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:51.897
and you killed the last royal heir,
threatening the succession.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.648
It will give the sidelined officials

00:20:53.732 --> 00:20:56.193
the perfect pretext
to overthrow the throne.

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:58.653
How dare you?

00:20:58.737 --> 00:21:01.239
You told me not to shine,
so I stayed in the shadows.

00:21:01.323 --> 00:21:04.701
You told me to live hidden from the world,
so I always kept to myself.

00:21:06.244 --> 00:21:07.871
Please let me live that way.

00:21:10.332 --> 00:21:12.542
Please don't harm anyone

00:21:13.377 --> 00:21:15.253
so I don't have to do anything.

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:25.097
That night,

00:21:26.264 --> 00:21:28.016
I should have picked up that sword.

00:21:33.021 --> 00:21:34.439
I should have

00:21:35.065 --> 00:21:37.692
cut you down with that sword.

00:22:49.764 --> 00:22:51.224
Traitor!

00:23:01.985 --> 00:23:04.613
Must I really run my own brother through?

00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:07.115
How dare you?

00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:58.959
What you're seeing is not real.

00:24:01.795 --> 00:24:02.796
Then…

00:24:04.214 --> 00:24:05.674
what is that?

00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:14.641
Look closely.

00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:16.309
It doesn't look like a tiger.

00:24:19.646 --> 00:24:20.689
No.

00:24:21.773 --> 00:24:23.191
You're wrong.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:26.194
That can't be true.

00:24:37.664 --> 00:24:39.040
It can't be true.

00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:45.630
Are you saying

00:24:46.756 --> 00:24:48.466
I have been chasing

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.218
an illusion?

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.761
No, your vanity.

00:24:54.764 --> 00:24:55.932
Do you know

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:59.394
why you came to be like this?

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:04.107
It's because Your Majesty

00:25:04.983 --> 00:25:07.068
abandoned your duty.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.988
My duty?

00:25:10.655 --> 00:25:11.656
Your Majesty,

00:25:12.824 --> 00:25:14.909
more than anyone else in this realm,

00:25:14.993 --> 00:25:17.412
you should have taken pity on your people.

00:25:20.248 --> 00:25:22.459
They are your people, Your Majesty.

00:25:23.376 --> 00:25:24.878
Please take pity on them.

00:25:25.628 --> 00:25:26.921
That is

00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:29.549
the weight the throne carries

00:25:30.425 --> 00:25:31.760
and demands.

00:25:34.471 --> 00:25:36.556
Punishing them based solely on the appeal

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:39.517
would bring great misfortune
upon Your Majesty in the future.

00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:42.437
If my father offered advice
that was hard to hear,

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.106
it would have been meant for nothing else

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.108
but Your Majesty's own good.

00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:51.196
Please remember the sincerity
with which he came before Your Majesty,

00:25:51.738 --> 00:25:52.822
risking his own life.

00:26:11.049 --> 00:26:12.175
You're right.

00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:17.222
Hong Min-jik…

00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:20.517
Min-jik is back!

00:26:38.618 --> 00:26:39.953
It must be a royal command.

00:26:43.998 --> 00:26:44.999
All right.

00:26:45.667 --> 00:26:46.793
Go on. Speak.

00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:50.463
There is no royal command.

00:26:52.465 --> 00:26:53.633
Write this down.

00:26:53.716 --> 00:26:56.761
I, Im Jae-i, the second son
of Im Sa-hyeong, confess

00:26:56.845 --> 00:26:59.389
that I procured the poisonous herbs
on my father's orders.

00:26:59.472 --> 00:27:00.807
That is not true.

00:27:02.767 --> 00:27:03.935
Arrest me.

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:07.647
Since this is the word
of the noble Left State Councilor's son,

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.858
I suppose no further witnesses are needed.

00:27:11.109 --> 00:27:12.652
- Throw him in jail.
- Yes, sir.

00:27:15.113 --> 00:27:16.197
Let go of me!

00:27:16.281 --> 00:27:18.658
- It's all over now.
- How dare you?

00:27:19.868 --> 00:27:21.870
{\an8}I must see His Majesty!

00:27:22.954 --> 00:27:24.789
{\an8}I will go to his residence at once!

00:27:37.427 --> 00:27:39.804
What will happen now?

00:27:55.904 --> 00:27:56.905
Look.

00:27:57.906 --> 00:27:59.657
The sun is rising.

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:53.545
Yeol is already back from the villa?

00:28:55.672 --> 00:28:57.465
Where is he? Tell me now.

00:29:10.687 --> 00:29:12.814
Are you all right?

00:29:15.483 --> 00:29:16.484
Yes, Mother.

00:29:17.986 --> 00:29:19.487
Where's your usual jokes?

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.156
Where's your usual sneaky smile?

00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:33.459
I must have worn
your heart thin with worry,

00:29:35.128 --> 00:29:36.796
like these socks.

00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:42.719
Mother,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.805
it looks like I should stop idling about.

00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:48.933
The king has abdicated!

00:29:49.017 --> 00:29:50.727
{\an8}ABDICATE: TO RENOUNCE ONE'S THRONE

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.936
{\an8}We did it without bloodshed!

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.898
And our troops haven't even arrived yet!

00:29:54.981 --> 00:29:56.399
I can't believe this.

00:29:57.108 --> 00:29:58.443
I was wrong.

00:29:59.068 --> 00:30:01.821
Gil-dong and the Grand Prince were right.

00:30:09.787 --> 00:30:10.788
Eun-jo!

00:30:16.419 --> 00:30:17.670
Lady Hae-rim?

00:30:22.508 --> 00:30:23.343
Eun-jo.

00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:26.304
- Eun-jo.
- Physician Hong.

00:30:27.472 --> 00:30:29.724
- Physician Hong.
- That's right.

00:30:30.266 --> 00:30:31.267
I'm here too.

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:34.604
- Physician Hong.
- Physician Hong.

00:30:34.687 --> 00:30:36.814
- Eun-jo.
- It's Physician Hong.

00:30:36.898 --> 00:30:40.276
- Physician Hong
- Eun-jo.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.153
- Physician Hong.
- Physician Hong.

00:30:42.236 --> 00:30:45.073
How did you all…

00:30:45.156 --> 00:30:46.616
Look.

00:30:46.699 --> 00:30:48.451
The sun is finally rising.

00:31:29.158 --> 00:31:32.954
His Majesty enters!

00:32:24.297 --> 00:32:26.549
Remember a king's duties at every step.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.052
A king must take every step

00:32:29.135 --> 00:32:31.429
toward his people.

00:32:32.055 --> 00:32:34.849
I shall bear it in mind, Mother.

00:32:36.976 --> 00:32:39.520
Four deep bows!

00:32:40.688 --> 00:32:41.564
One!

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:50.990
Two!

00:32:57.163 --> 00:32:58.623
Three!

00:33:08.674 --> 00:33:10.134
Four!

00:33:13.721 --> 00:33:15.098
In recent years,

00:33:15.181 --> 00:33:17.350
Joseon has been plunged into turmoil

00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:20.561
by the sycophantic minister Im Sa-hyeong
and a tyrannical king.

00:33:20.645 --> 00:33:23.731
This is because I,
along with the officials gathered here,

00:33:24.315 --> 00:33:26.192
have failed to act upon their crimes.

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.489
However,

00:33:31.572 --> 00:33:33.866
one person took pity on the people

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.827
amid this turmoil.

00:33:38.579 --> 00:33:39.580
It's Gil-dong.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.253
As of today,

00:33:45.336 --> 00:33:48.422
all those implicated in Gil-dong's case
will be pardoned.

00:33:50.258 --> 00:33:52.510
But Your Majesty, Gil-dong is a thief--

00:33:52.593 --> 00:33:53.719
Anyone who belittles him

00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:55.721
as a mere thief

00:33:56.347 --> 00:33:59.016
or slanders his devotion to the people

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:02.270
shall be deemed a traitor

00:34:03.187 --> 00:34:05.022
who harms the moral order of Joseon.

00:34:07.775 --> 00:34:08.943
Answer me.

00:34:10.695 --> 00:34:14.615
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:34:21.956 --> 00:34:22.915
Eun-jo!

00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.835
- Mother! Young Master!
- Eun-jo.

00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:30.423
- Eun-jo.
- Young Master, be careful…

00:34:30.506 --> 00:34:32.550
Young Master, catch your breath first.

00:34:32.633 --> 00:34:34.677
That's not important right now.
Brace yourself.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.179
What is it?

00:34:37.138 --> 00:34:38.639
I heard this on my way here.

00:34:39.223 --> 00:34:40.516
The king

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.475
has been changed.

00:34:45.062 --> 00:34:47.023
Madam, she's so shocked
she can't even speak.

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:49.859
- Now, brace yourself again.
- What is it this time?

00:34:49.942 --> 00:34:51.235
The new king is

00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:54.197
Grand Prince Dowol.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.743
My heart almost jumped
out of my chest to hear this.

00:34:59.493 --> 00:35:00.369
Then put it back.

00:35:01.787 --> 00:35:02.872
What's with this reaction?

00:35:02.955 --> 00:35:05.082
It's almost dinner time.
Let's talk at home.

00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:06.459
All right.

00:35:07.793 --> 00:35:11.339
By the way,
did you sort out the mess you made?

00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:13.966
It sounds like I did.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.885
- What?
- Mother.

00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:22.308
Wait up.

00:35:24.894 --> 00:35:27.730
Yesterday, the Section Chief
of the Ministry of Personnel told me

00:35:27.813 --> 00:35:30.858
that His Majesty
is always in the main hall.

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:33.736
A military officer told me that he said,

00:35:34.862 --> 00:35:37.698
"The ministers who've been all talk
and wasting their stipends

00:35:37.782 --> 00:35:39.075
shall now work like horses."

00:35:39.158 --> 00:35:40.618
That's what His Majesty said.

00:35:40.701 --> 00:35:43.496
All officials senior third rank and above
have to work day and night.

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:45.957
That explains it.
That's why I haven't seen

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.417
any high-ranking officials
at our courtesan house lately.

00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:49.752
It's all thanks to His Majesty.

00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:57.301
Don't you realize losing customers
means losing your pay?

00:36:00.721 --> 00:36:02.890
Since when were you so interested
in the state affairs?

00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:04.100
No-eul.

00:36:04.558 --> 00:36:07.395
Does taking an interest in the king
mean I'm a loyal subject?

00:36:09.021 --> 00:36:10.356
Dream on.

00:36:10.439 --> 00:36:12.566
His Majesty already has someone
in his heart.

00:36:20.408 --> 00:36:21.867
You may have confessed,

00:36:21.951 --> 00:36:25.204
but you conspired with Im Sa-hyeong
to plunge Joseon into turmoil.

00:36:25.288 --> 00:36:27.623
I said there should be no leniency
for such a grave crime.

00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:31.377
The new king has

00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:33.921
such a loyal subject.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.303
I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:36:42.138 --> 00:36:45.391
This will be our last time.
You can at least say goodbye

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:48.978
to the woman you once cared for,
if only briefly.

00:36:50.896 --> 00:36:52.773
All I see before me is a criminal.

00:37:00.156 --> 00:37:02.575
Accept the punishment you deserve.

00:37:13.544 --> 00:37:15.254
Thanks for everything.

00:37:17.882 --> 00:37:20.009
You're leaving again without hearing this.

00:37:27.975 --> 00:37:29.352
Kim Seung-baek, that cold bastard.

00:37:29.435 --> 00:37:31.145
You're out now,
and he didn't even show up.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.649
He knows he has nothing to gain from you.

00:37:41.947 --> 00:37:44.367
I know how to live
as the son of a fallen house.

00:37:45.368 --> 00:37:48.329
Wherever you go,
just think you're an uninvited guest.

00:37:48.412 --> 00:37:49.705
Then you can endure anything.

00:37:51.207 --> 00:37:52.333
Is that a comfort?

00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:53.584
Is it not comforting?

00:37:55.294 --> 00:37:57.254
Hong Eun-jo said I should comfort you.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.301
Go tell her

00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:04.595
that I look fine.

00:38:07.807 --> 00:38:09.433
And tell her I smiled too.

00:38:15.773 --> 00:38:17.566
Why did you abandon it?

00:38:19.568 --> 00:38:21.695
I have never truly owned

00:38:23.364 --> 00:38:25.366
anything you gave me.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.581
Without what I gave you, you are nobody.

00:38:34.917 --> 00:38:35.793
I'm not sure.

00:38:38.087 --> 00:38:39.255
I hear

00:38:40.923 --> 00:38:42.299
everyone's precious.

00:38:46.887 --> 00:38:48.389
It sounds absurd,

00:38:49.473 --> 00:38:51.183
but I would like to believe that.

00:38:57.148 --> 00:38:58.315
Those words…

00:38:59.567 --> 00:39:01.152
Who told you that?

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.363
Someone who made me abandon everything.

00:39:11.203 --> 00:39:13.289
These are spare clothes
for your journey to exile.

00:39:21.755 --> 00:39:23.090
I wish you a safe trip.

00:39:29.805 --> 00:39:32.224
My death as Gil-dong…

00:39:33.559 --> 00:39:34.810
The people.

00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:38.147
The name you should fear.

00:39:39.315 --> 00:39:40.774
You're a woman.

00:39:41.358 --> 00:39:43.194
I cared for a woman…

00:39:43.277 --> 00:39:46.322
I have no regrets,
even if I cannot live a woman's life.

00:39:53.954 --> 00:39:55.247
It's you.

00:40:11.764 --> 00:40:13.390
This bitch…

00:40:18.187 --> 00:40:21.649
As Your Majesty ordered,
the land taken for the hunting grounds

00:40:21.732 --> 00:40:23.776
has been returned
to the people of Chungcheong,

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:25.986
and all losses have been compensated.

00:40:27.613 --> 00:40:28.781
Well done.

00:40:30.324 --> 00:40:31.700
What is Your Majesty reading?

00:40:32.243 --> 00:40:33.702
At the royal lecture tomorrow,

00:40:33.786 --> 00:40:36.288
I will discuss
the malpractices of provincial officials.

00:40:36.372 --> 00:40:39.083
You haven't slept
since the accession, Your Majesty.

00:40:39.166 --> 00:40:42.461
When the king is at ease,
the people bear the burden.

00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:45.422
You may go home now.

00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:53.556
Your Majesty!

00:40:54.682 --> 00:40:55.516
Your Majesty.

00:41:03.357 --> 00:41:04.441
Are you still working?

00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:07.861
I just need to prepare
the herbs for tomorrow, then I'm done.

00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:11.615
You look so calm, as if nothing happened.

00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:13.409
Whenever I think about that day,

00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:15.953
my heart still races.

00:41:16.912 --> 00:41:18.872
How can you be so calm after all that?

00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:22.459
It's in the past now,
so I must return to my duties.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.462
I've never been so at peace
as I am these days.

00:41:26.046 --> 00:41:28.090
Now, I don't need to be a thief.

00:41:33.345 --> 00:41:35.139
What's with that look?

00:41:35.222 --> 00:41:36.599
To tell you the truth,

00:41:36.682 --> 00:41:39.018
when you said
your souls had been switched,

00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:40.477
I was confused.

00:41:42.104 --> 00:41:46.567
I wasn't sure if my feelings
were for you or His Majesty.

00:41:53.532 --> 00:41:56.035
But I found the answer today.

00:41:57.369 --> 00:41:58.370
It's Gil-dong.

00:41:58.996 --> 00:41:59.997
What?

00:42:03.042 --> 00:42:04.835
You came early today.

00:42:04.918 --> 00:42:06.754
Give it to me. You should head back soon.

00:42:06.837 --> 00:42:09.131
Today, you will come with me
to the palace.

00:42:11.175 --> 00:42:13.218
Oh, dear! Finally!

00:42:13.552 --> 00:42:14.845
Oh, wait.

00:42:15.721 --> 00:42:17.890
She needs to stop by somewhere first.

00:42:20.976 --> 00:42:23.437
Why do I have to stop by here?

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.647
What brings you two here?

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:26.690
Eun-jo is going to the palace.

00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:29.401
You all know what it means, right?

00:42:29.943 --> 00:42:31.153
Come on, girls.

00:42:31.862 --> 00:42:33.572
We're closing for tonight.

00:42:37.117 --> 00:42:38.327
What?

00:42:42.456 --> 00:42:45.084
Stop fussing. It's just a nosebleed.

00:42:45.167 --> 00:42:46.752
At this rate, you'll get seriously ill.

00:42:46.835 --> 00:42:48.170
Please let the physician in.

00:42:48.754 --> 00:42:50.964
The royal physician
can't treat this illness.

00:42:52.591 --> 00:42:53.759
He's lovesick.

00:42:53.842 --> 00:42:54.802
You heard him.

00:42:55.344 --> 00:42:56.470
That's what I have.

00:42:56.553 --> 00:42:57.971
Please close the book.

00:42:58.055 --> 00:43:00.265
A great physician
is on the way to cure you.

00:43:54.695 --> 00:43:55.738
Finally.

00:43:56.488 --> 00:43:58.615
Why the fuss in the middle of the night?

00:43:58.699 --> 00:44:00.451
- What?
- I heard you haven't been sleeping.

00:44:00.534 --> 00:44:02.786
You're working in the main hall
day and night?

00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:05.289
Oh, right.

00:44:05.372 --> 00:44:08.542
He even came to ask me
to talk some sense into you.

00:44:09.877 --> 00:44:11.044
Is that what Dae-chu said?

00:44:13.088 --> 00:44:14.757
It looks like he got himself a new lord.

00:44:17.426 --> 00:44:18.302
By the way,

00:44:18.385 --> 00:44:20.512
if you're here to talk some sense into me,

00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:22.097
why are you dressed like that?

00:44:23.098 --> 00:44:24.892
What about it?

00:44:24.975 --> 00:44:26.059
You look too pretty.

00:44:26.143 --> 00:44:27.561
I can't keep my senses around you.

00:44:29.354 --> 00:44:30.564
Well,

00:44:30.647 --> 00:44:33.525
they did say
it's like a combat suit for women.

00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:34.860
Combat?

00:44:34.943 --> 00:44:36.028
Did you have a fight?

00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:37.362
Who was it this time?

00:44:37.446 --> 00:44:38.489
"This time"?

00:44:39.323 --> 00:44:42.117
I just said
I was going to meet someone and…

00:44:42.201 --> 00:44:43.410
Meet someone?

00:44:43.494 --> 00:44:44.703
Meet who?

00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:47.790
It doesn't matter.

00:44:47.873 --> 00:44:50.000
Why won't you let the royal physician in?

00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:51.001
It matters.

00:44:51.084 --> 00:44:53.212
Who are you meeting
with such determination?

00:44:54.546 --> 00:44:57.382
Excuse me. Are you listening to me?

00:44:57.466 --> 00:44:58.550
Yes, I'm listening.

00:44:58.634 --> 00:45:00.010
And I've always wanted to.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:07.351
I guess you weren't.

00:45:10.145 --> 00:45:11.688
I was listening to you too.

00:45:13.899 --> 00:45:15.317
I had no choice.

00:45:17.736 --> 00:45:19.279
What brings you all the way here?

00:45:19.363 --> 00:45:20.489
His Highness…

00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:22.032
I mean, His Majesty.

00:45:22.115 --> 00:45:23.116
His Majesty sent this.

00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:33.877
This is my first night in the palace

00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:35.754
ever since you left.

00:45:39.675 --> 00:45:42.678
After the sudden abdication,
the court has been pretty busy.

00:45:44.805 --> 00:45:47.975
I've been meeting with the ministers
to address the neglected state affairs

00:45:48.058 --> 00:45:49.643
and stabilize Joseon.

00:45:52.729 --> 00:45:54.439
I shall not let this time be wasted

00:45:55.065 --> 00:45:57.192
for my people.

00:45:59.861 --> 00:46:01.363
I hope this lets you have

00:46:11.123 --> 00:46:14.501
a restful night, for once.

00:46:24.845 --> 00:46:26.263
This is the second night.

00:46:28.432 --> 00:46:30.934
The palace is preparing
for the accession ceremony.

00:46:37.274 --> 00:46:41.361
Would Your Majesty consider reinstating
those expelled in the Gyeongo Year?

00:46:42.154 --> 00:46:44.031
They keep asking me questions.

00:46:44.114 --> 00:46:46.366
I'm realizing that the one
who makes decisions

00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:50.495
cannot leave their post even for a moment.

00:46:54.124 --> 00:46:55.334
And so,

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.338
once again tonight,
I watch the night turn to dawn,

00:47:00.714 --> 00:47:02.007
thinking of you.

00:47:07.346 --> 00:47:08.513
I can only hope

00:47:10.766 --> 00:47:12.434
{\an8}you sleep soundly tonight.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.360
This is the third night.

00:47:24.237 --> 00:47:25.739
This is the fourth night.

00:47:44.466 --> 00:47:45.967
This is the fifth night.

00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:50.597
Now,

00:47:51.848 --> 00:47:53.266
it's the tenth night already.

00:47:56.019 --> 00:47:57.854
These days, I look forward to this hour

00:47:58.689 --> 00:48:01.191
at day's end, when I count the nights.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.413
Tonight,

00:48:15.163 --> 00:48:16.289
the stars shine

00:48:17.374 --> 00:48:18.583
brighter than ever.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:21.586
That must be why.

00:48:22.713 --> 00:48:24.548
I have missed you every night,

00:48:24.631 --> 00:48:26.466
but tonight,

00:48:27.676 --> 00:48:29.010
I miss you more than ever.

00:48:30.637 --> 00:48:31.680
Hong Eun-jo.

00:49:39.289 --> 00:49:40.957
Are you sure you were listening?

00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:44.294
Yes, it's burned into my brain.

00:49:44.377 --> 00:49:45.879
You wrote it in every letter

00:49:45.962 --> 00:49:47.964
that you missed me and wanted to see me.

00:49:48.048 --> 00:49:49.549
I heard that for ten straight days.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:52.844
So it did reach you.

00:49:53.762 --> 00:49:55.138
I thought you never got it

00:49:55.222 --> 00:49:56.598
because you didn't reply.

00:49:59.559 --> 00:50:01.102
I've been busy with this and that,

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.314
just like any other commoner.

00:50:06.566 --> 00:50:08.151
Why are you still busy?

00:50:08.235 --> 00:50:11.363
So this king worked
day and night for nothing.

00:50:13.073 --> 00:50:14.199
Exactly.

00:50:14.991 --> 00:50:16.868
You should take this and get some sleep.

00:50:16.952 --> 00:50:18.537
Exactly.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.454
I'm not taking it.

00:50:20.038 --> 00:50:21.873
We haven't seen each other for so long.

00:50:22.833 --> 00:50:24.501
I'll spend the whole night watching you.

00:50:30.966 --> 00:50:32.551
I went to the royal pharmacy,

00:50:32.634 --> 00:50:35.428
carefully picked these herbs,

00:50:35.512 --> 00:50:37.806
and prepared this with all my heart.

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:40.892
Your heart?

00:50:44.062 --> 00:50:45.480
You've been to the royal pharmacy?

00:50:48.149 --> 00:50:49.860
When our bodies were switched,

00:50:49.943 --> 00:50:53.780
I went there several times
to brew a decoction for the Queen Dowager.

00:50:59.578 --> 00:51:02.873
I managed to act like a Grand Prince then,

00:51:03.915 --> 00:51:05.584
but if we get switched again,

00:51:05.667 --> 00:51:07.252
I have to be a king…

00:51:23.059 --> 00:51:24.603
I can't do that.

00:51:49.794 --> 00:51:52.964
The prisoner has escaped!

00:52:09.147 --> 00:52:10.148
Hong Eun-jo.

00:52:34.047 --> 00:52:35.632
Did you wake up?

00:52:41.638 --> 00:52:42.472
What's wrong?

00:52:54.401 --> 00:52:56.361
Did you have a bad dream?

00:52:58.029 --> 00:53:00.657
Did we get switched in the dream?

00:53:01.282 --> 00:53:02.283
Yes.

00:53:03.368 --> 00:53:04.953
You disappeared.

00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:12.252
I thought something bad
happened to you again

00:53:12.335 --> 00:53:14.254
and I was left alone in your body.

00:53:16.631 --> 00:53:18.091
What do you mean…

00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:26.891
Come to think of it,

00:53:27.475 --> 00:53:29.019
every time we got switched…

00:53:30.603 --> 00:53:32.439
We were in mortal danger.

00:53:38.987 --> 00:53:40.363
Did you know?

00:53:46.202 --> 00:53:47.954
Why didn't you tell me?

00:53:50.081 --> 00:53:51.666
Because I didn't want to see this face.

00:53:55.253 --> 00:53:57.088
I don't care
how many times we get switched.

00:53:59.049 --> 00:54:01.509
Every time it happens,
I'll run to you at once…

00:54:03.386 --> 00:54:04.846
until my feet hurt.

00:54:12.771 --> 00:54:14.022
This isn't good.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:18.234
From now on,

00:54:18.318 --> 00:54:20.361
I forbid you to hurt your feet.

00:54:20.445 --> 00:54:22.238
What? Forbid?

00:54:24.282 --> 00:54:25.408
And there's one more.

00:54:26.201 --> 00:54:28.453
I forbid you to have bad dreams tonight.

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:35.168
Is there another one?

00:54:37.045 --> 00:54:38.088
What is it?

00:54:40.256 --> 00:54:41.966
I forbid you to miss me.

00:54:42.759 --> 00:54:43.593
What? Why?

00:54:43.676 --> 00:54:45.220
It's my feelings.

00:54:45.303 --> 00:54:46.429
You must be thirsty.

00:54:47.514 --> 00:54:48.723
Here. Drink up.

00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:54.979
Answer me.

00:54:56.856 --> 00:54:57.816
What?

00:54:59.192 --> 00:55:00.276
I drank it.

00:55:03.988 --> 00:55:05.365
Now, let's get you to bed.

00:55:23.758 --> 00:55:25.301
He knew all along.

00:55:26.386 --> 00:55:28.138
He said he wished he were wrong,

00:55:28.221 --> 00:55:29.889
and he had to be wrong.

00:55:29.973 --> 00:55:32.058
It turned out he was right, though.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.894
If one of you

00:55:34.978 --> 00:55:36.855
end up in danger again…

00:55:40.024 --> 00:55:41.609
That won't happen.

00:55:41.693 --> 00:55:43.361
From now on,

00:55:43.444 --> 00:55:46.114
I'll do everything I can
to protect myself.

00:55:50.034 --> 00:55:51.035
So…

00:55:57.041 --> 00:55:58.376
please protect him.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.047
His Majesty?

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:05.425
That's what I've been doing.

00:56:05.508 --> 00:56:06.885
More than I'm paid for.

00:56:08.011 --> 00:56:10.305
I really shouldn't be doing
more than I'm paid for.

00:56:37.498 --> 00:56:39.042
Come to think of it,

00:56:39.125 --> 00:56:40.710
every time we got switched…

00:56:44.339 --> 00:56:46.216
We were in mortal danger.

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:51.763
Were we protecting each other?

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.874
The last ten days
have been wonderful for me.

00:57:24.128 --> 00:57:27.423
Your letters asking after me
brought me joy,

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:34.889
your goodnight wishes warmed my heart,

00:57:38.434 --> 00:57:41.062
and hearing that you missed me
gave me comfort.

00:57:43.982 --> 00:57:45.525
Tonight,

00:57:45.608 --> 00:57:48.361
I will take your longing with me,

00:57:51.322 --> 00:57:54.117
so you can sleep peacefully.

00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:58.955
And I hope

00:57:59.998 --> 00:58:01.958
I will miss you dearly,

00:58:06.504 --> 00:58:08.256
deeply,

00:58:10.758 --> 00:58:12.176
and for a long time.

00:58:21.019 --> 00:58:22.520
I can't stop you, right?

00:58:23.479 --> 00:58:24.314
No.

00:58:24.397 --> 00:58:26.149
I should go, because I'm offended.

00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:29.068
Why don't you at least wait until dawn?

00:58:29.986 --> 00:58:31.613
I want it to be tonight.

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:33.573
What are you going to do?

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:36.826
My old resolution.

00:59:31.339 --> 00:59:33.424
You ruined everything…

00:59:40.056 --> 00:59:41.224
Gil-dong.

01:00:33.901 --> 01:00:35.194
{\an8}Step aside.

01:00:35.278 --> 01:00:36.904
{\an8}Is Hong Eun-jo there?

01:00:36.988 --> 01:00:39.323
{\an8}Something bothered me, so I went to check.

01:00:39.407 --> 01:00:40.825
{\an8}He left this for Your Majesty.

01:00:40.908 --> 01:00:42.034
{\an8}Hong Eun-jo is in danger.

01:00:42.118 --> 01:00:43.161
{\an8}I'm still me.

01:00:43.244 --> 01:00:46.831
{\an8}Try anything foolish,
I'll stab you and kill your mother too.

01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:50.835
{\an8}He must have received my letter by now.

01:00:50.918 --> 01:00:52.128
{\an8}It's Im Sa-hyeong's trap!

01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:53.921
{\an8}I'm the one Im Sa-hyeong is after.

01:00:54.005 --> 01:00:56.382
{\an8}"If you want to save Gil-dong's life,

01:00:56.466 --> 01:00:58.009
{\an8}come alone."

01:00:58.634 --> 01:00:59.552
{\an8}Hong Eun-jo.

01:00:59.635 --> 01:01:00.803
Hong Eun-jo!

01:01:12.607 --> 01:01:14.609
