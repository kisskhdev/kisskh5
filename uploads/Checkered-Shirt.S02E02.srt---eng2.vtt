00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:27.569
Hello?

00:00:28.737 --> 00:00:31.281
I'm Lee Han-gyul's ex-boyfriend.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.700
Do you really know who Lee Han-gyul is before dating him?

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.787
Lee Han-gyul hit on you first, didn't he?

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.124
No, that's just how he is.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.793
Why do you think he's suddenly preparing to transfer universities?

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:47.047
It's because he has a guilty conscience about something.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.132
He...

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.925
Do you know his relationships with guys are messy?

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:51.968
Hey.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.805
If you badmouth Lee Han-gyul one more time,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.725
I won't let it slide.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.625
So good...

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.335
Your smell, Hyung.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.462
When did you wake up?

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.173
Just now.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.718
I was shocked because I thought you disappeared, Hyung.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.263
Why would I disappear?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.851
Why do you think he's suddenly preparing to transfer universities?

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.020
It's because he has a guilty conscience about something.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.773
Do you think it'd be good if I transferred to our school?

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.944
I'm excited.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.904
About the people and the classes too?

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.992
Even though I won't be there?

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.832
I'll wait for you.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.584
While thinking, "Hyung must have taken this class too"?

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:10.922
Ay...

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:14.259
Aren't you supposed to smile when your boyfriend says something like that?

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.345
You're making it obvious you've never dated before.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.486
I don't know...

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.488
I'm going to do it my way.

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.217
Long time no see.

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:58.803
Hey.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.723
Are you still mad?

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:08.980
I'm sorry.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:15.445
I was short-sighted, man.

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.989
If you know, then it's fine.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:22.827
Hey, but what are you doing?

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.746
Searching for a bakery.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.498
My boyfriend said he really wants to go to Uptown Bakery.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.334
Hey, I heard that place is super famous.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.711
I think there's only one branch in Seoul, at Donghan University.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.545
Donghan University?

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.296
Yeah.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.007
I went there with Minji last week.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.635
Wow, it was swarming with Donghan students.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.637
I thought they were lining up for the school cafeteria.

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:07.121
[Jung-woo Hyung: Almost there]

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.960
Do you think Park Jung-woo wouldn't do that? Huh?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.586
That jerk is probably exactly the same.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.520
They say this is the most famous thing at Uptown.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.772
You said we'd go together.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:36.776
Well... I heard the waiting line was super long.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.028
Ah, we still should have gone together.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.365
The weather's bad anyway, let's just stay home, okay?

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.034
I heard a lot of fun stuff came out on OTT platforms.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.414
Are you doing this on purpose?

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.960
You never even watch movies until the end.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:59.090
Next time, you have to go with me, for sure.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.719
Shall we go on a trip?

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:07.890
Suddenly?

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.520
I heard there's a branch of that bakery on Jeju Island too.

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.273
How about we go after your transfer exam is over?

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:19.986
Two days after I take the exam...

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.322
is your enlistment, Hyung.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.950
That's exactly why we should go.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:33.041
Well... do you like that idea?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.596
[Day of Jeju Island Trip]

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:54.395
[Lee Han-gyul: I just arrived!]

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:09.035
Hyung!

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.851
Oh, Han-gyul, it's Jaeseop Hyung.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:35.937
Yes.

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:38.064
Ah...

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.525
The thing is, Jung-woo...

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.860
He says he can't make it to Jeju today.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.946
He asked me to tell you not to wait for him.

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.825
Ah, why are you telling me that, Hyung...?

00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:53.204
Listen...

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.999
Jung-woo might contact you, so just wait for now.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.126
Huh?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.293
I'm hanging up.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.629
H-hello?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.213
Hyung.

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:26.320
[Lee Han-gyul: Hyung, what on earth happened?]

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.991
[Lee Han-gyul: Why can't I reach you?]

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.621
Since that day,

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.874
to anyone, about Jung-woo Hyung's news...

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.835
I couldn't hear a thing.
