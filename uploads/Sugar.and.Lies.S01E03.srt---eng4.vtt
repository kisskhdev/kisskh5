00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.480
So this is your ride.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.440
What, not a fan?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.880
Aren't you a big boss now?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.040
And you still drive this?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.760
A big boss can drive whatever they want.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.000
So they get whatever they want.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.920
You've had this planned all along, huh?

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.760
Well?

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.720
Miss Ding,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480
dare to get in?

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.720
Sure.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.120
I'm fearless.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.680
My colleague, Lin Xibei.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.960
Keep Love's results show

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.120
she's definitely single.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.360
Is there something off
about the feng shui here?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.200
What do you mean?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.360
Don't pretend you don't get it.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.680
He really doesn't know.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640
Miss Lin, your hearing is sharp.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.080
Call me Sister Xi.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.320
Sister Xi's a data genius.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.390
She's Yu Kun's apprentice.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.520
She's amazing.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.680
Our numbers look great.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.480
She pulled in all the viewers.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.200
Say your compliments louder.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.120
I don't mind.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.000
Thanks.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.480
See you tomorrow.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.360
Miss Gu.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.080
Tonight...

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.920
Do you have time?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.000
No.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240
What a coincidence.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.640
Me neither.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.280
So childish.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.180
(Probability of Falling in Love)

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.260
(Bonus: Stay at the café up ahead.)

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.960
You still only drink Americano.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.200
No sugar, no milk.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.280
I tend to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.680
hold on to old habits.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.200
Is your Keep Love app really reliable?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.960
You can go try it yourself.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.480
See how compatible
you and your fiancé are.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.800
Or you can try

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.400
the Pre-marriage Contraception Package.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.960
Will you get me a membership?

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.640
It's free for you, for life.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.880
Then I want some extra perks too.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.160
What kind of perks are you after?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.400
A free, unlimited privilege

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.160
to date the founder

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.800
of Keep Love for life.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.560
That feature

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.080
is still under development.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.400
Miss Ding.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.990
How about visiting Aiye Town after this?

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.160
I'm fine with anything.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.520
I'll just go with your plans.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.680
(Why did you still act so indifferent)

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.240
(after I mentioned the Aiye Town?)

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.500
(Suga Love)

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.920
This is already his...

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.280
fifth cup of coffee.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.920
It's fine.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.640
Ruomai is here to smooth things over.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.900
(Medical Diagnosis Certificate)

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.320
She's developed a severe case of

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.760
pre-wedding jitters.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.360
The doctor advised her
to get out and relax.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.760
Doctor's orders?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.520
Sounds more like you told her that.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.520
Me?

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.120
I called her just now.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.400
A guy picked up.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.480
No way it was a guy.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.440
When I talk normally,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.080
a lot of people say I sound like a guy.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.640
If you keep making things up,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680
I'll call the police.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.360
President Hu, wait.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.400
Stay calm.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.720
Especially now, you need to stay cool.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.000
You're about to get engaged.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.000
Mancheng isn't a big place.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.880
If word gets out about this,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.880
who knows how others

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.400
will twist the story.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.920
You know it's inappropriate.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.080
So where exactly is Ding Daang?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.400
Ding Daang...

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.480
It's all my fault.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.320
I let her go out alone.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.240
That was reckless of me.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.560
President Hu, don't rush.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.200
I'll help you find her.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.840
I'll make sure to bring her to you

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.400
before the engagement.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.240
Can you stop pretending to be pitiful?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.000
President Hu, don't worry.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.600
Once Ding Daang is found,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.560
I'll have a serious talk with her.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.200
I mean, she's marrying
such a great guy like you.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.520
What's there to be anxious about?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.680
Why make such a fuss?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.000
But still,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.760
you should try to understand her a bit.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.360
Like the Keep Love said,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.600
the pain from one's original family

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.560
takes a lifetime to heal.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.440
Gu Ruomai,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.840
I'm the one who's engaged to her.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.120
I'll be the one to help her heal.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.380
But first, she needs to come home.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.520
I've gone over every moment
of their reunion.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.240
His heartbeat and his breath

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.360
show that he can't let go
of an old flame.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.800
So there's a chance.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.960
It depends on how he plays his cards.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.440
Oh right.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.720
One more thing.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.160
Can you boost

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.800
the Chemistry Score between me

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.560
and Gu Ruomai on the back end?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.360
I already raised it by twenty last week.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.120
Otherwise you think she'd be a streamer?

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.040
Ten grand.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.480
You'd better rein yourself in.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.370
No need.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.440
Let me burn bright while I can.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.120
Keep this up
and the boss will catch on to you.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.840
How about...

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.440
adding it up to two grand?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.520
If it go south,
I'll take the blame alone.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.360
Look at you.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.000
You just can't

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.480
get your eyes off the money, can you?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.990
That's better than throwing yourself

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.360
into love ocean headfirst.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.400
Relax.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.440
I'm a great swimmer.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.560
It's always the good swimmers
who end up drowning.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360
You know what?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.000
You're such a die-hard fan of the boss.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.250
Your Guardian Score must be 100.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.320
So what? What can we do about it?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.120
We chased so many sunrises together.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.320
Turns out sunset
is the most romantic confession.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.920
I never thought

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.720
we'd get another chance

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.040
to be together like this again.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.280
Me neither.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.840
After all this time,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.720
you're still clinging to hopeless romance.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.720
Miss First Love.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.240
You're finally awake.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.720
Come on, let's watch the stars.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So...

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.480
this is what you've been hiding

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.720
in the trunk of your car.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.440
You always said
you wanted to camp in Mount Nan.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.080
But you never did it even once.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.360
You…

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.040
When did you change your name?

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.890
When I wanted to leave the past behind.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.720
Leave our past behind too?

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.480
Forgetting you would be pretty hard.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.960
I just had a dream in the car.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.560
A nightmare?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.600
After you left,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.680
I kept having nightmares.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.400
Aming.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.360
Before this…

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.240
did I ever hurt you?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.400
If I did,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.560
I owe you an apology.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.520
Here, take this.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.480
Where did you get all that money?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.400
I have my own way.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.480
No.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.520
Take it back.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840
I can't accept it.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.600
Brother.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.320
Your mom's still in the hospital.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.240
Just take it.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.400
No.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560
Ding Daang.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.960
My family already owes you too much.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.920
I can't take this money.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.600
If that's really how you feel,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.160
then spend your lifetime paying it back.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.600
I told you, I can't. I just can't.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.440
If you truly want to help me,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.680
then stay away from me.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.120
Aming.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.320
Chen Aming.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.520
Aming.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.520
After you left back then,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.960
it felt like a piece of my heart
was missing.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.160
I tried so hard to fill that gap,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.760
but no matter what I did,
it never worked.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.280
But look, I'm back now.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.080
Yeah, but you'll still leave again,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.480
won't you?

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.280
Let's treat these few days

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.400
like a dream.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.720
Just enjoy this dream while it lasts.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.080
That's enough.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.960
(If I wish this dream would never end,)

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.560
(would you stay with me?)

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.760
(Too bad,)

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.160
(the person in your dream isn't me.)

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.200
Don't forget why you're back to Mancheng.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.080
It's not for love,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.320
but for work.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.000
And don't forget

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.400
livestreaming is work.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.450
Not some company-sponsored romance.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.280
Numbers don't lie.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200
I'll only say this once.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.680
I'm not joking.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.080
I really don't want to leave.
