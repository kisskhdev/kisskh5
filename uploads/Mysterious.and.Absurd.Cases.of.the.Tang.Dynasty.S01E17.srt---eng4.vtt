00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.240
Who are you?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.200
Let me go.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.080
I beg you, let me go.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.600
Let me go.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.640
Please, let me go.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.040
Let me go. I beg you.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.200
What a fine body.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.040
Why be a prostitute?

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.040
And defile yourself?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.160
Please spare me.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.720
Let me go.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.840
Please, let me go.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.200
I beg you, let me go.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840
I'll give you whatever you want.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.960
Please let me go.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.840
Don't kill me.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.560
Mmh.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.800
Spare me, I beg you.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.880
Let me go.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.240
I am doing this to help you.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.880
To help you cleanse the filth of the flesh.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.720
Those who defiled you...

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.880
...also deserve to die.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.120
All deserve to die.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.360
All deserve to die.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.560
This annoying rainy weather...

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.160
...has finally stopped.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.720
What is this?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.880
Guess what Big Brother...

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.600
...brought for you to play with today.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.680
Which one do you want?

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.600
I want this one.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.560
Then you take this one.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.080
I'll find one for you too.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.320
How about this one?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.320
Okay.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.280
Children, breakfast is here.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.640
Time to eat.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.920
Put the toys away properly.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.360
Eat up, eat up.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.000
Me too, me too!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.760
There's enough for everyone.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.600
Everyone gets some.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.320
Don't fight over it.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.080
Everyone gets some.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.400
Big Brother Liu Tong.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.480
The things you brought last time are still here.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.320
Making these takes time and effort.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.840
You don't have to go to such trouble.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.680
Because of my appearance...

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.320
...only you...

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.840
...and these children don't despise me.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.040
Being able to do something for them...

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.960
...is the least I can do.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.320
As for you...

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.440
...at such a blooming age...

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.080
...revolving around these children every day.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.440
These children...

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.960
...were either left behind by the dead...

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.800
...or left behind by criminals.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.280
My sworn brother was afraid they'd have nowhere to go.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.080
I'm considering this as helping my sworn brother out.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.760
Then your sworn brother...

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.680
...how is Junior Minister Yao's investigation going?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.880
Another victim appeared this morning.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.240
Dismembered.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.160
Another rainy night.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.400
I fear it was done by the same person as the night before last.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880
We were still a step too late.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.680
Such inhumanity.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.320
It is truly an outrage to gods and men.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.920
The killer clearly could have...

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.800
...dumped the body parts in the mountains.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.840
Why dump them here?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.960
This is a place where commoners gather.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.360
Is the killer trying to cause panic?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.880
He doesn't just want to kill.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.680
He wants to instill fear in people's hearts even more.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.920
He wants to disrupt all of Chang'an.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.560
Perhaps he enjoys this feeling.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.120
Give the order.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.200
All gathering places in Chang'an...

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.160
...search for body parts.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.760
East and West Markets, Pingkang Ward, Vermilion Bird Avenue.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.520
Chongren Ward, the city gates.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.480
Lord Vice Minister.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.480
Body parts found on south Vermilion Bird Avenue.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.640
Confirmed.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.760
My Lord, body parts found in Pingkang Ward.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.680
My Lord, body parts found in the East Market.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.440
My Lord, body parts found in the West Market.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.120
My Lord, body parts found at the East City Gate.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.520
My Lord, body parts found at the South City Gate.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.200
Old Yao

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.720
It's been a whole day.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.240
You haven't had a drop to drink. Rest a bit.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.520
If I rest, I'm giving the culprit time.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.200
Not bad, Vice Minister.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.720
You have the style I had back in the day.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.440
You...

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.480
Vice Minister.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.160
Shut up.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.880
Vice Minister.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.560
Mm.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.040
Based on the portrait you reconstructed,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.280
the identity of the deceased is confirmed.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.440
Chun'er, the Top Courtesan of Hundred Phoenixes Pavilion.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.480
Another prostitute.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.920
Also on a rainy night.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.000
Mm.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.120
Also not sexually assaulted.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.840
A total of thirty-seven body parts.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.880
The lungs are missing.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.040
Yet the torso remains intact.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.200
The second painting has appeared.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.880
Appearance stems from the mind.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.800
Vicious, cruel, heartless.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.520
Derives pleasure from the act of killing.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.400
Capable of killing through the night,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.800
and dumping bodies all across Chang'an.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.360
Given his agility,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.600
he cannot be a heavy man.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.040
His targets are all prostitutes,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.800
yet the victims were not sexually assaulted.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.760
He is not driven by lust.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.600
The money earned by prostitutes

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.680
is held by the Madam,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.640
so he cannot be after money either.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.080
He destroys their faces...

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.880
Is it out of inferiority?

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.560
Is he ugly?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.080
Or does he have scars on his face?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.840
If he has scars on his face,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.880
he would surely cover them with his hair.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:07.960
It's another rainy night.
