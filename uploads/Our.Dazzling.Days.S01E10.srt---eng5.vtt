[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.720
[Episode 10]

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.870
Make way!

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.940
Don't block the way. Move!

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.870
A thorough inspection was conducted,
covering the process, installation,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.310
materials, and quality.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.770
Strictly...

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.910
Director, I told him
you were in a meeting,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.430
but I couldn't stop him.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.030
Piss off.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.240
That factory kid, Zhang Xiaoman,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.000
was taken away by the City Bureau.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.730
What do we do?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.130
I heard from Security.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.730
Isn't he the kid who got into a brawl

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.960
in the family quarters last night?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.120
How was it a brawl?

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.800
It wasn't a brawl.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.470
Those hooligans were looking for trouble.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.840
Xiaoman was acting in self-defense.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.590
H-How did it...

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.120
escalate into a brawl?

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.120
Mr. Ding, it's not up to us to decide.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.800
You have to trust the government

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.670
and our laws.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.970
If it was self-defense like you said,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.310
then Xiaoman will be fine.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.450
No one will wrong him, right?

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.710
Well, that's how it is.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.030
Let's put aside
whether he's wronged or not.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.090
I feel so sorry for that kid, Xiaoman.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.070
His dad is gone. No one looks after him.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.870
You... just stop the meeting.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.680
Go with me to the City Bureau

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.420
and bring him back first.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.950
Let's go.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.490
Move it, won't you?

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.430
No, Mr. Ding.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.080
Our entire factory has
ten to twenty thousand employees.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.610
Fights happen every month.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.520
If I have to go pick them up every time,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.250
how will the factory function?

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.400
Besides, I'm not in charge of
the City Bureau's leaders.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.910
My hands are tied.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.480
If there's nothing else, please leave.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.540
We're in a meeting.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.310
Mr. Ding, the leadership team
is in a meeting.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.000
I'll whack you.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.730
-Sit down.
-What are you doing?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.980
Ding Guoqiang.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.110
You still want to fight?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.020
Come, hit me!

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.340
The whole factory knows it anyway.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.870
You slapped me once before.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.829
It doesn't matter if you
hit me with a rolling pin now.

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:31.640
Come on, do it!

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.960
I was wrong.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.120
I shouldn't have

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.380
slapped you back then.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.870
How about this?

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.770
You slap me twice.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.560
Get even.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.430
How about I kowtow to you?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.120
M-Mr. Ding!

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.320
W-What are you doing?

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.870
I'll get on my knees. Is that okay?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.930
What are you doing?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.680
What happened between us

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.520
is in the past.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.100
If I really had a grudge against you,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.100
I wouldn't have waited until today.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.100
How about this? Let's tell them

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.800
how pitiful Xiaoman is.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.220
He has no family to rely on.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.380
He's taking the college entrance exam.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.110
This could ruin his whole life.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.100
Mr. Ding.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.120
In the past,

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.079
Security would handle fights
within the factory.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.410
If so, I could have a say.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.339
But things are different now.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.320
It's been escalated to the City Bureau.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.550
It won't make a difference even if I go.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.630
How would it be of no use?

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.720
Director, everyone knows

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.070
you're a prefecture-level cadre
who transferred over.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.430
Even the vice mayor has to respect you.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.040
Even the Bureau Chief

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.170
has to listen to you.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.190
We're not asking for much.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.270
Let's just clear this up

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.040
and get the kid out.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.270
Okay, Mr. Ding.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.360
I'll go with you.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.870
I'll go with you.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.560
Let's go.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.480
Okay.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.870
The rolling pin.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.750
What's wrong?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.360
Yan Xiaodan, get back here!

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.920
Yan Xiaodan, get back here!

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.270
Officer,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.250
I understand we have legal procedures and

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.970
organizational discipline.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.720
But Zhang Xiaoman is
a child of our factory.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.000
As the factory director,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.040
I must take responsibility for him.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.180
Of course,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.870
it was definitely wrong for
Zhang Xiaoman to hurt someone.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.870
After we get back,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.750
we will discipline him.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.680
However,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.950
I do also understand

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.300
what exactly happened.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.430
It was mainly because Feng Xiaobo

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.490
retaliated first.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.870
So I hope the police

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.020
will investigate thoroughly

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.480
and handle this properly.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.220
Mr. Ding?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.720
Allow me to say a few words.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.520
Go ahead.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.120
Xiaoman was the one being bullied.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.830
Why couldn't he fight back?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.270
Look.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.100
You're wearing a police uniform.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.580
And I used to wear a military uniform.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.020
To be straightfoward,

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.190
it was just a fight between teens.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.040
Aren't some scrapes

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.600
and a little bleeding normal?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.070
So what?

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.730
Is it necessary to lock him up?

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.510
Besides, before you became a cop,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.440
have you never gotten into a fight?

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.909
What I mean is,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.120
I-I'll take Xiaoman back,

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.270
and I'll discipline him at home.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.480
I'm more effective than the police.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.210
Mr. Ding, let me put it this way.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.570
This is no longer just
a fight between children.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.270
Isn't it just—

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.120
Feng Xiaobo is being resuscitated
in the hospital.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.470
Zhang Xiaoman's actions

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.460
have caused serious consequences.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.870
If you are asking me to release him now,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.120
I definitely can't.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.630
Look, this is just...

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.870
Say something.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.820
You see... this kid...

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.240
Let's not talk about the
college entrance exam.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.270
If this gets on his record,

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.450
it'll ruin his whole life.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.690
What are you doing?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.720
Can you keep it down?

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.270
So I can't speak?

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.670
This is a police station.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.400
Officer Leng, look.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.520
Officer Leng.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.510
If you find it difficult

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.720
to make a decision

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.480
right now,

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.210
I can meet your superiors.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.920
I know Chief Wang quite well.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.040
I can explain the situation

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.110
to him,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.870
and we can discuss

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
a solution together. Okay?

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.330
Director Meng.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.720
To be honest,

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.120
no one can help you now.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680
Zhang Xiaoman has caused

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.210
substantial harm to Feng Xiaobo.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.330
And we have already

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.280
initiated judicial proceedings.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.720
But please trust the police

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.870
and the law

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.720
to give him a fair outcome.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:55.920
Okay?

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.770
Please go back for now.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.000
So what now?

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.070
Xiaoman has lost his father.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.040
How can I just stand by and watch?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.970
Keep it down. The child is outside.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.480
All's good. I'm handling it.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.640
Chief Engineer Yan.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.440
Yan.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.200
Tell us about it.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:40.669
Director Meng.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.080
Captain Leng.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.210
Chief Engineer Yan.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.330
If it's convenient,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.720
I'll talk to you alone.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.320
What is this?

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.510
Why the private talk?

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.170
Why can't you say it to my face?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.910
The kid is about to go to jail.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.270
What are you dawdling about?

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:54.870
Mr. Ding,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.910
watch your attitude.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.510
Stop picking on me, I'm telling you!

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.310
What? You going to detain me too?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720
What is wrong with you people?

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.080
Can't you calm down?

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.270
Watch your attitude, will you?

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.080
What kind of attitude am I having?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080
If your Meng Ge had been arrested,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.270
would you be watching your attitude?

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.930
W-Who could stand all of this?

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.880
Talking about that is useless.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.750
Come. Sit down.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.090
Sit down.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.840
Why are you here?

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.220
You have no business here. Go home.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.840
What do you mean it's none of my business?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.240
If it weren't for me,
would Xiaoman be here?

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.860
This is everything that
happened that night.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.980
I wrote it all down.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.720
I even put my fingerprint on it.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.550
I can testify.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.720
Xiaoman was just defending me.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.240
This has nothing to do with Xiaodan.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240
I can testify!

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.510
Chen, take him outside.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.240
Officer Leng!

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.910
Go outside first.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.790
I can testify.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.290
Chief Engineer Yan.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.670
Everyone, please step outside
for a moment.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.120
Okay.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:06.990
You too.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.670
Let's go.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.510
Thanks for the trouble.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.630
Why are you coming out again?

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.550
What are you doing?

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.040
What is going on here?

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.030
Chen.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.240
Bring Zhang Xiaoman in.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.800
Yes, Sir.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:32.830
Come in.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:38.730
Go inside.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.580
Chen, step out and close the door.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.400
Yes, Sir.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.910
Zhang Xiaoman.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.080
When you gave your statement,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.080
why didn't you mention that

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.270
it was Feng Xiaobo who was
attempting to assault

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.080
Yan Xiaodan?

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.720
Officer Leng,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.300
I started it.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.630
Xiaodan had already run away.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.910
This has nothing to do with her.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.510
Zhang Xiaoman, let me remind you.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.710
This determines the nature of the case.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.160
Think clearly before you speak.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.800
Officer Leng.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.750
Can I...

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.600
ask you for a favor?

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:25.840
Go ahead.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.080
Xiaodan is taking the
college entrance exam soon.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.810
It's less than two months away.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.550
Can we keep this

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.400
from affecting her exam?

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.270
Understood.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.120
It's also the police's duty to protect
the involved parties.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.890
How about this?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.080
Think it over carefully.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.510
Tell me when you've thought it through,

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.400
and whether you want

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.870
to add to your statement.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.050
Also, let me remind you of one thing.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.120
Don't let Yan Xiaodan down

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.980
after all that she's done for you.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.720
You...

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.010
You just won't listen.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.240
I told you long ago

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.240
that if something like this happens,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.120
just leave it to your family.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.870
Xiaodan, are you involved in this too?

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.800
Why are you here?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.850
Enough. Come home with me.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.130
I won't.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.370
Let's go.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:41.840
Goodness.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.440
Let me see.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.080
How did this happen?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.120
You and Mom shouldn't have locked me in.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.270
What a beast. Locking up your own child?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.190
Shut up.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.790
Dad, don't you think you're too selfish?

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.450
I know you don't like Xiaoman.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.720
But compared to someone's life and future,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.720
is your reputation that important?

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.960
You're still young.
There are things you don't understand.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.490
I'll explain it to you slowly
when we get home.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.880
Is Xiaoman alright now?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.940
Xiaodan, thank you.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.140
The information you provided

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.080
was very helpful to Zhang Xiaoman.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.720
I see Chief Engineer Yan is here too.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.000
As Xiaodan's father,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.270
we need you to

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.440
accompany her to give a statement
in a moment.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.720
Okay, I'll cooperate.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.560
So long as it's helpful.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.690
Thank you, Xiaodan.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.010
Based on what we know so far,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.440
although Zhang Xiaoman injured someone,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.550
it was triggered by Feng Xiaobo's

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.270
retaliation against him.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.030
Also, we just received a call.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.000
Feng Xiaobo is out of critical condition.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.270
That also helps with
the eventual classification

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.330
of Xiaoman's case.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.390
That's great.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.650
Thank goodness.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.120
Bad guys live long lives.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840
Why don't you uncuff him?

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.720
Why is he still in handcuffs?

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.780
Look at things now.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.720
Once the details have been ascertained,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.080
we will definitely take them off.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.720
Mr. Ding.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.550
In a moment,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.840
we need to take another statement
from Xiaoman.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.390
Okay.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.450
Please come along.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.510
No, it's no trouble at all.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.270
I-I'm fine.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.270
I won't do anything else today.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.080
I'll just stay with him.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.870
Let alone taking a statement,

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.440
I'd even stay locked up with him
for two days.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.780
Okay, thanks. Let's go.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.760
No, I thank you.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.080
Leng, I'm sorry.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.870
My attitude earlier was out of line.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.150
You're just doing your job by the book.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.950
You're bound to get a promotion.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.000
Xiaodan,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.900
did you see the fireworks?

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.510
Yes, I saw them.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.080
Just pack two pieces.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.080
We don't know if it can be delivered.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.510
I told you, two pieces are enough.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.570
We don't even know if we can send it in.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.750
This kid

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.040
has no priorities.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.660
By now,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.480
the college entrance exam
is just around the corner.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.080
Xiaoman!

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.170
Uncle Ding.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.910
W-Where is Xiaoman?

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:23.720
Why didn't he come back?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.180
Wait, Auntie, why are you packing?

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.910
No, don't scare me.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.770
Is Xiaoman not coming out, Uncle?

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:30.490
Is it—

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.270
Enough. They're investigating.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.510
What is there to investigate?

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.270
Xiaodan went to testify, didn't she?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.630
What happened, Mr. Ding?
How long is his sentence?

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.630
What sentence?

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.090
Stop making things worse.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.320
Go home.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.260
Don't tell anyone.
This must not get out.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.870
Uncle, let us go with you.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.510
Just stay here.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:49.870
I haven't even packed the clothes yet.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.270
Don't make things worse!

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.480
What's going on, Auntie?

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.750
Will Xiaoman get out?

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.240
I'm scared. Don't...

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.520
Don't worry.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.870
Our child is a good kid.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.080
It'll be okay.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.870
Everything will be okay.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.010
There's no way a child like Xiaoman
not get released.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.360
Everyone, put down your pens for a moment.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.010
I want to talk about
the college application forms.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.270
Everyone, based on your mock exam results,

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.070
fill out this application form.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.720
Between your first choice,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.580
second choice,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.550
and third choice,

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.750
you should leave a larger score margin.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.310
You can refer to
last year's cutoff scores.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.910
The most important thing

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.790
is that you must think clearly about

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.710
whether you agree to being reassigned.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.120
When filling out this application form,

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.180
you must think it through carefully.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.890
If you fill it out well,

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.270
you can get in just by meeting the cutoff.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.800
If you don't fill it out well

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.260
and refuse reassignment,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.960
it may result in no university
accepting you.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.800
You'll have to

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.920
enter the workforce or retake the exam.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.630
So, we suggest that you all

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.310
agree to the reassignment.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.680
This is a matter that will affect
the rest of your lives.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.790
Is that clear?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.480
Yes.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.180
If you have any questions,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.920
you can come and talk to me.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.280
However,

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.890
I can only give you objective advice.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.110
At this moment,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.720
and also speaking for myself,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.070
I hope you all

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.880
get into your dream universities.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.550
Thank you, Teacher.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.920
Go for it!

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.790
Let's do this, everyone!

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.110
Go for it!

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.920
All the best!

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.290
Alright, everyone, focus on your revision.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.840
He, let's switch seats.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:26.900
Okay.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.380
Where are you planning to apply?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.140
My dad has already decided

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.010
where I will be applying to.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.590
March in unison!

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.490
[According to Article 234 of the Second Edition of the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China (1997),]

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:03.830
[Zhang Xiaoman was found guilty of grievous hurt,
and was sentenced to six months of detention.]

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.830
[Additionally, pursuant to Article 17, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Xiaoman was over 16 but under 18 years of age.]

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.160
[In accordance with the law, a lighter or reduced punishment shall be imposed. The defendant is sentenced to a juvenile detention center.
The term of imprisonment shall be calculated from the date of commencement of the sentence.]

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.680
Done.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.470
Done? What about the other choices?

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.330
I only want to go to Tongzhou University.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.510
No, think it through.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.310
If you don't get in,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.310
you'll have to repeat a year.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.570
I wanted to testify at the police station,

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:38.900
but you wouldn't let me.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.480
And now, the whole family
has to move to Shanghai.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.740
We do whatever you say.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.790
When do I ever

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.680
get to decide?

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.920
So this is where you were going with this.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.830
Let me tell you,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.350
I don't think
it's worth risking your own life

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.240
just to spite your parents.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.310
I'm not doing that.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.480
I just want to go to Tongzhou University.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.920
You can fill in the rest for me.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.550
Whatever works, right?

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.790
You just want me to go to Shanghai,
don't you?

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.030
Whether I go to a technical school
or another college,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.070
it doesn't matter to me.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.400
If it doesn't matter,
then don't take the exam.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.030
That's even better.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.750
Why go to college?

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.110
Great. I'll just stay here then.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.770
You can stay here by yourself.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.200
I can. Why can't I?

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:08.750
It doesn't matter.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.710
We'll all leave and leave her alone.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.510
Let her stay here by herself.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.070
Right?

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.920
Alright, stop talking.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.470
Sweetie, what's wrong?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.810
Mom, stop trying to be the peacemaker.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.960
I know you grew up here.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.640
You can't bear to leave, right?

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.710
But you also have to understand
your father.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.140
He has his own hometown.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.970
He's been away for so many years.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.350
Alright.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.510
And you said you weren't being
a peacemaker.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.830
Your father is indeed a bit overbearing.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.660
But he's not wrong.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.920
You can't take your anger out
on your future.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.270
Do you understand?

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.070
I'm not.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.870
I'm confident I can get into
Tongzhou University.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.520
Then tell him that.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.440
Talk to your father nicely.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.300
Look how anxious you've made him.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.440
Talk to him nicely, okay, sweetie?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.920
I just want him to be anxious.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.510
Your father is getting old.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.310
He can't win against you, you know?

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.850
I'll go cut some fruit for you.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.850
Study hard.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.140
Be good.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.770
Mr. Gu, stop pulling.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.270
Look, it's falling apart.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.370
Mr. Gu, please.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:16.920
No, it won't.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.170
Mr. Gu, don't buy them.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:18.790
I'll give you two for free.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.730
You don't have to buy it.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:20.310
I'll give you two.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.790
I can't accept that.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.680
Just take them.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.920
Then I won't buy any.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.680
Fine, forget it.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.920
Mr. Gu, grocery shopping?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.310
Xia Lei's mom?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.510
That's a lot of groceries.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.370
I bought a carp to nourish Xia Lei.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.070
Yes, yes.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.030
At this critical moment,

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.640
he does need extra nourishment.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.270
I've been meaning to thank you.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.160
Xia Lei

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.770
often mentions you at home.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.480
He says you are a responsible and
good teacher.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.070
His math grades are really...

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.200
thanks to your hard work and guidance.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.720
It's our duty.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.510
As teachers,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.640
we are happiest when we meet

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.700
students like Xia Lei,

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.680
and parents like you

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.120
who value education.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.400
Recently,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.330
isn't it time for the kids to fill out
their college applications?

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.920
We are a working-class family,

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.180
so we don't have much experience.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.270
I was also hoping to

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.440
ask you for some advice

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.310
and guidance.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.640
The child's own ideas and wishes
are very important.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.000
He doesn't have any ideas.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.960
He's putting all his energy into
studying right now.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.240
Regarding the application,

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.040
first, consider the major,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.030
and second, consider the city.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.070
As for the city,

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.540
go to Shanghai.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.070
Shanghai is developing well right now.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.160
Shanghai?

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.270
Shanghai...

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.720
Shanghai is a bit far, isn't it?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.400
Well, I was thinking maybe

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.800
I should let him try for
maybe Tsinghua or Peking University.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.400
I recommend Shanghai

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.850
because I think the growth potential
generated by Pudong's development

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.510
won't be exhausted within
the next twenty to thirty years.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.240
If Xia Lei goes to college in Shanghai,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.240
he'll be just in time to
catch this great opportunity.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.440
Well,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.160
thank you, Mr. Gu.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.920
We will definitely go back

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.450
and consider it seriously.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.290
You didn't manage to buy any vegetables.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.070
Take these potatoes of mine.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.600
I handpicked these potatoes one by one,

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.680
all of them carefully selected.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.510
In the whole market,

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.310
you won't find better potatoes.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.350
You're too kind.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.480
I can't accept this.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.020
I also hope Xia Lei does well too.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.640
No, no.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.310
How about you come over
for dinner someday?

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.680
Xia Lei's dad is a good cook.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.020
He'll prepare a feast for you.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.920
Take this.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.510
Take it.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.540
How about this, I'll take one.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:29.170
One?

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.460
One is enough.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.070
Thank you.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:35.480
I've long heard that your husband
is a great cook.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.680
When Xia Lei gets into a university
in Shanghai,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.580
you can treat me then.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.550
Of course.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.370
Definitely.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.710
Okay.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.680
Mr. Gu, I'm heading home.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.540
I live this way.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.770
You aren't going this way?

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.270
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.250
See you.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.590
Plus

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.200
one over cosine C

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.730
equals negative twice the square root
of two.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.720
So...

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:01.720
You're wrong.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.960
That's not what our teacher said
this morning.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.560
It should be written up here.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.440
Let me simplify this equation then.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.480
Cosine A plus cosine C equals

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.920
equals negative twice the square root
of two.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.200
Cosine A... cosine C...

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.340
Xiaodan, what's up?

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.590
I'm going to visit Xiaoman this afternoon.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.650
Do you want to come?

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.640
This afternoon?

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.120
Isn't there a cram session this afternoon?

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.410
Did Ms. Tong give you permission?

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.830
I'm skipping class.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.960
Why don't we go this weekend?

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.120
I should probably be able to

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120
sneak out then.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.790
Whenever I think of Xiaoman
in juvenile detention,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.850
I just can't focus on studying at all.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.960
Don't blame yourself for
what happened to Xiaoman.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.030
It has nothing to do with you.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.550
It's all that bastard Feng Xiaobo's fault.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.350
Exactly. It's all that bastard's fault.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.550
I'm telling you, if I had been there,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.150
I would have stabbed him too.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.440
Seriously. I'm not bluffing.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.200
I really would have stabbed him.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.730
I-I definitely would have.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.960
I'm just worried that Xiaoman

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.820
will get bullied in the
juvenile detention center.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.840
He wouldn't be bullied,

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.410
and he wouldn't bully others either.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.450
Zhang Xiaoman!

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.030
Here!

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:40.890
Zhang Xiaoman!

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:42.430
Come! You have a visitor!

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.680
Come in.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.350
Number seven.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.730
Can you hear me?

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.440
Mr. Ding.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.830
Xia Lei and Xiaodan didn't come?

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.510
What's with that look?

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.310
Did I make a mistake coming here?

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.640
You only care about them.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.000
What? Am I not welcomed?

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.870
No, no.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.570
I just miss them.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.030
It's only a month left to
the college entrance exams.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.440
Those two are suffering
more than you right now.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.350
If you asked them to switch places
with you now,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.440
they'd be in here in a heartbeat.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.260
But their parents held them back.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.240
Well, I'm definitely...

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.290
going to miss the exams.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.200
You're thinking too far ahead.
Don't lose heart.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.350
You're in juvenile detention.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.480
If you behave, there's still a chance.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.500
About your dad... don't blame me.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.140
I wanted to wait until you grew up,

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.600
until after your exams
to tell you properly.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.350
This is... my friend.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.200
What did I do wrong

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.730
to have to apologize to her?

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.010
Here, one more!

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.440
I know everything now.
You were doing this for my own good,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.030
therefore keeping me in the dark.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.630
It's all right, Uncle.
He's had a hard life too.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.550
Zhang Xiaoman, let me ask you.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.160
You little brats,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.220
have you been talking behind my back?

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.510
No.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.200
Really?

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.160
No.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:49.860
No?

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.510
I know everything by now,
and you still say no?

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.170
Is it divided into things like

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.440
Northern and Southern Shaolin?

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.790
And then you say I got hit

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.030
by a nun's palm strike.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.030
That kungfu move?

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.750
What was the name of that move again?

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.550
Eagle Claw Lineage-Ending Palm?

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.350
Look at the name you came up with.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.590
I didn't name it.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.200
The guys across from me did.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.460
They aren't on my side.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.350
You're too honest, kid.
I tricked it out of you just like that.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.350
Just watch me go back and beat him up.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.750
Eagle Claw Lineage-Ending Palm.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.550
I didn't plan for the line to end with me.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.750
But I did get injured.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.590
Actually, after I returned from my injury,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.030
I didn't think I could still

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.310
find someone to marry.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.790
So I went to the factory.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.030
Then one winter,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.030
I saw your aunt

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.640
fishing by an ice hole.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.180
I said to myself,
"This woman is something else!

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.050
She's so amazing!

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.960
So wild and tough!"

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.750
I was just thinking about that,

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.440
and the very next year,

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.300
we got married.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.030
So, with people,

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.030
you never know if you're stepping into
dog crap or good luck.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.490
Everything's uncertain.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.640
Uncle Ding, I...

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.930
I understand.
You don't need to try to comfort me.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.620
I was too impatient this time.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.140
I didn't know when to stop.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.770
I'll reform myself in here.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.280
I'll be fine.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.750
As long as you're good, Xiaoman.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.900
As long as you behave in there,

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.570
there's still hope for us
when you get out.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.350
You call this studying?

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.830
Dad, please take me to see Xiaoman.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.590
You can't. Didn't I tell you?

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.180
The juvenile detention center only allows
visits Monday through Thursday.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.980
I can take time off.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.420
Take time off for what?

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.250
How many times have we talked about this?

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:47.750
The college entrance exam
is just days away.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.410
You can't get distracted now.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:50.920
Just let me see him once.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.160
After all, he's in there because of me.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.390
Going to see him now will

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:56.050
definitely affect your mood.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.290
Do you think Xiaoman wants to see that?

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.260
I'm back.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.480
No, he wouldn't.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.070
Here, have some oranges.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.190
But by not seeing him

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.500
and thinking about him being in there...

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.000
it affects my mood even more.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.270
I feel even worse.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.510
Let's not feel bad, okay?

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.370
How about this?

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.920
I will take you to see him as soon as
the college entrance exam is over.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.480
Really?

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.000
It's a deal.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:24.680
It's a deal.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.240
I'll go revise then.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:27.440
Yan.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.920
Eat some fruit if you get thirsty, okay?

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:31.890
All the best.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:32.750
Yan.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.440
How could you agree to that?

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.350
I know what I'm doing.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:42.790
You agree first,

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.350
and she'll just... you know?

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.510
Once she... you know,

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.370
won't everything be... you know?

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.160
What do you exactly mean?

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.420
What do you think it is?

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.900
You don't understand.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.750
Report!

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.160
What is it?

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.680
Officer, there's a scarlet sage
over there.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.340
Pull it out.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.960
Aren't we here to pull weeds?

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.160
That's a flower.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.920
So you're just gonna leave it there?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:12.750
Sir!

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.750
Speak.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.920
Can I dig it up and keep it?

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.440
Sure.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.700
Permission granted.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.110
Go find a tool.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.260
Thank you, Officer.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.550
Yan.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.270
Yan.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.160
This kid has changed.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.000
She's staying up late to study.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.200
Still studying?

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.810
That's a good thing.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.160
Make her a late-night snack later.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.110
We need to keep up with her nutrition.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.570
I already brought her milk

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.790
and apples.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.790
Don't worry.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.350
On her calendar,

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.350
besides marking
the college entrance exam dates,

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.720
there's another marked date.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.000
October 18.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.310
What day is that?

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.000
The day Xiaoman is released.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:16.170
Will she come back from Shanghai
to see him then?

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.310
Impossible.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.520
Just rest assured.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.580
Think about it.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.750
Once she gets to a new school,

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.360
it's a new environment with
new classmates and teachers.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.150
At Tongzhou University,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.240
there will be plenty of outstanding boys.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.970
Talented ones, handsome ones.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:34.750
Right?

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.830
Over time,
she'll drift apart from Xiaoman.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.220
They'll grow distant.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.720
I hope so.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.590
Don't worry.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.920
Think back to when we were in college.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.070
What did you see in me as your senior?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.750
Was it talent or looks?
