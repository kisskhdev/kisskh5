=No Pain No Gain=
(Adapted from the Qidian novel)

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.180
("Losing Money to Be a Tycoon"
by Qingshan Quzui)

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
=Episode 15=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.060
(Four Wall Apartments)

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.940
So,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.110
you came back without knowing why

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.830
he joined Sky Fire?

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.940
He didn't want to tell me.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.390
How can I know?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.580
I'm sure he joined Sky Fire as a mole

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.670
to steal all of their
confidential information.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.146
There's nothing worth
stealing in Sky Fire.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.440
Sky Fire has always been the one stealing
other people's confidential information.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.300
If so, why did he join Sky Fire in secret
to do something like this?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.180
Mr. Pei always does this.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.110
He works hard in silence

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.620
and shocks everyone.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.180
Let's not interrupt him.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.530
We should wait for his good news.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.540
(Sky Fire Tower)

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.140
(Strive for Excellence
and Create Miracles)

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.110
Wei.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.110
Wei?

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.790
Stop scaring me.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.990
Wei,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.270
what's going on?

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.240
Do all of you like to
spend nights in the company?

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.300
No one likes to spend nights here.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.300
Last night's meeting lasted until 5 AM.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.990
And my house is very far away.

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:50.524
I have to punch in for today
in just three hours.

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.300
It's not even enough time for me
to travel back and forth.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.510
Do we have that many projects lately?

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.950
Did you guys work overtime until now?

00:03:57.391 --> 00:03:59.546
Don't tell me Mr. Zhou
requested you guys to do it.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.620
When he does request us to do it,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.510
that'll be your last day

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.350
working in this company.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.980
(Sky Fire)

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.510
Wei,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.990
why don't you take a break

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.813
and scroll your phone?

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:19.620
The surveillance camera
won't catch us here.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.380
Count on me.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.435
I'm not scrolling my phone.

00:04:21.524 --> 00:04:22.710
I'm writing my daily report.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.860
With your phone?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.260
You see,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.860
typing on a phone's nine-square grid

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.990
requires less finger movement
than a keyboard.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.300
It's a form of rest.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.940
Let me type it for you, then.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.030
They haven't given me
any work lately anyway.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.620
Mr. Pei,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.740
in the entire company,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.770
you're the only one
who's truly concerned about me.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.820
I consider you one of us.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.590
I'll tell you this.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.990
Our superiors said

00:04:56.013 --> 00:04:58.420
that we wouldn't let you touch
any projects after this.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.790
Mr. Zhou,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.350
I've been observing your actions

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.860
for the past few days.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.110
Just be honest with me.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.030
Are you still hesitant about me?

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.350
Pei,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.860
you're overthinking it.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.510
Who told you that I wouldn't let you
get involved with any projects?

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.550
If only I were overthinking it.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.560
You see, I only have two days left
until my probation period ends.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.160
But you're not letting me do a single thing.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.230
By then, you won't just
find a random excuse

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.680
like saying that I slack off all the time
and sack me, right?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.940
Mind your words!

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.300
Xuming,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.820
he's still young.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.960
It's good that you have
a high awareness.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.940
That's what we need.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.150
Our new game, Eternal Reincarnation,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.990
is basically complete.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.060
I was planning to
have you try it out anyway.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.110
If so, can I think of it
as the last challenge I'll face

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.060
during my probation period?

00:06:06.124 --> 00:06:08.180
How dare you approach
Mr. Zhou with your request?

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.380
Don't you have any awareness at all?

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.910
You can think of it that way.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.710
Deal?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.150
Deal.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.940
However,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.670
you need to complete the game

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.420
within 24 hours.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.230
No problem!

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:31.380
Are we actually letting
Pei Qian do the playtesting?

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.910
Won't it cause us any trouble?

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.940
Eternal Reincarnation

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.150
is more than a match for him.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.670
You're right.

00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:40.550
Eternal Reincarnation

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.180
crushes
Returning to Shore on all fronts.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.629
Of all people, Pei Qian is the last one
we need to guard against.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.470
I'll go prepare an NDA
(non-disclosure agreement).

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.590
Speaking of which,

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.820
how could anyone
complete Eternal Reincarnation

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.740
in a single day?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.820
(Game Testing Room)

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.300
(Four is four, ten is ten)

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.820
Four is four, ten is ten.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.180
Fourteen is fourteen.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.230
Forty is forty.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.590
Who said fourteen is forty...

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.990
(Game Over)

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.702
No wonder
they let me do the playtesting.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.150
Isn't this just a knockoff version

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.968
of Returning to Shore
with added tongue-twisters?

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.110
The park has four rows of stone lions,

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.620
each row consisting
of fourteen large stone lions.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.550
At the feet of
each large stone lion lies...

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.110
(Game Over)

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.350
(You need to complete the game)

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.350
(within 24 hours.)

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.470
The park has four rows of stone lions.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.380
Mr. Shi took forty-four students

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.457
to count the stone lions.

00:08:23.457 --> 00:08:24.902
The park has four rows of stone lions.

00:08:24.924 --> 00:08:25.820
Each row consists of...

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.470
(Game Over)

00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:29.680
At the feet of
each large stone lion lies

00:08:29.724 --> 00:08:31.110
four small stone lions.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.260
Mr. Shi took fourteen students to...

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.950
(Game Over)

00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:36.500
The park has four rows of stone lions.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.191
At the back of
each large stone lion lies

00:08:38.191 --> 00:08:39.124
four small stone lions.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.660
(Game Over)

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:42.380
The park has four rows of stone lions.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.590
Count the stone lions.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.190
You say...

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.140
(Game Over)

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.860
The park has four rows of stone lions,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.990
each row consisting of
fourteen large stone lions.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.768
At the back of
each large stone lion lies

00:08:51.768 --> 00:08:52.540
a small stone lion.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.257
At the feet of
each large stone lion lies

00:08:54.257 --> 00:08:55.310
four small stone lions.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.110
Mr. Shi took forty-four students

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.260
to count the stone lions.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.740
How many

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.540
large stone lions

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.830
and small stone lions are there?

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.710
(Game Over)

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.660
This is impossible.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.140
This game is harder than

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.140
99.9999999% of the games

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.070
on the market.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.950
There's no way anyone can complete this.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.260
This time,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.660
we must create a core gameplay mechanic.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.350
And, it must be something new.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.860
As a soulslike,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.590
the difficulty should be cranked up

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.350
to hell mode.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.380
We must integrate ancient poetry

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.780
and verses into the combat system.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.380
If so, how many percent of players

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.620
should the early-game boss eliminate?

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.140
It should

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.310
eliminate

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.780
99.9999% of players.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.660
(Eternal Reincarnation)

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.470
If you're good,

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.035
one line works, then every line works.

00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:01.720
One line works,

00:10:01.724 --> 00:10:03.990
then every line works.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.310
If you're not,
one line fails, every line fails.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.310
One line fails,

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.380
every line fails.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.620
Want every line to work?

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.660
Make one line work first.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.190
Become a pro in your trade.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.190
Master one trade, master them all.

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:21.613
Did I actually complete the game?

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.020
(Game Over)

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.180
(Sudden Wealth)

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.500
Pei,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.350
the analysis in your report
is inadequate.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.470
Regarding what the players
like and dislike about the game,

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.946
not only do you need to list them out,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.900
but you must also identify commonalities

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.789
and fundamental issues.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:08.900
Once you identify the issues,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.230
you need to come up with solutions.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.310
We hire you

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.230
to solve our issues.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.950
If not,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.070
why should we hire you?

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.500
Sky Fire recruited you

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.070
because we recognized your abilities.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.070
But your current work attitude

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.540
has left me deeply disappointed!

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.540
Why can others

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.710
excel at the same job

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.540
while you can't?

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.880
You should let others
see the fundamental differences

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.710
that set you apart from them!
But what a shame!

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.430
You never fully opened yourself up!

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.190
What value have you
brought to the company?

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.020
Did you even treat
the company as your home?

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.140
What do you do in the office every day?

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.590
Pei,

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.070
have you ever seen your true self?

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.457
You need to be prepared for combat!

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.230
Pei!

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.830
Pei.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.540
If you can't hang in there anymore,

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.710
you should come back.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.500
My child.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.380
You should come back.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.350
Come back!

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.740
(Game Over)

00:12:44.613 --> 00:12:46.020
(Incorrect password. Please try again)

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.020
Wei.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.540
Give me a second. I...

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.780
What's wrong with the password?

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.310
Why is it incorrect?

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.740
I can't log in.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.500
Wei Dongli.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.430
Come with me.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.780
(Incorrect password. Please try again)

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.900
(Eternal Reincarnation)

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.020
It's been 24 hours.

00:13:10.346 --> 00:13:12.470
If you're good, one line works,
then every line works.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.470
One line works,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.230
then

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.110
every line works.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.900
If you're not,
one line fails, every line fails.

00:13:16.902 --> 00:13:17.830
One line fails,

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.540
every line fails.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.110
Every line will fail.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.235
Want every line to work?

00:13:21.257 --> 00:13:23.590
Make one line work first.
Become a pro in your trade.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.070
Master one trade, master them all.
And make it work!

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.660
(Great)

00:13:30.035 --> 00:13:32.146
(Great)
(Congratulations On Passing the Level)

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.540
I won.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.070
I actually won.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.780
Mr. Zhou, I completed the game!

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.140
I did it within 24 hours...

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.310
I'll excuse myself first.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.350
Sorry about that.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.900
Mr. Zhou.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.900
Mr. Zhao.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.590
Please allow me to explain.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.990
I was late twice last quarter.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.020
My father wasn't in the best of health.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.430
Last month, on the 15th,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.235
he had just undergone
heart bypass surgery.

00:14:44.302 --> 00:14:46.235
And my mother had a stroke
just a few days ago.

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.391
He couldn't look after her.

00:14:47.391 --> 00:14:49.768
After I handled the affairs at the hospital,
I rushed back and worked overtime.

00:14:49.768 --> 00:14:52.590
It's shown in the attendance records!

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.140
And, this month, on the 5th,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.168
my wife took
my mother-in-law for dialysis.

00:14:56.168 --> 00:14:57.500
After that, something cropped up.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.680
She couldn't leave her alone.

00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:00.070
My child was having a fever.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.350
And, he was all alone.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.350
Oh yeah.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.780
I worked overtime until 5 AM that day.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.457
I've already posted the WeChat record

00:15:06.457 --> 00:15:07.260
to our group chat.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.710
Mr. Zhao, take a look. I...

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.710
Mr. Zhou, take a look.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.710
You always have plenty of excuses.

00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:13.780
Can excuses help us
put food on the table?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.680
All of us are busy with
our own affairs, you know?

00:15:15.724 --> 00:15:17.190
If explanations can generate value,

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:20.020
I'm sure you'll be
the most valuable employee in Sky Fire.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.140
Mr. Zhao.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.140
Mr. Zhou,

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.013
my situation is special.

00:15:28.013 --> 00:15:29.350
For the past few years,

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.140
our parents weren't the healthiest.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.470
And my child is still very young.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.350
There are so many expenses
to cover at home.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.110
I can't live without this job.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.230
I...

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.057
I joined Sky Fire right
after graduating, you know?

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.400
Even if I didn't contribute much to the company,
I've put in my fair share of hard work too.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.540
You guys can't just do this
because I'm almost 35...

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.260
Wei!

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.740
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.350
This conversation has nothing to do

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.110
with your age at all.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:57.020
Look.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.660
Just look at this quarter's
Last-place Elimination System.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.020
You had the poorest performance.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.099
You weren't as efficient as the others.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.860
You had the highest
percentage for being late.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.200
You wrote your reports without thoughts,
and you even wrote fewer words than the others.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.190
If this keeps up,

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.660
where will your value proposition be?

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.590
Where will your core competencies be?

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.740
Compared to the others,

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.780
your value is extremely meager.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.230
It's not like Mr. Zhou

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.540
never gave you a chance.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.110
You were the one
who had disappointed us.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.500
Wei,

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.500
you do look pretty exhausted,
both physically and mentally.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.230
If that's the case,

00:16:38.635 --> 00:16:40.020
you should head back first.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.470
Go back and rest.

00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:42.946
Readjust your mental state as well.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.780
I understand.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.620
If this does happen,

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.020
will I still receive the compensation?

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.630
Judging by the situation,

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.390
I don't think so.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.990
I understand now.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.710
Judging by the situation,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.702
will I still receive the compensation?

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.740
Judging by the situation,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.950
I don't think so.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.150
What's going on in there?

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.150
The subsequent discussion
will be open and fair.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.060
Let me record it.

00:17:46.146 --> 00:17:47.480
It won't pose an issue, right?

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.430
Deliberately inducing
employees to resign

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.780
to avoid paying severance pay

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.540
is a serious violation of
the Labor Contract Law.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.049
Mr. Zhou, you're busy.
You have plenty of affairs to deal with.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.280
It's understandable
that you can't recall the labor law.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.870
But what about the HR Department?

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.260
I'm sure you know it, right?

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:04.670
Now,

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.910
let's review the situation again.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.990
You guys are trying

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.870
to sack Wei.

00:18:10.102 --> 00:18:12.680
According to Article 39 of
the Labor Contract Law,

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.235
it must be proven that the employee
meets the following conditions.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:16.849
First, employers
may rescind the contract if the worker

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.590
fails to meet employment
criteria during the probationary period.

00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:22.670
Second, a serious breach of
the employer's rules and system.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:26.020
Third, serious dereliction
of duties and corruption

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.470
causes the employer
to suffer significant damages.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.480
Fourth, the worker holds
an employment relationship

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.950
with another employer
concurrently, which has

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.680
a severe impact on his/her performance
of work tasks assigned by the employer

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.470
or refuses to make correction
as demanded by the employer.

00:18:37.524 --> 00:18:40.191
Fifth, under the circumstances
stipulated in Article 26, Paragraph 1

00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:41.540
of the Labor Contract Law,

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.102
the labor contract is deemed invalid.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.300
Sixth, the employee is held criminally
liable in accordance with the law.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.168
It's obvious that Wei fulfilled
none of the criteria above.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.740
That means

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.390
he's subjected to no-fault termination.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.670
If so, you guys have to give him
a one-month notice or...

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.430
Give him an additional month's pay.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.991
Compensation shall be paid
at the rate of one month's salary

00:19:01.991 --> 00:19:04.060
for each full year
of the employee's service.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.630
As you guys didn't notify

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.710
Wei in advance,

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.780
you need to compensate Wei with N+1.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.100
N for his years at Sky Fire,

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.820
plus one month

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.500
as notice pay.

00:19:15.968 --> 00:19:17.780
Mr. Zhou, what other questions
do you have?

00:19:18.013 --> 00:19:20.820
If there are any issues, I'll have Wei take it
to labor arbitration.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.457
Labor arbitration
is now very convenient.

00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:23.902
We can apply for it online.

00:19:29.657 --> 00:19:31.257
Zhao, don't be so impulsive.

00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:32.950
To think that you're a game developer.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.020
Did you know that recordings

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.946
can now be uploaded
to the cloud in real time?

00:19:35.991 --> 00:19:36.540
Sit down.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.500
Great work

00:19:42.746 --> 00:19:44.020
in reciting the law articles.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.870
I'm just an amateur.

00:19:47.546 --> 00:19:48.990
Why are you still standing there?

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.580
Follow Mr. Pei's instructions.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.910
Sky Fire has always
been a law-abiding company.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.168
Pei Qian, we'll follow your example.

00:20:06.168 --> 00:20:08.391
We'll abide by the law
and conduct our business impartially.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.950
This is an official notice.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.430
Your probationary period is over...

your line of work.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.150
I quit.

Wei,

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.540
you need this more than me.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.990
Thanks, Mr. Pei.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.150
How did you memorize

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.502
that legal provision so thoroughly?

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.780
You may not believe me,

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.540
but I was once sacked as well.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.990
The more I thought about it,
the angrier I got.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.100
Thus, I studied

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.020
the Labor Contract Law.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.630
I don't believe you.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.020
You were actually sacked?

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.340
How is that possible?

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.870
Mr. Pei,

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.020
where are you taking me

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.340
after this?

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.230
I haven't decided either.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.020
I guess I should pack my stuff, then.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.190
You see,

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.780
they just think that I'm too old.

00:22:47.213 --> 00:22:48.702
They wanted to sack me long ago.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.990
Luckily, you were there.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.100
You managed

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.580
to help me win an N+1.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.340
At least, I can give
my family an account.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.230
But you were implicated

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.630
because of it.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.020
I'm sorry.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.390
It's fine.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.820
As long as I can make a living,
my whole family will be fine.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.100
Hello, Dear?

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.340
How's Mom doing?

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.300
Good to hear that. What about Dad?

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:31.340
Good to hear that.

00:23:31.413 --> 00:23:31.990
That's great.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.580
Nope. I'm not working overtime today.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.060
You...

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.591
You should keep our baby company first.

00:23:37.613 --> 00:23:39.100
I'll go back and cook for you all.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.100
Yeah, no overtime work today.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.870
I don't need to
work overtime ever again.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.150
Okay.

(Jinchuan International Airport)

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:27.470
Hello, Ms. Xin?

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:28.710
It's like this.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.710
Are you sure
you gave me the right location?

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.780
How could Mr. Sima live in such a place?

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.580
Go upstairs?

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.500
Where?

00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:37.390
What about this?

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:38.990
Send me the location again.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.980
(Go straight for 3 meters)

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.100
(Go straight for 3 meters)

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.580
Where the heck am I?

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.910
You must be kidding me!

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.420
(Exit)

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.870
Hello, Mr. Pei.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:21.580
Over here, please.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:33.430
Please mind your steps.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:44.060
Mr. Wang,

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.950
water that side more.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.670
Mind your steps.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.500
Water them evenly.

Mr. Pei,

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.020
please come inside.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.230
Let me make you a cup of tea.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.950
No need for that.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.340
Long time no see.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:51.580
Mr. Sima,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.150
can I please

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.910
return to Tengda?

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:03.430
Are you not

00:29:03.457 --> 00:29:04.768
taking any helicopter rides today?

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:13.870
Mr. Sima,

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.020
this house of yours is pretty unique.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.190
It was hard to locate.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.950
Why are you staying here
when you're this wealthy?

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.260
I grew up here.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.150
No matter how rich I am,

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.260
I won't forget who I am.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.100
I won't leave my roots behind either.

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.710
Only by living among the common people

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.230
can I truly understand

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:39.990
what's unfolding in this world

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.580
day after day.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.430
I suppose this is your hometown.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.190
Your hometown is the same as mine.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.139
There are no elevators.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.260
Everything's on foot.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.500
I'm sure you're very healthy.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:25.740
(Tengda Games)

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.630
Mr. Ma.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.340
He's here.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.870
Come! Mr. Pei is here!

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.740
Come.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:36.820
Go!

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.190

Welcome.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.260
Welcome.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:47.740
Mr. Pei,

00:30:47.813 --> 00:30:49.991
it must've been tough
infiltrating our enemy's ranks.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.300
Mr. Pei, you've been away for so long.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.340
You've lost so much weight.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.780
Yeah. We missed you.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.057
While you were away,

00:30:59.102 --> 00:31:01.060
we struck a balance
between work and leisure.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.150
We worked hard,

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.500
and we also enriched our lives.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.768
Don't worry about it, Mr. Pei.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:07.390
Mr. Pei, welcome home.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.260
Wei?

00:31:15.124 --> 00:31:16.990
Lin Wan, I'm sure
you didn't expect this.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:18.500
We're going to work together again.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:20.500
Hi, everyone.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.580
Weren't you the one
presenting the speech

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.670
at Sky Fire?

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:24.820
Yeah, that was me.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.390
It's you, Mr. Goji.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.430
Yeah, it's me.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:28.710
Hi, everyone.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.950
From now on, we're a family.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.990
So, Mr. Pei, you went there
to poach their talents, huh?

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.580
I was sacked by Sky Fire.

00:31:36.813 --> 00:31:38.390
But luckily, Mr. Pei is a kind person.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:39.430
He's willing to take me in.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.470
He brought me here.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.630
So, where's my work desk?

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.190
I can start working now.

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.710
You must be joking me.
You're more competitive than Huang.

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:47.430
Let's do this.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.390
Welcome.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.230
One month of paid vacation!

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:55.580
Welcome.

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.470
Now that you're back,
don't run around, okay?

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.060
Our pantry is so huge.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:00.959
Everything's for free.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.946
Do we have gojiberries here?

00:32:01.946 --> 00:32:02.780
Yeah, we have plenty.

00:32:03.213 --> 00:32:04.630
We have an unlimited supply of it.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.300
This feels so nostalgic.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.230
This was

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.190
originally Huang's work desk.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.980
(Stay true to our mission,
succeed for the greater good.)

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.860
(GM Office)

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.540
How is it?

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.591
You like it, don't you?

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.260
Why did my office
turn into something like this?

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.100
We saw that your working environment

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.580
was terrible.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.950
So, while you were at Sky Fire,

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.390
we cleaned it up for you.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.020
You guys did a perfect job.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.950
Look at this.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.100
I bought it just for you.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.100
Do you like it?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.470
It's Zhang Chulan.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.990
Don't cry now.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.990
Mr. Pei?

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.190
You're finally back.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:49.580
When are you free?

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.524
I'll present my
management trainee reports to you.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:53.340
Management trainee?

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.150
Was I that twisted?

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.150
What do you mean?

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.390
I mean, we can hire
more management trainees

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.630
in the future.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.670
Let our juniors

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:04.630
learn more

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:05.580
from each department

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.230
so that they can

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.270
grow happily.

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.060
Alright, Mr. Pei.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.820
(Tengda Games)

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.140
While you were away,

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.220
we've refined

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.060
The Divine Mountains
and Seas once again.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.870
We also discussed

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.660
the design direction
for the game characters.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.220
This is our latest idea.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.220
Please take a look.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.060
It's fine. Just proceed with it.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:51.830
Don't you need to take a look?

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.660
It's fine.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:53.790
Over this period,

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:54.591
it has been proven

00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:57.057
that you guys are fully capable
of making your own decisions.

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:04.539
- Thank you, Mr. Pei.
- Thanks.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.350
You guys can do this.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:12.660
Mr. Pei,

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:13.910
sorry about this.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.950
I've been hiding something
from you all along.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.620
Do you still remember a novel called

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.870
The CEO Has an Exclusive Crush on You?

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.390
I told you to take it down, right?

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.310
Yeah.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.180
I did take it down.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.220
I've even got triple
the penalty money ready.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.270
But it's a great IP.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.540
We shouldn't let it go to waste.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.790
I gave it some serious thought.

00:35:33.902 --> 00:35:35.790
We shouldn't let outsiders
reap the benefits.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.790
Mr. Pei,

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.270
do you think we can

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.430
establish our own TV and film studio?

00:35:41.555 --> 00:35:43.115
We can write our own novels

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.310
and turn them into TV dramas.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.790
Sure. Just do whatever you want.

00:35:45.857 --> 00:35:47.180
Mr. Pei, are you sure about that?

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.660
Mr. Pei,

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.430
I won't let you down.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.660
If so,

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.310
you should name the studio.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.180
It's your own company.
You should name it yourself.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.950
This isn't my studio.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:00.946
It belongs to everyone.

00:36:00.968 --> 00:36:02.413
Just name it as our representative.

00:36:02.457 --> 00:36:04.440
Whenever you name a project,
it'll surely succeed.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.390
Whenever you name one,
it'll become popular.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.013
When that happens,
you should name another project.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.750
To be honest,

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.310
I've been completely transformed

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.168
after enduring
society's harsh treatments.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.950
Mr. Pei,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:14.924
I have an idea.

00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:16.990
Why don't you hear me out
and see if it's suitable?

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.620
Tell me.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.430
Feihuang Pictures.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:22.660
You...

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.950
Are you sure you want
such an inauspicious name?

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:25.790
Inauspicious?

00:36:26.057 --> 00:36:27.660
It represents the splendor of success.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:28.910
Feihuang Pictures?

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.220
Sounds like success to me.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:32.660
That's great.

00:36:33.013 --> 00:36:33.830
Can I use that name?

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:34.310
Sure.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.270
Mr. Pei, I'll surely do my best.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:40.830
Tell me, then.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.580
What else do you have to report to me?

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.580
There's no progress on
DreamForge Capital's side.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.620
I thought you held
plenty of projects before.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:49.910
Yeah.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.140
But I've reviewed them

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.500
once again.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:54.660
I think they're not mature enough.

00:36:55.324 --> 00:36:56.480
I know you're going to say

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.559
that DreamForge Capital is a place
where dreams come true.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.946
Even so, we should make sure
the projects are stable and reliable.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:03.540
There's no rush.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.790
If there aren't any good projects,
you should wait it out.

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:06.390
Don't worry.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.457
Our company will
support you with everything we have.

00:37:15.657 --> 00:37:17.850
Why did it seem like he left
the company for five years?

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.500
What's wrong?
Are you lying flat completely?

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.746
Are you cutting your losses now?

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.035
He became completely different

00:37:35.035 --> 00:37:36.220
after joining Sky Fire.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.620
Under probation in Sky Fire,

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.939
I didn't make much money at all.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.910
What about next month?

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.870
What about the mortgage?

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:41.950
With what? Our sincerity?

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:43.580
I didn't change,

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.790
and I didn't give up.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.350
I was just enlightened.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.160
I realized something.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.870
Instead of being tormented in Sky Fire
and getting my wage docked,

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.470
it's better for me to retire in Tengda
and receive 5,000 yuan per month.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.791
I won't be docked a single cent.

00:37:53.835 --> 00:37:55.830
5,000 yuan? That's not enough.

00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:58.500
Have you ever heard of
the term "slash youth"?

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.430

at your destination.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.350
did you source all these goods?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.220
Yeah.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.350
You can pick whichever you want.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.540
Just scan the QR code to pay.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.350
Okay.

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:44.950
I suppose you have it rough as well.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.620
I'll take this.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.750

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.620

Hello.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.430
Mr. Pei, I see
you've been keeping yourself busy

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.270
after rejoining Tengda.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.060
I guess.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:12.180
However,

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.790
sorry about this.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.791
Using company vehicles for personal gain
is against the company's policies.

If I catch you again,

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.220
I'll confiscate the car.

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:25.350

The trailer for Sky Fire's

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.310
is pretty good.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:23.500
I'm sure they've spent a lot on it.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.830
What are you talking about?

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.270
They just plagiarized our stuff.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.750
It just looks cool.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:28.968
So what if they're rich?

00:40:29.013 --> 00:40:30.800
They just changed
the core gameplay mechanic.

00:40:30.813 --> 00:40:32.580
Turned the poetry recital
into tongue-twisters.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.060
That's what they do for every game.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.580
They're experts at finding loopholes.

All of them are praising Eternal Reincarnation
while criticizing Returning to Shore.

00:41:09.279 --> 00:41:11.124
I'm sure Zhou Muyan
and his gang are behind this.

That's a given.

You see, my ex-superior

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.140
is a repeat offender.

00:41:24.257 --> 00:41:26.100
They call it learning
and drawing inspiration,

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.930
but it's just telling the project team
to copy the core gameplay entirely.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.830
After that, they can alter it
to their liking.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.213
So they could launch so many games
in such a short period.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.220
If so, have you played it before?

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:35.870
Is it fun?

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:36.470
No, I haven't.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.910
I don't have time for that.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:40.220

I've sent the trailer
and the current situation to Mr. Pei.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.270

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:56.180

Among the Three Sins,

00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:59.830
slander is the gravest of them all.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.835
We must have faith
that karma will take its course.

00:42:01.835 --> 00:42:03.635
Sky Fire will receive
their just deserts soon.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.430
Do not listen,

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.020
do not inquire,

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:05.620
do not dwell on,

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.302
and do not look.

00:42:06.302 --> 00:42:07.700
Release your obsession.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:08.990
Focus on oneself,

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.390
so that you won't face
eternal damnation.

00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:15.310
What exactly has Mr. Pei
gone through in Sky Fire?

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.180
Why is he getting
more and more abstract?

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:18.990
Indeed.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.220
He's been getting weirder
and weirder lately.
