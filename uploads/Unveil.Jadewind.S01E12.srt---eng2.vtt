{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:49.385
The fetus already has bones.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:50.945
At least four months along.

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:53.065
But Lady Wang's medical record
has no note about this.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:55.705
The powder on the wings
was smeared on by someone.

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:59.065
Flint powder.
This kind of butterfly feeds on rot,

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:00.585
usually near damp marshes.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:02.225
But the Sepulchral Hall sits high up,

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:03.465
dry and well-ventilated.

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:04.865
Someone released the butterfly inside.

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:08.985
They really planned this well.

00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:12.145
What happened here?

00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:14.025
Oh no.

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:15.825
I… I have to report this.

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:18.065
If you report it now,

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:20.265
this year's Lantern Festival,
you'll be using the gold ingots

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:21.825
your family burns for you.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:23.385
Your Ladyship,

00:02:23.465 --> 00:02:25.905
what… what are you trying to do?

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:30.345
One foot's already in the underworld,
and you're still asking what I'll do?

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:31.745
What a hassle.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.865
By protocol,
a consort's coffin is catalpa.

00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:37.465
But Lady Wang's coffin was river willow.

00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:39.985
And it was stuffed full of pine shavings.

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:41.825
It seems meant for damp and odors,

00:02:41.905 --> 00:02:44.825
but in fact, like river willow,
it's highly flammable.

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:46.865
Plus, there is
that easily ignited flint powder.

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:49.625
Lady Wang's body being destroyed
was thanks to all of this.

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:53.945
This servant only guards and buries.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:57.385
I don't know what you mean…

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:59.785
Then I'll put it in words you understand.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.385
You were lax in oversight.

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:04.145
The coffin in the morgue was swapped,
and you noticed nothing.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:05.105
You failed at guarding it,

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.345
and Lady Wang's body was burned.

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:08.865
If you rush to report it,

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:10.465
you're walking straight into a trap.

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.025
You really think
you can dodge all responsibility?

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:15.385
Please enlighten me, Your Ladyship.

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:18.265
I know you've done your duty.

00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:21.065
So I'm giving you a chance to make amends.

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.105
How do I make amends?

00:03:27.825 --> 00:03:29.265
Is everyone here?

00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:32.225
All on night duty today are here.

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:35.385
Everyone, hold out your hands.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.265
Do exactly as he says!

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:48.345
Your Ladyship,

00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:50.505
what… are you checking for?

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:57.505
There was flint powder on their wings.

00:03:57.585 --> 00:03:59.745
In theory, if it was done by these people,

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:02.225
someone's hands would be covered in it.

00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:05.145
And in the dark room,
there'd be a big patch of green glow.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.625
Unless someone
was working with an outsider

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:10.025
and didn't do it themselves,

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:11.465
just…

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:12.745
Who is it?

00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:17.465
Wang Dejun?

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.265
You're not on duty tonight.

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:26.265
What are you doing here?

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:27.985
Liang Weishan told me to come.

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:30.545
He took leave today,
so I'm covering for him.

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:33.465
Liang Weishan really didn't come.

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:34.785
When did you arrive?

00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:36.745
About one ke ago.

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:38.505
You remember that clearly.

00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:39.625
Seize him.

00:04:39.705 --> 00:04:40.585
Yes, madam!

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:05.665
This trick is both merciful and vicious.

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:07.945
Only you can came up with this way.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.465
It's all thanks to Mr. Xiao.

00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:13.545
He won't let me use torture,
but he still wants a confession.

00:05:14.665 --> 00:05:15.705
Let go of me!

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:17.385
Come on.

00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:19.705
Let's go question
this "butterfly gentleman."

00:05:32.705 --> 00:05:33.665
Who told you to do it?

00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:35.265
Do what?

00:05:35.345 --> 00:05:36.385
What did I do?

00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:39.425
The butterflies flew in through
the vent window of the Sepulchral Hall.

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.505
They were drawn by the rot

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:42.945
and circled over the body.

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:45.425
The flint powder smeared on their wings

00:05:45.505 --> 00:05:46.665
fell onto the corpse.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:47.585
It was muggy tonight.

00:05:47.665 --> 00:05:49.305
The coffin was full of foul gas.

00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:50.985
Flint powder ignites with heat,

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:53.185
and the wood shavings and coffin

00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:54.145
are both highly flammable.

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:55.505
The fire flared up in an instant,

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:57.345
and the body was burned to ash.

00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:00.385
Those butterflies were released
through the vent by you.

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:02.985
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:04.145
I didn't do anything.

00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:05.865
You're framing me,

00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:06.985
setting me up,

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:09.345
and using these disgusting bugs
to force a confession.

00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:10.585
I'm not admitting anything!

00:06:10.665 --> 00:06:12.105
Bluffing.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:13.865
You've got no experience
being questioned, huh?

00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:16.785
Butterflies aren't easy to find.

00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:19.705
We finally lured some moths in for you,

00:06:19.785 --> 00:06:20.625
and you call them disgusting?

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:23.705
If we could question you,
we won't wrong you.

00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:25.865
Flint powder is common in a graveyard.

00:06:25.945 --> 00:06:28.625
You were terrified
of leaving any trace of it.

00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:31.425
So that bath-bean scent on your hands
can be smelled from five paces away.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.425
I just like being clean.
I happened to wash my hands.

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:36.625
You can't just use that to pin this on me!

00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:38.305
Fine.

00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:40.065
Then answer me one more thing.

00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:41.745
Why did you cover a shift today?

00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:44.985
Actually, I meant to get medicine today.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.585
I hadn't agreed to switch
with Liang Weishan yesterday.

00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:50.185
But the physician left town early,
so I figured

00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:53.025
I'd cover his shift and earn a bit more.

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:55.505
Then why didn't you report when summoned?

00:06:55.585 --> 00:06:56.785
After I got here,

00:06:56.865 --> 00:06:59.265
I was busy cleaning the front rows
of tombstones.

00:06:59.345 --> 00:07:00.585
It took a full ke.

00:07:00.665 --> 00:07:01.945
I never heard any summons.

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.105
You've rehearsed your lines well,

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:07.825
but when you say them, they're stiff.

00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:10.345
Let me teach you
a questioning trick I just learned.

00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:11.745
When Her Ladyship asks you,

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:13.545
"Why did you cover a shift today?",

00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:14.545
a normal person says,

00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:17.785
"I happened to be free,
so I covered for extra pay."

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:19.345
Then if she asks,

00:07:19.425 --> 00:07:21.305
"Why didn't you report when summoned?",

00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:22.425
a normal person says,

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:24.505
"I was working. I didn't hear."

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:26.345
Someone with nothing to hide

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:27.785
answers exactly what's asked.

00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:30.265
Only when pressed further
do they explain the details.

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:31.865
She asked you one question,

00:07:31.945 --> 00:07:33.945
and you spilled the whole story,
start to finish.

00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:35.345
You expect us to believe you're innocent?

00:07:36.785 --> 00:07:38.305
I…

00:07:39.265 --> 00:07:41.305
Learn from Mr. Xiao.

00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:43.705
Next time you're caught
doing something shady,

00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:44.665
don't be so obvious about it.

00:07:46.225 --> 00:07:47.065
Words aren't proof!

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:52.545
Chase them down!

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:57.905
Who? Who is it?

00:07:57.985 --> 00:07:59.185
Who's trying to kill me?

00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:01.345
Ask yourself.

00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:02.385
Who wants you dead?

00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:09.785
It was… a woman.

00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:11.505
Dressed in black.

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:13.505
She gave me a box of butterflies.

00:08:13.585 --> 00:08:17.145
She said if someone
came to view Lady Wang's body,

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:18.545
I should release the butterflies.

00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:21.505
They were so hard to keep alive.

00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:22.865
More than half of them died.

00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:24.225
If you'd come a few days later,

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:26.025
I'd have had none left to release.

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:28.105
Anything else about her?

00:08:28.785 --> 00:08:29.905
She was extremely cautious,

00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:31.345
face under the hood,

00:08:31.425 --> 00:08:33.345
even hands inside the robe.

00:08:34.024 --> 00:08:35.545
I… I couldn't see her features.

00:08:36.985 --> 00:08:38.425
You didn't see anything,

00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:39.865
and you still took the job?

00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:42.505
How could I know
she wanted to burn the body?

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:44.105
I thought it was
just releasing butterflies

00:08:44.185 --> 00:08:45.825
for a string of coins.

00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:48.705
Your Ladyship, we didn't catch them.

00:08:48.785 --> 00:08:50.345
You didn't?

00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:53.225
An assassin in the palace,
and you couldn't catch them?

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.465
We've asked what we needed. Let him go.

00:08:58.385 --> 00:08:59.305
No, don't let me go!

00:09:00.025 --> 00:09:02.505
If I step out now, I'm dead for sure!

00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:04.145
Lock me up!

00:09:04.665 --> 00:09:05.945
I still have more to tell!

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:09.785
What you've said
isn't enough to convict you.

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:10.865
I can only let you go.

00:09:11.945 --> 00:09:13.705
I… I have physical evidence!

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.945
That box for raising butterflies
looked valuable.

00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:19.025
She told me to burn it after it was done.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:20.865
I couldn't bring myself to.

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:23.985
So I hid it under the corridor
outside the Sepulchral Hall.

00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:26.785
- Go find it.
- Yes, madam.

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.345
Now can you lock me up?

00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.265
You helped by providing evidence.

00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:37.225
All the more reason to let you go.

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:40.225
No!

00:09:41.585 --> 00:09:42.865
Help!

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:50.025
Boss, that arrow I shot
matched Prosecutor Gu's, right?

00:09:50.105 --> 00:09:51.665
Not bad. You're improving.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.305
Did that kick you gave him
blow off some steam?

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:57.025
Good enough.

00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:02.305
So Lady Wang really was pregnant?

00:10:02.985 --> 00:10:05.265
Why sneak about?
We're just talking about the case.

00:10:06.865 --> 00:10:09.185
I'm used to talking palace secrets.

00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:11.025
HANLIANG HALL

00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:13.905
After His Majesty granted her the title,
he never shared Lady Wang's bed again.

00:10:14.425 --> 00:10:15.305
So it seems

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:18.345
Lady Wang had an affair

00:10:18.425 --> 00:10:19.665
and got pregnant.

00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:22.385
The child's father feared it'd be exposed,
so he killed her.

00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:24.985
A consort having an affair
is a grave crime.

00:10:25.065 --> 00:10:27.545
We can't lightly pin that charge on her.

00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:33.025
When was the last time
the Medical Officer took her pulse?

00:10:33.745 --> 00:10:34.865
Over a month ago.

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:37.625
A pregnancy pulse is easiest to tell.

00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:40.265
So, she couldn't have hidden it.

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:44.105
That Medical Officer must know something.

00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:55.825
Your Ladyship, Mr. Xiao.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.065
Have something to eat.

00:10:57.665 --> 00:10:58.985
Hanliang Hall is so remote.

00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:01.545
If your lady wants to visit other palaces,

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:02.705
it'd be a hassle.

00:11:02.785 --> 00:11:03.985
It is remote,

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:05.865
but my lady only goes

00:11:05.945 --> 00:11:09.185
to the Music Office sometimes
to tune and restring her ruan.

00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:10.545
She rarely goes out.

00:11:11.585 --> 00:11:13.465
My lady is proud and aloof.

00:11:13.545 --> 00:11:14.945
She doesn't like socializing.

00:11:16.505 --> 00:11:17.465
Then,

00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:19.425
she could easily offend people.

00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:21.185
She keeps to herself.

00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:23.225
She'd have no chance to offend anyone.

00:11:24.145 --> 00:11:25.305
In the palace,

00:11:25.385 --> 00:11:27.625
she either chants sutras or plays the qin.

00:11:28.225 --> 00:11:29.505
Those consorts and ladies

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:32.425
probably don't even know
there was a selected lady like her.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.785
Before she died of a chill,
did anything seem unusual?

00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:39.185
Two months before she died,

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:41.185
Consort Wei came to see her.

00:11:41.265 --> 00:11:43.345
Consort Wei knows music well.

00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:46.505
She admired my lady's talent,
considering her a kindred spirit.

00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:48.905
She even gifted her a ruan.

00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:51.705
Does that count?

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:54.945
What your lady ate and drank

00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:56.145
all passed through your hands?

00:11:56.225 --> 00:11:57.905
Yes.

00:11:57.985 --> 00:12:01.545
If someone wanted
to poison her a little at a time,

00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:03.305
wouldn't you be the easiest route?

00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:06.145
Your Ladyship, what do you mean?

00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:08.665
We haven't served my lady for long,

00:12:08.745 --> 00:12:10.625
but she's been very kind to us.

00:12:10.705 --> 00:12:13.345
How could we ever dare poison my lady?

00:12:14.145 --> 00:12:15.225
Besides you,

00:12:15.305 --> 00:12:16.625
who else had the chance?

00:12:18.185 --> 00:12:20.505
There is one thing
that doesn't go through our hands.

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:21.825
Her medicine.

00:12:21.905 --> 00:12:24.225
The Medical Officer
prescribed it to soothe her nerves.

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:36.625
It was clearly in there. Where did it go?

00:12:37.505 --> 00:12:38.905
Looks like they acted fast.

00:12:51.825 --> 00:12:52.865
This begonia

00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:55.585
- was moved from beside the table?
- Yes.

00:12:55.665 --> 00:12:56.985
Why move it?

00:12:57.065 --> 00:12:59.665
This begonia used to grow well.

00:13:00.265 --> 00:13:02.505
Starting last month,
it suddenly began to wither.

00:13:02.585 --> 00:13:05.905
I thought putting it by the window
to get more air might help,

00:13:06.545 --> 00:13:08.785
so I swapped the two pots.

00:13:08.865 --> 00:13:10.545
However,

00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:13.265
it didn't get better,

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:15.145
and the other pot is wilting too.

00:13:21.745 --> 00:13:23.865
Your Ladyship, can you tell what this is?

00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:31.665
White peony root.

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:32.825
Mulberry mistletoe.

00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:33.745
Honey-fried licorice.

00:13:35.225 --> 00:13:36.465
This isn't a calming decoction.

00:13:36.545 --> 00:13:37.425
It's a pregnancy tonic.

00:13:38.705 --> 00:13:39.785
A pregnancy tonic?

00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:42.025
But my lady wasn't pregnant.

00:13:42.105 --> 00:13:43.785
Why would this be here?

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:46.505
Could this kind of medicine
make plants wither?

00:13:47.745 --> 00:13:48.665
No.

00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:50.865
The medicine was poisoned.

00:13:55.025 --> 00:13:57.545
Did Lady Wang usually like to drink wine?

00:13:58.145 --> 00:14:01.025
When she first arrived,
my lady was in low spirits.

00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:03.145
She did drink to drown her sorrows.

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:06.065
But later, I didn't see her drink anymore.

00:14:10.105 --> 00:14:11.305
Could it be…

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:21.785
This killer is truly ruthless.

00:14:21.865 --> 00:14:23.385
The Medical Officer's
ship sank on his way home.

00:14:23.465 --> 00:14:24.905
They never even found his body.

00:14:26.425 --> 00:14:28.305
From when Yushu fell ill to when she died,

00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:29.665
he was in charge, right?

00:14:29.745 --> 00:14:31.065
Yes.

00:14:31.145 --> 00:14:32.985
What are these? Where did you find from?

00:14:34.425 --> 00:14:37.385
Our sharp-eyed Mr. Xiao
found them in flowerpots,

00:14:37.465 --> 00:14:39.545
the pregnancy tonic used to poison Yushu.

00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:41.425
How did you find it?

00:14:43.745 --> 00:14:46.065
Begonias are easy to keep alive,
and it's the blooming season.

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:47.585
Yet this pot was nearly dead.

00:14:47.665 --> 00:14:48.505
That's highly abnormal.

00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:51.145
And on a plant, the sunny side
usually grows thicker and fuller.

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:53.065
But on this begonia, the sunward side

00:14:53.145 --> 00:14:54.945
was sparse instead, even more abnormal.

00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:56.105
Sure enough,

00:14:56.185 --> 00:14:57.905
Ruisheng said this begonia had been moved.

00:14:58.865 --> 00:14:59.705
And then?

00:14:59.785 --> 00:15:01.385
I checked the other plants in the room.

00:15:01.465 --> 00:15:02.705
Aside from the begonia,

00:15:02.785 --> 00:15:04.745
only the one by the table
was a bit wilted.

00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:06.025
And Ruisheng said

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.745
the begonia was moved
from beside the table.

00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:10.145
Two pots kept by the table withered
one after another.

00:15:10.225 --> 00:15:11.505
That can't be a coincidence.

00:15:12.105 --> 00:15:14.665
And the table
is the most used spot in the room,

00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:15.745
so I had a suspicion.

00:15:20.505 --> 00:15:21.745
Mr. Xiao,

00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:23.585
just tell Wuren the truth already.

00:15:24.105 --> 00:15:25.105
How did you figure it out?

00:15:30.065 --> 00:15:31.185
I…

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:32.585
cast a divination.

00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:36.905
You're unbelievable.

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:38.945
So what now?

00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:40.785
This medicine's been boiled
and dried out for so long.

00:15:40.865 --> 00:15:42.225
Can the poison still be identified?

00:15:43.065 --> 00:15:45.465
It's tricky, but not impossible.

00:15:54.905 --> 00:15:58.065
Hard to detect, slow-acting poison.

00:15:58.145 --> 00:15:59.785
Unbearable pain marks the end.

00:16:00.305 --> 00:16:02.505
The corpse shows
red, flower-shaped blotches.

00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:11.505
TREATISE ON FEBRILE DISEASES, VOL. 2

00:16:31.265 --> 00:16:32.465
Can't tell by smell.

00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:01.065
From now on,
don't investigate by hurting yourself.

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:02.625
As your partner,

00:17:02.705 --> 00:17:05.424
I'll think of other ways
to solve the problem.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.785
You getting hurt is my failure.

00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:19.224
You little rascal…

00:17:21.505 --> 00:17:23.785
My good master, can you tell what it is?

00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:28.905
It's Yunxiang Powder.

00:17:31.345 --> 00:17:32.345
Yunxiang…

00:17:39.305 --> 00:17:40.945
You crazy girl.

00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:44.505
I actually believed
you'd grown a conscience,

00:17:45.145 --> 00:17:49.785
bringing all this fine food and wine
to honor your old master.

00:17:50.785 --> 00:17:53.945
Turns out you're trying to poison me,
so you can feast at my funeral.

00:17:55.065 --> 00:17:57.905
Old man, why paint me that evil?

00:17:57.985 --> 00:17:59.705
I came to ask you for help.

00:18:00.385 --> 00:18:02.025
Couldn't you just ask?

00:18:02.105 --> 00:18:04.065
Why poison the soup?

00:18:05.505 --> 00:18:07.625
I didn't want it to sway your judgment.

00:18:07.705 --> 00:18:10.145
Xiao's already gone to check.

00:18:10.225 --> 00:18:12.865
Why should I suffer for this?

00:18:12.945 --> 00:18:14.785
We had to confirm it.

00:18:14.865 --> 00:18:18.345
Besides, who knew you'd react this hard?

00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:20.625
Lady Wang took it for a month
before it kicked in.

00:18:22.065 --> 00:18:22.905
Exactly.

00:18:22.985 --> 00:18:24.825
So why am I reacting this hard?

00:18:27.785 --> 00:18:29.225
I brewed it a bit stronger.

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:34.425
One day you'll kill me
with your own hands!

00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:39.425
Mr. Du.

00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:40.825
The medical text says

00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:43.625
after taking Yunxiang Powder,
you mustn't drink.

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:46.745
So, you'd better drink cold water.

00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:48.865
So you really found it.

00:18:48.945 --> 00:18:49.945
What does the book say?

00:18:50.705 --> 00:18:52.665
I found three poisons that can leave

00:18:52.745 --> 00:18:54.905
red, flower-shaped marks on the skin.

00:18:54.985 --> 00:18:56.505
One comes from the Western Regions.

00:18:56.585 --> 00:18:57.545
It's extremely potent.

00:18:57.625 --> 00:18:59.665
Just a tiny dose
and you cough blood and die on the spot.

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:01.505
Another one comes from Changbai Mountain,

00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:03.065
but it reeks.

00:19:03.145 --> 00:19:06.385
Lady Wang would have noticed it
straight away.

00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:07.385
It's likely not the one.

00:19:07.985 --> 00:19:09.585
That leaves Yunxiang Powder.

00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:14.105
Yunxiang Powder is produced in Annan.

00:19:14.185 --> 00:19:16.905
It was originally used as medicine,

00:19:17.505 --> 00:19:18.945
but taken long-term,

00:19:19.465 --> 00:19:20.385
it becomes poison.

00:19:20.465 --> 00:19:22.265
No symptoms day to day,

00:19:22.345 --> 00:19:23.985
only at the very end

00:19:24.065 --> 00:19:25.265
it causes unbearable pain.

00:19:25.905 --> 00:19:28.185
By the time it flares up,

00:19:28.265 --> 00:19:30.025
the poisoner is already long gone.

00:19:30.785 --> 00:19:32.665
This drug

00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:35.025
is rare now.

00:19:35.985 --> 00:19:37.905
But you must know where to find it.

00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:40.025
I don't.

00:19:41.825 --> 00:19:43.265
Old man,

00:19:43.345 --> 00:19:44.665
are you really going to let this case

00:19:44.745 --> 00:19:46.785
go unsolved just because you're mad at me?

00:19:52.585 --> 00:19:54.265
Bring brush and ink.

00:19:54.345 --> 00:19:57.505
GHOST MARKET

00:20:28.105 --> 00:20:29.145
Here.

00:20:32.225 --> 00:20:34.185
Don't mention my name
before the shop owner.

00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:55.865
Sir,

00:20:55.945 --> 00:20:57.505
Du Zhixing sent me to find you.

00:21:04.665 --> 00:21:05.545
What,

00:21:07.385 --> 00:21:09.785
Du Zhixing isn't dead yet?

00:21:10.465 --> 00:21:12.825
What, you want him killed?

00:21:13.345 --> 00:21:14.545
How much are you paying?

00:21:15.425 --> 00:21:18.545
HEIYA, APOTHECARY OWNER

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:20.385
Come with me.

00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:55.865
What kind of business are you two in?

00:21:56.505 --> 00:21:57.785
I came to see you,

00:21:57.865 --> 00:21:59.585
so, of course,
it's a business of human lives.

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:03.025
With your skills,

00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:06.265
you still need me to kill someone?

00:22:06.985 --> 00:22:09.505
Killing with blades is always crude.

00:22:12.225 --> 00:22:15.825
- You want something elegant?
- Yes.

00:22:15.905 --> 00:22:18.185
Elegant, tragic,

00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:20.025
and killing without a trace.

00:22:20.665 --> 00:22:21.745
Poison.

00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:24.065
But ordinary poison won't do.

00:22:24.145 --> 00:22:26.625
If you get the bleeding, the blue face…

00:22:26.705 --> 00:22:27.545
What a sight!

00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:31.345
I've got something here

00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:34.065
you'll definitely like.

00:22:34.705 --> 00:22:35.745
Let's hear it.

00:22:36.425 --> 00:22:38.345
Yunxiang Powder.

00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:39.985
What's so special about it?

00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:42.465
Colorless, tasteless.

00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:44.105
Delayed onset.

00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:47.505
Agony at death,

00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:51.065
but afterward,
it looks like they're just asleep.

00:22:53.065 --> 00:22:55.825
Any poison that can be traced
isn't a good poison.

00:22:56.505 --> 00:22:58.265
It takes seven days after death

00:22:58.345 --> 00:23:00.425
for signs of poisoning to appear.

00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:02.625
Hard to detect.

00:23:02.705 --> 00:23:06.345
And the body will surface

00:23:06.425 --> 00:23:08.185
flower-shaped marks.

00:23:09.105 --> 00:23:10.065
Beautiful, really.

00:23:10.665 --> 00:23:12.585
You'll love it, my lady.

00:23:13.665 --> 00:23:15.065
Such a fine poison.

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:16.345
How have I never heard of it?

00:23:17.945 --> 00:23:21.665
Anything everyone knows,
I don't sell here.

00:23:22.665 --> 00:23:25.105
If it became famous,

00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:28.585
how could it kill without a trace?

00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:30.785
You're right.

00:23:36.185 --> 00:23:39.425
And you, sir, what do you think?

00:23:42.065 --> 00:23:43.225
Talk is cheap.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:49.185
This way, please.

00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:42.505
Shorty!

00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:44.385
Attempted murder
before the deal is even struck?

00:25:44.465 --> 00:25:46.185
If you don't die,

00:25:46.985 --> 00:25:48.585
I'm the one who dies.

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:37.865
You're still alive?

00:26:52.785 --> 00:26:53.945
Come with me!

00:26:55.305 --> 00:26:56.585
Give me your hand.

00:27:10.705 --> 00:27:11.985
A bloody handprint on you!

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:15.185
There's something mixed into this blood.

00:27:15.265 --> 00:27:16.265
No wonder the alligator only attacked you.

00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:17.985
He must've left it when he pushed me in.

00:27:18.585 --> 00:27:19.545
That shorty is vicious.

00:27:37.065 --> 00:27:38.905
Like it? I'll add a little extra.

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:48.745
Freshly mixed Softening Powder.

00:27:48.825 --> 00:27:49.705
Lucky you.

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:54.385
Who told you to do this?

00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:56.625
You kept not showing up,

00:27:57.145 --> 00:27:59.145
so I kept worrying.

00:27:59.665 --> 00:28:01.345
Now that you're here,

00:28:02.025 --> 00:28:03.745
I finally feel at ease.

00:28:04.345 --> 00:28:05.945
So you still want to live.

00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:08.545
Tell me who sent you to kill me,

00:28:08.625 --> 00:28:09.545
and I'll spare your life.

00:28:12.225 --> 00:28:13.785
If you won't talk,

00:28:13.865 --> 00:28:15.105
come back with us
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:28:17.065 --> 00:28:18.665
Step into the Ghost Market,

00:28:19.185 --> 00:28:21.425
and you belong to it for life.

00:28:21.505 --> 00:28:22.865
You're not taking me!

00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:24.425
Careful!

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:28.585
I said it…

00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:31.745
You're not taking me…

00:28:36.065 --> 00:28:37.265
Wait for me outside.

00:28:37.345 --> 00:28:38.385
- I need to find something.
- No.

00:28:38.465 --> 00:28:40.065
Half a ke at most.

00:28:40.145 --> 00:28:41.345
Find it or not, I'll come out.

00:28:46.025 --> 00:28:47.065
Take care.

00:28:57.625 --> 00:28:58.865
You started the fire?

00:28:59.465 --> 00:29:00.785
It was probably that shorty.

00:29:00.865 --> 00:29:01.705
Before he went in,

00:29:01.785 --> 00:29:03.585
he lit a fuse hidden somewhere outside.

00:29:04.185 --> 00:29:05.385
If he killed us and got away,

00:29:05.465 --> 00:29:07.065
he could put it out in time.

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:08.625
If he couldn't get out alive,

00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:09.545
then it's mutual destruction.

00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:13.265
Let's get out of here first.

00:29:17.145 --> 00:29:18.865
DU'S MANSION

00:29:21.825 --> 00:29:23.345
You made it back alive?

00:29:23.945 --> 00:29:25.745
Old man, you set me up!

00:29:28.065 --> 00:29:29.665
Right back at you.

00:29:30.345 --> 00:29:33.625
Dealing with Heiya took you this long?

00:29:34.225 --> 00:29:35.705
He had an alligator.

00:29:35.785 --> 00:29:37.545
I made it back alive,
and you can't even praise me?

00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:41.985
You burned down his den.

00:29:43.265 --> 00:29:44.185
What's there to praise?

00:29:45.345 --> 00:29:46.305
It wasn't me.

00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:47.225
He did it to himself.

00:29:51.585 --> 00:29:52.465
He's dead?

00:29:53.905 --> 00:29:55.625
What, you'll miss him?

00:29:58.425 --> 00:30:00.585
He did have plenty of good stuff.

00:30:01.185 --> 00:30:02.505
Shame it couldn't see daylight.

00:30:03.705 --> 00:30:05.665
The goods all burned up?

00:30:07.025 --> 00:30:08.025
Not all of it.

00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:20.665
Oh, Yunxiang Powder.

00:30:21.865 --> 00:30:22.985
What about the buyer?

00:30:23.585 --> 00:30:25.665
You didn't find the ledger?

00:30:26.305 --> 00:30:27.665
The ledger was burned.

00:30:29.665 --> 00:30:31.265
But not completely.

00:30:32.185 --> 00:30:33.465
Evidence, after all.

00:30:33.545 --> 00:30:35.505
You've got to save what you can.

00:30:36.305 --> 00:30:37.585
But the writing on this…

00:30:39.145 --> 00:30:40.545
When you work a case,

00:30:41.065 --> 00:30:43.185
you can't rely on ordinary methods…

00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:45.265
alone.

00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:46.865
Of course.

00:30:47.385 --> 00:30:49.465
But if people found out,
it wouldn't look good.

00:30:51.385 --> 00:30:52.345
Spit it out.

00:30:52.985 --> 00:30:54.265
How do I get it?

00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:00.465
Didn't I already give it to you?

00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:02.865
I mean the key to the hidden compartment.

00:31:04.105 --> 00:31:05.865
When I retired,

00:31:05.945 --> 00:31:07.105
I turned it in.

00:31:10.105 --> 00:31:11.505
Fine, so be it.

00:31:12.025 --> 00:31:13.145
Where are you going?

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:15.745
Back to the Bureau to file the evidence.

00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:21.025
At least let me see what it says.

00:31:21.105 --> 00:31:23.345
You're retired. You don't get to.

00:31:28.545 --> 00:31:29.625
Here!

00:31:36.385 --> 00:31:37.745
You little rascal.

00:31:38.265 --> 00:31:39.745
You're messing with me again?

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.425
How is that messing with you?

00:31:47.345 --> 00:31:48.225
Not bad.

00:31:49.185 --> 00:31:51.065
A load off my mind.

00:32:05.705 --> 00:32:06.985
Old man…

00:32:07.065 --> 00:32:08.585
ELEGANCE AND BLESSINGS

00:32:08.665 --> 00:32:09.625
Mr. Xiao,

00:32:10.145 --> 00:32:12.545
why is this sachet in your hand?

00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:15.185
Lady Wang dropped it at the Music Office.

00:32:15.265 --> 00:32:16.225
Someone picked it up.

00:32:16.305 --> 00:32:17.785
When it went missing,

00:32:17.865 --> 00:32:19.145
my lady was so upset.

00:32:19.825 --> 00:32:22.745
We turned the whole place upside down
and still couldn't find it.

00:32:22.825 --> 00:32:24.785
Over this sachet,

00:32:24.865 --> 00:32:27.345
my lady scolded us harshly
for the first time.

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:30.425
Do you know what it once held?

00:32:30.505 --> 00:32:32.025
My lady never said.

00:32:39.985 --> 00:32:40.865
Did Lady Wang

00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:43.225
ever meet someone alone,

00:32:43.865 --> 00:32:45.625
especially at night?

00:32:49.865 --> 00:32:51.465
Even if my lady wasn't favored,

00:32:51.545 --> 00:32:53.385
she couldn't be left unattended.

00:32:53.985 --> 00:32:56.545
My lady had no time alone.

00:32:59.385 --> 00:33:00.225
Except…

00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:03.505
when she chanted sutras.

00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:15.505
This altar was set up by your lady?

00:33:16.145 --> 00:33:17.265
Yes.

00:33:17.345 --> 00:33:18.985
When my lady was alive,

00:33:19.065 --> 00:33:20.985
she tended it herself.

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.065
Now,

00:33:22.145 --> 00:33:23.905
I think it's best

00:33:23.985 --> 00:33:25.465
not to let the incense go out.

00:33:25.545 --> 00:33:28.225
My lady chanted here every night.

00:33:28.305 --> 00:33:30.145
At that time, she didn't need attendants.

00:33:30.225 --> 00:33:32.625
She'd have me and Fangsheng
rest for a while.

00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:34.305
Every night?

00:33:35.145 --> 00:33:36.225
Not every night.

00:33:36.305 --> 00:33:39.225
Before chanting, she'd have us
light the incense and candles.

00:33:39.305 --> 00:33:41.145
Once they burned down,

00:33:41.225 --> 00:33:43.025
she'd be finished.

00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:44.745
Right about an hour.

00:33:45.585 --> 00:33:46.865
An hour?

00:33:54.945 --> 00:33:56.385
That's not ordinary candles.

00:33:56.985 --> 00:33:58.385
They're ghee lamps meant to burn long.

00:33:58.985 --> 00:34:00.945
Your wound isn't healed. Rest today.

00:34:01.905 --> 00:34:02.985
Just a scratch.

00:34:03.065 --> 00:34:04.105
And with the old man's medicine,

00:34:04.185 --> 00:34:05.185
I'm fine.

00:34:07.665 --> 00:34:10.385
One ghee lamp burning out
takes far more than an hour.

00:34:27.185 --> 00:34:29.545
So her chanting
actually took over two hours.

00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:31.425
It didn't feel that long.

00:34:32.065 --> 00:34:33.264
When you steal a break,

00:34:33.344 --> 00:34:35.145
time seems to speed up.

00:34:35.665 --> 00:34:36.784
So Lady Wang

00:34:36.865 --> 00:34:38.945
probably used that two hours to slip out

00:34:39.025 --> 00:34:40.385
of Hanliang Hall alone.

00:34:41.705 --> 00:34:42.625
Then,

00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:43.985
we've got the time.

00:34:44.065 --> 00:34:45.784
Next we need the place and the person.

00:34:47.665 --> 00:34:49.344
With just two hours,

00:34:49.425 --> 00:34:50.744
if she was meeting someone,

00:34:51.784 --> 00:34:53.105
the round-trip walking time

00:34:53.185 --> 00:34:55.344
should be within an hour.

00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:58.385
Hanliang Hall sits
in the southeast corner.

00:34:58.465 --> 00:34:59.985
Let's search west and north.

00:35:00.505 --> 00:35:01.545
To the north is the garden.

00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:03.905
His Majesty's consorts
often go there for a stroll.

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:04.825
So it's probably not there.

00:35:04.905 --> 00:35:06.425
Then let's search west.

00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:11.665
CHENG'EN PALACE

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:23.065
Cheng'en Palace is under repair.

00:35:23.145 --> 00:35:25.905
But it's been over a year,
and it's still not finished.

00:35:25.985 --> 00:35:28.105
It's not Xingqing Palace's best location,

00:35:28.185 --> 00:35:29.505
but it's still an auspicious site.

00:35:30.025 --> 00:35:31.305
How could it be left this desolate?

00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:34.705
Cheng'en Palace being abandoned
is definitely suspicious.

00:35:35.305 --> 00:35:37.825
But isn't an abandoned and quiet palace

00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:39.385
perfect for a secret meeting?

00:36:12.385 --> 00:36:13.225
Mr. Xiao, look.

00:36:13.305 --> 00:36:14.505
In all of Cheng'en Palace,

00:36:14.585 --> 00:36:16.585
only this side room
is kept in perfect order.

00:36:16.665 --> 00:36:18.065
So it's not ordinary.

00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:32.225
This place was probably
cleared out recently.

00:36:32.945 --> 00:36:34.105
But something feels off.

00:36:35.105 --> 00:36:36.185
What feels off?

00:36:43.905 --> 00:36:45.425
Locking the door is useless.

00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:47.065
Trying to kill and silence
someone in the palace

00:36:47.145 --> 00:36:48.665
is pure delusion!

00:36:49.305 --> 00:36:51.305
Enjoy yourself, Your Ladyship.

00:36:55.905 --> 00:36:57.745
Mr. Xiao, what's wrong?

00:37:01.545 --> 00:37:02.705
Why is your forehead burning?

00:37:03.345 --> 00:37:04.505
Something's wrong with this room.

00:37:04.585 --> 00:37:05.545
What's wrong?

00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:06.465
The candles…

00:37:07.185 --> 00:37:08.305
Lust-inducing fumes!

00:37:27.465 --> 00:37:28.825
We underestimated them.

00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:31.625
Once my honor's on the line,

00:37:32.385 --> 00:37:34.385
no matter how capable I am,

00:37:34.465 --> 00:37:36.225
I will be severely constrained.

00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:38.705
You're not an ordinary woman.

00:37:39.745 --> 00:37:41.265
But if a woman's disgraced,

00:37:41.945 --> 00:37:43.985
it drags down more than just her.

00:37:55.385 --> 00:37:56.585
Tie me up,

00:37:56.665 --> 00:37:58.785
and they'll have no rumors to spread.

00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:11.385
Mr. Xiao.

00:38:13.545 --> 00:38:15.785
For once, you're both clever

00:38:15.865 --> 00:38:16.705
and simple.

00:38:37.225 --> 00:38:38.105
This room…

00:38:41.345 --> 00:38:42.185
is too dark.

00:39:32.425 --> 00:39:33.305
Your Ladyship?

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.305
Your Ladyship?

00:39:35.985 --> 00:39:37.385
Your Ladyship?

00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:52.425
It's so hot.

00:39:57.065 --> 00:39:58.065
Should we…

00:39:58.945 --> 00:40:00.385
clear the air?

00:40:02.745 --> 00:40:03.585
The air between us?

00:40:17.905 --> 00:40:20.185
Your Ladyship, come help me.

00:40:20.265 --> 00:40:23.225
If we air it out,
it should ease the smoke.

00:40:30.945 --> 00:40:32.145
I inhaled it too.

00:40:33.145 --> 00:40:34.305
I'm out of strength.

00:40:43.745 --> 00:40:44.905
Your Ladyship,

00:40:45.585 --> 00:40:46.425
come here.

00:40:47.065 --> 00:40:48.905
Fresh air helps a lot.

00:40:50.945 --> 00:40:52.345
I'll help you over.

00:40:57.225 --> 00:40:58.225
Mr. Xiao,

00:40:59.105 --> 00:40:59.945
forgive me.

00:41:45.425 --> 00:41:47.905
Last night at Cheng'en Palace,

00:41:47.985 --> 00:41:49.105
we opened the door

00:41:49.185 --> 00:41:50.585
and the County Princess

00:41:50.665 --> 00:41:53.025
and Mr. Xiao on the bed, stark naked!

00:41:53.625 --> 00:41:56.105
Eunuch Liu was scared out of his wits!

00:41:57.665 --> 00:41:59.705
Fuchang County Princess
has always been willful,

00:41:59.785 --> 00:42:01.985
but to act like this before marriage

00:42:02.065 --> 00:42:03.385
is outrageously bold.

00:42:03.465 --> 00:42:06.625
I heard they say
she keeps a man by her side all day.

00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:07.745
I knew something was off.

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:10.185
I never thought
she'd be this unrestrained.

00:42:10.705 --> 00:42:12.025
Yulan, right?

00:42:14.945 --> 00:42:16.225
I was looking for you.

00:42:20.225 --> 00:42:21.105
Looking for me?

00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.105
Someone asked me to pass you a message.

00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:25.305
The Imperial Guard at south side gate said

00:42:25.385 --> 00:42:27.305
he understands your feelings,

00:42:27.385 --> 00:42:29.105
but he's already betrothed.

00:42:29.185 --> 00:42:31.065
So he really can't accept your affection.

00:42:31.705 --> 00:42:33.865
He threw away
the handkerchief you gave him too.

00:42:33.945 --> 00:42:35.825
He says don't do this again.

00:42:35.905 --> 00:42:37.065
Feelings?

00:42:37.145 --> 00:42:38.025
A handkerchief?

00:42:38.105 --> 00:42:39.065
Hey…

00:42:39.145 --> 00:42:40.345
What are you talking about?

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:42.065
What Imperial Guard? What handkerchief?

00:42:42.145 --> 00:42:43.065
Oh, besides,

00:42:43.145 --> 00:42:45.305
he also said from now on,

00:42:45.385 --> 00:42:47.905
don't sneak out
while you're on night duty.

00:42:47.985 --> 00:42:51.065
If someone sees you, it won't end well.

00:42:51.705 --> 00:42:54.225
Nonsense! Which idiot is spreading this?

00:42:55.385 --> 00:42:57.585
You're Yulan, new in Consort Shu's palace?

00:42:57.665 --> 00:42:59.145
With an orchid pattern
on your handkerchief?

00:42:59.825 --> 00:43:00.905
Yes.

00:43:01.865 --> 00:43:03.225
Then it's you, no doubt.

00:43:03.825 --> 00:43:05.225
Let me give you a warning.

00:43:05.305 --> 00:43:07.825
Keep a lower profile from now on.

00:43:07.905 --> 00:43:09.985
If this gets reported to Consort Shu,

00:43:10.065 --> 00:43:12.025
you'll be kicked out.

00:43:12.105 --> 00:43:12.945
What…

00:43:13.025 --> 00:43:14.105
- Let's leave.
- What are you even saying?

00:43:14.185 --> 00:43:16.505
I didn't do anything!
Why would I be kicked out?

00:43:18.145 --> 00:43:19.825
You like spreading rumors, don't you?

00:43:19.905 --> 00:43:21.465
Then you can be the lead this time.

00:43:22.065 --> 00:43:23.145
Hey…

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.745
Boss. You're awake?

00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:31.345
Where's Mr. Xiao?

00:43:35.465 --> 00:43:36.865
At a time like this,

00:43:36.945 --> 00:43:38.465
you're still worried about Mr. Xiao?

00:43:41.425 --> 00:43:42.545
He was sent back to the Xiao's Mansion.

00:43:43.465 --> 00:43:44.465
Boss,

00:43:44.545 --> 00:43:46.505
no matter what, you're still a young lady.

00:43:46.585 --> 00:43:47.905
Next time you investigate at night,

00:43:47.985 --> 00:43:49.465
take me with you, okay?

00:43:49.545 --> 00:43:52.025
A man and a woman alone in a room,

00:43:52.105 --> 00:43:55.105
no matter what,
it sounds bad if it gets out.

00:43:56.225 --> 00:43:57.705
I was set up while working the case.

00:43:57.785 --> 00:44:00.225
Of course I know. But…

00:44:00.825 --> 00:44:02.345
others won't care about that.

00:44:02.425 --> 00:44:04.065
Royal secrets?

00:44:04.145 --> 00:44:06.745
The more thrilling
and wild it sounds, the better.

00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:09.985
Let's hear it. How wild?

00:44:12.145 --> 00:44:13.385
They…

00:44:13.985 --> 00:44:15.705
They said

00:44:15.785 --> 00:44:18.785
you used the case
as an excuse to meet Mr. Xiao,

00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:21.265
then lit "Love Incense"
and used too much of it.

00:44:22.385 --> 00:44:24.145
I can't stand those gossips.

00:44:26.705 --> 00:44:29.105
If I cared that much
about what people say,

00:44:29.185 --> 00:44:30.345
how could I live?

00:44:30.865 --> 00:44:32.305
As long as you believe me, I'm fine.

00:44:32.385 --> 00:44:34.585
Of course I believe you.

00:44:34.665 --> 00:44:36.945
Those gossiping have nothing better to do.

00:44:39.305 --> 00:44:40.385
How did they find me?

00:44:42.465 --> 00:44:43.825
A eunuch

00:44:43.905 --> 00:44:46.505
heard strange noises at Cheng'en Palace

00:44:46.585 --> 00:44:48.625
and saw ghost lights.
He insisted it was haunted.

00:44:48.705 --> 00:44:50.505
After the Hanliang Hall case,

00:44:50.585 --> 00:44:52.065
everyone in the palace was on edge.

00:44:52.145 --> 00:44:53.825
So that eunuch
led a squad of Imperial Guards

00:44:53.905 --> 00:44:56.465
to search Cheng'en Palace inside and out.

00:44:56.545 --> 00:44:59.585
Then, in the innermost room,

00:44:59.665 --> 00:45:01.305
they found you and Mr. Xiao.

00:45:01.945 --> 00:45:05.105
So the whole palace must've heard.

00:45:05.745 --> 00:45:06.585
Yes.

00:45:08.345 --> 00:45:09.185
Good.

00:45:10.545 --> 00:45:12.225
Good?

00:45:12.865 --> 00:45:14.345
Boss, you did it on purpose?

00:45:15.025 --> 00:45:15.945
Of course.

00:45:16.785 --> 00:45:17.825
Only if it made a big splash

00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:21.185
could they openly probe for news.
