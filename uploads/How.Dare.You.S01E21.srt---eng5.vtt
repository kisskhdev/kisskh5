00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.990
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.880
[Episode 21]

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.560
Push harder!

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.600
Bring the battering ram!

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.200
Yes!

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.610
You're at the end of your rope now,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.910
and you're still not giving up?

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.280
Dan.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.770
Should we kill her?

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.970
Do you have any poison?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.710
The kind
that won't kill someone right away.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.110
How do you know I have any?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.120
I didn't make it myself.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.440
I don't know if it's lethal.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.810
But I tested it on a chicken.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.700
One pill shouldn't kill a person.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.170
When the chicken ate it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.400
it collapsed immediately.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.030
Mr. Bei,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.410
Feed this to the Empress Dowager.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.070
Xiahou Dan!

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.130
Xiahou Dan!

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.410
Xiahou Dan, you can't kill me!

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.700
I raised you!

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.600
I put you where you are today!

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.190
Dan.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.000
Dan...

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.270
Xiahou Dan!

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.579
You've been poisoned.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.560
If I die,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.450
you'll die too.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.470
The throne of Great Xia

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.870
will belong to Xiahou Po.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.140
Dan, think about it.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.310
Are we

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.020
going to hand over

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.070
the empire to him so easily?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.490
Mother, you seem to have forgotten

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.640
that thanks to you and Prince Duan,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.210
I've been poisoned many times
over the years

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.600
and taken so many medicines.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.860
Ordinary poisons

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.240
no longer affect me.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.940
So Mother, don't worry.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.170
I won't die before you.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.530
Feed it to the Empress Dowager.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.300
Mother, do you remember where we are?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.050
In the tomb
I built for you with my own hands.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.360
The door has been broken down!

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.620
The Emperor is inside!

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.360
Kill them!

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.980
Your Highness!

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.140
I, Fu He, Deputy Commander
of the Imperial Guards,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.120
was late in coming to the rescue.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.050
I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.000
I'm fine.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.070
Quickly, save the Empress Dowager.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.370
Your Highness!

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.159
Your Highness!

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.890
Terrible news, Your Highness!

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.800
Terrible news!

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.720
Speak.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.180
Tu'er

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.909
had already

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.550
depleted most of the Emperor's forces.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.360
We seized the chance to strike.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.120
But

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.780
unexpectedly,

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.040
the Imperial Guards

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.800
suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.840
All our efforts are wasted!

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.920
Isn't Zhao Wucheng on our side?

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.530
He wasn't leading the troops.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.670
It's said the deputy commander

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.330
used the Tiger Tally to mobilize
the army without permission.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.450
What about the Emperor?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.800
Was he injured?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.730
Well...

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.390
I

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.300
was lucky enough

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.950
to escape alive.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:42.460
[Capital of Xia]

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.010
Stop.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.510
Deputy Commander Fu He.

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.950
Move!

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.960
Your Majesty.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.620
Where is Zhao Wucheng?

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.270
I...

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.140
His Majesty is asking you!

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.840
Commander Zhao...

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.680
has gone missing.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.120
Issue my decree:

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.660
Zhao Wucheng,
Commander of the Imperial Guards,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.520
has committed insubordination,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.530
neglected his duty, and fled,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.200
causing the Empress Dowager's
sudden illness.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.920
Dismiss him immediately

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.680
and search the entire city for him.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.510
I...

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.190
want him alive.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.040
Yes.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.810
Deputy Commander Fu He.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.850
I am here.

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.690
For your merit in saving me,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.230
you are promoted to Commander,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.820
Grand General of the Junior Second Rank,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.450
with full command of the Imperial Guards.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:55.330
Thank you,

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.630
Your Majesty, for this great honor.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.350
Your Highness.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.310
The Emperor appeared at the city gate.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.040
He promoted Deputy Commander Fu He.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.480
But he didn't get out of his carriage.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.000
I

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.240
couldn't tell if he's injured.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.720
Tu'er.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.110
What about those assassins?

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.030
They're nowhere to be found.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.200
We don't know if they are alive or dead.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.270
Xiahou Dan!

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.460
You're really hard to kill!

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.490
You're really hard to kill!

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.550
Issue an order in His Majesty's name:

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.720
the palace is under curfew tonight.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.840
No one may enter or leave.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.150
Yes.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.320
Here.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.440
Careful.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.730
Alright.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.960
Hang in there.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.670
I'll go fetch the imperial physicians.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.200
Don't go.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.630
The Imperial Medical Bureau

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.360
is full of Prince Duan's spies.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.120
If he finds out I'm injured,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.120
the peace talks will be ruined.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.190
Don't worry.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.910
I'm just a little tired.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.250
You don't need to worry either.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.640
I can handle it.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.600
Mr. Bei,

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.020
can you manage this?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.000
I can only stop the bleeding temporarily.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.580
But he's been poisoned.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.150
The wound won't heal.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.270
What should we do?

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.160
Who else can we find?

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.780
Lan.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.380
Go find Consort Xie.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.700
Tell her to avoid Prince Duan's spies...

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.080
Yes.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.790
And bring Xiao Tiancai here secretly.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.510
If she doesn't believe you...

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:16.840
Okay.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.790
Just make this gesture to her.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:19.920
Hurry up.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.400
Be careful, Your Highness.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.210
Gently.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.120
Consort Xie,

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.300
with what you're doing now,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:29.630
I...

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.240
Shut up.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.750
Be quiet.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.190
If you yell,

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.270
I'll hit you again.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:42.990
What are you doing?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.280
You talk too much.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.900
Consort Xie.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.030
Consort Xie.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.070
-I'm Lan, Noble Consort's personal maid.
-Lan...

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.390
What is it?

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.080
Noble Consort asks you
to go to Yongyan Palace with me.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.360
She also said to bring along

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.420
that junior imperial physician
you're familiar with.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.030
I don't have any

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480
familiar physicians in the palace.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.250
Besides,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.570
I'm not feeling well tonight

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.000
and am already resting.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.800
Please leave.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.030
Noble Consort
also asked me to give you a message,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.690
which is...

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.600
"GA-VE-ME-FI-VE."

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.470
But I do like someone.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.960
Who?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.740
Give me five.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.890
Give me five?

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.140
Oh my goodness!

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.100
I was so scared.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.880
Yu Wanyin,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.380
you're finally back.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.270
We couldn't find them.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.270
Search over there.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.670
You guys, search the back!

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.200
Let's go!

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.320
Yong'er.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.150
Wanyin,

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.620
you're finally back.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.290
This is Physician Xiao.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.720
Physician Xiao,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
His Majesty has been poisoned.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.510
His wound won't heal and keeps bleeding.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.510
Please save him.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.670
I will do my utmost.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.330
Physician.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.340
It didn't hit any vital spots.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.240
What should I do?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.770
You...

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.290
Hold the wound first.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.240
What exactly happened?

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.240
How did it get this bad?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.170
Are you alright?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.730
A few words can't explain.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.320
In short,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.120
the Empress Dowager has collapsed.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120
We barely made it.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.970
As long as we survive the next few days,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.080
we'll be able to fight Prince Duan.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.260
But can he survive such a serious injury?

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.720
What am I even saying?

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.650
Of course he can.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.030
Right.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.800
We could give him a blood transfusion.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.150
We don't know his blood type.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.320
I'm type O.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:19.750
Universal donor.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.500
You mean

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.480
you were type O before coming here?

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.870
Oh, right.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.250
Yong'er,

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.090
I haven't had the chance to thank you.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.480
If you hadn't risked yourself
to deliver that message,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.410
we might all have died at Mount Bei.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.480
I just made the choice I wanted.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.080
Enough about me.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.550
I'm curious—

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.550
you don't know martial arts.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.610
How did you escape?

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.600
A gun?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.320
That's a choice?

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.550
My goodness.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.400
I'm glad I'm not standing against you.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.730
Your Highness.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:04.760
Physician Xiao,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.720
how is it?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.880
Judging from the wound,

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.830
His Majesty
seems to have been poisoned with

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.510
a toxin that prevents blood clotting
and healing.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.050
This poison is extremely potent

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.840
and doesn't seem to be from our Great Xia.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.640
That's right.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.170
It's from Qiang State.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.180
But there's more than one poison
in His Majesty's body.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.630
Your Highness, please don't panic.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.600
Although the old poison
has built up over many years,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.460
it's not fatal.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.390
I've long heard that His Majesty
suffers from headaches.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.510
They are most likely
related to this poison.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.370
Is there a cure?

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.600
I need time.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.020
However...

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.670
What?

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.800
There's something strange.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.510
As you said earlier,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.320
this new poison should cause the wound
to continue worsening.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.870
But from what I just observed,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.840
when the new poison interacted
with the old one,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.300
the wound actually
showed signs of healing.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.150
I'm a bit confused.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.370
What exactly is happening?

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.480
There's only one possibility now:

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.310
the new poison and the old poison

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.770
counteracted each other.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.210
You mean...

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.680
curing poison with poison?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.210
Exactly.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.200
Empress Dowager.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.120
Let me check your pulse.
Please don't move.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.440
Come on. Hold her down for me.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.910
Why are you dawdling?

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.680
Hurry!

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.120
Yes.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.910
Come on. Help me hold her hand.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.710
Acupuncture!

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.880
Acupuncture!

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.310
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.570
The imperial physician is treating her.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.010
You're finally awake.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.320
How long was I asleep?

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.680
A day and a night.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.050
You scared me to death.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.200
How do you feel now?

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.810
Better than I expected.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.670
Mr. Bei made you some sweet porridge.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.800
Try to have a little.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.630
How are things at the palace?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.750
Court was not held yesterday.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.870
The official story is that

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.030
you were attending
to the Empress Dowager's illness.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.230
The palace gates are still restricted.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.240
But I wanted to bluff Prince Duan,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:09.640
so

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.069
I had them prepare for the peace talks

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.130
as scheduled the day after tomorrow.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.819
There's been

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.460
no movement from Prince Duan's side yet.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.880
What about the Empress Dowager?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.589
I heard she's been shouting nonstop

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.250
and can barely speak clearly.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.810
As for the officials from her faction,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.030
they've been coming to me
one after another

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.110
like the Calabash Brothers
rescuing their grandfather.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.830
But Xie Yong'er sent them all away
with just a few words.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.630
Xie Yong'er is that formidable?

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.960
When women unite

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.440
and work on something important,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.300
they're no less capable than men.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.240
You really scared me with this.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.170
If she hadn't been helping me,

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.120
I definitely
couldn't have handled it alone.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.420
You haven't rested at all?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.110
I'm fine.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.660
Seeing you awake

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.880
puts my mind at ease.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.960
Well, I'll...

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.490
You're not going anywhere.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.350
Sleep for a while.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.270
Just consider it keeping me company.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.750
I can't. There are
still many things to take care of.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.390

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.420

Mr. Mu, wait!

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.070
Mr. Mu!

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.000
Mr. Mu!

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.790
The more I called you, the faster you ran.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.590
Let me ask you.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.110
Didn't they say the Empress Dowager
was just a little startled?

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.550
How come His Majesty
attended to her yesterday

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.550
and today as well?

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.160
This must be a serious illness

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.620
if he's not holding court.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:52.640
Mr. Chen,

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.110
I don't know either.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.110
How can you not know?

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.170
Wasn't this your i—

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.480
Wasn't the Empress Dowager's trip
to Mount Bei your idea?

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.000
Now the envoy delegation is missing,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.350
the Empress Dowager
and His Majesty are missing,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.150
and even Prince Duan is missing.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.260
This isn't normal.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.200
Lord Chen,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.890
why don't you

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.790
go to the Empress Dowager's chamber
yourself and ask?

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.450
Then you'll know everything.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.040
You...

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.960
The Imperial Guards and the Yulin Guards
fought in the streets!

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.720
Such a serious matter—

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.310
I must inform Her Majesty!

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.310
-Yes, we should tell her!
-Yes!

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.590
Indeed.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.680
The envoy delegation has disappeared.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.790
It involves diplomatic relations.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.190
Can you afford the delay?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.740
Exactly!

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.200
-By order of His Majesty,
-Can you afford the delay?

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.720
the Empress Dowager
has suddenly fallen seriously ill

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.590
and must rest.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.210
No one is to disturb her.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.140
This...

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.590
You keep repeating yourself.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.380
Is that all you can say?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:43.640
[Shou'an Palace]

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.640
-Move!
-Back off!

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.160
Move!

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:45.790
Move!

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.310
I'll stay here today.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.000
What are you going to do about it?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.440
Exactly!

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:49.800
Right!

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.830
What can you do about us?

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.240
Exactly!

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.390
Quick, let us in!

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.930
Mr. Chen.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.510
Clam down.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.720
-Mr. Chen is here.
-Calm down.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.580
Step aside now!

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.070
Mr. Chen, you're finally here.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.570
They won't let us in.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.070
Right.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.670
Calm down.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.840
By order of His Majesty,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.750
the Empress Dowager
has suddenly fallen seriously ill.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.080
No one is to disturb her.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.970
How dare you!

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.440
Open your eyes and look carefully!

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.480
This is Mr. Chen Danian,
Minister of Revenue,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.680
the Empress Dowager's
most trusted official.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.240
Exactly!

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.440
Yes, this is Mr. Chen.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.880
Young sir,

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.680
the Empress Dowager once instructed

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.790
that as soon as
she returned to the palace,

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.790
I must come to meet her immediately.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.830
Immediately.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.530
Mr. Chen!

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.810
By order of His Majesty,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.050
no one is to disturb Her Majesty.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.740
No one.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.510
You...

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:37.510
[Prince Duan's Mansion]

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.070
The Imperial Guards provoked us first.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.680
Many civilians witnessed it.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.070
Public opinion is in uproar now.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.920
What should we do?

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.720
Yes.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.330
Everyone is saying

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.210
that the Emperor was injured too.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.700
Regarding the next steps,

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.580
we need to meet with His Highness.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.920
I understand

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.040
how you all feel.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.270
But His Highness
has been unwell these days

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.670
and isn't seeing anyone.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:21:59.970
My Lords,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:00.970
my apologies.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.070
[Prince Duan's Mansion]

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.530
Well...

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.340
Well...

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.110
Wait!

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.000
Wait!

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:08.940
Hold on.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.760
Why are you here?

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.680
Wasn't the trip to Mount Bei your idea?

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.790
Now the envoy delegation is missing,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.480
the Empress Dowager
and the Emperor are missing,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.610
and even His Highness isn't seeing us.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.700
This isn't normal.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.000
Indeed.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.770
Lord Jia,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.000
wait a moment.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.150
Wait a moment.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.310
You...

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.750
Will His Highness see him?

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:31.790
Is he allowed in?

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:32.470
Yes.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.070
Mr. Xu.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.120
Let me ask one more question.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.210
Has Prince Duan

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.930
left any private message for me?

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.440
If anything happens,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.850
all of you will certainly be notified.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.230
Wait, Mr. Xu.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.550
You may not know me.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.200
You should go back and wait for news,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.930
Lord Murong.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.250
M-Mr. Xu!

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.480
In the battle at the posthouse,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.550
I witnessed with my own eyes

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.280
Tu'er and his men's abilities.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.270
Each of them could really fight 10 men
on their own and were incredibly brave.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.110
Logically,
with the skills of the Emperor's guards,

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.770
they wouldn't have survived.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.410
There was a master fighter?

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.010
I'm willing to help with all my strength.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:56.270
[Since that's the case,
I'm willing to help with all my strength]

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.700
The experts around the Emperor

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:57.960
[The experts around the Emperor
you mentioned—I've identified them]

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.200
you mentioned—

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.090
I've identified them.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.960
That little fox Yu Wanyin.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.030
She tricked me again.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.130
Your Highness,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.400
I carefully examined all the traces.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.550
There was indeed a master fighter.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.080
However,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.510
apart from this one person,
the others seem

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.550
no match for the envoy delegation.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.910
Could there be something

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.570
that we've overlooked?

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.090
The smell of saltpeter and sulfur?

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.300
It seems this is how the Emperor

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.590
managed to escape.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.160
Hurry up!

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.920
Don't push me!

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:13.800
Hurry!

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.760
I'm not going.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.010
As the Prince of Yan State,

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.300
I'm wearing eunuch's clothes,

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.490
living in a tunnel like a rat.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.760
What a disgrace!

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.680
In this palace,
besides His Majesty, it's all eunuchs.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.400
Should I give you

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.160
a dragon robe?

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.560
You...

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.420
Come on.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.830
You could dress like a woman,

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.850
just like me.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.440
You Great Xia people
are just unreasonable.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.270
What now?

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.870
Want me to beat you up again?

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:43.630
Pick it up!

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.190
Move!

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.400
Do you want His majesty to wait for you?

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.930
Hurry up!

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.340
Search thoroughly!

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.410
Your Highness.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.030
That person was one of the Imperial Guards
who rescued the Emperor that day.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:01.960
He's one of ours.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.550
Greetings, Prince Duan.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.010
When you arrived that day,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.540
how many people
were in the underground palace?

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.550
My rank...

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.540
wasn't high enough

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.320
to get close.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.240
But according to those who saw,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.920
there were only the Emperor,
the Empress Dowager,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.640
two severely wounded guards,

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.210
and a maid.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.510
No one else?

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.710
There was indeed no one else.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.110
You may go.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:30.920
Yes.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.940
It seems that although

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.180
the Emperor
had a master fighter and weapons

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.090
around him,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.440
they didn't gain any advantage.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.350
Otherwise, he wouldn't have escaped
to this underground palace.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.750
So...

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.480
shall I proceed according to the plan?

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.480
Plans

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.040
can't keep up with changes.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.030
Right now, the most important thing

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.180
is to find Tu'er first.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.110
But where has he gone?

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.030
I'm worried about

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.460
what identity I should use

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.770
to ally with Great Xia.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.040
If I declare myself the new king,

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.240
wouldn't the people of Yan State

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.510
see me as a traitor?

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.310
Of course not.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.920
You're the envoy sent specifically
by the Emperor of Yan for the peace talks.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.700
Doesn't that

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.570
make your signing official and legitimate?

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.530
I'm an impostor.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.210
But the people don't know.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:54.630
Tomorrow,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.580
once the treaty is signed,

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.170
I'll immediately spread the news

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.980
across the country,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.010
all the way to Yan State.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.480
I'll say

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.440
that Zhaluowahan showed great sincerity

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:08.570
by sending a prince

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.550
for the peace talks,

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.680
and Great Xia,
appreciating that sincerity,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.810
honored you as a distinguished guest.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.240
Then the two nations

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:19.280
have finally ceased hostilities.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.510
The people of Yan State, weary from war,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.060
will also rejoice.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.350
By then...

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.080
By then, if Zhaluowahan

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.960
refuses to acknowledge the treaty

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.310
just to start the war,

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.740
he'll be breaking his word

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.000
and proving himself an unjust ruler.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.860
I didn't expect

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.700
you'd catch on so quickly.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.090
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.830
Based on what I know about him,

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.630
he won't sit back and do nothing.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:54.920
I...

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.140
I don't want to see civil war
in Yan State.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.960
If we are to kill Zhaluowahan,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.290
it must be done quickly.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.580
I can lend you some men.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:09.960
It's settled.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.890
I'm leaving.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.010
Can I not stay down here?

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.880
No.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:31.370
Can he at least not stay with me?

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.500
No.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.110
Can I...

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.170
Just go down there!

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.670
We're both men.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.790
What's there to be awkward about?

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:42.990
Stop talking so much.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.830
Stop pretending to be asleep.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.960
The bed is shaking from your laughter.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.880
Making Tu'er pretend to be a eunuch?

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.920
I can't believe you came up with that.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.120
I learned it from you.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.290
Having Eunuch An impersonate me?

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:17.080
Eunuch An is still hanging around
the Empress Dowager's place.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.350
The men you said

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.830
you'd lend him just now—

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:20.560
was that Bai?

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.560
Correct.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.130
Ten points for you.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.440
But as just a martial artist,

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.830
can he summon so many people at once?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:38.720
Wrong.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.880
Minus 10.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.830
What's wrong?

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.120
Why do you always bring up other people?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.350
Stop flirting with me.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.550
Keep that up, and your wound will split.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:53.930
I don't care.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.880
I have something important to ask you.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.460
How do you know so much about Shanyi?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.400
Weren't you

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.050
not even here at that time?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.930
I investigated.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.380
The palace servants who recovered
her body told me.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.070
Then, after you recognized
Tu'er in the main hall,

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.270
why didn't you confront him immediately?

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.480
That might have prevented

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.480
that fierce battle on the mountain.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.460
He wouldn't accept a one-sided story

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.810
without witnesses.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.780
I had to wait until his efforts failed

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.630
and he refused to accept defeat,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.910
so I could give him a new purpose

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.890
and someone to take revenge on.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.580
Tu'er's men killed Wang Zhao.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.930
I don't feel sympathy for him.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.290
But his story with Shanyi

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.750
is quite heartbreaking.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.000
In this world,

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.670
surviving is sheer luck,

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.600
and staying together

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.900
is an even greater luxury.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.400
Yes.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.560
Being able to stay together

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.480
is already a luxury.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.200
So, in a way,

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.930
I should be grateful for this.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.590
Otherwise, if we kept
circling around like this,

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.190
one day we might suddenly die

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.810
without ever really being together.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.310
So...

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.510
we are together now?

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.550
Oh my.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.160
I've become love-obsessed after all.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.560
But

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.330
having witnessed how fragile life is,

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.960
I had

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.070
the impulse to seize the day.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.540
I feel the same way.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.770
Before you went up the mountain,

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.090
didn't you set a flag?

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.060
What were you going to tell me?

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.830
What's wrong?

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.090
I think my wound is really splitting.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.440
I told you not to flirt with me.
You didn't listen.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.199
Wait here.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.540
I'll get the medicine.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.210
Don't move.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:43.960
Wanyin,

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.280
I've lost the courage to tell you again.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:47.880
I'm sorry.
