[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 17]

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.120
If you don't believe

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.640
Yu Wanyin would say something like this
to Xie Yong'er,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.370
that's fine.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.180
I'll ask you in a different identity.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:56.310
How...

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.640
Are...

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.070
You?

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.630
Answer me!

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.380
How are you?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.190
You too?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.240
Yes, I am.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.630
I'm tired.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.880
Let's put our cards on the table.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.820
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.690
You already know very well who I am.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.490
Stop talking!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.190
How long are you going to
keep running from this?

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.870
I'll ask you that same question again
right now.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.070
Do you dare answer it?

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.760
Answer what?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.829
Your Majesty.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.460
Consort Yu has gone crazy.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.380
She keeps saying strange things.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.190
I'm really scared.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.000
Is that so?

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.360
Let me answer it for you.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:56.630
Fine.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.840
Thank you.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.870
And you?

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.280
You too?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.600
[Kunyu Palace]

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.560
Why are you here?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.000
Is everything with the envoy delegation
settled?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.750
More or less.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.960
I muddled through it
without any real trouble.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.190
I heard

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.850
the Empress Dowager gave you a hard time.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.440
I managed to muddle through it as well.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.600
You're awake.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.400
So you two, like me,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.910
are also transmigrators?

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.240
Yes.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.190
Since we're all the same kind...

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.850
Since we're all the same kind,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.640
why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.240
Did you have to watch me from the shadows

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.800
and see me make a fool of myself?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.240
Right.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.110
Watching you cheat on me the whole time—

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.470
pretty thrilling.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.820
Then...

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.290
Then why are you telling me now?

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.600
Why not just kill me?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.040
Just tell the public that Xie Yong'er
died from childbirth complications.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.920
This way, Prince Duan
wouldn't suspect anything.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.270
Wouldn't that be even better?

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.830
Indeed.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.520
Wanyin, why did you tell her?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.040
Well...

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.780
Why not just kill her?

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.930
Yong'er,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.700
look,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.050
we've already reached the point of
miscarriage

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.220
and framing each other.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.490
If the plot keeps developing like this,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.090
it'll be a fight to the death.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.610
Since we're all the same kind,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.060
isn't there another possibility for us?

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.990
Stop being so hypocritical.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.040
You never intended to tell me the truth
from the start.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.390
Now that you see me

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.230
in this state,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.480
you come telling me we're the same kind?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.740
Haven't you had your fill of the joke yet?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.460
If we had told you
right after we transmigrated,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.750
would your first reaction

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.080
have been to cooperate?

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.480
At that time, you had already
sided with Prince Duan.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.880
Suddenly finding out
that I was a wild card,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.950
you'd probably
have gone straight to Prince Duan

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.610
and told him

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.490
to take me out

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.890
while I was still weak.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:25.600
Am I wrong?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.360
Makes sense.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.110
But

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.360
is there anything wrong with
me wanting to survive?

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.830
Don't you two want to survive?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.040
Of course we do.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.250
Yong'er.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.390
I don't think you're wrong.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.560
It's this darn situation that's wrong.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.430
If possible,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.720
I hope you, me,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.430
the three of us

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.000
can all make it to the end.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.120
Then we

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.030
can have hotpot together

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.159
and play a few rounds of
"Fight the Landlord."

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.420
It would be so much fun.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.930
Stop with your act.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.480
If the roles were reversed,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.530
I believe your choices

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.180
wouldn't be any different from mine.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.840
But the difference is huge.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.390
If Wanyin had been as ruthless

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.120
as you were when you framed her,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.240
you wouldn't even be alive now.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.510
Come on, bro.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.420
Are you determined to sabotage our plan?

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.210
That's not the case at all.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.620
Actually, Yong'er

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.290
is not as cruel as he imagined.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.170
Right, Yong'er?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.810
Come on, get up. It's cold on the floor.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.010
What are you doing?

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.890
I don't think

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.750
there's anything more
to talk about with her.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.280
Let's go.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.480
Why were you constantly
undermining my efforts just now?

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.870
Xie Yong'er is emotionally vulnerable
right now.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.200
I was trying to turn her.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.830
I know.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.690
I was working with you.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.600
What kind of "working with me" is that?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.430
I intimidate,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.480
you entice.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.070
She cheated on me, all right?

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.480
Even if I was just putting on a show
for the Empress Dowager,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.210
it's reasonable for me to be
a little harsh on her.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.490
Xie Yong'er is a real villain.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.580
Forget about turning her.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.360
Do people who've made mistakes

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.800
not deserve a fresh start?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.140
She probably didn't intend to
harm me today.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.000
It was just a stress response to
the Empress Dowager.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.360
I just happened to
have a higher ground than her,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.120
and I met you,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.500
which allowed me to seize the initiative

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.670
and even appear justified
in everything I did.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.090
Everything I did was just
to protect myself.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.870
The only reason I wanted her to survive

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.870
was because I'm worried
the story would get cut short.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.160
So essentially, I'm not really
any different from her, am I?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.940
You are.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.390
Have you never thought

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.800
that keeping someone alive

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.400
can be done in many ways?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.560
Chop off her legs,

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.650
imprison her for life—

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.060
so long as she doesn't die,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.070
the goal

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.520
is still achieved, isn't it?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.080
You can't even think of that,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.220
and you dare call yourself a villain?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.890
If it were Xie Yong'er,
she'd definitely think of it.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.179
She's just a 2D character.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320
She's as wicked

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.100
as the plot requires her to be.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.480
You...

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.760
What's wrong?

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.440
Nothing.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.320
Wanyin, you left in a hurry.
Did you eat enough?

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:01.910
I'm okay.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.030
I'll just ask the servants

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.830
to heat up something
for a late-night snack later.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.540
That's thoughtful of you.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.120
Dealing with the Empress Dowager,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.550
guarding against the Yan State envoys,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.750
and still remembering to bring me food.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.030
No way.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.190
Getting moved so easily,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.480
"great villain"?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.460
All right, I'll stop teasing you.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.950
Eat up, or I'll have brought it
for nothing.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:59.600
By the way,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.360
what kind of person were you before?

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.390
Just an ordinary guy.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.640
No real skills, no connections,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.150
and... Okay-looking, I guess.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.010
So modest, huh?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.250
What about you?

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.240
Me?

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.970
I was also ordinary.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.910
Working nine to five every day,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.840
serving one client after another.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.270
When it got busy,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.400
I didn't even have time to wash my hair—

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.930
completely different from how I look now.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.350
No need to put yourself down.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.260
You must have been good-looking as well.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.080
Are you alright?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.730
I'm fine.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:06.910
Well,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.960
I'll head back to the palace first.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.760
Aren't we still putting on that whole
"chasing-your-wife-after-screwing-up" act?

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.640
Get some rest early.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.600
As soon as the banquet ended,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.080
His Majesty immediately
went to Consort Xie's place

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.390
and tightened the security
around her chambers.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.450
From what I can see,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.240
His Majesty is quite attentive to her.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.840
It doesn't look like he was
the one behind this.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.130
Then this

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.270
really is suspicious.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.240
Could it be

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.510
that I overthought it?

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.150
You may leave now.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.510
Yes.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.880
Your Majesty.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.440
His Majesty has always kept out of
state affairs.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.480
Why is it that this time, he repeatedly

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.670
stepped in to smooth things over
for the envoy delegation?

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.240
We

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.600
truly cannot make sense of it.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.790
It seems His Majesty's wings
have grown stronger

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.920
and he's begun to form ideas of his own.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.660
If the peace talks succeed

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:30.750
and the borders are secured,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.790
Prince Duan's power

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.120
will swell completely,

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.530
and we'll be left on the back foot.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.010
So what do you suggest?

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.700
His Highness Crown Prince

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.870
is wise and benevolent,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.360
and he carries the bearing of
a wise ruler.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.240
These Yan people can't even

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.960
manage a proper sentence
in the official tongue.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.750
Walking around the capital,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.390
frictions with the Xia people
are bound to happen.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.960
A bunch of barbarians—

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.910
one wrong word

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.910
and they might start throwing punches.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.960
Blades have no eyes.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.610
Before you know it,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.030
there could be bloodshed.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.830
I'll see to it right away.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.280
Your Majesty.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.000
Killing envoys during a conflict
between two states

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.730
could very well spark a new war.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.870
That's right, Your Majesty.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.940
The safety of our state

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.320
is something we officials
cannot afford not to consider.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.000
What's there to worry about?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.670
Even if the Central Army is defeated,

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.200
we can still deploy
the Left and Right Armies.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.270
Then we can just sit back and

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.850
watch the Yan people and Prince Duan
wear each other out.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.360
But...

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.470
Crown Prince.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.850
What's your take on this?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.270
If Grandmother believes we should fight,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.470
then we should fight.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.320
Exactly!

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.270
If the Crown Prince says
we fight,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.300
then we fight!

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.480
Thanks to you, Yang,

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.000
that I get to enjoy such fine wine today.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.480
I won't stand on ceremony then.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.940
Come on.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.480
It's rare to see you
drinking so heartily, Li.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.280
I'll join you.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.000
It's been ages since the three of us
got together.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Why are you drinking tea?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.860
Switch to wine.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.440
I'll pass.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.650
I'd like to stay alive a bit longer
to tend my fields.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.750
Don't drink alone.
Come on, let's drink together.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.680
Come on. Cheers.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.240
Yang, since you got here,

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.000
you've barely said a few words.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.000
Aren't you usually the chattiest one?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.060
Why so quiet today?

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.840
You seem to have lost weight, Yang.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.640
Has something happened?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.670
I never want to talk again
in this lifetime.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.840
You two

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.990
both got what you wished for—

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.790
you joined the Ministry of Revenue,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.120
and you get to keep studying farming.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.670
Do you know what I'm in charge of

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.070
after entering the Imperial Observatory?

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.360
Divination.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.790
Reading the stars for omens of
fortune and disaster, rise and fall.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.630
I spend my days spinning stories
for people.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.910
And you think I can just make them up?

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.510
No.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.630
If His Majesty wants this reading
to foretell misfortune,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.840
then I have to couch it
in grand, arcane phrasing—

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.240
pacing the constellations,
plumbing the mysteries of change—

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.600
so that even bad news
sounds ornate and eloquent.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.600
Is my literary talent
really meant for this?

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.250
Let them leave.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.620
Enough with the dance.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.370
You all,

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.240
get out.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.090
Get out.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.050
All of you, get out too.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.080
-Let's go then.
-Let's go.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.610
Hurry up.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.800
What kind of rubbish dance is that?

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.760
Nowhere near as good as
the dances of our Great Yan.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.320
And this wine and these dishes—

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.170
too delicate.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.980
Not satisfying at all!

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.670
Ever since we came to Great Xia,

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.080
I haven't felt at ease for a single day!

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.360
At the Grand Longevity Banquet,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.910
the Empress Dowager
was clearly targeting us.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.600
I just can't

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.320
swallow such insult!

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.360
Enough.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.330
We've long known

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.730
how insidious and cunning
the Xia people are.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.010
What's most important now

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.240
is keeping our composure

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.650
and waiting for the right moment.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.569
As long as Xiahou Dan agrees to
meet us alone,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.119
we can kill this dog of an emperor

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.020
without losing a single soldier.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.200
That old Emperor of Yan

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.069
is counting his chickens too early.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.359
Let's put in some effort

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.220
and make sure he spends his old age

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.120
thoroughly engulfed in the flames of war.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.020
Speaking of which,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.860
we pulled a switcheroo

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.620
and took
the real envoy delegation's place.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.140
Do you think

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.410
Zhaluowahan

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.510
has realized by now?

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.070
And what if he has?

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.680
He's nothing but

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.580
a toothless old wolf now.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.540
He's probably eagerly waiting for
the outcome of the peace talks.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.490
Alright.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:58.400
Come on.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.750
Cheers.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.280
Alright.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.520
It's time for the Xia people

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.000
to pay the blood debt they owe us.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.880
I, Yang Duojie,

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.680
with my ten years of diligent study
and exceptional talent,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.280
actually ended up
becoming a fortune-teller.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.050
Keep your voices down.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:16.960
Yang.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.240
Yang.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.310
Didn't His Majesty say

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.720
that, for now, he needs you to write

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.160
those mystical, mumbo-jumbo pieces
to fool people,

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.820
and he'll transfer you elsewhere
after a while?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.320
Allow me to say something
downright treasonous—

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.240
do you believe that?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.480
I do.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.760
I believe it too.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.200
Therefore,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.270
you should also have

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.270
more faith in His Majesty.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.310
His Majesty also told me

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.480
to keep compiling the land registers
from various regions,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.070
saying they would be useful someday.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.870
That counts as the Emperor's promise,
doesn't it?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.410
That's not what you said when you
first joined the Ministry of Revenue.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.130
So you don't mind
Er Lan being so socially adept

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.070
and rising through the ranks with ease
anymore?

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.600
I don't see him that way now.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.510
Then why didn't you invite Er
along today?

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.830
You're the host—
shouldn't you be the one to invite him?

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.480
But you both work in
the Ministry of Revenue.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.920
Yes, we do.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.510
I even nodded to him
when I saw him earlier.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.170
I thought he was heading here.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.640
That's on you.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.830
Besides, he's probably swamped with
work now. Able men are always busy, right?

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.290
How would he have time to come out
for our little get-together?

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.930
Well said—"able men are always busy."

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.030
You're all so steadfast.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.200
Turns out I'm the only one still wavering.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.320
Take Wang Zhao for instance.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.510
He was supposed to return
with the envoy delegation,

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.440
yet now he's been kept in Yan State.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.350
I fear the worst for him.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.030
And His Majesty, fully aware that
the Yan people came with ill intent,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.690
still lowered himself
to curry favor with them.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.110
I can't understand
what he's really thinking,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.790
and I don't know

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.350
-what he takes us for...
-Stop there!

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.440
-What's happening?
-What do you want?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.310
They're from the Yan State, right?

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.270
-You haven't paid yet. You can't leave.
-Looks like it's those Yan fellows.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.750
Speak of the devil.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.890
Six dishes, four jugs of wine—

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.440
you even gave us two coins in change.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.650
That only covers the food and drinks.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.800
You didn't pay for the songstress.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160
What songstress?

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.340
She came in and sang on her own,

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.120
and she barely sang a couple of lines

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.400
before we sent her away.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.530
Everyone knows that

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.390
Miss Miaoying is a star on our street.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.350
So many people spend a fortune
to hire her, yet can't.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.430
How is it that with you Yan folks,

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.730
she came performing for you on her own?

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.740
How much do you want?

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.680
You're quite straightforward.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.450
50 taels.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.680
They're deliberately giving us trouble.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.020
We can't pay this money.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.290
Don't forget the purpose of this trip.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.130
We can't risk the big picture
over small matters.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.440
That should be enough.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.370
It's not enough!

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.110
This isn't just a matter of money!

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.200
They... They even tried to
take advantage of me.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.310
That's pure slander!

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.920
Who tried to take advantage of you?

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.270
Him! It was him!

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.680
Me?

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.690
Yes, it was him!

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.650
Everyone, look!

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.720
He even left his handprint right here!

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.160
-You don't think this situation...
-I didn't take advantage of her!

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.440
Is going to escalate into a fight, do you?

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.830
Don't jinx it. Just stop talking.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.430
It was him!

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.720
-How could you hit her?
-Let's go.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.920
How could you do that?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.620
Stop there!

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.680
Brother, they're the ones who bullied me!

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.080
You bullied my sister

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.160
and think you can just walk away?

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.760
Beat them!

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.060
We can't kill them.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.920
But, Your Highness...

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.640
If we kill them, we'll be charged

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.440
and arrested.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.790
Something's not right.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.200
These people's fighting skills

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.750
don't seem like those of
ordinary laborers or commoners.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.480
You go first.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.880
We'll stay here and deal with them.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.310
No.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.840
We must leave together.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:30.800
Who was it?

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.820
[Zuixiang House]

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:32.700
Run!

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.120
Run!

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.330
Are you crazy?

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.530
Do you know how much
that jug of wine is worth?

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:40.510
You're the crazy one!

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.720
At this point, you still care about money?

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.000
Stop arguing, you two.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.840
They clearly came prepared.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.000
Who knows
if they're the Empress Dowager's people.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.030
Here's what we'll do. Yang,

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.270
hurry into the palace
and report this to His Majesty.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.480
Li, let's follow them

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.880
and see if we can help.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.560
Follow them? I just hit them.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.510
They don't know it was you.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.680
Besides,

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.960
the envoy delegation's safety
is crucial to stopping the war.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.820
Let's split up.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.750
You're right.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.240
Yang!

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.210
This way.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.990
Do we have to sneak around like thieves?

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.070
Stop!

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.060
Stop there!

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.270
Block them!

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:26.440
There's a path behind the wall.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.400
Climb over!

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:27.850
Okay.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.410
Let's go!

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.130
Stop! Don't run!

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.800
Get down here!

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.110
Easy!

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.110
Behave yourself!

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:51.130
Move!

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.880
Thank you for the timely report, Mr. Li.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.210
We'll take these criminals back
for thorough questioning.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.030
Those Yan State envoys

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.190
should have left safely.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.710
They actually dared carry out

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.750
such bandit-like attacks
in broad daylight.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.240
It seems

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.750
the Empress Dowager is really going to
show her real colors.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.480
The crisis in these peace talks

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.950
is still unresolved.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.410
Let's hope His Majesty
can make preparations soon.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.440
Where's Hawugu?

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.110
Those people who came to kill us

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.510
must have been sent by
the Empress Dowager.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.570
That woman targeted me
back in the main hall.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.720
I suppose she couldn't think of
any other tricks.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.830
Those soldiers arrived pretty fast though.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.680
It was probably the person
who threw the jug

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.200
who notified the soldiers.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.860
Could it be the Emperor's men?

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.140
Not likely.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.480
I don't think

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.540
they're with the same group as

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.870
the ones who told us to
climb over the wall.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.070
So there's internal conflict in Great Xia
as well.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.080
Let's go.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.700
I left right after giving the signal.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.160
As Your Highness instructed,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.160
I didn't show my face in front of
the envoy delegation.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.440
Did you discover anything else?

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.040
That Haqina in their group

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.160
doesn't seem to be the real leader.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.270
During the fight,

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.850
I heard him call that burly attendant
"Your Highness."

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.820
I also found that bearded man
very suspicious.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.640
He seemed to be deliberately disguised,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.030
and he kept reminding those around him

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.510
not to provoke conflicts.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.370
I remember now.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.930
There was indeed such a person.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.200
At the Grand Longevity Banquet,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.850
you said he was a master fighter,
right, Mr. Bei?

00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:59.650
That's right.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.640
That man's internal force
is extremely profound,

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.100
far superior to Haqina's.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.050
So here's the question:

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.810
why would a master fighter

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.350
disguise himself as an attendant?

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.830
Those Yan people

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
have probably never

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.730
been truly seen by
our Great Xia's people before.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.610
There's supposed to be no need for them
to hide their faces.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.080
Since he's in disguise,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.690
he must be someone familiar to us.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.400
The occasion where our people
would recognize his face...

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.920
Could it be...

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.960
The battlefield?

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.310
With his skills,

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.010
he could indeed live up to the title of
top fighter of the Yan State.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.200
He's Tu'er!

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.190
[Prince Tu'er]

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.630
With the beard, they do look

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.680
about 70% to 80% similar.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.400
But it's long been rumored that

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.350
Tu'er and the old Emperor of Yan
are at odds.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.880
So how could he have been sent
as part of the envoy delegation?

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.680
Could it be...

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.030
The envoy delegation is fake.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:54.960
No wonder!

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.480
No wonder Wang Zhao
didn't come back with them.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.280
Your Majesty,

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.030
they must be carrying many schemes
on this visit.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.290
Please be extra cautious, Your Majesty.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.390
I understand.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.400
Here's what we'll do.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:09.930
Mr. Yang.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:10.680
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.310
Send the Ministry of Rites to
the envoy delegation's inn to apologize.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.590
The more ceremonious the display,
the better.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.250
Apologize?

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.920
But shouldn't we...

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.500
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.000
Dan.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.510
Those Yan people have not come
with good intentions.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.570
You should make preparations early.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.460
If we want peace talks,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.270
we have to take risks.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.880
Besides, in a way,

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.160
Tu'er and I should have met long ago.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.380
Then should we

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.520
tell Wanyin about this matter?

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.000
No.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.210
The matter with Xie Yong'er

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.240
is already troubling her enough.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.440
I don't want to add more pressure on her.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.110
saying it's compensation
to our envoy delegation

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.970
for what happened during the day.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.040
All they know

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.720
is how to apologize.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.550
I noticed there are more guards
on duty today.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.440
It's said they were specially reinforced

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.920
to prevent the criminals
from striking again—

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.120
to protect us.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.810
Whether they're trying to protect us

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.570
or keep an eye on us

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.510
is hard to say.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.530
You know, years ago,

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.680
when the Emperor of Yan
fought against our country,

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.600
he didn't just get shot in one eye—

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.510
he was actually hit in another part
of his body as well.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.850
That's why he has no children of his own

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.050
and only has Tu'er as his nephew.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.120
Zhaluowahan may not have been
especially close to Tu'er,

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.480
but he dutifully taught him
how to ride and hunt.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.740
Who would have thought

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.800
those two had such affection
as uncle and nephew?

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.920
In the blink of an eye,
Tu'er grew into a valiant young man,

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.550
surpassing the Emperor of Yan
in riding and archery,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.880
and the number of subjects supporting him
gradually increased.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.530
As Tu'er became the Yan State's
top fighter,

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.310
calls for the old Emperor of Yan
to abdicate

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.840
and give the throne to Tu'er

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.680
grew louder by the day.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.380
Truly, raising a nephew
turned out to be the uncle's hardship.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.750
Beautiful Lady Shanyi
was originally Tu'er's lover,

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.750
but was sent to Great Xia
as a gift by the Emperor of Yan.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.000
She later died in the palace
after a failed assassination attempt.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.750
However, afterward, the Yan people

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.680
not only denied the assassination attempt,

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.940
but even accused Great Xia of killing her

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.000
and used this as an excuse
to wage war against us.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:36.300
So Tu'er must hate the Emperor to death.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.270
This time,

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.460
could he be trying to imitate Jing Ke,

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.240
changing his name and disguising himself
to infiltrate the envoy delegation?

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.960
Risking his life seems unnecessary.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.160
The Emperor is already in a weak position,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.060
and the expert by his side is dead.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.620
And this time, Tu'er has brought
a whole group of Jing Kes with him.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.740
Your Highness,

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.680
do you think we should

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.160
reveal something to the Emperor?

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.550
I didn't expect that you, Mr. Cao,

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.810
would be so concerned about the Emperor.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.940
I'm thinking entirely of
Your Highness's interests.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.180
If Tu'er really kills the Emperor,

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.880
war will break out
between our states again.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.720
By then,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.080
we won't have resources
to deal with the Empress Dowager.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.530
I was thinking the same thing earlier.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.080
But then I realized something.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.210
Since the person coming is Tu'er,

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.850
with his skills,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.960
when carrying out the assassin
like Jing Ke,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.560
accidentally killing
the Empress Dowager too

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.820
shouldn't be difficult, right?

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.790
With no one at the helm,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.820
formidable enemies outside,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.680
and the Crown Prince still young,

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.640
someone would have to serve as regent
to manage state affairs.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:51.710
As for the war,

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.760
since we're all aware of it now,

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.380
we can prepare in advance,

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.350
so we won't be caught off guard

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.590
by the Yan State's surprise attack.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.320
Therefore, we need not inform the Emperor.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.160
When necessary,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.990
we can even lend Tu'er a helping hand.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.860
[Ten years ago] [Emperor of Yan]

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.200
[Ten years ago]

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.800
Your Majesty, this is Tu'er.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:35.550
Un... Un...

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.380
Uncle.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.240
Does it hurt?

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:49.630
No, it doesn't.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.650
What's this?

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.670
It's a Camel Bell flower.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.130
It's really pretty.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.190
Shanyi!

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.210
Is it pretty?

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.840
Yes, it is.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.920
I'm about to leave for the Great Xia.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.660
Has our Yan State run out of men

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.130
that we have to send a woman
as an envoy?

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.350
Because I'm the holy maiden

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.880
chosen by the people of Yan.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.980
Naturally, I must go and dance for them.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.110
This is a dagger I made myself.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.210
Take it for protection.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.330
It's really pretty.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.600
Even engraved with Camel Bell flowers.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.020
I wanted to go with you,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.570
but Uncle insists I stay
to handle state affairs.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.510
Please be extra careful on your journey.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.250
Don't worry.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.510
I'm going for peace talks, not war.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.340
There won't be any danger.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.090
Shanyi, hurry up!
We're all waiting for you.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:23.610
Coming!

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.170
Tu'er.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.000
Wait for me to come back.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.600
I have something to tell you.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.239
Uncle.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.230
Why hasn't Shanyi returned?

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.850
She's the holy maiden.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.810
She should have returned with
the envoy delegation.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.070
Uncle.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.910
What happened to Shanyi?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.280
That Emperor of the Great Xia...

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.250
He was impressed by Shanyi's dancing

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.000
and actually tried to
take advantage of her

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.600
right there in the main hall!

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.880
Shanyi

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.650
refused to be humiliated

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.150
and fought back fiercely,

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.510
but that Emperor...

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.290
He actually killed Shanyi!

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.940
Zhang San's Diary.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.850
[Rockery]

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.870
[1-3 AM]

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.840
[Rockery]

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.400
It's her.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.430
She's here.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.030
[1-3 AM]
