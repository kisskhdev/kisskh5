WEBVTT

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.777
Maybe it's because I'm human now,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.155
but my heart keeps racing
for no reason whenever I look at you.

00:00:50.252 --> 00:00:53.575
I guess this is what
humans call romantic feelings.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:54.660
What?

00:00:56.328 --> 00:00:57.329
Si-yeol,

00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.498
I think

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.000
I need to date you.

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:10.676
Wait, hold on.

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.845
Do you even know
what you're saying right now?

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.557
Well, you're not bad-looking,

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:20.894
and I'm not embarrassed
to be seen with you.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:23.480
- By the way, which Kang clan are you from?
- What?

00:01:23.563 --> 00:01:26.566
Don't you know your clan branch
and generation?

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:30.237
You are from a noble lineage, right?

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.906
Did any of your ancestors
hold an official post?

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:36.284
Seriously, what are you talking about?

00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:37.577
As I told you before,

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:39.996
I've tried everything
that looked even remotely fun

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.082
while living in the human world.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:44.292
Except for one thing.

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:46.795
- And you're saying that's--
- Yes, dating.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:51.174
I avoided dating, just in case
it made me want to become human.

00:01:51.258 --> 00:01:55.011
So I've gone out of my way
to avoid men all these years.

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:58.056
But I don't need to do that now.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.560
I might as well try dating you
since I'm already human

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.353
until I turn back to normal.

00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:04.938
So, Si-yeol.

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:06.732
Go out with me.

00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:12.487
Are you making a move on me right now?

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.197
No, this is an order.

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:17.367
Cooperate if you want to go back
to your normal life.

00:02:22.038 --> 00:02:23.415
Do you like me?

00:02:24.624 --> 00:02:25.959
Are you insane?

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.503
How dare a mere human think such a thing?

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.964
It's just that

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:34.050
you're qualified enough
and not embarrassing to be with.

00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:35.844
That's about it.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.722
Besides, it's not like
you'd dare reject me,

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.724
so there's no problem, right?

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:43.643
Why wouldn't there be a problem?

00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:46.855
No one starts a relationship like this,
not when you don't even like me.

00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:49.608
What's the big deal?

00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:53.945
It's not like all humans date
because they're madly in love.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:57.282
We'll be back to normal soon anyway,
so it's not like we'll be dating for long.

00:02:57.365 --> 00:03:01.536
Jeez, stop arguing with me
and just cooperate.

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:05.957
I'm actually pretty excited
about this new hobby.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.835
Hope we get along, honey.

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.349
EPISODE 8
THE HOBBY CALLED LOVE

00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:51.711
{\an8}What are you…

00:03:52.504 --> 00:03:53.839
{\an8}Why are you here?

00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:55.590
{\an8}What's with you?

00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:56.967
{\an8}Did you sleep well, baby?

00:03:57.634 --> 00:04:01.012
{\an8}Seriously, what's wrong with you?
It's way too early for this.

00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:03.473
{\an8}Just act normal.

00:04:10.188 --> 00:04:13.191
What do you want now?

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:15.735
Come here. Let me lie on your arm.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.697
Who told you to get up already?
Way to kill the mood.

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:25.620
My neck hurts.

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:28.540
Muscle cramp.

00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:42.387
What are you doing?

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:48.101
Fine, whatever.

00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:49.269
I give up.

00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:50.562
Here.

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:01.406
What now?

00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:06.119
Read the room.

00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:10.624
Open wide.

00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:12.626
Me?

00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:15.086
Open up.

00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:23.929
Does it taste different
when I feed it to you?

00:05:24.554 --> 00:05:27.557
It's still just a rolled omelet.
Why would it taste different?

00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:28.600
Really?

00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.520
But shouldn't it be different
when you're in a relationship?

00:05:33.563 --> 00:05:34.898
Actually, same here.

00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:37.692
Whether you feed me or not,
it tastes exactly the same.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:40.987
What am I doing wrong?

00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:44.407
That's why I'm telling you
to stop with all this.

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:47.661
Why would I stop? We just started.

00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:52.624
Should we try holding hands?

00:05:56.878 --> 00:05:58.964
Hold my hand and I'll give you some water.

00:05:59.047 --> 00:06:00.423
What?

00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:01.424
Come on.

00:06:05.762 --> 00:06:07.097
Jeez.

00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:09.808
Here, drink.

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:16.982
Seriously.

00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:18.984
Si-yeol, how about a date today?

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.111
What?

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:23.863
Let's go on a date
after we're done for the day.

00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:26.199
Isn't that what all couples do?

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.678
Give me a break.

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:49.723
Stop obsessing over this "couple" thing.

00:06:49.806 --> 00:06:51.933
What, is your hand that precious?

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.270
It's not like
it'll wear out if I touch it.

00:06:55.353 --> 00:06:57.272
It'll rot away when you're dead anyway.

00:06:58.481 --> 00:06:59.733
So,

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:02.360
what do you mean, "done for the day"?

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.114
Are we volunteering
at the nursing home again today?

00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:07.866
Yes.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:11.745
Good deeds don't show results
overnight, you know.

00:07:11.828 --> 00:07:15.123
You have to do it for at least a week
to see if it actually works.

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:20.712
Plus, there's something else
I want to look into while I'm there.

00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:23.173
Look into what?

00:07:24.382 --> 00:07:25.884
What happened yesterday.

00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:29.512
I've been trying to remember,

00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:32.766
but I have no idea who that old man is.

00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:37.687
Judging by his reaction,
he seems to have been a client of mine.

00:07:39.647 --> 00:07:44.069
But I don't get why he'd hold
such a grudge against me,

00:07:44.152 --> 00:07:47.906
which just really rubs me the wrong way.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:53.286
But how would you even find that out now?

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.124
His memory seemed pretty shot to me.

00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.627
Well, he clearly remembers something.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.171
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
reacted that way.

00:08:03.254 --> 00:08:06.174
If I go ask him,
maybe I'll get something out of him.

00:08:13.932 --> 00:08:15.600
My grandmother is unbelievable.

00:08:15.683 --> 00:08:18.311
I'm here to visit, and she leaves
to hang out somewhere else?

00:08:18.394 --> 00:08:20.730
I'm the only one who always misses her.

00:08:20.814 --> 00:08:22.440
Well, of course.

00:08:22.524 --> 00:08:24.275
She probably saw you every day.

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:28.321
Stop whining
and pull the sheet tight on your end.

00:08:28.404 --> 00:08:31.366
Jeez, the work is never-ending.

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:34.160
Why are there so many beds?

00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:35.787
We're almost done.

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:38.540
This is the last room.

00:08:38.623 --> 00:08:40.500
What? Already?

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:43.044
What's with that reaction?

00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:46.172
I told you I had to ask
that old man something.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.591
But why isn't his room here?

00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:50.176
Hey.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.970
You're right.

00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:56.766
VOLUNTEER CLEANING CHECKLIST

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.060
His name isn't even on the list.

00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.354
You there.

00:09:01.437 --> 00:09:02.772
Yes?

00:09:02.856 --> 00:09:05.775
Do you know where Mr. Hwang Dong-sik is?

00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:10.363
Mr. Hwang Dong-sik passed away last night.

00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:13.533
Pardon?

00:09:14.284 --> 00:09:15.410
He passed away.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.790
FUNERAL HALL

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.318
REST IN PEACE

00:11:15.238 --> 00:11:16.698
Please, have a seat here.

00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:17.907
Thank you.

00:11:21.327 --> 00:11:24.289
What brings you all the way here?

00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:26.040
Well…

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:29.460
We went to the nursing home earlier

00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:33.172
and heard the news about his passing.

00:11:34.424 --> 00:11:35.967
I had something to ask.

00:11:38.052 --> 00:11:40.179
- To me?
- That's right.

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:43.224
I was going to ask him directly.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.145
But since that's no longer an option,

00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:49.397
I'll just have to ask you instead.

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.150
I'm not sure…

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:53.776
Please, help yourselves.

00:11:59.407 --> 00:12:01.034
- Honey, sit here.
- Okay.

00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:10.877
So, did you know my father-in-law?

00:12:12.003 --> 00:12:13.463
I'm trying to find that out.

00:12:16.966 --> 00:12:20.053
Oh, by the way…

00:12:20.136 --> 00:12:23.181
just so you know, she grew up abroad.

00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:26.309
So she hasn't learned
how to speak formally yet.

00:12:26.392 --> 00:12:28.269
What are you talking about?

00:12:28.353 --> 00:12:30.188
Look, pick one.

00:12:30.855 --> 00:12:33.691
Either speak politely
or just play along with what I'm saying.

00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:36.110
Stop making things awkward.

00:12:36.194 --> 00:12:37.570
Play along with what?

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:42.742
Fine. Whatever.

00:12:44.494 --> 00:12:45.828
I'm actually

00:12:45.912 --> 00:12:47.789
from the City of Angels.

00:12:49.332 --> 00:12:50.792
City of Angels?

00:12:51.376 --> 00:12:52.877
It's a city in America.

00:12:54.128 --> 00:12:57.465
I think they call it Los Angeles now.

00:12:58.883 --> 00:13:02.512
Gosh, I'm not sure
where she's going with this.

00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:06.099
Why is this funeral so shabby?

00:13:06.808 --> 00:13:08.559
Didn't your family used to be well-off?

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:12.480
Wait, how would you know that?

00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:14.816
Because he was my client.

00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:16.651
Pardon?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.530
They say wealth lasts
three generations even if you go broke.

00:13:20.613 --> 00:13:22.907
Why are you living like this?

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.325
It's making me uncomfortable.

00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:26.786
Well-off? Yeah, right.

00:13:27.912 --> 00:13:29.122
When I married into his family,

00:13:29.205 --> 00:13:31.958
they were so poor that they didn't have
a matching set of anything.

00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:33.793
I wasn't lying about our wealth.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.711
I'm serious.

00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:37.422
When I was a kid,

00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:41.050
we had a chauffeur and lived
in a two-story house with a yard.

00:13:41.134 --> 00:13:43.636
Sure. Whatever you say.

00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:46.848
I wonder what happened to all that wealth.

00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.100
I'd sure love to see it for myself.

00:13:49.183 --> 00:13:50.935
Well, my father…

00:13:51.477 --> 00:13:53.980
Forget it. What's the point anyway?

00:13:57.692 --> 00:13:59.819
Don't just stop all of a sudden.

00:13:59.902 --> 00:14:01.988
Go on. I'm curious.

00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:04.282
Tell me about your father.

00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:08.119
You want us to sell you our new drug?

00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:10.121
{\an8}THIRTY YEARS AGO
WORLD PHARMACEUTICAL

00:14:10.204 --> 00:14:11.080
{\an8}I'm sorry, I can't.

00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:15.710
Even if you doubled your previous offer,
I would never--

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.503
Ten times.

00:14:19.172 --> 00:14:20.423
Excuse me?

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:21.591
Not double.

00:14:23.384 --> 00:14:24.510
I'm offering ten times more.

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:28.473
Think it over carefully, Mr. Hwang.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:33.603
When it comes to new drugs,

00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:36.647
they're worthless
if they fail the clinical trials.

00:14:39.734 --> 00:14:40.943
Isn't it better…

00:14:42.987 --> 00:14:48.326
for you to take this money
and walk away, Mr. Hwang?

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:51.329
Doesn't your company lack the funds

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:53.831
to get through
Phase 3 of US clinical trials?

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:58.085
Sell that drug to me.

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:04.258
What a waste!

00:15:04.884 --> 00:15:07.178
He should've sold it back then.

00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:08.596
What do you mean?

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:11.390
I mean, he held on to that drug
instead of selling it

00:15:11.474 --> 00:15:13.184
and ended up failing, didn't he?

00:15:13.267 --> 00:15:15.937
That has to be
why our family ended up like this.

00:15:16.562 --> 00:15:18.272
He sold it for ten times the price.

00:15:19.357 --> 00:15:20.983
How much was it again?

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:23.444
Well, in today's money,

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.031
it was enough
to buy a building in Gangnam.

00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:28.533
Really?

00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:30.826
Then where did all that money go?

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:32.620
He lost it all.

00:15:33.246 --> 00:15:34.664
All of it?

00:15:34.747 --> 00:15:39.043
Was he scammed or something?
Or did he gamble it away?

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:41.337
No, it wasn't anything like that.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.259
Apparently, those clinical trials ended up
being a huge success a few years later.

00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:48.636
But that was the problem.

00:15:49.262 --> 00:15:50.888
Why was that…

00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:52.765
My mother said…

00:15:54.767 --> 00:15:58.020
that my father became a bit strange.

00:15:59.188 --> 00:16:00.439
Like a man possessed.

00:16:00.523 --> 00:16:05.278
He wanted to make a new drug
that was even better than the one he sold.

00:16:05.903 --> 00:16:09.115
He poured money into a hopeless project

00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:10.992
and got into debt.

00:16:11.075 --> 00:16:13.244
He lost both the company and the house.

00:16:14.161 --> 00:16:16.831
But his entire life,
he'd never talk about it.

00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:19.500
I don't know the full story myself,

00:16:20.042 --> 00:16:25.381
but selling that drug like that
must've haunted him for life.

00:16:28.718 --> 00:16:31.095
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:34.890
Sir, as the chief mourner,
you need to select a coffin.

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:36.726
Here are the different types--

00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:41.022
We'll take the cheapest one, please.

00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:44.483
- Our finances are a bit tight.
- I understand.

00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:53.367
So,

00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:55.786
did anything come to mind?

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.038
Yes.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.874
That old man wasn't my client.

00:17:00.374 --> 00:17:01.500
Really?

00:17:02.168 --> 00:17:04.587
Actually, hearing the story,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.298
it didn't sound like his life
went south because of you.

00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:08.341
No.

00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.760
It was because of me.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.511
What?

00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:17.183
Si-yeol, go to that ATM
and withdraw some cash.

00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:19.560
Let's leave some condolence money.

00:17:19.644 --> 00:17:21.062
Sure.

00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:23.439
How much?

00:17:24.774 --> 00:17:26.525
We don't have much money left.

00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:28.653
Would 50,000 won be enough?

00:17:29.445 --> 00:17:31.906
Don't be cheap. Take everything out.

00:17:31.989 --> 00:17:33.741
You said it's not even that much anyway.

00:17:33.824 --> 00:17:36.952
Then what are we going to live on?

00:17:37.036 --> 00:17:39.705
It makes no difference. Just give it.

00:17:41.207 --> 00:17:44.669
You seem to have no idea
how scary being broke can be.

00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:48.339
How can anyone live without a single…

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:54.136
Okay, whatever.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.638
We'll figure it out somehow.

00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:58.349
And if possible…

00:18:01.602 --> 00:18:04.021
tell them to use that money
to get the best coffin.

00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:23.541
Sis!

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.127
What did you just do?

00:18:27.128 --> 00:18:28.295
What do you mean?

00:18:28.379 --> 00:18:30.047
I was just standing here.

00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.925
Why are you making such a fuss?

00:18:33.008 --> 00:18:35.845
I just gained spiritual power.

00:18:37.138 --> 00:18:38.013
What?

00:18:38.097 --> 00:18:42.184
It was a tiny, microscopic,
practically invisible amount,

00:18:42.268 --> 00:18:45.771
but I thought I should tell you
since it was still a gain.

00:18:45.855 --> 00:18:48.649
You tried doing good deeds for days,

00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:51.694
but no power was building up,
so I thought I was being scammed.

00:18:51.777 --> 00:18:53.654
You gained spiritual power?

00:18:54.155 --> 00:18:55.448
Just now?

00:18:56.782 --> 00:18:57.950
Hey.

00:18:58.033 --> 00:18:59.243
When did you get here?

00:19:00.703 --> 00:19:02.621
I just gave them the condolence money.

00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:07.126
It took a while
because they were refusing to take it.

00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:11.756
Anyway, what's going on?

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:13.090
Si-yeol.

00:19:13.716 --> 00:19:15.092
I think I finally know

00:19:16.719 --> 00:19:18.262
what we have to do.

00:19:34.153 --> 00:19:35.988
This place is incredibly fancy.

00:19:36.614 --> 00:19:40.034
He must've made a fortune.

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:44.079
Hey, what are you doing?

00:19:45.372 --> 00:19:46.749
Can't you tell?

00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:47.792
I'm looking around.

00:20:01.138 --> 00:20:03.015
You know, back in the day,

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:06.143
this place used to sell things
like ointments and stomach medicine.

00:20:06.227 --> 00:20:07.686
It was just a local pharmacy.

00:20:08.771 --> 00:20:11.148
Over time,
it became a pharmaceutical company

00:20:12.107 --> 00:20:13.734
and made quite a bit of money.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.071
Enough for the owner's son
to become my client.

00:20:17.822 --> 00:20:18.989
But that should've been it.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.576
That was the limit of the wealth and fame

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.703
this family could ever enjoy.

00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:29.917
Do you know how this company
became such a world-renowned corporation?

00:20:30.876 --> 00:20:33.170
Not all new drugs are the same.

00:20:33.254 --> 00:20:35.923
Some drugs are
more profitable than others.

00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:39.218
Like treatments for obesity or hair loss.

00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:41.178
Just imagine if someone developed those.

00:20:41.804 --> 00:20:44.056
So, what are you getting at?

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.185
Are you asking me to just whip up
a miracle drug for you?

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:51.981
- Do you really think that's possible?
- No, that's not it at all.

00:21:00.531 --> 00:21:02.950
Please, just take a look at this.

00:21:05.244 --> 00:21:06.328
What's this?

00:21:06.412 --> 00:21:07.288
NEW DRUGS

00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:08.747
Once this passes clinical trials,

00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:11.250
it will rake in
all the money in the world.

00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:14.920
It's a paper on a blockbuster new drug.

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.966
But the thing is,

00:21:20.718 --> 00:21:23.804
our company wasn't the one

00:21:24.513 --> 00:21:26.056
that developed it.

00:21:27.016 --> 00:21:29.435
Forget all the complicated details.

00:21:29.977 --> 00:21:32.479
Just tell me what your wish is.

00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:38.277
I need to know if the clinical trials
for this drug will succeed or fail.

00:21:38.903 --> 00:21:40.654
I need to know for sure.

00:21:41.906 --> 00:21:47.411
So this chairman already knew
the new drug would be a success,

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.748
and Mr. Hwang Dong-sik sold it
without having any idea.

00:21:51.624 --> 00:21:52.833
Excuse me.

00:21:53.542 --> 00:21:54.835
How can I help you?

00:21:55.502 --> 00:21:57.129
I'm here to see the chairman.

00:21:58.297 --> 00:22:00.341
- Pardon?
- What are you doing?

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:02.009
Right.

00:22:03.218 --> 00:22:05.554
Now, look me straight in the eye.

00:22:08.933 --> 00:22:11.268
Where is the chairman right now?

00:22:13.479 --> 00:22:15.564
- Nice shot!
- Great shot!

00:22:15.648 --> 00:22:17.524
That was a powerful swing.

00:22:39.129 --> 00:22:41.298
What's with the weather all of a sudden?

00:22:42.257 --> 00:22:43.342
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:45.469
Who are you?

00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:48.013
Hey, stop!

00:22:49.306 --> 00:22:51.850
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:54.103
Stop this cart right now!

00:23:11.954 --> 00:23:13.122
The nine-tailed fox?

00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:17.418
What on earth is going on here?

00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:19.253
Welcome, Chairman Kim.

00:23:20.129 --> 00:23:21.296
Sit.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.549
I'm here because I have business with you.

00:23:29.805 --> 00:23:31.724
Hwang Dong-sik is dead.

00:23:32.391 --> 00:23:33.726
Hwang Dong-sik?

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:35.144
Don't you remember him?

00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:38.105
You made a wish to me 30 years ago.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.817
Oh, him.

00:23:42.443 --> 00:23:44.945
You're not complete strangers.
At least go and pay your respects.

00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:47.448
You don't have much time left
on this earth either.

00:23:47.531 --> 00:23:49.366
Doing a good deed wouldn't hurt.

00:23:51.493 --> 00:23:52.828
Okay, I understand.

00:23:53.954 --> 00:23:55.622
How much should I give?

00:23:58.292 --> 00:24:00.961
I think something
other than money would be better.

00:24:01.045 --> 00:24:02.004
Something else?

00:24:02.629 --> 00:24:03.547
A building.

00:24:04.214 --> 00:24:06.884
I saw your company's building earlier.

00:24:06.967 --> 00:24:09.803
It's quite fancy and looks pretty nice.

00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:12.222
You don't mean

00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:15.684
our corporate headquarters, do you?

00:24:16.935 --> 00:24:19.021
You want me to give that
instead of condolence money?

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:21.857
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:27.654
Technically, your company only grew
big enough to build that building

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.615
because of Hwang Dong-sik,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.451
the old man you stole that drug from.

00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:34.161
Stole?

00:24:34.244 --> 00:24:35.579
I paid

00:24:36.497 --> 00:24:39.833
a fair price for that drug, didn't I?

00:24:41.043 --> 00:24:44.379
Come on. Let's be honest, Chairman Kim.

00:24:45.047 --> 00:24:48.842
He wouldn't sell at any price,
but I made it happen for you,

00:24:49.384 --> 00:24:50.469
didn't I?

00:24:51.261 --> 00:24:52.638
Hey.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:56.767
Stop being so stubborn

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.436
and just sell the drug or whatever.

00:25:04.233 --> 00:25:06.276
If it happens to fail,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.695
it will completely ruin you.

00:25:09.404 --> 00:25:10.531
Doesn't it make you anxious?

00:25:12.282 --> 00:25:16.245
You're enjoying the success
that old man should've had.

00:25:16.328 --> 00:25:18.038
Don't you think it's a fair amount?

00:25:18.122 --> 00:25:19.498
Except

00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:24.503
I already paid you a high enough price
when I made my wish.

00:25:24.586 --> 00:25:26.672
How can you do this to me now?

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:29.633
Chairman Kim.

00:25:30.134 --> 00:25:33.345
Since we've maintained
a good relationship for such a long time,

00:25:33.971 --> 00:25:36.223
you must've forgotten

00:25:36.306 --> 00:25:38.350
exactly who I am

00:25:38.892 --> 00:25:41.979
and how easily I can ruin your life.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.530
Does it look like I'm here to negotiate?

00:25:59.246 --> 00:26:04.418
So, fixing the misdeeds
you committed in the past

00:26:05.043 --> 00:26:06.795
is the will of Heaven?

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:09.965
What you just did was also part of that?

00:26:10.048 --> 00:26:11.216
That's right.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.926
I saved kids' lives

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.096
and did endless community service,
but I didn't gain any spiritual power.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.891
But yesterday, we gave that old man
every penny we had,

00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:21.101
and we got an immediate response.

00:26:21.185 --> 00:26:22.561
What else could that mean?

00:26:22.644 --> 00:26:25.856
- We didn't even give him much, though.
- The amount doesn't matter.

00:26:25.939 --> 00:26:29.818
What matters is
that I gave him everything we had.

00:26:31.153 --> 00:26:32.654
But do you think that old man

00:26:32.738 --> 00:26:37.034
will really hand over a building
just because you said so?

00:26:37.117 --> 00:26:38.035
Of course.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.662
As long as he doesn't find out
I've become human,

00:26:40.746 --> 00:26:42.789
he can never disobey me.

00:26:43.957 --> 00:26:45.918
I've tamed him well.

00:26:48.003 --> 00:26:49.671
I'm sure you have.

00:26:50.464 --> 00:26:51.632
Anyway,

00:26:52.132 --> 00:26:54.009
let's just wait and see what happens.

00:26:55.385 --> 00:26:58.931
In the meantime,
can we go to the buffet again?

00:27:05.687 --> 00:27:07.356
The thing is,

00:27:07.898 --> 00:27:10.442
I'm completely broke right now.

00:27:10.525 --> 00:27:13.570
Can't we just ask that old man
for some money?

00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:17.699
You already took his building,
so that should be nothing, right?

00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:20.244
You really think that'd work?

00:27:20.327 --> 00:27:23.330
I'm trying to do good deeds
so you can become human,

00:27:23.413 --> 00:27:26.458
but you want me to shake down
a human for personal gain?

00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:28.001
I guess you're right.

00:27:29.044 --> 00:27:31.922
I'll take you to the buffet
once I make some money.

00:27:32.005 --> 00:27:33.173
Okay.

00:27:33.257 --> 00:27:35.550
In fact, I was just about to make some.

00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:39.596
Make money? You?

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.806
How?

00:27:41.306 --> 00:27:42.224
You said it yourself.

00:27:42.307 --> 00:27:44.935
All I know is soccer,
and I don't have any other skills.

00:27:46.228 --> 00:27:48.939
So, that's how I'm going to make money.

00:27:54.486 --> 00:27:58.073
Hey, how badly do you think
we'll lose today?

00:27:58.156 --> 00:28:00.617
I don't know, maybe 4-0?

00:28:01.243 --> 00:28:03.036
If we're lucky, we might lose 3-0.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.122
Man, what's wrong with you guys?

00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:06.623
We could tie.

00:28:06.707 --> 00:28:08.709
Stop talking nonsense.

00:28:09.293 --> 00:28:11.086
How can we tie
against a second-division team?

00:28:11.169 --> 00:28:13.463
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Seriously, why did the coach

00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:16.800
schedule such a ridiculous practice match?

00:28:16.883 --> 00:28:18.677
This isn't even practice
with such a skill gap.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.220
Tell me about it.

00:28:20.304 --> 00:28:25.058
Getting crushed by guys like that
won't make us tougher.

00:28:25.142 --> 00:28:26.810
It'll just wear us down.

00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:28.520
Wait.

00:28:29.146 --> 00:28:30.397
Number 7 over there.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.898
Isn't that him?

00:28:32.649 --> 00:28:34.318
The former national team forward.

00:28:34.401 --> 00:28:36.028
It is him.

00:28:38.405 --> 00:28:41.074
- It's really him.
- No way!

00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:43.243
Damn it!

00:28:46.413 --> 00:28:48.165
Are you guys out of your minds?

00:28:48.248 --> 00:28:52.002
You went over to the opposing team
before the game even started,

00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:54.421
wagging your tails
like a bunch of neighborhood mutts,

00:28:54.504 --> 00:28:56.840
just to get some autographs?

00:28:56.923 --> 00:28:59.843
Coach, you're crumpling the paper.

00:29:04.431 --> 00:29:05.515
Unbelievable.

00:29:09.102 --> 00:29:10.437
Get your heads in the game.

00:29:11.313 --> 00:29:12.272
Listen up.

00:29:14.274 --> 00:29:16.068
What's our goal for this season?

00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:25.952
Damn it, it's escaping last place!

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:29.331
Every time I go to a coaches' meeting,

00:29:29.414 --> 00:29:31.583
I'm too embarrassed to even show my face!

00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:34.669
Even if we can't get to the middle
of the fourth division,

00:29:34.753 --> 00:29:37.130
we sure as hell can't finish last!

00:29:39.007 --> 00:29:40.342
I know exactly

00:29:41.051 --> 00:29:43.303
what you're all thinking.

00:29:43.387 --> 00:29:47.182
"Gosh, this practice match
is going to be tough."

00:29:47.265 --> 00:29:50.685
"Why would he match us up
against a top second-division team?"

00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:52.521
That's what you're thinking, right?

00:29:53.355 --> 00:29:54.398
Well, let me tell you.

00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:57.943
I had a reason for choosing them.

00:29:59.611 --> 00:30:00.695
All right.

00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:03.323
Our strategy for this season

00:30:04.199 --> 00:30:05.075
is defense.

00:30:06.827 --> 00:30:08.829
I'm not asking you guys to win.

00:30:09.371 --> 00:30:10.705
Then what?

00:30:12.374 --> 00:30:13.500
Just sit back.

00:30:14.126 --> 00:30:16.253
Sit and lie down, even.

00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:18.171
You don't even have to attack.

00:30:18.255 --> 00:30:22.259
If they don't score a single goal,
then there's no way we can lose.

00:30:26.596 --> 00:30:27.848
You see?

00:30:28.849 --> 00:30:31.143
You get it now, right?

00:30:31.226 --> 00:30:34.229
It doesn't matter if they're
top of the second division.

00:30:34.312 --> 00:30:36.273
Just block them!

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.697
- Block him!
- Move fast!

00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:45.615
Hurry up!

00:30:50.495 --> 00:30:51.496
Hey!

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.956
It's okay.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:55.625
Hyeon-su, get out there!

00:30:59.546 --> 00:31:01.673
Damn it, I'm losing my mind.

00:31:02.674 --> 00:31:03.717
Jeez.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.262
We've got ten guys defending,

00:31:07.345 --> 00:31:09.389
and we're still
giving up goals left and right.

00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:14.436
You guys must be feeling generous!

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:16.062
Very generous, damn it.

00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:19.441
Is this funny to you, you punk?

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.570
What?

00:31:27.407 --> 00:31:29.701
Hey, Si-yeol.

00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:37.834
KIM GYEONG-HUN

00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:38.960
What are you doing here?

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:40.879
And what's with the getup?

00:31:41.505 --> 00:31:44.341
Coach, you said I'm still
on the team roster, right?

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.719
Well, yeah.

00:31:47.802 --> 00:31:49.137
Do you want to win?

00:31:49.221 --> 00:31:50.347
What?

00:31:51.306 --> 00:31:52.307
I mean,

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.810
at this rate,
I don't know when I'll be able to return.

00:31:55.894 --> 00:31:59.022
But I need to stay in shape,
so I might as well play anywhere.

00:31:59.648 --> 00:32:01.024
So, I'll play for you.

00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:06.947
What are you even saying, you punk?

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.949
You're out of your mind.

00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:13.245
You said your wish was promotion.

00:32:14.496 --> 00:32:17.040
I'll make sure you move up

00:32:18.416 --> 00:32:19.709
to the third division.

00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:24.881
WISHING FOR DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC'S VICTORY

00:32:25.674 --> 00:32:27.842
There's nobody here.

00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:31.555
I know, right?

00:32:32.722 --> 00:32:35.475
Why are they even playing
when no one is watching?

00:32:36.142 --> 00:32:37.435
Such a waste of energy.

00:32:43.233 --> 00:32:45.694
Anyway, where is Si-yeol?

00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:51.992
- Kang Si-yeol, let's go!
- Si-yeol, you can do it!

00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:53.243
Let's go, Si-yeol!

00:32:53.326 --> 00:32:54.452
Stay focused!

00:32:54.536 --> 00:32:56.246
Si-yeol's here.

00:33:07.757 --> 00:33:10.427
- Over here.
- Why pass it now?

00:33:35.744 --> 00:33:38.288
Hey, look at the score! We're losing!

00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:39.873
Come here, let me give you a kiss!

00:33:39.956 --> 00:33:41.499
Hurry and get back in position!

00:33:41.583 --> 00:33:42.876
But didn't you say

00:33:43.543 --> 00:33:46.796
they're doing well
if they put the ball in there?

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.090
Why is Si-yeol so angry?

00:33:53.011 --> 00:33:54.763
Because he has a bad temper.

00:33:59.726 --> 00:34:02.395
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

00:34:19.496 --> 00:34:20.955
I'm sure you know

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:24.376
that your body is falling apart.

00:34:28.588 --> 00:34:29.839
When that day comes,

00:34:30.674 --> 00:34:32.550
all the spirits you've devoured

00:34:32.634 --> 00:34:37.347
will tear your soul to pieces.

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.516
They'll slash, tear, and crush you.

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:44.270
They'll chew you up and spit you out.

00:34:44.896 --> 00:34:48.692
Unable to die, yet unable to live.

00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:51.361
That's the fate that awaits you.

00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:20.432
Hey!

00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:26.855
Man, you've become
quite pathetic yourself.

00:35:28.189 --> 00:35:29.983
I'd heard you were close to death,

00:35:30.066 --> 00:35:32.610
but look at you,
coughing up blood and collapsing.

00:35:37.282 --> 00:35:39.617
This hospital belongs to our foundation.

00:35:39.701 --> 00:35:42.036
I told them to look out for you
just in case,

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.455
and they notified me right away.

00:35:43.538 --> 00:35:45.874
I've been looking for you,

00:35:45.957 --> 00:35:48.877
but I had no way of contacting you.

00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:50.920
Why were you looking for me?

00:35:52.547 --> 00:35:54.466
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.221
That's it.

00:36:01.014 --> 00:36:04.225
What on earth is happening right now?

00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:05.560
I don't know.

00:36:06.102 --> 00:36:08.104
Is this score for real?

00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:10.815
How many minutes has it been
since Si-yeol went in?

00:36:10.899 --> 00:36:12.859
It's been about 13 minutes.

00:36:12.942 --> 00:36:15.028
Gosh, that hat trick.

00:36:15.111 --> 00:36:16.905
He's totally insane!

00:36:28.666 --> 00:36:30.376
- Nice.
- Yes!

00:36:31.002 --> 00:36:32.921
Hey! What are you guys doing?

00:36:33.004 --> 00:36:35.215
Aren't you going to block Number 10?

00:36:35.298 --> 00:36:37.300
That guy's going to lose his voice soon.

00:36:40.094 --> 00:36:41.137
Hey, Ref!

00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:42.847
That's a foul.

00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:46.142
Are you blind? Watch the damn game!

00:36:51.105 --> 00:36:52.774
Ref!

00:36:52.857 --> 00:36:55.735
You, Ref! Do your job!

00:36:58.696 --> 00:37:01.199
I've got the whole defense on me.

00:37:01.282 --> 00:37:03.243
How are those idiots not scoring?

00:37:04.369 --> 00:37:05.870
Unbelievable.

00:37:05.954 --> 00:37:08.081
I haven't even run that much.

00:37:08.164 --> 00:37:10.917
How out of shape am I?
I'm already worn out.

00:37:11.501 --> 00:37:13.332
Si-yeol!

00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:23.805
Damn it!

00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:28.518
I can't keep going like this.

00:37:31.938 --> 00:37:33.147
Hey, Si-yeol!

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.484
Get a grip. You're losing!

00:37:36.568 --> 00:37:40.113
Man, that temper of hers.

00:37:40.196 --> 00:37:42.365
I'll never hear the end of it if we lose.

00:37:50.248 --> 00:37:54.294
- How much time do we have left?
- They gave three minutes of added time.

00:37:54.377 --> 00:37:57.130
I think this is the last chance to score.

00:37:57.213 --> 00:37:58.506
Really?

00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.716
Damn it.

00:38:00.425 --> 00:38:04.095
All I'm asking for is just one more goal.

00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:14.939
That was a total foul!

00:38:15.023 --> 00:38:17.066
- Penalty kick!
- Penalty kick!

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.193
That's a penalty. You have to call it.

00:38:19.277 --> 00:38:20.987
Ref!

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.949
- Yes!
- We got a penalty kick!

00:38:25.033 --> 00:38:26.326
Penalty kick!

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.710
KANG SI-YEOL

00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:43.927
Stay calm. Don't cheer. Don't get nervous.

00:38:44.552 --> 00:38:46.679
Here he goes. Please…

00:38:52.769 --> 00:38:54.187
Kang Si-yeol!

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.126
That's our Kang Si-yeol!

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.880
I knew you could do it!
Why didn't you play like this before?

00:39:22.507 --> 00:39:24.050
Don't.

00:39:25.468 --> 00:39:26.928
What's with the mood in here?

00:39:27.679 --> 00:39:29.097
Coach, hold on a second.

00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:32.308
Seo Beom, what the hell was that earlier?

00:39:32.392 --> 00:39:33.351
Me?

00:39:33.434 --> 00:39:35.770
Who makes that pass at that moment?

00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:37.438
You should've waited.

00:39:37.522 --> 00:39:40.358
Draw the defense in first,
then make the pass!

00:39:41.609 --> 00:39:42.568
And you!

00:39:42.652 --> 00:39:43.653
Bae Jeong-bae, right?

00:39:43.736 --> 00:39:46.990
Why didn't you take the chance
to cut inside when you had it?

00:39:47.073 --> 00:39:50.243
When I drew the defense out to the side,

00:39:50.326 --> 00:39:53.246
you should've exploited the space!

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.539
Unbelievable!

00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:58.751
Did I misread the score?

00:39:58.835 --> 00:40:00.670
Did we lose?

00:40:00.753 --> 00:40:01.796
No, we tied.

00:40:02.422 --> 00:40:03.631
We did, right?

00:40:04.549 --> 00:40:06.092
Then why does it feel like we lost?

00:40:06.175 --> 00:40:09.429
Tell me about it. You'd think we lost.

00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:11.431
We didn't win!

00:40:11.973 --> 00:40:15.643
Where's the fight? Where's the hunger?

00:40:15.727 --> 00:40:17.562
You're all just slacking off.

00:40:18.187 --> 00:40:19.814
Don't you guys want to win?

00:40:20.356 --> 00:40:21.649
Are you okay with losing?

00:40:22.275 --> 00:40:23.359
Gosh.

00:40:24.027 --> 00:40:26.571
I'm going to step out for a second.

00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:29.449
Coach! Where are you going?

00:40:29.532 --> 00:40:31.034
- Well--
- You can't leave.

00:40:31.117 --> 00:40:32.285
Explain this to me, Coach.

00:40:32.368 --> 00:40:34.746
With 13 minutes left, 4-0?

00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:37.206
And how are you guys excited about this?

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.583
You!

00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:41.878
Look at the size of you.
How are you so bad at defending?

00:40:43.671 --> 00:40:46.049
Si-yeol was absolutely incredible today.

00:40:46.132 --> 00:40:47.008
Don't you think so?

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.387
Well, that's the bare minimum.

00:40:51.471 --> 00:40:53.431
He is a pro soccer player, after all.

00:40:53.514 --> 00:40:57.226
I don't know why everyone's making
such a big deal over a few goals.

00:41:01.647 --> 00:41:02.648
Bang!

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.657
Anyway, aren't you leaving?
How long are you staying?

00:41:13.326 --> 00:41:14.577
Beat it!

00:41:21.209 --> 00:41:23.127
Man, I'm really late.

00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:26.005
I'm heading out first, guys.

00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:27.590
- Good game!
- Catch you later!

00:41:32.178 --> 00:41:33.096
Hey.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.390
Did you pay Gyeong-hun back?

00:41:36.474 --> 00:41:37.850
Money? What for?

00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:41.312
You abandoned his car
on some back road in Gyeonggi Province.

00:41:41.395 --> 00:41:42.814
He said the towing fees were huge.

00:41:42.897 --> 00:41:44.107
Didn't he mention it?

00:41:44.732 --> 00:41:47.485
Oh, I didn't even think of that.

00:41:48.653 --> 00:41:49.529
I'll pay him back.

00:41:50.238 --> 00:41:52.615
Tell him to sit tight
now that I'm back on the field.

00:41:52.698 --> 00:41:54.200
I'll have the cash in no time.

00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:56.119
While we're on the subject,

00:41:56.202 --> 00:41:57.870
how much am I worth again?

00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:00.540
Why am I so broke right now?

00:42:01.749 --> 00:42:03.793
Did you just ask
what the payout is if you die?

00:42:03.876 --> 00:42:06.671
Did you take out a life insurance policy?

00:42:07.171 --> 00:42:08.589
No, my paycheck.

00:42:08.673 --> 00:42:10.758
How much do I make a week?

00:42:10.842 --> 00:42:13.094
- What?
- Weekly pay?

00:42:13.177 --> 00:42:16.472
It's the fourth division,
so it won't be much.

00:42:16.973 --> 00:42:19.058
Do I make about two or three million won?

00:42:19.142 --> 00:42:21.394
Are you crazy?

00:42:21.477 --> 00:42:24.147
Even less? One million, then?

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.065
A million won a week?

00:42:26.149 --> 00:42:29.026
Who do you think you are, a pro?

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.154
You've never earned a weekly wage.

00:42:31.237 --> 00:42:32.280
It's not a weekly wage?

00:42:33.114 --> 00:42:34.991
I guess they pay
an annual salary in Korea.

00:42:35.867 --> 00:42:38.244
I mean, it's not like
I've ever played in the K League.

00:42:38.327 --> 00:42:41.289
You're not on an annual salary.
You get paid per game.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.667
- Per game?
- Yes.

00:42:45.543 --> 00:42:48.838
It's 50,000 won per game,
and 300,000 for a win.

00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:50.464
What are you talking about?

00:42:51.382 --> 00:42:52.592
That's it?

00:42:53.968 --> 00:42:55.136
What about a base salary?

00:42:55.219 --> 00:42:58.264
There isn't any.
Our team doesn't even pay for training.

00:42:58.347 --> 00:43:01.934
Actually, compared
to other fourth-division teams,

00:43:02.018 --> 00:43:03.603
we're in pretty bad shape

00:43:04.103 --> 00:43:05.771
since we're always in last place.

00:43:07.648 --> 00:43:11.152
So you're saying
if there are four games a month,

00:43:11.235 --> 00:43:13.196
that's 350,000 won times four.

00:43:16.115 --> 00:43:18.326
Only 1.4 million won?

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.369
Your math is way off.

00:43:20.453 --> 00:43:22.663
We can't win every game.
We lose almost all of them.

00:43:23.623 --> 00:43:26.584
It's 50,000 won times four,
so it's 200,000 won.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.169
Hey.

00:43:28.252 --> 00:43:31.047
You at least get that 200,000 won
because you're a starter.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:33.090
Look at Gyeong-hun.
He's just a backup goalie.

00:43:33.174 --> 00:43:36.344
When was the last time he played?
Was it last year?

00:43:36.427 --> 00:43:37.303
Yeah.

00:43:37.386 --> 00:43:39.222
Then how much does he get paid?

00:43:39.305 --> 00:43:40.765
Nothing.

00:43:40.848 --> 00:43:43.517
He trains like crazy,
but he doesn't get paid at all.

00:43:43.601 --> 00:43:46.145
That's why he's out
doing delivery gigs day and night.

00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:48.689
Do you get it now?
You ripped off a poor kid like that.

00:43:50.566 --> 00:43:52.485
Then how do you guys survive?

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.071
You can't live on 200,000 won a month.

00:43:55.154 --> 00:43:56.697
We all have part-time jobs.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.324
Except for Jeong-bae.

00:44:00.993 --> 00:44:03.204
Forget about the sports car guy.

00:44:03.287 --> 00:44:06.916
So you guys have jobs
other than playing soccer?

00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:09.460
Then how can you focus on training?

00:44:09.543 --> 00:44:11.796
So stop giving them such a hard time.

00:44:11.879 --> 00:44:14.257
They're all just
trying their best to get by.

00:44:16.759 --> 00:44:17.718
I'm heading out.

00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:20.429
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

00:44:38.948 --> 00:44:39.865
Hey!

00:44:40.449 --> 00:44:43.077
What took you so long?
I've been waiting forever.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.203
Oh, sorry.

00:44:45.162 --> 00:44:46.539
But why are you alone?

00:44:48.791 --> 00:44:49.834
She left.

00:44:50.876 --> 00:44:52.003
I see.

00:44:55.756 --> 00:44:57.925
What's going on with you?

00:44:58.551 --> 00:44:59.510
What?

00:44:59.593 --> 00:45:04.473
I mean, you played pretty well today,
but you look so dejected.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:08.561
Did that Coach Park give you a hard time?

00:45:10.479 --> 00:45:11.647
It's not that.

00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:17.611
I've just got some stuff on my mind.

00:45:18.237 --> 00:45:19.655
And most of all,

00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:21.699
I didn't make any money.

00:45:22.783 --> 00:45:25.703
Even if it was a practice game,
I thought I'd at least get paid.

00:45:25.786 --> 00:45:27.830
So it was about money?

00:45:28.456 --> 00:45:29.332
Don't worry about it.

00:45:29.415 --> 00:45:31.751
I can just make that money myself.

00:45:31.834 --> 00:45:32.752
Besides,

00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:36.088
you looked pretty cool out there today.

00:45:39.216 --> 00:45:42.386
Right, like you're going to make money.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.264
Wait, then what do we do
about our date tonight?

00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:47.516
- What?
- Don't you remember?

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.144
We couldn't have one last night
because it was too hectic,

00:45:50.227 --> 00:45:52.438
so we agreed to go on our date tonight.

00:45:54.065 --> 00:45:56.442
Are we postponing it again?

00:45:58.069 --> 00:46:00.905
Well, we can just go some other time.

00:46:00.988 --> 00:46:02.823
What's the rush?

00:46:02.907 --> 00:46:04.784
You said it was just
a hobby for you anyway.

00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:09.914
Damn, we should've kept some cash
instead of giving it all away.

00:46:10.498 --> 00:46:12.958
Man, where can I get some money?

00:46:13.459 --> 00:46:15.503
Hey, Si-yeol!

00:46:15.586 --> 00:46:16.587
And your girlfriend!

00:46:20.257 --> 00:46:22.301
Why are you guys still here?

00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:23.594
Si-yeol.

00:46:23.677 --> 00:46:26.722
Isn't that the guy who was
driving that fancy sports car?

00:46:26.806 --> 00:46:27.807
Yeah.

00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:33.562
I heard his family owns
a famous galbi restaurant in Seoul.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:18.774
What are you staring at?

00:47:19.525 --> 00:47:21.527
- Do I look weird?
- What?

00:47:22.486 --> 00:47:24.572
No, of course not.

00:47:24.655 --> 00:47:26.115
It's just that…

00:47:29.827 --> 00:47:34.331
I guess expensive clothes
really do make you look good.

00:47:35.791 --> 00:47:36.876
Right?

00:47:36.959 --> 00:47:41.505
I need to get back to my old self
and buy this in every color.

00:47:44.341 --> 00:47:47.636
Anyway, where are we going?

00:47:48.512 --> 00:47:49.847
Do you have a plan?

00:47:50.806 --> 00:47:52.558
A plan?

00:47:55.311 --> 00:47:58.230
I just thought of something.

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:01.066
- What is it?
- Namsan.

00:48:01.734 --> 00:48:03.736
Namsan is the ultimate
date spot, after all.

00:48:13.662 --> 00:48:17.541
Jeez, you've been going on about a date
since yesterday morning,

00:48:17.625 --> 00:48:20.085
so I was wondering
what kind of grand plans you had in mind.

00:48:20.169 --> 00:48:22.046
Was Namsan all you could come up with?

00:48:23.297 --> 00:48:24.757
How cliché.

00:48:25.633 --> 00:48:27.510
I'm not looking for anything
out of the ordinary.

00:48:27.593 --> 00:48:29.512
I want a totally cliché, classic romance.

00:48:29.595 --> 00:48:31.972
And where else would we go but here?

00:48:33.724 --> 00:48:37.353
Well, when you put it that way,
I guess you have a point.

00:48:39.688 --> 00:48:43.776
Since you're human now,
it's time to do everything you wanted.

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:50.824
That! I've always wanted to try that.

00:48:50.908 --> 00:48:53.452
It's a classic, right? Let's go.

00:48:59.917 --> 00:49:04.129
So we just write our wish on this, right?

00:49:04.713 --> 00:49:05.756
That's about it.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:14.557
MAY OUR LOVE LAST FOREVER

00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:16.850
LET'S COME BACK IN TEN YEARS!

00:49:25.025 --> 00:49:26.402
Wait, what's this?

00:49:26.485 --> 00:49:28.821
I thought you wanted something classic.

00:49:29.363 --> 00:49:31.115
EUN-HO, KANG SI-YEOL
BACK TO HOW WE WERE

00:49:31.865 --> 00:49:34.493
This is a wish. I have to be realistic.

00:49:35.202 --> 00:49:38.038
What other wish
could possibly be more important?

00:49:38.122 --> 00:49:40.040
I'm just saying.

00:49:40.124 --> 00:49:43.335
Did you have to bring us
back to reality on this?

00:49:45.212 --> 00:49:48.173
Are you pouting
because my wish wasn't romantic enough?

00:49:48.841 --> 00:49:50.759
Who's pouting?

00:49:50.843 --> 00:49:51.844
Don't be ridiculous.

00:49:51.927 --> 00:49:53.762
I'm just playing along for your sake.

00:49:53.846 --> 00:49:55.014
Why would I be pouting?

00:49:55.097 --> 00:49:58.434
Fine, I'll just do something
more classic, then.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.397
Is this better?

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.608
What are you doing?

00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:07.401
A heart between us?

00:50:07.484 --> 00:50:09.403
You said a wish has to be realistic.

00:50:09.486 --> 00:50:11.155
What if this jinxes it?

00:50:11.238 --> 00:50:13.699
You worry too much.

00:50:13.782 --> 00:50:16.493
Once things are back to normal,
we'll go our separate ways.

00:50:16.577 --> 00:50:17.870
This heart doesn't mean anything.

00:50:17.953 --> 00:50:20.748
This heart won't matter at all by then.

00:50:20.831 --> 00:50:22.666
Hey, you didn't have to go that far.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.002
Whatever. Let's just hang this here.

00:50:25.085 --> 00:50:26.420
Goodness.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.964
Hang it or don't. I don't care.

00:50:29.048 --> 00:50:30.174
There.

00:50:49.193 --> 00:50:50.778
Dad, I'm home.

00:51:06.126 --> 00:51:08.170
Do we have a guest?

00:51:09.672 --> 00:51:12.216
Oh, you're home?

00:51:14.551 --> 00:51:15.719
What are you doing here?

00:51:16.345 --> 00:51:17.805
How did you get in here?

00:51:21.016 --> 00:51:22.393
Where's my dad?

00:51:23.477 --> 00:51:24.812
He's just over there.

00:51:27.856 --> 00:51:28.941
Dad!

00:51:31.735 --> 00:51:32.861
Dad.

00:51:34.196 --> 00:51:36.240
Wake up!

00:51:43.038 --> 00:51:46.333
What did you do to my father?

00:51:48.001 --> 00:51:51.672
He's just unconscious,
that's all.

00:51:51.755 --> 00:51:53.215
Man, I feel refreshed.

00:51:54.299 --> 00:51:57.261
Even the shower's amazing
in a fancy house.

00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:04.143
Answer me!

00:52:05.352 --> 00:52:08.230
What did you do to him?

00:52:08.313 --> 00:52:10.190
There's no need to worry.

00:52:10.274 --> 00:52:13.610
He'll be fine
once he wakes up from his little nap.

00:52:14.153 --> 00:52:16.572
By the way, I heard you lost your memory.

00:52:17.239 --> 00:52:18.532
I told you

00:52:18.615 --> 00:52:22.077
I knew someone
who can help with this kind of thing.

00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:25.456
Meet Jang Do-cheol. He's a shaman.

00:52:26.582 --> 00:52:27.833
A male shaman.

00:52:27.916 --> 00:52:29.001
A shaman?

00:52:29.626 --> 00:52:32.838
What, did you expect me to bring a priest?

00:52:33.422 --> 00:52:37.551
All you want is
to get your memory back, right?

00:52:39.928 --> 00:52:42.556
I said we should eat something nice
since we're out anyway.

00:52:42.639 --> 00:52:44.349
What's wrong with pork cutlet?

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:46.518
Isn't it totally a classic?

00:52:46.602 --> 00:52:49.938
Besides, how much were you planning
to spend on borrowed money?

00:52:57.529 --> 00:52:58.447
Here.

00:53:00.115 --> 00:53:01.950
Look at you being so cooperative.

00:53:02.576 --> 00:53:04.578
It's just manners.

00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:06.079
It's second nature to me.

00:53:07.206 --> 00:53:09.917
Still, I like it. It's also classic.

00:53:18.217 --> 00:53:19.676
Si-yeol,

00:53:20.469 --> 00:53:22.888
isn't there anything
you've wanted to do on a date?

00:53:24.139 --> 00:53:25.474
I don't know.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:28.811
I just wanted something normal too.

00:53:28.894 --> 00:53:31.063
Not having to date inside a car

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:32.898
or hide my face.

00:53:33.565 --> 00:53:36.819
Something like holding hands
and walking down a crowded street.

00:53:37.361 --> 00:53:38.779
I've never done that before.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.948
Really?

00:53:42.199 --> 00:53:45.577
I was hoping for some fun ideas,
but that's it?

00:53:47.162 --> 00:53:50.541
Living as a celebrity must be exhausting.

00:53:51.166 --> 00:53:54.086
I can just do whatever I want
and erase people's memories.

00:54:06.306 --> 00:54:07.933
Erase that human's memory.

00:54:08.642 --> 00:54:10.018
Erase it.

00:54:11.311 --> 00:54:13.355
Sis, I found a way!

00:54:13.897 --> 00:54:16.400
I found a way for you to turn back

00:54:16.483 --> 00:54:17.860
into a nine-tailed fox.

00:54:23.448 --> 00:54:26.368
How about it? Do you remember now?

00:54:30.706 --> 00:54:31.582
Tell us.

00:54:31.665 --> 00:54:33.625
What do you know?

00:54:33.709 --> 00:54:34.710
Well…

00:54:38.171 --> 00:54:39.464
She said she became human.

00:54:40.716 --> 00:54:42.050
What?

00:54:44.052 --> 00:54:45.470
That nine-tailed fox.

00:54:46.388 --> 00:54:49.224
She's just an ordinary human now.

00:54:54.479 --> 00:54:56.148
Si-yeol, hold my hand.

00:54:57.357 --> 00:54:58.317
What?

00:54:58.817 --> 00:55:00.611
This was the date you wanted to go on.

00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:02.905
We're on a date,
so let's hold hands as we walk.

00:55:04.239 --> 00:55:05.782
Oh, come on.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.952
Seriously, how long
are you going to keep this up?

00:55:19.421 --> 00:55:21.006
You know, it's strange.

00:55:21.506 --> 00:55:22.382
What is?

00:55:22.466 --> 00:55:23.717
I mean, until just recently,

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:27.012
my heart would race,
and I'd get nervous around you.

00:55:27.095 --> 00:55:30.682
But now
that we're actually dating like this,

00:55:30.766 --> 00:55:32.059
my heart doesn't race anymore,

00:55:32.142 --> 00:55:35.854
even when we're holding hands
or I'm lying on your arm.

00:55:35.938 --> 00:55:38.941
Is something wrong with our relationship?

00:55:40.817 --> 00:55:44.529
Are you saying this doesn't
make your heart race at all?

00:55:45.405 --> 00:55:46.531
Not at all.

00:55:49.701 --> 00:55:51.662
Are you toying with me?

00:55:53.497 --> 00:55:56.041
But I actually had fun on our date today.

00:55:56.124 --> 00:55:59.753
I think I'll remember it for a long time
because it was so ordinary and classic.

00:56:02.422 --> 00:56:06.134
Speaking of memories,

00:56:07.844 --> 00:56:11.431
when things go back to normal,
are you going to erase my memory too?

00:56:12.557 --> 00:56:14.017
What?

00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:15.894
You just said earlier

00:56:15.978 --> 00:56:19.982
that you'd do what you want
and then erase the memory.

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:26.029
I mean, I ended up
learning too much about you.

00:56:26.863 --> 00:56:30.701
So, like you did to Woo-seok
and that old man,

00:56:31.326 --> 00:56:33.328
I wondered if you'd just erase mine too.

00:56:34.621 --> 00:56:36.456
Why would you suddenly ask that?

00:56:37.165 --> 00:56:39.167
Because of what you said

00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:42.337
about going our separate ways
once everything is back to normal.

00:56:42.421 --> 00:56:44.047
I'm going to erase it.

00:56:44.131 --> 00:56:46.967
To me, human friends
have always been disposable.

00:56:47.884 --> 00:56:51.221
I have my fun,
and then I wipe the slate clean.

00:56:51.304 --> 00:56:54.725
That way,
things don't get emotionally messy.

00:56:54.808 --> 00:56:55.684
It's cleaner that way.

00:56:58.395 --> 00:57:02.524
Hearing that makes me feel a bit sad.

00:57:05.235 --> 00:57:06.361
It doesn't make you sad?

00:57:08.905 --> 00:57:09.906
It does.

00:57:14.369 --> 00:57:17.831
It's obvious that I'm special to you,

00:57:17.914 --> 00:57:19.291
but to me, you're also…

00:57:20.667 --> 00:57:22.294
a pretty special human.

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:28.425
You're the first human friend I've had
who didn't feel disposable.

00:57:29.051 --> 00:57:31.970
Of course it'll be sad
after I erase your memory.

00:57:32.929 --> 00:57:34.556
Then don't erase it.

00:57:36.016 --> 00:57:37.142
I can't.

00:57:37.225 --> 00:57:38.560
Why not?

00:57:38.643 --> 00:57:41.813
Because then your life won't be normal.

00:57:41.897 --> 00:57:43.940
For a human to live a normal life,

00:57:44.024 --> 00:57:46.443
memories of switched fates
and a nine-tailed fox becoming human

00:57:46.526 --> 00:57:48.070
are better forgotten.

00:57:48.904 --> 00:57:51.239
So, erasing your memory

00:57:52.365 --> 00:57:54.284
is my final gift to you.

00:58:00.165 --> 00:58:01.625
What if…

00:58:04.711 --> 00:58:06.463
I don't want to be normal?

00:58:08.507 --> 00:58:09.382
What?

00:58:10.008 --> 00:58:12.344
If you're just going to erase my memory

00:58:13.095 --> 00:58:15.472
and be the only one
who remembers this moment…

00:58:18.308 --> 00:58:21.937
then I should be allowed to do
at least this much, right?

00:58:23.105 --> 00:58:24.397
What do you mean…

00:58:55.637 --> 00:58:57.597
{\an8}SPECIAL APPEARANCES
BY KIM HONG-PA AND OH MIN-SEOK

00:59:19.035 --> 00:59:21.705
EUN-HO, KANG SI-YEOL
BACK TO HOW WE WERE

00:59:21.788 --> 00:59:24.708
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:59:24.791 --> 00:59:27.169
{\an8}Let's date. For real.

00:59:27.252 --> 00:59:29.963
{\an8}Don't think about running.
Let's do this right.

00:59:31.464 --> 00:59:34.467
{\an8}Eun-ho, should we go on a trip?

00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:37.012
{\an8}Then who erased your memory?

00:59:37.095 --> 00:59:38.889
{\an8}There was someone else there.

00:59:38.972 --> 00:59:42.017
{\an8}He told me to wait and do nothing,
but what the hell is he doing?

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.852
{\an8}Here. I made some money.

00:59:43.935 --> 00:59:45.724
{\an8}Wait, what did you do to get…

00:59:46.271 --> 00:59:48.481
{\an8}I'm on a mission
to do good deeds right now.

00:59:48.565 --> 00:59:50.358
{\an8}Hey, Si-yeol!

00:59:50.984 --> 00:59:52.194
{\an8}Hyeon Woo-seok collapsed!

00:59:52.277 --> 00:59:54.112
{\an8}- Woo-seok!
- Hey, Woo-seok!

00:59:54.196 --> 00:59:56.114
{\an8}They say he might die.

00:59:59.618 --> 01:00:01.620
