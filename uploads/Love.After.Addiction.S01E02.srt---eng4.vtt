00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 2)

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.159
I heard you think the
funds are already in place.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:34.736
So you think no one else matters?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.120
Like you can do whatever you want.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.760
But do you wanna bet?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.520
As long as our Yoki Baby quits the show.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.456
They'll withdraw the investment right away.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.600
You think that won't happen?

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.239
Directors are a dime a dozen.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.040
Are you leaving, or is Yoki Baby?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.400
Who do you think they'll pick?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.400
Guys like you.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.519
You might only get one
chance like this in your life

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.680
to be in this position.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.096
Don't you dare mess it up!

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.400
How stupid can you be?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.359
All of this... is for love.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.039
Hey.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.159
My baby Yoki

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400
I already chewed out that

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.599
selfish director.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.240
Calm down first, okay?

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.400
I just hope

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.639
that you won't leave.

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.280
We're in a tough spot right now,

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:43.960
you know that too.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.640
If you wanna turn things around,

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.216
you gotta endure a little hardship.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.039
That's why I didn't ask you to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.199
bring an assistant.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.000
I really hope you'll stay.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
Good boy.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.000
Then get a good night's sleep, ok?

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.520
Wait.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.216
You're still answering calls this late?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.280
Another sleepless night?

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.599
Not exactly.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.159
I think I've found

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.719
my magic cure.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.000
This feeling of deep sleep is truly

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.680
long overdue.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.479
So nice!

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.960
Pervert!

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.479
I love my wife very much.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.080
My wife made me who I am.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.639
My wife became my wife.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.439
My house became my home.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.199
She's a very virtuous woman.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400
Get to the point.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.719
Mr. Yoki.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.719
I was wrong about what happened today.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:50.280
This variety show,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.615
I've been working for it for eight years.

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.000
I don't want to lose my wife.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You're going to quit?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.560
But you're a volunteer.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.400
Do you know what a volunteer is?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.879
We haven't even started
rolling and you're backing out.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.559
What are we going to do about this?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.639
But.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.680
If you really don't want to participate,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.719
I will never

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:09.919
go against your will,

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.639
but Lanwan Village

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:12.919
will be in trouble.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.000
I know what to do.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.159
Village Chief.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.519
Magic cure Yang Meng.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.079
Miracle for insomnia.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.399
Here he comes.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:02.759
Mr. Yoki.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.639
Where are your shoes?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.560
I can't find them.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.120
It's okay, this is fine.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.560
Seriously?

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:14.999
A man with nothing to lose

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.600
fears no man with everything to lose.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720
You'll definitely win!

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920
Mr. Yoki.

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:33.399
It hasn't started yet.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.600
The first segment.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:44.720
Our guests have to compete for.

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:47.360
Lanwan Village's specialty ingredients,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.120
and then

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.399
cook a dinner themselves.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:51.839
In other words,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.439
what you eat for dinner

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.279
depends on what you grab.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600
Ready?

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.439
Brother Yoki.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600
Good luck!

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360
You too!

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.720
Take your positions!

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560
Alright!

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.920
Please continue the competition, everyone!

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.360
Don't be affected!

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360
What's wrong, Yoki?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.319
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:50.000
Let me check.

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:51.399
It hurts.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.600
Be careful!

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.920
Slow down.

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:55.920
Take it easy.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.360
It hurts so much.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:59.879
Then be careful!

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:04.079
Slow down, slow down...

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.240
Walk slower.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:06.839
Okay, slow down...

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.600
I... I...

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.336
What's wrong with your program team?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.336
Leaving the guests injured like this
and doing nothing about it—it's dangerous!

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.295
He's totally different from
how he was in high school.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.759
He's changed so much.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.439
Don't move!

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.759
Don't move!

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:40.479
Didn't expect you're quite professional.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:42.480
I'm a volunteer in the village now.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.040
The work is quite diverse.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.800
I need to know a little bit of everything.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:51.240
Nice jawline.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Great skin too.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.759
How come I didn't
notice that in high school?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.120
He's quite handsome.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.480
It might hurt a bit.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.759
It's okay.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.680
Do whatever you want with me.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.040
Anything is fine.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.080
Ouch...

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:34.960
Just kill me...

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:43.879
It's okay now.

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:47.919
All done.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.080
Are you a mermaid?

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.919
I'm injured.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.120
Give me a hand.

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:56.519
Stop being so dramatic.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:57.999
Could you check the wound please?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.560
A trip and fall isn't a real injury.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.399
Fine, I'll get up myself.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.120
Alright, alright, I'll help you.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720
I...

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.120
Are you trying to save me

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.320
or kill me?

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.919
Bad start.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320
Mr. Yoki.

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.919
It's a successful first battle.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320
Idiot.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:43.559
Damn pervert!

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840
Brother Yoki.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.759
Didn't expect you'd get injured

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:52.919
at the beginning.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080
Do you need me to

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.360
take care of the wound again?

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:56.799
No.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.639
It's fine.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.519
I just want to see

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.679
how serious your wound is.

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:01.960
What are you doing?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.840
Just checking, I'm worried it's serious.

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.200
Told you it's fine!

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:31.679
Did he just glare at me?

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720
I don't know.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.440
No need

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:37.759
I'm afraid it hurts.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.960
It doesn't hurt at all.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840
The tide's gone out.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.799
Let's go tide pooling!

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:57.399
Mr. Yoki.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.159
We're about to move on to

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.320
the next round.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.159
You made ten tiny bites
out of that one green onion.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.080
Are you reluctant to eat it

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.679
or waiting for someone to feed you?

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:10.039
No, not at all.

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:12.080
It looks delicious.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.240
Alright.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.399
Great.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.679
Tonight

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:23.559
our accommodation

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.320
will be determined by drawing lots.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.480
Everybody,

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.159
what kind of house you want to live in

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.000
depends on your luck.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.320
Who wants to go first?

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120
Mr. Yoki.

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:03.039
Please go ahead.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.000
What?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
A yellow mud house.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.080
Director,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.216
is the yellow mud house better

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.840
or

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.080
my luxurious sea view room?

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.440
What do you think?

00:12:25.552 --> 00:12:26.552
Of course,

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:28.200
each has its own merits.

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:30.200
Damn pervert!

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.679
Yoki.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.480
I don't feel right about this.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.240
Why don't you come stay with me?

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:37.679
There's definitely enough space.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:42.319
Follow the program team's arrangement.

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:44.759
Alright,

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:46.655
but if you really can't get used to it,

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:47.919
promise me you'll come find me.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.120
What are you looking at?

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.240
You want to eat it?

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:57.559
Come here.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.519
So violent!

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.120
But so charming!

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440
What are you doing?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
What are you eating?

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.399
Is it good?

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:23.799
Give me a bite.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.360
It's delicious!

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.120
You...

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.240
Are you avoiding me?

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.759
No, I'm not.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120
You're scared of me.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.639
N-No, I'm not.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.440
No?

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:12.919
Really?

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:15.039
Really.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320
Alright.

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:22.759
The place I'm staying tonight,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.120
I can't read the map.

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:25.799
Show me the way.

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.080
I'm only responsible for

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.519
safety issues.

00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:37.679
Ok fine.

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:42.079
What kind of old classmate are you?

00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:44.239
Haven't seen each other for eight years,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.800
no wonder there's no friendship left.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.440
Leaving me here

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.879
on this lonely island

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.879
to fend for myself.

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:03.120
Coincidentally

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.640
I'm on my way to do something.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.200
If you can get on,

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:07.519
I'll give you a ride.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360
Are you out of your mind?

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:14.559
Yang Meng,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.639
Why did you bring me to your house?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.920
This is where you're staying tonight.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:02.879
This is where I'm staying!

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:04.519
Come on in.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120
We're here.

00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:20.159
This is it.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.919
Live here alone?

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.639
I might die here

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:30.679
and no one would know?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.360
Impossible.

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:33.399
Look,

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:35.799
this open-air space is cool.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.360
This curtain,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600
this table,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.840
this bed is square

00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:42.039
and sturdy.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.639
Sturdy?

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.720
Maybe...

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200
I can make you a hammock.

00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:55.279
Or.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.320
Or... or...

00:16:58.639 --> 00:16:59.919
Why don't you stay here

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.039
and sleep with me?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.000
I'm really scared living alone.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.119
Didn't you plan this

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:07.480
from the beginning?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400
No.

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:11.599
How could I?

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.640
Fine.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:14.319
Then I'm not helping.

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:15.559
Clean up by yourself.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:20.839
What's wrong with you?

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:23.079
I... I have a toothache.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.280
Where exactly does it hurt?

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240
Toothache.

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.479
It's an old problem acting up.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920
Let me see.

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:33.519
Open your mouth.

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:40.039
Is it here?

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
A little further in.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.720
Here?

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.960
Further in.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480
This one.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960
Come back.

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:03.960
Let go.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.680
It's a bit salty.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.240
H-His tongue.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.440
What are you doing?

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.039
I have a toothache.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200
Then go to the clinic.

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.039
Let's go.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.240
Wait a minute.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.680
Turn around.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.240
Turn around.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.600
Why do I need to turn around?

00:18:22.759 --> 00:18:23.160
Stop talking nonsense.

00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:24.160
It hurts like hell, hurry up!

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:25.920
Hurry, turn around, hurry, hurry.

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:27.479
Hurry and stick out your butt.

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:28.720
Stick out your butt.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.559
Hurry up!

00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:31.000
Hurry, hurry, stick it out.
