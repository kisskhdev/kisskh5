[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.930
[Episode 18]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.509
In three days,

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.150
the Yan delegation
will have an audience with His Majesty.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.539
Tu'er will likely make his move then.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.400
"The wind howls

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.150
and the Yi River cold.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.310
Once the hero departs,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.530
he shall never return."

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.120
Your Highness, are you lamenting

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.890
that Tu'er and his men won't return alive?

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.030
When people read the story of Jing Ke's
attempt on the King of Qin,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.290
some admire Jing Ke's solitary bravery,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.080
while others marvel at
the King of Qin's narrow escape.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.310
But now,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.390
we are neither Jing Ke

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.180
nor the King of Qin.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.310
Then we are...

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.760
Crown Prince Dan of Yan?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.840
Correct.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440
He planned the assassination
with great care,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.250
yet one wrong move ruined everything.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.710
In the end, it led to the fall
of his state

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.640
and the destruction of his family.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.570
Gentlemen,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.500
do you know where he failed?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.770
Was it because Jing Ke
lacked martial skills?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.310
Tu'er is Yan State's top fighter.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.970
Or was it because...

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.200
the King of Qin was too cunning?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.800
Our emperor

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.760
is far less cunning than the King of Qin.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.829
Then what was the reason?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.560
Mr. Murong, what do you think?

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.620
It's the location.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.330
Exactly.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.190
Jing Ke chose to strike

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.650
inside the Qin royal hall.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.680
It was heavily guarded

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.430
and the place
the King of Qin was most familiar with.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.560
That was why he could evade the attack.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.920
During peace talks,
security will also be tight.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.720
Tu'er cannot
bring all his men into the palace.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.210
But if not in the main hall,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.470
then where will the talks be held?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.680
Mr. Jia,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.240
we don't have to wait
until the peace talk.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.440
There might be a place

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.400
where they can meet in advance.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.960
Mount Bei?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.750
In my view,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.470
His Majesty now protects those Yan people

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.330
like a hen protecting her chicks.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.730
It would be unwise for us to confront him
head-on.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.710
However,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.880
the mausoleum on Mount Bei
is nearly complete.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.930
His Majesty should accompany you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.240
to inspect it anyway.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.290
You mean

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.899
once the Emperor leaves the city,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.750
those Yan people
will lose their protection,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.600
and we can...

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.600
That's exactly what I mean.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.150
Brilliant!

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.320
The main hall on Mount Bei

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.870
is a perfect place for an assassination.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.880
Right now, the Emperor

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.320
is protecting the delegation
with utmost security.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.000
But if he leaves the city
and takes half the troops with him,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.370
the Empress Dowager
will have her chance to strike.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.170
But will the Emperor go?

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.240
After all, he doesn't even need to think

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.040
to know

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.070
it's obvious the Empress Dowager would not

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.159
invite him out of the palace
for no reason.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.760
Mr. Jia, have you forgotten?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.159
No one knows

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.680
the Emperor's weak spot

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.690
better than the Empress Dowager.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.190
Your Majesty,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.600
Her Majesty
will inspect Mount Bei tomorrow.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.270
She wishes to invite you to go with her.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.970
The mausoleum is not yet complete.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.870
Wouldn't it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.480
be too early to go now?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.290
Her Majesty also said that

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.880
if you are occupied with state affairs,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.800
she may, according to protocol,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.040
have the Noble Consort
accompany her alone instead.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.320
What did you say?

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.360
Please do not take offense, Your Majesty.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.950
I am only conveying Her Majesty's decree.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.760
Since Mother is so concerned
about her final resting place,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.390
as her son,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.150
I have no reason not to go.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.870
Then I shall report back to Her Majesty.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.390
Dan,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.920
the Yan delegation is still in the city.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.310
For the Empress Dowager to invite you
to Mount Bei at this time,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.510
she likely harbors ill intent.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.950
Most likely,

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.370
she failed to stop the peace talks

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.120
and is now furious out of embarrassment.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.450
That is all the more reason
you must not go.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.310
If I don't go,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.450
she'll make Wanyin go.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.870
But...

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.150
I'll settle accounts with her eventually.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.920
It's just a matter of time.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.540
If she insists on choosing tomorrow,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.010
then I will oblige her.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.040
After all,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.810
a mausoleum is meant for the dead.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.040
Mr. Mu,

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.240
your foresight is remarkable.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.300
The moment Consort Yu was mentioned,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.390
the Emperor agreed as expected.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.480
That is thanks to His Majesty's

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.830
deep affection for Consort Yu.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.070
Love

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.870
is a useless thing.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.390
Excellent.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.270
Once the Emperor leaves the palace

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.720
and the Yan envoys are dead,

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.750
hostility between the two states
will be inevitable.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.270
This war,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.630
Prince Duan will have to fight

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.060
whether he wants to

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.470
or not.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.250
Tonghao.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.600
Deploy our people.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.560
Tomorrow when the Emperor and I
go to Mount Bei,

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.870
keep a close eye on Prince Duan

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.920
and make sure
he does not cause any trouble.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.980
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:51.560
I'll see to it right away.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.190
Mr. Mu.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.920
Your Majesty.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.360
Once we leave tomorrow,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.680
the affairs of the city
will be entrusted to you.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.270
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.670
I will carry out my duties
with utmost care.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.070
I trust your competence.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.870
But...

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.310
have you considered this?

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.040
Tomorrow, neither I
nor the Emperor will be in the city.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.480
If anything were to happen

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.620
to the Yan envoys,

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.360
it...

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.549
It would surely be

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.669
Prince Duan's doing.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.150
Mr. Mu,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.480
you understand my intentions
better and better.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.690
Your Majesty, this move

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.600
can not only eliminate the Yan delegation

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.840
and halt the peace talks,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.980
it can also pin everything

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.540
on Prince Duan afterward.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.720
Even if the people want to complain,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.760
they'll only blame Prince Duan.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.800
Your Majesty,

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.950
this plan kills two birds—

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.720
no,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.750
three birds—with one stone.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.410
Brilliant.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.120
Truly brilliant.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.630
Mr. Mu,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.670
once this is accomplished,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.030
you will stand above all other officials.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.390
Thank you,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.930
Your Majesty.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.330
Master,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.920
someone sent an invitation.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.030
[Kunyu Palace]

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.600
I'm sorry.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.270
What a silly girl.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.000
She still feels
that she disappointed Xiahou Bo.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.200
Why are you here?

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.350
You're awake?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.370
Your fever has finally broken.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.200
The medical conditions in ancient times
are terrifying.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.330
How are you feeling?

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.040
Let me get you some hot water.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.460
Yu Wanyin.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.360
You don't need to play the good cop,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.690
bad cop with Xiahou Dan.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.490
Just be honest.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.560
What do you want?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.460
Then I won't hold back.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.670
What are you trying to do?

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.600
Girls' dorm gossip time—

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.200
haven't you ever experienced it?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.330
Trying to play the heartstrings card?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.250
That won't work.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.670
So you really dreamed
of Xiahou Bo just now?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.870
It wasn't him.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.170
Xie Yong'er,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.940
do you still remember
you're a modern woman?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.790
He knew the Empress Dowager
would pressure you,

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.750
yet he got you pregnant,

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.510
and then didn't cherish you afterward.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.110
Such a heartless jerk,

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.950
and you want to apologize to him?

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.470
I already told you it wasn't him.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.530
Then who was it?

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200
Could it be...

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.030
me?

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.150
Sis,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.060
have you finally realized

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.550
how good I've been to you?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.600
It was my mom, sis.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.040
I'm sorry.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.480
Maybe because I know who you are now,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.360
I dreamed of things

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.080
from before I came here.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.030
That day,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.720
I quarreled with her
over some trivial matter

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.770
and didn't even get to apologize.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.390
Before I came,
I actually had a call with my mom.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.000
She said

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.830
she learned a new dish

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.060
and wanted me to come home
so she could make it for me.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.410
You have no idea,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.840
but I used to complain so much
about my mom's cooking.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.600
Now...

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.320
I don't even know when I'll get to eat it.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.410
Where is your hometown?

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.650
Beijing.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.530
What about you?

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.080
City A.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.030
City A?

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.770
Don't you know?

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.870
It's the capital.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.600
I know.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.960
Then what's Beijing?

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.760
Just a small county.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.260
It's normal that you haven't heard of it.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.870
When exactly did you two

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.400
find out about my identity?

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.720
At the palace banquet,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.960
when you played the guitar.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.030
That early?

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.440
But I wanted to come clean with you
the very next day.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.960
It's just that back then
you were so focused on scheming,

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.490
you wouldn't listen at all.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.530
You even tried to frame me
with Wei Zi peony's juice.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.390
This still makes me angry
when I think about it.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.190
His Majesty trusted you so much.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.330
Well,

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.340
I didn't know back then.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.600
In the original story,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.600
your character caused Xie Yong'er
a lot of suffering.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.960
So,

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.630
characters are characters,
and we are ourselves.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.630
Believe it or not,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.510
I never intended to harm you.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.530
But you have to understand.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.790
We really couldn't

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.150
risk telling you our identities directly

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.790
at the time.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.150
That makes sense.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.180
Your Highness,

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.130
Lord Mu is here.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.180
Your Highness.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.250
I took the liberty of inviting you here

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.150
because I have
an unfinished game of chess.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920
There's one piece

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.020
I'm still not sure how to move.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.840
Please tell me, Prince Duan.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.300
Now that we have the stage,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120
the King of Qin,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.390
and the assassin,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.200
is there no more uncertainty?

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.550
Your Highness, your play

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.800
is fierce and sharp,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.020
never roundabout,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.010
advancing and retreating

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.480
with rhythm and variety.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.480
Truly an exceptional player.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.250
But this game has reached its limit.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.580
If there's any uncertainty left,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.830
it can only be the will of heaven.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.510
Therefore,

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.360
I must go see someone

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.220
to discern the will of heaven.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.480
Congratulations, Your Highness.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.320
This game

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.490
has taken a new turn.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.050
For such a long time,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.100
you've been dealing with
the Empress Dowager

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.870
as Mu Yun for me.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.540
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Murong.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.120
I am willing to serve the true sovereign

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.720
to the best of my ability.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.150
Were you a student before you came here?

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.120
I've been working for a while.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.980
What did you do?

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.550
Just a corporate slave.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.550
It's all the same.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.530
What about you?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.630
I was just 6 months away
from graduating college.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.920
You came here so young?

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.590
Poor thing.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.080
I feel like my beautiful life
hadn't even begun

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.210
before I ended up in this awful place.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.080
Don't you feel like

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.740
everything here is so unreal?

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.410
Every day I have to put on an act.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.550
It's driving me crazy.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.440
Totally.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.660
I live every day in fear.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.790
You?

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.170
In fear?

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.960
I think everything's going smoothly
for you.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.290
You and Xiahou Dan

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.550
have been enjoying life to the fullest.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.450
Who said that?

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.440
On my very first day here,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.080
Xiahou Dan almost had me dragged out
and buried alive.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.000
Really?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.880
Later in the palace,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.840
the Empress Dowager, the consorts—

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.360
who doesn't want me dead?

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.790
That's true.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.170
Wait.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.320
I don't.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.060
I never wanted to kill you.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.180
You didn't. But what about Xiahou Bo?

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.790
When I was outside the palace,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.480
he sent people to assassinate me.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.270
I nearly ended up
at the bottom of the lake.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:42.910
No way.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.790
The fire at the library that day

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.520
was also set by someone he sent.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.670
The scar on my arm still hasn't healed.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.070
Wasn't that an accident?

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.870
He told me so himself.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.670
Is this your first time dating?

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.460
So naive.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.440
It's really your first time?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.480
I hadn't graduated from college.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.010
My mom wouldn't let me date.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.310
Gosh.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:12.950
You're so obedient.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.680
But I do like someone.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.069
Who?

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:16.079
Give Me Five!

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.109
I wasn't asking you to high-five me.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.579
It's the name of my idol's group—

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.750
Give Me Five,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.349
or GMF for short.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.730
Are you done?

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.090
What's with that face?

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.490
Wait.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.000
Yu Wanyin.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.290
Are you really here to make peace with me?

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.720
It feels like things
have gotten worse between us.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.780
It's all its fault!

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.510
Stop right there.
I'm going to put makeup on you!

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.970
Don't even think about it!

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.790
What's so funny?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.600
-I won't do it again.
-Why hasn't she finished

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.200
playing the good cop yet?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.270
I'm going to put makeup on you too!

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.640
I won't do it again!

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.590
Is she planning to play 81 episodes?

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.720
I'll do it to you too!

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.600
-Alright, alright!
-Stop!

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:10.880
Stop right there!

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.750
Crayon Shin-chan!

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.570
Say that again!

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.560
Stop.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.200
-In the magnifying glass,
-Stop laughing.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.680
-you did look pretty!
-Come on.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.030
Were you like this...

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.160
-in that world?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.720
Sit still.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.680
Alright. I'll remove it for you.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.370
That's more like it.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.560
Use mine.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.790
It smells so good.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.920
Why does this makeup remover
smell so nice?

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.440
Physician Xiao
added rose essential oil for me.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.030
That setting powder is really nice too.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.290
The texture is so fine.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.880
Physician Xiao added pearl powder for me.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.750
What's happening?

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.310
You always mention Physician Xiao.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.570
Why is he so nice to you?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.240
Maybe because I'm a good person.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.400
Look at your gossipy face.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.660
Don't overthink it.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.960
There's nothing between us.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.880
We're buddies.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.110
Something's wrong.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.310
What's wrong?

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.530
Then why are you blushing?

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.050
I was running just now.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.100
It's so hot.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.790
You think it's like you and Xiahou Dan?

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.050
You two are always showing off your love.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.880
Are you two for real or just acting?

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.370
Say something.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.200
Your lips are chapped.
Let me apply some lip balm for you.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.660
Don't change the subject.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.290
Do you like Xiahou Dan?

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.790
I...

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.230
What's so great about him?

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.570
He's a tyrant,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.310
always wearing a scowl,

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:02.750
as if someone owes him money.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.720
And he's sickly too.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.050
Well,

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.150
then what do you see in Xiahou Bo?

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.730
He's cunning, devious,

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.920
suspicious, and cold-hearted.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.320
Watch what you say.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.120
What's wrong with that?

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.280
Fine, you win.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.350
I...

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.070
Actually, at first,

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.600
I just wanted to use his influence
to survive.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.240
I didn't intend anything more.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.790
But...

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.590
it's just that...

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.190
the deeper I fell for him,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.770
the more distant he became.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.760
And the more distant he became,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.900
the more I couldn't accept it.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.560
What's so hard to accept?

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.000
You've read the story too.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.860
You should know

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.030
that in the original story,

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.590
he and your character

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.150
were deeply in love.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.790
Why is it that with me,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.340
he's so distant?

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:48.850
Then you're wrong.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.960
He loves no one.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.250
He's the type

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.790
of outstanding villain in the stories
who's all about his career.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.270
A workaholic. Understand?

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.070
Outstanding?

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.570
I don't see it at all.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.040
Why are you here?

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.270
Get out.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.670
-What's wrong?
-Get out!

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.030
We're not done with makeup yet.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.630
Boys aren't allowed in here.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.760
What's wrong?

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.550
Prince Duan asked
to meet Xie Yong'er tonight.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.170
The note

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.790
was intercepted by Mr. Bei.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.160
Look.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.460
I got it.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.170
But you need to go out first.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.900
I haven't finished speaking.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.790
-Yu Wanyin...
-Get out.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.190
You...

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.640
How dare you lock me outside?

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.570
I am the Emperor.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.750
You're a tyrant.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.200
Outrageous.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:38.100
[Upon hearing about your ordeal, I am
heartbroken. I hope we can meet tonight]

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.200
What's wrong?

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.260
Did he write you another love letter?

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.350
It's Prince Duan.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.920
He wants to meet you.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.050
There's something...

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.560
I didn't want to tell you.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.050
[A true confidant is hard to find.
Say no more]

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.210
[Let's meet in the flower house today]

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.660
[I heard you've been wronged,
and I'm deeply concerned]

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.390
[Please take care of yourself
for the future]

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:39.860
You already know

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.240
he didn't follow your plan

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:42.820
[A true confidant is hard to find.
Say no more]

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.480
and made his own adjustments.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.350
[Let's meet in the flower house today]

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.610
But what you don't know

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.590
is that while he was
trying to get information from you,

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.050
he was using the same words
to manipulate me.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.660
To him, we are both outsiders.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.240
He will never develop feelings
for outsiders.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.040
That's right.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.940
If he takes the throne,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.160
you'll be the first one to die.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.070
Stop talking.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.440
Why shouldn't I?

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720
You haven't told her

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.050
about the medicine yet.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.020
What medicine?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.680
The people in the Imperial Medical Bureau

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.080
checked the medicine Prince Duan gave you.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.880
Good thing you only took one pill.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.410
If you had taken them all...

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.500
What would happen?

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.350
Both you and your child would have died.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.410
Only the dead

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.710
can keep secrets.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.600
Xiahou Dan,
say one more word and I'll hit you!

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.450
Why are you telling me all this?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:49.510
You could have kept everything from me.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.550
Because I don't want you
to stay in the dark any longer.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.170
Yong'er,

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.280
the choice for the next step

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.480
is up to you now.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.880
Keep an eye on her.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.110
If anything happens,

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.030
report to me immediately.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:09.350
Yes.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.800
I wonder if it will go smoothly.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.730
It's too late to worry now.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.570
She's already on her way
to meet Prince Duan.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.920
Why don't you trust Xie Yong'er?

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.110
Because she's a 2D character.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.970
The so-called free will she shows

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.310
is just part of her character
in the story.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.440
It can't be changed.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.480
In this world,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.070
everyone except us is a 2D character,

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.750
including those ministers we've persuaded.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.030
They are characterized

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.630
as loyal and devoted people.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.440
But what about Xie Yong'er?

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:45.900
Well...

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.920
Xu Yao was originally designed

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.070
to be on Prince Duan's side.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.600
Yet in the end, he joined us.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.680
So free will does exist.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.800
Xie Yong'er just wasn't strong enough
back then.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.480
Now that I've given her a push,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.810
she could be different.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.330
Let's wait and see then.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.850
Let's see if she lives up to your...

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:03.960
sincerity.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.350
Sincerity?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.070
Are you...

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.110
jealous?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:13.930
Yes, I am.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.280
But...

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:16.920
she's a girl.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.660
That has nothing to do with it.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.590
Then what does it have to do with?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.860
Your Highness.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.340
You're finally here to see me.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.310
You look...

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.170
especially beautiful today.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.670
I still look a bit sickly now.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.760
I didn't want you to see me
in an ugly state,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:35.790
so

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.240
I put on a bit more makeup.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.910
Do you like it?

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.240
I do.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.240
How are you feeling?

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.540
Any better?

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:52.410
Your Highness.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.510
I heard that after your miscarriage,

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.350
the Emperor
had people stationed outside your palace.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.720
He called it protection, but it was really
to keep you from leaving.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.000
So how did you manage
to come see me today?

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.740
They think they've persuaded me.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.440
So they sent me to gather information.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.230
You mean

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.120
the Emperor forced you to come?

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.100
Your note asking to meet me

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.750
was intercepted by them.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.660
He was furious
and threatened to drown me alive.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.880
But then he suddenly
wanted me to go to the meeting,

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.000
telling me

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.200
to find out if you have any schemes.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.680
Schemes?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.270
He didn't say much else,

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.270
only mentioned having a nightmare.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.590
Maybe he was overthinking,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.970
or perhaps it was a warning.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.110
It seems to be related
to the envoy delegation.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.020
Your Highness,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.960
please take me away.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.000
They will surely kill me.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.260
I will take you away,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.030
but the time isn't right yet.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:19.970
Yong'er,

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.510
for my sake,

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.040
you must go back and tell him

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.500
everything is normal.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.110
But once I say that,

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.480
I'll have no reason to live anymore.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.210
Don't worry.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.570
Tomorrow, Xiahou Dan will go to Mount Bei.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.750
That's a path

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.240
of no return.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.660
Then I'll do as you say.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.990
I'll deliver the message to His Majesty

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.050
once I'm back.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.960
Thank you.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:08.750
But don't worry.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.530
I'll secretly send my people
to protect you.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.070
I am with you.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:21.660
Together, we will
ensure your mission succeeds.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.880
Why is your hand so cold?

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.100
My robe.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.100
It's cold,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.410
and you're wearing so little.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.740
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.430
You actually put a dragon robe on me.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.370
If word gets out,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.210
I'll be called a demonic consort again.

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:38.540
Aren't you one already?

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.410
There are so many people watching.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.810
No one is watching now.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.550
Are you two for real or just acting?

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.850
Do you like Xiahou Dan?

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.070
I...

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.310
Let's go.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.830
I still have matters to attend to.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:07.480
My dear,

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.640
you should go rest by yourself for now.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.440
Your Majesty.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.920
I'm afraid to sleep alone.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.730
How about...

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.500
we sleep together?

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.750
CEO Dan,

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.200
the moonlight tonight

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.210
is beautiful.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.180
The moonlight?

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:46.810
Isn't it?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.110
Yes, it is.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.720
So...

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.440
So...

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:07.730
Mr. Bei!

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.910
Show him something good.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.460
It can help you fight for justice,

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.400
and can also be used for self-defense.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.860
This is something that
can completely overwhelm the bad guys.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.260
Are you kidding me?

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:30.730
This was Wanyin's idea.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.830
Mr. Bei, have you ever thought about

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.240
designing an even more powerful mechanism?

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.100
For example...

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.190
not triggered by internal force,

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.190
but by gunpowder?

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:42.640
Gunpowder?

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.160
Instead of using internal force
to activate it,

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.360
gunpowder drives the mechanism

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.740
to continuously launch hidden weapons.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.380
I spent countless nights

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.550
figuring it out.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:54.970
Here,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.110
each of you take one

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.090
for self-protection.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.140
However,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.880
you haven't been trained,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.210
so your aim might be off.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.280
Don't use them recklessly.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.540
In history, these are the only two...

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.440
Guns?

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.050
How can you call them guns?

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.090
I named them

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.130
Nine Heavens Mystical Fire Repeating
Sleeve Crossbows!

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.440
[Yongyan Hall]

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.480
CEO Dan?

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.280
CEO Dan?

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.590
CEO Dan?

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.040
I'm here.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:45.929
I haven't left.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.889
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.090
This was delivered

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.750
by Xie Yong'er this morning.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.850
[All is as usual.
Prince Duan advocates peace talks]

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.850
What a perfunctory answer.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.680
Are you still going to trust her?

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:09.940
Hard to say.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.360
If Prince Duan
really is not up to anything,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.420
that would be best.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.530
But if...

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.070
You're overthinking it.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.930
Help me put on my crown.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.520
How about...

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.760
I go with you to Mount Bei?

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.270
No.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.430
You stay here.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.000
If...

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.960
If anything happens unexpectedly,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.760
with your exceptional wisdom,

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.200
you can respond flexibly

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.960
and provide support.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.440
Why do I feel

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.130
your answer is quite perfunctory too?

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.250
I'm being serious.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.540
Compared to the Empress Dowager,

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.250
Prince Duan is the one
we should be wary of.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.960
Besides, have you forgotten?

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.160
The Yan delegation is still in the city.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.880
If we both go to the mausoleum

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.880
and something happens in the city,

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.080
who will take charge?

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.670
But with the Empress Dowager suddenly
asking you to go up the mountain,

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.870
I feel really uneasy.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.880
I just feel it's not safe.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.340
Have you forgotten

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.710
I still have Mr. Bei as my trump card?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.070
He even gave the secret guards

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.130
special training.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.340
They're incredibly skilled now.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.160
Don't worry too much.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:40.760
As for you,

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.960
if anything happens,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960
you must remember

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.310
that protecting yourself comes first.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.590
I'm leaving Eunuch An in the palace.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.960
If anything happens in the palace,

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.840
he can help out.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.080
Your Majesty,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.200
it's time.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.800
Madam Bei is waiting outside the hall.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.540
Wait for me.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.360
After I come back,

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.380
I have something to tell you.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.400
It's unlucky to make such a promise!

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.130
Take it back!

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.010
No.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.050
Take it back!

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.000
No.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.180
Zhang San's Diary.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.460
Is it...

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:00.760
you?

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.740
Your Highness!

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.000
Did you take my note?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.400
I didn't know
it belonged to Your Highness!

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.330
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.490
[If you're one of my kind, leave
a message. I'd like to meet you]

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.600
It's alright.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.310
It's just you and me here.

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:29.510
You can tell me the truth.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.670
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.440
Didn't you recognize
that patch of flowers?

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.430
That SOS!

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.880
I did not.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.400
Then why were you digging there?

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.190
I work in a nearby side hall.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.320
I often saw

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.910
a wandering figure there

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.330
and grew curious.

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.680
So I dug a little when no one was around.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.630
Are you afraid I'll hurt you?

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:49.770
I won't.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.530
We're the same kind.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.030
You can trust me.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.960
Hello.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:54.730
How are you?

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.550
What's the second half of "study hard"?

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.590
I don't understand.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.590
What holiday is June 1st?

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.520
Your Highness, you're hurting me.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.730
You're all I have in this world.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.730
You really aren't?

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.880
Aren't what?

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.510
She isn't!

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.080
I have no friends

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.420
and no companions!

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.230
They're all my enemies!

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.060
Help!

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.580
Just a second.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:33.800
Just hold on a little longer.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.600
Just a second!

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:41.750
I didn't want to do it.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480
I killed someone.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.920
I didn't want to do it.
