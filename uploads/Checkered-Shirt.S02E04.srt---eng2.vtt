WEBVTT

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.638
Since Hangyeol prefers coffee,

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.265
I'll drink this.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.103
It's an Americano, right?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.700
While this UI maintains familiar patterns,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.119
we need to design something new.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.288
This structure looks very familiar, doesn't it?

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.627
Relax a little.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:47.047
You're our team's best ace.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:51.426
Ah,

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.135
and,

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:52.802
in this proposal,

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.055
the AR fitting feature was added,

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.348
why did you drop it?

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.103
You don't need to worry about that.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.898
I consulted with other developers,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:05.940
but due to device compatibility issues,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.526
I already received an answer that it's difficult.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.449
I think it's possible though.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.579
We can handle iOS cross-platform with WebGL fallback,

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.123
and just scale with Kubernetes on the server side.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.751
How does that sound?

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.464
Okay.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:31.132
Give it a try.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.974
Shall we take a short break?

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:41.684
The meeting is overflowing with energy.

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.436
It's sucking the life out of me.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.587
You haven't changed.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:12.590
Just holding the cigarette without lighting it.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.386
Don't follow me for no reason.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.099
I'm not following you.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.767
Just,

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.310
coincidentally, like in the old days.

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.405
In front of people at the company,

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.782
please don't act like you know me.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:41.327
I don't want to.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.663
Even if we force up past connections,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.126
only uncomfortable memories will remain.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.213
They aren't just memories,

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:55.300
they are cherished moments.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.724
To you, am I

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.310
just a mediocre memory?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:15.278
I don't even remember it well.

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:32.670
Humans,

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.756
need to have good memory, remember dates.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.343
Wife's birthday, mother-in-law's birthday,

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.512
father-in-law's birthday, wedding anniversary...

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:41.888
Ah,

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:42.680
now I'm more scared of my wife

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.308
than my mom, seriously.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:48.478
Hey.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.189
But why have you been like that since earlier?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.400
What about me...

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.652
No,

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.072
your eyes look like a dead fish at the mart.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.698
Why?

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:01.991
Is work tough?

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.453
It's not work,

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:08.957
if I had to say, it's because of a person.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.125
Hey, but you dug your own grave.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:11.584
Your fate,

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.336
you twisted it yourself.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:16.422
My headhunter friend said he'd introduce you to a better company,

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.340
but you said you were moving,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.009
and you insisted on going to that company.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.095
I guess I was possessed by something.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.849
Oh! Here.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.144
My friend I was supposed to meet later.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.438
Ah, he said he arrived early.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.148
You're okay, right?

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.442
See you here.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.069
So soon.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.279
Again.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:42.240
What will you drink?

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.158
Good.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.204
What is that?

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.999
A cocktail.

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.209
Blowjob.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.044
Ah...

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.255
So that's what it is.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.339
What?

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.799
Is this that famous?

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.969
I don't know about that,

00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.431
but you know this isn't my style, right?

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:07.473
What are you talking about?

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.600
Speak clearly, dude.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.270
There is something like that.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.230
Could I get the menu, please?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.195
Drink this.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:21.446
What?

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.947
It was tasty.

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:36.461
You seem to know Hangyeol, don't you?

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:41.716
It doesn't seem necessary to talk about the company here.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:44.218
Company talk?

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.014
I'm just talking about a person.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.560
Hangyeol,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.311
when you work with him,

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.146
he really stands out.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:57.982
He's diligent,

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.444
and sometimes cute too.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.406
Talking about others so carelessly,

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.534
isn't that rude?

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.790
Why?

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:15.875
Are you uncomfortable?

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:20.713
Manager Park,

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.590
why you become so cautious only in front of Hangyeol,

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.427
I'm curious.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:32.183
Because there's a reason.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.190
Hey.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.692
Why is the atmosphere like this?

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:42.902
Did you guys fight?

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:43.820
No, since we're from the same company,

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.196
we should stick together.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.281
We were just having a nice chat.

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:49.659
It didn't look like that.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.830
Manager Park.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.582
I have something to discuss with my friend today,

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.087
so I'm sorry but...

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:05.091
could you give us some space?

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:19.856
Ah, yes, Mr. Courier.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.482
About the package I inquired about yesterday.

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:26.195
Ah...

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:27.280
That is my old address.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.492
Ah, yes, understood.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.874
Haa...

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:41.586
Where is my mind?

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.080
Why are you here?

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.544
Because I missed you...

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:12.718
This isn't my house.

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.473
I know.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:29.402
Hangyeol.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:33.823
I'll ask just once.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:39.412
Are you okay?

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.378
Yes.
