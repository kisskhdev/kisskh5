(Utopia)

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.800
Why are you staring at me?

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.040
How would you know?
Were you staring at me?

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.760
What's so fun about that?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.760
What's so special about a cactus?

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.960
Mind your own business.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.800
Then you mind yours.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.160
Do you always talk to people like that?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.600
Normally I...

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.120
don't talk much.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.400
Then what was that just now?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.440
Not talking doesn't mean I can't talk.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.240
President Hu,
you should just head back.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.600
Relax.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.680
She'll come back.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.840
Cut it out.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.960
Think of a way to bring her back.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.240
Whatever you want, just name it.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.640
President Hu, what do you take me for?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.740
What kind of person do you think you are?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.360
Alright then.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.720
Let me give you a tip.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.480
Go buy one package from Keep Love.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.400
The Win-Back-the-Wife Redemption Package.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.840
It's perfect for you.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.520
You think I'm clueless?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.440
You think you're a genius?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.840
President Hu, President Hu.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.880
Take it easy.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.300
You might not know much
about Keep Love.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.440
It's the latest and hottest AI product.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.720
If you're curious about

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.000
that win-back-the-wife package

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.960
and want to try it,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.790
I can offer you a discount.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.040
Are you two crazy?

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.680
Let me be clear upfront.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.160
If anything happens to Ding Daang,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.520
Gu Ruomai,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.680
you won't get away with this.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.320
Do you think that

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.920
devoted men always win extra points?

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.320
Let me ask you something.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.000
Go ahead.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.480
If Hu Yitong

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.360
had actually tried to hurt me,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.360
would you have fought him?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.560
Of course, I definitely would.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.780
But I'm worried if this keeps up,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.360
things might be out of control.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.040
Gu... Miss Gu.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.320
Did your Keep Love ever tell you

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.840
I would treat you like this?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.440
No... never.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.840
Excited, huh?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.800
Expert Zhou.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.840
Only when you lose control,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.940
will you deserve excitement.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.200
Got... it.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.400
You've got some real skills.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.680
I lived alone all these years.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.880
If I didn't pick up new skills,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.280
life would've been too dull.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.840
I don't think I've asked you yet,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.600
why did you come back to Mancheng?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.000
Many functions in Keep Love

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.200
haven't been fully developed.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.240
My investor is based in Mancheng.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.480
He needs me to give him updates

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.260
on the project's progress anytime.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.960
You are still that perfect A-student,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.000
more successful than I imagined.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.440
That's not quite right.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.680
It depends on

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.080
how you define success.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.480
All these years,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.000
I've worked around the clock.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.200
Even Miaomiao said

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.840
I was like a machine built just for work.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.360
Speaking of Miaomiao,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.120
she should be...

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.760
about twenty now, right?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.680
How's she doing?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.840
Has she started seeing anyone?

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.800
I hardly ever...

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.440
get to see her.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.840
Remember I told you,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.200
everyone I care about

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.080
ends up leaving me.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.040
So I often feel like

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.640
I've let her down.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.080
Miaomiao!

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.960
Who told you to take that?

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.000
Why couldn't I have it?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.840
Give it here.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.760
Her family owes us this.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.320
What could she possibly owe us?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.280
We're the ones who owe her.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.320
Hand it over.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.520
Give it here!

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.600
Pass it to me.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.600
I want Mom to come back.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.120
I want her back.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.680
Mom's going to be fine.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.440
I warned you before.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.160
Stop bringing up the past.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.480
And I told you too.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.000
I'm not scared.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.280
I wasn't scared then,
even less now.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.120
But I am scared.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.320
I used to be.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.880
And I still am now.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.640
Doesn't that Keep Love

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.040
have an Emotional Healing System?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.200
So why didn't it heal you?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.360
Or was it...

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.480
just a big lie all along?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.520
Ding Daang.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.100
You're still the same,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.040
always so intense.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.040
I think compared to pain,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.800
a numbingly empty life

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.920
is what's truly terrifying.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640
I'm done eating.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.800
Your turn.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.800
By the way,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.520
your best friend
running off with my boss...

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.040
Isn't that a little too wild?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.720
Crazy things never last forever.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.960
Pass.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.160
Boss Gu,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.860
I recommend you buy an Assist Pack

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.920
from our Keep Love app.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.720
I don't go online.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.080
No internet, no phone.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.680
What, are you from ancient times?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.000
Pretty much.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.360
You sound so serious
even when you're making things up.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.200
UNO.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.440
Last card, blue.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.320
Hold on.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.160
Did you use Keep Love to track cards?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.880
This is tech boosting romance.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.120
The moment I shouted UNO just now,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.200
your heartbeat toward me

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.160
sped up by at least 12%.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.200
I'm enjoying the fun
of being old-fashioned.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.600
Give it a try?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.200
Not fun.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.880
Xibei.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.240
This younger brother of mine

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.520
lives in an old-fashioned way,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.960
but his soul is lively and interesting.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.880
He's your real brother?

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.360
Doesn't look like it?

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.440
- No.
- No.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.440
Boss, the investor's here.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.880
They're coming to see us next week.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.040
The investor still refuses to show up.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.000
You sure you want to take that risk?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.960
Miaomiao.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.240
Miaomiao is still suffering

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.920
from her breakup.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.390
Could this be a trick from our rivals?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.200
I want Mom to come back.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.680
I want Mom to come back.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.120
What's wrong?

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.360
You alright?

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.480
I'm fine.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.440
Just a stomach ache.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.960
If we do this,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.360
the risk is really high.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.480
You're free to go.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:30.880
The door's right there.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.880
Don't call me Chen Aming.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.720
My name is Yu Kun.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.240
Yu Kun, Yu Kun.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.090
When exactly will you

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.320
face who you truly are?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.640
Then when will you

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.320
stop turning cold without a word?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.160
All these years, I've never changed.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.120
You're the one who changed.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.480
A coward
who even abandoned your real name.
