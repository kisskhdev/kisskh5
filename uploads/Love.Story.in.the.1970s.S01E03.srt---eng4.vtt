00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.800
=Love Story in the 1970s=

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.940
=Episode 3=

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.730
Ms. Chen.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.280
Do you think

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.690
I'm just not meant for university?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.190
If even that comes down to fate,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.310
then maybe it's not worth going at all.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.850
But when you taught us,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.090
that's not what you said.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.790
If I hadn't read your essays,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.930
I wouldn't have dreamed of literature.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.030
If you hadn't always encouraged us

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.410
to study hard,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.890
to go to university,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.730
so we could see
a bigger world out there,

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.730
I wouldn't be this stubborn

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.670
about getting in.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.500
So now it's on me?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.840
Where there's a will,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.780
there's a way.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.410
Burn your bridges,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.340
and even the Qin strongholds
will fall to Chu.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.410
Heaven rewards...

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.780
- those who persevere.
- Heaven rewards those who persevere.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.660
Endure hardship,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.570
and three thousand
Yue soldiers can conquer Wu.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.820
The world's changing too fast.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.340
These days, I don't even know

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.460
if pushing you
toward university back then

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.260
was right or wrong.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.410
Either way,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.730
you were the only one

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.060
who supported me going.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.410
Whenever I started to lose faith,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.660
you kept encouraging me.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.570
So please,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.890
you can't waver now.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.780
Alright.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.930
Then I'll be

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.950
a pine tree

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.900
on the highest peak,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.080
always standing behind you.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.240
Rehabilitation Plan.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.490
First,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.370
physical exercise.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.100
Daily walks and sun exposure.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.340
Second, memory training.
Read the newspaper every day.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.190
(Rehabilitation Plan)
Finish one book a week.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.250
Third, improve nutrition.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.520
At least one meal
of refined grains a day.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.100
Meat once every two weeks.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.960
Fei Ni.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.990
What are you doing up so late?

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.250
Who are you talking to?

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.650
I'm just reading.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.880
Go to sleep.

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:00.950
Don't stay up too late.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.410
Forget it.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.690
Meat once a week...

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.860
And fruit.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.420
(Meat and fruit once a week)

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.860
(This money has to be sent
to my brother every month.)

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.170
(I can't touch it.)

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.450
(This is the family's
monthly living expenses.)

00:05:54.982 --> 00:05:56.190
(I can't touch this either.)

00:05:59.137 --> 00:05:59.900
(University Fund)

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.930
(Definitely not.)

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.610
(I've saved this for three years.)

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:06.420
(It's for my parents' living expenses
once I get into university.)

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.810
(I absolutely cannot touch it.)

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.490
(But meat and supplements cost money.)

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.420
(Should I borrow some from Ms. Xu?)

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.860
(No. No. No.)

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.100
(I can't ask the superior for money...)

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.520
(If word gets out later,)

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.930
(my commendation will be gone.)

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.300
(What am I going to do...)

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.471
(University Fund)
(This time, I'll have to dip into it.)

00:06:31.537 --> 00:06:33.860
(Otherwise Fang Muyang will really
be taken by his sister.)

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.610
(And my chance at university is gone!)

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.370
Fang Muyang.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.420
You have to get better this time.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.780
(Inpatient Department)

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.630
Fang Muyang.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.810
Can you come down first?

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.580
Whatever you want, just tell me.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.950
Come down first.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.648
I'm waiting for Fei Ni.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.160
It's always about Fei Ni.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.110
Is that all you know?

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.471
Does Fei Ni owe you something?

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.120
Cut it out.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.280
Alright, don't move!

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.660
I'll go get Fei Ni. Just don't move.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.448
- I'll go find Fei Ni for you.
- Fang Muyang!

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.810
Come down now.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.510
Fei Ni!

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.340
Why are you sitting up there?

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.310
Quick, come down.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.730
Hurry.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.930
What's going on?

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.630
She's taking me away.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.090
I don't know her.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.660
You're still smiling?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.370
That was dangerous.

00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:10.980
Come here.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.980
I'll talk to her, alright?

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.200
Sit here.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.540
Head Nurse,
could you watch him for a bit?

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.420
Alright.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.220
- Go on, we've got him.
- Okay.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.800
Don't go up the window ledge.

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.820
(Rehabilitation Plan)
This is the recovery plan

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.537
I've prepared for Fang Muyang.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.770
Dr. Liang said

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.400
he's only lost his memory.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.180
His cognitive ability is fine.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.540
So I'll start

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.450
by teaching him basic life skills,

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.780
(Rehabilitation Plan)
until he can take care of himself.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.680
If he regains his memory along the way,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.950
that would be ideal.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.390
But if he doesn't,

00:09:44.382 --> 00:09:46.226
he'll still be able to live normally.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.100
So,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.060
could you not send him
to a sanatorium?

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.810
I know

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.730
you can't bear to either.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.100
Do you see me
the same way the other nurses do?

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.690
Like I'm cold-blooded?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.580
You have your own difficulties, too.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.080
Honestly, I admire you.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.120
If it were someone else,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.110
they might not be as...

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.180
clear-headed.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.470
Clear-headed?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.370
You mean selfish.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.315
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.210
You've already done the best you can

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.460
within your means.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.130
No one has the right

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.570
to ask you to sacrifice yourself
for someone else.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.350
Not even your own brother.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.270
Then what about you?

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.370
Why are you willing
to give up your time

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.700
to look after him?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.840
It's not a sacrifice. I...

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.760
I truly admire...

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.700
Fang Muyang.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.060
So don't worry.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.420
I'll take the best possible care of him.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.730
My brother...

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.650
He's never done
anything to be proud of.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.026
And now he's become a hero.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.640
I'm counting on you.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.660
(Jiangcheng)

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.250
Excuse me. Passing through.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.300
Excuse me. Passing through.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:36.980
Comrade.

00:11:38.204 --> 00:11:39.140
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.610
Alright. Comrade.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.060
Hello, that's my seat.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.026
Hey, watch your hands.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.300
Please move.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.640
That's my seat.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.770
You're funny.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.180
On a train, whoever sits first owns it.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.580
Since when is it yours?

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.860
It is my seat.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.140
There's a seat number on it.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.070
Not anymore.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.010
Get up.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.010
You... you...

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.010
Thug.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.650
People like you

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.680
have no morals, no shame.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.410
(Qu Hua)
All you do is bully the weak.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.350
If the one sitting here today
were a six-foot man,

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.410
would you still dare?

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.880
How can a scum like you

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.090
even get to live in this world?

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.000
You're worse than a toad in a cesspit.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.700
At least a toad eats pests!

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.410
But you?

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.580
You're like flies, mosquitoes,
and bedbugs!

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.780
All you do is disgust people

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.010
and waste resources.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.860
What gives you the right?

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.690
How do people like you

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:41.950
get to

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.490
run around

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.700
bullying people?

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.250
(He has never harmed anyone,)

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.460
(yet he has to suffer like that!)

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.830
Why?

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.410
How dare you hit me?

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.650
Hey, don't yell at her!

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.890
Everyone saw that.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:01.820
I didn't touch her.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.890
I didn't do anything!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.820
Make way, please.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.410
Make way.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.740
I'm a doctor. Please move aside.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.120
Keep the air flowing.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.100
Make way, please.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.671
You're awake.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.300
Who are you?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.010
How did I end up here?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.560
I'm a doctor.

00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:47.130
Your blood sugar was too low.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.220
And you got overly agitated just now.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.220
So, you fainted.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.950
But it's nothing serious.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.230
Have some sugar and get proper rest.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.770
Thank you.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.860
This is my berth.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.280
You can lie here.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.360
I'll go sit in your seat later.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.220
I can't do that.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.940
Treating patients is my responsibility.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.580
You need to rest right now.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.180
I can't take advantage of you.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.740
Besides, you said I'm fine.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.026
If you insist on leaving,

00:14:19.071 --> 00:14:20.271
(Biscuits)
have this.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.160
I'm getting off at the next stop.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.240
I've already spoken to the conductor.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.370
He'll come find you later

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.000
to top up the sleeper ticket

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.730
for the rest of your journey.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.680
No need.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.690
Thank you.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.790
You study mathematics?

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.770
When you fainted earlier,

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.280
while I was carrying you up,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.370
the things in your bag fell out.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.460
(Jiangcheng University Staff ID)

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.250
Get some proper rest.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.380
I'll leave you be.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.560
(Director Wu, I've made up my mind.)

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.560
I'm going to cut ties

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.293
with my “Black Five
Categories” parents.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.840
These are all the letters and photos

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.700
they sent me.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.550
Please trust

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:23.693
(Professor Wu)
my loyalty to the revolutionary cause.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:24.980
And please believe

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.220
that I'm willing to devote my life

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.648
to our nation's mathematics.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.780
I'm applying
to remain at the university.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.390
Even doing odd jobs is fine.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.460
(Advanced Mathematics)

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.100
I heard from your sister
that you like drawing.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.230
I bought these for you.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.900
(Colored Pencils)

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.980
(Watercolors)

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.060
(Fang Muyang never stuck
with anything growing up.)

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.920
Except for drawing.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.500
He's kept at it all these years.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.610
If possible,

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.020
get him a sketchbook.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.450
It might help his memory recover sooner.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.410
Thank you.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:27.840
Fei Ni.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.000
Use them sparingly.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.990
These art supplies aren't cheap.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.080
When I saw your sister off
at the station,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.004
she left you a hundred yuan.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.890
Can you manage money?

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.040
Forget it.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.950
I'll hold onto it for you.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.120
In case you get scammed again.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.093
Don't worry, I won't spend a cent of it.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:58.560
If you like it,

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:00.137
it's all yours.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.560
Don't talk nonsense.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.110
Taking advantage of a hero?

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.700
You could get me into trouble.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:06.920
Alright.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.550
No more nonsense.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.740
Anyway,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.170
if there's anything

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.930
you feel like eating, just tell me.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.410
I'll take good care of you.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.720
But you've got to try hard
to remember the past.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.680
When your sister comes again,
you have to tell her

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.040
I've been taking good care of you.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.820
Sure.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.900
(Jiangnan Station)

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.170
Hello.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.780
The conductor never came.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.180
So I figured
you didn't get off early after all.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.580
This is the sleeper fare.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:02.960
Thank you.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.960
Watch and learn.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.410
Cut along this line.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.860
Don't go past it.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.240
Or you'll bleed.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.550
There, one nail done.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.300
Not hard.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.600
Your turn.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.020
Slowly.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:40.780
Okay.

00:20:50.271 --> 00:20:51.382
What are you doing?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.040
You...

00:20:53.137 --> 00:20:54.040
What are you doing?

00:20:54.248 --> 00:20:55.340
I'm helping you cut them.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.230
Did you do that on purpose?

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.220
Did you remember
I cut your finger before,

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.500
so this is payback?

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.360
I don't remember.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.780
It's okay.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:25.650
Take it slow.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.580
From now on,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.700
I'm going to teach you
basic life skills.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.080
Brushing your teeth,
washing your hair and face,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.640
tying your shoelaces,
mending clothes, and doing laundry.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.040
You'll have to
learn to do all these yourself.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.630
There's a reward if you do well.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.520
Pull it up.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.170
Nicely brushed.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.760
- Braised pork.
- Deal.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.780
All neat and tidy.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.137
Fang Muyang, how do you learn so fast?

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.880
Pork cutlet.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.130
We don't have that.

00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:23.804
Deda Western Restaurant does.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.520
Did you remember something?

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.800
The pork cutlet
at Deda Western Restaurant,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.690
the ice cream and borscht,
Yuhua Restaurant's meatballs,

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.250
and the beef noodles
on Shangcheng Street.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.720
Why is it all food?

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.310
Didn't you remember anything else?

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.020
The train station.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.660
What about the train station?

00:22:48.804 --> 00:22:50.580
The brown sugar
pancakes they sell there.

00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:53.980
Fang Muyang, you're exactly
the same as when you were little.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.410
All you think about is food.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.740
I'll tell my sister

00:22:56.782 --> 00:22:58.448
you've been taking great care of me.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:00.690
Alright.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:01.780
(University Fund)

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.450
(Madam Xu)
Hello, your pork cutlet.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.490
Thank you.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.340
You're welcome.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.820
I'm not eating it.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.740
Braised pork.

00:23:17.804 --> 00:23:19.240
Beef noodles from Shangcheng Street.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.580
Yuhua Restaurant's meatballs,
and borscht.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.410
Washed up nice and clean.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.860
Coffee.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.580
Co-what?

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.580
Hello.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.140
You sure you want coffee

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.830
served in this enamel mug?

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:41.650
Yes.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.610
Impressive.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.300
I pricked my hand.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.690
It's fine.
I'll put some antiseptic on it later.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.520
Red...

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.550
Remember something?

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.693
Red wine.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.290
What?

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.060
I want red wine.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.420
(Fang Mujing, 100 yuan)

00:24:16.982 --> 00:24:19.004
I said I wouldn't spend a cent,
and I won't.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.800
It's not like I'd cheat him.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.160
I can earn it back.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.930
One yuan a bottle.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:43.890
That's right.

00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:50.890
I don't want it anymore.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.650
So salty and spicy.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:34.960
Maybe...

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.970
the grapes weren't great this year.
Just make do.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:38.860
I'm off to work.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.030
I want to hear music.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.640
Fang Muyang, don't push it.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.930
I'll tell my sister

00:25:44.382 --> 00:25:46.115
you've been taking great care of me.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.930
Just one minute.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.940
Have him take his medicine.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.210
Okay.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.860
Take your medicine.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.650
You're leaving?

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.450
Yeah, heading home for dinner.

00:26:44.626 --> 00:26:45.920
I've got the night shift later.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.860
Can you help trim my nails again?

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:50.280
I...

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:51.890
I...

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.980
Didn't I already teach you?

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.300
You learned it.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.820
I forgot again.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.300
I've been biting them off.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:06.540
Alright, alright.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.370
Stop biting. Sit down.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.530
Take your medicine first.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.270
Look.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.820
Just don't go past this line.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.580
Or it'll bleed.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.890
See? It comes right off.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.260
Cut along here. See that?

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.750
Fang Muyang.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.610
Fang Muyang, look at me.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.870
Turn around.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.520
Are you tricking me?

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.650
You already know how.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.182
You just wanted me to do it for you.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:55.860
Yes.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.480
Don't think that just because
I buy you food and drinks,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.560
and art supplies, it's a given.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.010
From now on, every bit of effort
I put in for you

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.020
comes with a price.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.060
Everything I've done,

00:28:13.293 --> 00:28:14.404
I'll let it slide.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.880
From today onward, it's fixed rates.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.490
Actually,

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:21.670
things like trimming nails,

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.790
tidying clothes,

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.480
these don't really cost anything.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.010
I shouldn't be charging you for them.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.440
It's also a task
assigned to me by the factory.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.240
But,

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.370
if I teach you more than three times

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.400
and you still can't learn,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.780
then I'll charge per session.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.880
Also, when you buy
sketchbooks and art supplies,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.150
or anything you want to eat,
like fried pork cutlet,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.580
coffee,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:42.770
or wine,

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.500
it all gets deducted
from the hundred yuan.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:45.540
Agreed?

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.940
Look here.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.370
Nail trimming, clothes tidying,

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.190
(Fee Schedule)
shaving, three cents each time.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.100
Hair washing, sponge baths,
laundry, sewing buttons,

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.170
ten cents each time.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.260
Food, drink, clothing,
and daily expenses

00:29:06.582 --> 00:29:07.915
are reimbursed as spent.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.260
You nodded just now.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.540
Sign here.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.140
(Both Parties Sign)

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:18.890
The name.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.170
How do I write it?

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.800
Nail trimming.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.580
I'm charging you now.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.460
Go ahead.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.570
Okay.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.320
Speaking of money,

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.580
I just remembered.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.390
You still owed me money
back in middle school.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.260
Don't run.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.380
(Six Years Earlier)

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.650
Fei Ni, I've got no money for food.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:17.680
Lend me some?

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.870
Don't your family give you money?

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.130
How much do you want?

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.430
How much do you have?

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:37.390
This little?

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.337
It's not even enough
for one brown sugar cake.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.170
Just give me everything you've got.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.680
I'll pay you back double.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.660
Really?

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.520
Of course.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:47.820
If you don't believe me,

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.470
I'll leave my sketchbook as collateral.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.890
I've got no use for that.

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.120
When my grandma gets back,

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.660
I'll buy you a chocolate and cream cake.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.280
No need to treat me.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.150
Just pay me back.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.060
Thanks.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:05.690
Here.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.900
Borrowed five cents,
paying back ten.

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:08.980
Double, right?

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:09.860
Okay.

00:31:11.915 --> 00:31:13.450
Can you lend me another twenty cents?

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:14.940
I'll pay you back forty,

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.500
and treat you to a brown sugar pancake.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.170
You're broke again?

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.430
Didn't I just repay you?

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.950
Besides, I'll have money
once my grandma's back.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.890
Skip the pancake.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.200
By your rules,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.230
just pay me forty.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.300
A promise is a promise.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.950
When?

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.030
Sunday.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.330
I'll come find you.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.070
Where do you live?

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:42.220
(Jiangcheng No. 1
Textile Factory Family Quarters)

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.370
Come on, let's go play at Jingshan Park.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:47.610
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.640
My mom said

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.580
Jingshan Park is gorgeous
this time of year.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:51.450
Yeah!

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.500
My mom said
all the flowers are blooming.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.630
Then let's go.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.370
Come on!

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:57.580
Fei Ni, you coming?

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.020
I'll pass. You guys go ahead.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.715
- Okay!
- Let's go!

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.700
Fei Ni, dinner's ready.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.170
I won't bother
with all those years of interest.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.590
You've got money now.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.330
Why don't we settle up?

00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.810
I don't remember.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:02.690
Fine.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.120
You will someday.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.580
Fang Muyang.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.930
I already washed these.

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:16.210
Why did you wash them again?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.370
You said I should learn.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:21.800
I...

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.780
I told you to learn,

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.930
not ruin them.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.580
How am I supposed to fix this now?

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.100
And you're laughing?

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.240
Ni.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:42.840
Yeah?

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.430
What are you doing?

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.370
Those are from ten years ago.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:48.740
Why dig them out?

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.610
I'm making Fang Muyang a shirt.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:54.300
Be serious.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.900
Look at his build,

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.960
and look at mine.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.880
I'll just add a bit to the length.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:04.800
Well,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.510
my daughter's got
brains and good hands.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.460
(Save the Dying, Heal the Wounded
Serving Workers and Peasants)

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.520
The fabric's old,

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.810
but buying new cloth
and making one from scratch

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:01.930
would cost a lot.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.493
And you don't have fabric coupons.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.410
So?

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:06.900
It's unique.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.500
Nice color too.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.070
Color...

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:11.410
Mom,

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.480
where are the cloth scraps?

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:18.260
Looks good, right?

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.090
I picked it out carefully.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.220
Since you seem happy with it,

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.204
I'll charge you two yuan.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.050
What?

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.920
It'd cost more in a shop.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.248
I'm already giving you a deal.

00:35:32.893 --> 00:35:33.710
I don't want it.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:34.700
Wait, wait.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.480
One fifty. That's my final offer.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.050
Fang Muyang.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.950
So you've learned to bargain now?

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.730
You taught me.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.700
Fair enough.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.550
That's a useful skill.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.830
You'll need it.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.200
Look at this.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.410
I restocked everything for you.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:01.560
Draw and think wisely.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.270
Or I've wasted my money.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.300
I have money.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.050
That doesn't mean you waste it.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.060
Wait.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.490
I'll draw you.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.250
Why me?

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.730
You told me to draw.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:17.530
I...

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.410
Fine.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.560
Turn a bit.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.370
Fang Muyang,

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.100
you really don't remember

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.460
anything from school?

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.660
You scared me with that dead fly,

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:06.220
and I twisted my ankle.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.420
And that time you splashed mud
all over me on your bike.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.940
With genes like yours,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.650
your mom's a university lecturer,

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.210
your dad's a famous painter,

how did none of that pass on to you?

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.271
You even had to repeat a year.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.780

How much does a photo cost at a studio?

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.660
For one this size,

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.780
about one yuan.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.510
I'll charge you fifty cents.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.900
Fang Muyang,
now you're making money off me?

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.180
You taught me.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.260
You messing with me?

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.170
At this rate,

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.490
your memory should be back soon.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.182
I'll draw you every day.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:07.980
No charge.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.390
No need.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:14.500
One is enough.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.320
Some things

00:39:16.715 --> 00:39:18.271
are more precious with rarity.

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:20.860
I like it.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:21.860
Thanks.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:28.860
Oh, right,

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.440
I'll take you to
meet someone this weekend.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:32.320
Okay.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.426
You don't want to know who?

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.660
Not really.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.240
I wouldn't remember anyway.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.180
I'll grab you a carrot.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.660
Everyone, watch closely.

00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:11.410
(Fei Ting)
Planting rice seedlings is simple.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.700
Shallow water, shallow planting.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.093
Plant them steadily and straight.

00:40:15.137 --> 00:40:16.680
One thing to watch out for

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.050
is not to plant them too deeply.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.770
They'll drown in a few days.

00:40:21.915 --> 00:40:22.804
One more thing.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.980
Mind the gap between each seedling...

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.640
Fei Ting, Fei Ting.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.400
Your partner's on the phone.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.890
Go take it at the commune.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:31.990
Coming.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.220
You all try first.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:45.380
Hello?

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:46.640
Fei Ting,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.400
is the return report ready?

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.200
I...

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:51.780
I got it.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.180
I got it ready.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.270
So why no updates?

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:58.870
No. There's been
a lot of work in the fields lately.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.260
Everyone's swamped.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.400
The regiment leader
hasn't had time for this.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.080
Maybe give it a bit longer.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.570
Don't dodge the question.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.490
Your fracture never healed properly.

00:41:07.515 --> 00:41:09.048
Your medical discharge was approved.

00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:10.150
Is the leader too busy,

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.820
or did you never submit the report?

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.340
Fei Ting, be honest with me.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.620
Did you never plan to come back?

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.890
Did you never plan to marry me?

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.100
If that's the case, just say it.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.250
If we're done, so be it.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:28.800
I'm not clinging to you.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.404
Go find someone else then.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.690
I'm not going back.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.790
Fine. I will.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:56.740
(Jiangcheng University)

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.780
Spread out.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.820
Stop reading for a second.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.740
The one who just scored was Ye Feng.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.448
His mom's the administration director
at Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.050
Come on, let's return the books.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.300
Hua,

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.370
I just remembered
I've got something to do.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:34.410
Can you return them for me?

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.140
Sure.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:47.740
Move it to the side.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:48.690
To the side.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.380
Shift it over!

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.140
Careful.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.700
Hey, are you okay?

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.050
I'm fine.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.820
Fine? It's already red.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.580
Zu, cover for me a sec.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.450
Let's go to the infirmary. Come.
