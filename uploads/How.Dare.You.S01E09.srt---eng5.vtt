WEBVTT

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.890
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.910
[Episode 9]

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.710
What Flower Festival Banquet?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.970
I think they're just bored
and want to waste money.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.229
Common people can barely afford to eat,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.520
yet they still have time
for such frivolities.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.610
This isn't the way back to the palace.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.830
I didn't dare call out to you
since you were walking this way

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.960
with your head down.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.570
No wonder.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.090
-Let's—
-Consort Yu.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.770
The palace is so big,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.570
yet somehow I run into him everywhere.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.370
Such bad luck.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.270
Your Highness.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.090
Consort Yu.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.340
May I have a word with you?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.550
Wait for me over there.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.660
Yes.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.430
Your Highness,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.650
what brings you here?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.770
When I was young
and hadn't left the palace,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.210
if the servants beat me,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.410
I'd hide here

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.650
and only return late at night.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.890
So now that I have time,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590
I wanted to come back and take a look.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.530
Here it comes.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.780
The villain's monologue.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.730
Wanyin.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.510
Why do I feel that

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.790
we've grown distant?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.320
It's not that.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.580
It's just that this place

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.270
has too many prying eyes.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.150
My secret guards are watching the area.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.540
No one will come.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.700
Regarding what I said last time,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.210
have you thought about it?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.540
Can Your Highness foresee

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.680
my decision too?

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.780
What do you think?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.400
Dodging the question.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.290
Good thing I'm prepared.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.760
I panicked that day,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.930
and my words

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.630
may have offended Your Highness.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.060
I embroidered this myself.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.320
Swallows

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.170
flying together.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.310
It's "The Return of the Condor Heroes."

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.880
You must've put some thought into this.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.740
As long as Your Highness likes it.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.940
Your Highness predicts things like a god,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.580
always making a move first.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.790
Could it be that you are also...

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.830
Also what?

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.620
One with foresight?

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.450
Yes.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.529
I gained it

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.870
quite recently.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.769
In your dreams,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.930
do you often see

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.370
strange sights

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.930
but don't know what they mean?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.120
They look...

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.500
quite blurry.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.570
Dream interpretation is difficult.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.370
It's hard to explain it clearly.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.970
It is said those of the highest level

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.480
can see all beings in the Six Realms.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.260
Just by closing their eyes,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.450
they can reveal heaven's secrets.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.820
But everyone is different,

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.800
so what they see

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.180
varies.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.510
Makes sense.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.250
Since Your Highness is a prince,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.340
can you see more?

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.550
Things further in the future?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.960
A few days ago, I foresaw in a dream

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.910
that an expert appeared
beside His Majesty.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.430
He took you out of the palace in disguise

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.400
to a lake

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.370
to speak with some commoners.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.570
I was merely worried about your safety,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.870
so I sent men to follow you secretly.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.340
But unexpectedly,
this expert acted without any warning

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.340
and killed many of my secret guards.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.450
With such a dangerous person by your side,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.150
how can I be at ease?

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.760
He beat around the bush

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.520
just to get things out of me.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.450
I'd never seen this person

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.910
in the palace either.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.430
I was truly terrified that day.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.909
What about after returning to the palace?

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.380
Have you seen him?

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.780
No, I haven't.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.700
Is that so?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.980
Your Highness,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.090
do you not believe me?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.080
Of course not.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.170
I wonder if you could use your foresight

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.030
to divine for me

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.030
where this person

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.480
is right now.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.010
Doesn't Your Highness know

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.320
that the scenes in the dreams

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.260
are bizarre

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.620
and bestowed by the will of Heaven.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.440
It is not something we can dream

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.770
just because we want to.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.780
Perhaps, just for my sake,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.360
give it a try,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.880
will you?

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.909
Insidious.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.100
Cunning.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.070
-My Lady, wait for me!
-Thick-skinned too!

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.060
My Lady!

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.950
[Zhaoyang Hall]

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.460
I'm so pissed off.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.330
It's exhausting every time I talk to him.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.900
What does Xie Yong'er see in him anyway?

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.300
He flirts everywhere and plays both sides.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.700
Quite fitting of his name Duan
which means to balance both sides.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.490
Your Highness,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.830
Dan has something very important

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.510
for you.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.340
What?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.080
Dan asked me to watch you
practice calligraphy.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.060
Calligraphy?

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.140
I did want to practice brush writing,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.710
but I have other things
to think about now.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.690
I have no time.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.910
You can always make time.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.480
[Yong]

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.780
Besides,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.000
Dan said Your Highness

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.030
only needs to practice
the character "Yong" well,

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.960
and you'll master all characters.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.690
He wrote this for you personally.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.409
[Yong]

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:40.340
Don't let his kindness go to waste.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.020
It looks pretty decent.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.070
When did he practice this behind my back?

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.659
Just practice, Your Highness.

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:49.990
I'll stay here with you.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.150
I won't go anywhere.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.780
Yong.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.510
Yong.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.220
Yong.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.330
The "Yong" in Xie Yong'er.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.420
Yong.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.660
Crap.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.930
I fell for Prince Duan's trap.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.220
All that nonsense I spouted—

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.020
he definitely didn't buy it all.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.240
With his cautious nature,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.070
he might go check with
Xie Yong'er right away.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.270
If Xie Yong'er doesn't say
she gained the foresight,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.990
and our stories don't match,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.169
then I'm doomed.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.630
Mr. Bei.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.350
Tell me,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.830
how can you make someone keep a secret

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.150
and not tell anyone else?

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
How is your relationship with them?

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.140
Not good.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.610
Whatever I say,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.420
she won't believe a single word.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.080
Lock her up.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.010
That won't work.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.180
I can't lock her up forever.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.180
Then silence her.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.160
That's even worse.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.100
She has to stay alive.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.100
Then I don't know.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.910
Nothing works.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.220
What should I do?

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.970
Your Highness.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.570
You...

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.440
[Yong]

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.120
Oh shoot.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.260
What the hell did I write?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.780
Your handwriting, Your Highness,

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.350
is like wandering dragons
and painted phoenixes.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.880
If you take it to the market,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.880
it could ward off evil spirits.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.050
Thanks for the compliment, Mr. Bei.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.060
Ward off evil spirits...

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.200
I got it!

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.590
Prince Duan is definitely a 2D character.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.590
He suspects you, me,
and Xie Yong'er are the same kind.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.470
I lied that the three of us
gained the foresight,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.730
and fooled him for now.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.900
But just in case Xie Yong'er's story
doesn't match ours,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.340
we need to stage a supernatural event

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.300
to scare her.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.630
Anyway, we can't let Prince Duan

"Transmigrated:
The Devil's Beloved Consort."

I am not sure about that.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.040
But ever since you attended to him,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.630
His Majesty has been lost in thought alone

your drunken ramblings

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.780
really scared me to death.

So it was all a misunderstanding.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.850
Do not blame me, my dear.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.190
After all,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.400
No one wants their bedfellow

why are you here alone?

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.690
Your Highness,

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.590
His Majesty is busy
with official business,

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.940
s-so I...

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.420
did not stay the night,

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.450
and wanted to take a walk.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.720
Why are you here?

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.390
His Majesty summoned me

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.070
to discuss matters.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.120
What a coincidence.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.880
Ever since the library fire,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.230
it has been inconvenient for me
to come to the harem.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.380
Seeing you

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.079
is harder than ascending to the heavens.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:05.760
Yes.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.230
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.849
Then why did you

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.250
not write to me?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.500
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.900

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.680
No matter how selfish I am,

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.339
how could I put my beloved

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.070
in danger?

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440
Your Highness...

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.470
I have one more question.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.500
The silk pouch you gave me,

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.100
contained a brilliant plan.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.550
It was truly ingenious.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.300
But you stay in the harem all day,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.300
and have no contact with those people.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.560
How did you know

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.090
about these secrets?

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.850
I...

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.110
no one wants their bedfellow

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.590
to be on the other side.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.260
What is it?

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.500
I

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.360
know a little divination.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.970
I often see things about the future

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.350
in my dreams.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.920
Something like that...

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.840
Your Highness,

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.210
you can understand it this way.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.390
I'm the kind of person
described in storybooks

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.590
who knows divination

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.130
and gains foresight through dreams.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.510
Otherwise, how could I foresee the future?

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.940
It's just that when these dreams come

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.150
and whether they are accurate

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:42.080
depend entirely

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.350
on heaven's will.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.740
That is why I never

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.200
told you the truth before.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.150
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.370
Your Highness,

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.430
someone is coming.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.760
Don't worry.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.960
I will keep your secret.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.200
Did Xie Yong'er really say that

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.860
last night?

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.790
Word for word.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.210
Thank you, Mr. Bei,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.720
for eavesdropping for me.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.620
Anything for you.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.670

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:39.980

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.480
She laughed so hard.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.330
You actually summoned Prince Duan
to the palace on purpose

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.260

When can we get rid of Xie Yong'er?

I make her drunk every day.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.960
I can't drink anymore.

how there was no distinction

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.100

The Empress Dowager has Luo Yi too.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.870
That puts us at a disadvantage.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.180
Usually,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.550
the Empress Dowager uses Luo Yi
to keep General Luo in line.

But in a crisis,

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.330
he could become a weapon used against us.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.270

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.360
Send a message to Mr. Murong.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.190
Ask him if he has any ideas.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.700
That way,

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.700
we can distract the Empress Dowager

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.120
so she won't trouble Luo Yi.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.030
It will also show General Luo

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.750
that we are doing our part.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.570
Yes.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.210
Your Highness.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.380
Your Highness.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.170
T-Then...

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.080
What about this horse?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.580
You can have it.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.210
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.700
Military officials
returning to the capital to report

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.560
must not stay longer than 15 days.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.740
General Luo didn't leave
until the morning of the 16th day.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.970
This can be either a minor or major issue.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.070
[Chen Danian,
Chen Dasui's brother]

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.080
I can find an excuse

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.370
to charge him with perverting the law.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.940
Don't we have his son?

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.250
Instead of convicting him,

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.230
why not find a way
to make him useful to us?

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.300
Lord Chen,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.750
don't just talk.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.700
Don't be like your brother.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.220
Use your brain.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.330
Yes.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.550
Empress Dowager,

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.240
I have finished confiscating
the Wei estate.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.380
We seized

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.110
15 property deeds
and 20,000 taels of gold.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.760
Here is the inventory.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.730
Grand Tutor Wei
was convicted by the Emperor.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.400
Let him handle it.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.710
His Majesty is unfamiliar
with state affairs.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.500
Matters of the court, big or small,

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.260
still require your decision,
Your Majesty.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.710
Which should go to the treasury,

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.630
and which should not—

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.760
it is your decision, Your Majesty.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.510
[Great Xia Agriculture]

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.510
[Sweet Potato]

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.660
[Great Xia Agriculture]

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.750
How long have you been

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.640
recording in this book?

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.070
About 10 years.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.350
For these 10 years,

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.830
I have maintained across Great Xia

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.070
a small experimental field in each region.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.440
It was to study the climate, soil,

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.460
planting times, irrigation methods,
and other factors' impact

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.610
on the harvest.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.790
I now have a system on

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.730
what to plant and how to plant

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.220
in which area.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:51.540
Lord Cen,

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:53.700
do the crops listed

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.350
include Yan millet?

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:56.590
Yan millet?

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.120
It should be...

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.340
just some sporadic records.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.110
It is not common in Great Xia.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.500
What about other drought-resistant crops?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.190
Why do you ask, Your Highness?

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.150
The Imperial Astronomer reports

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.980
an anomaly in the celestial phenomena.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.180
In the next two years,

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.560
there will be a severe drought.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.820
This matter

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.500
is top secret.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.010
I

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.630
will not leak a word.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.130
It hasn't happened yet.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.790
If we prepare now,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.180
when the time comes,

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.240
no one will starve.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.300
Official Cen?

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.760
Although Yan millet tastes poor,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.700
it ripens two to three times a year.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.270
If planted widely,

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.490
it could indeed
save lives during a drought.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.710
Great Xia

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.530
has no tradition of planting Yan millet.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.230
To start planting now,

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.240
we must first convince the people.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.550
As for Yan millet seeds,

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:14.750
perhaps the court can

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.530
purchase them from Yan State.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.160
The treasury is empty.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.850
The court has no money.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.900
And there is much friction on the border
between Yan State and Great Xia.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.700
And now,

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.830
the military power
is entirely in Prince Duan's hands,

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.830
and the national treasury is empty.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.280
Neither soft nor hard tactics

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.610
can be implemented.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.270
But I must introduce Yan millet

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.800
to save the people from disaster.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.350
That is why

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.270
I have gathered you all here

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.650
to discuss a solution.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.110
I have an idea.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.720
We might not need to spend any money

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:01.690
to obtain

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.040
a large amount of Yan millet seeds.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.080
Can you be more specific?

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.400
We shall take our leave.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.780
What's wrong?

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.050
Is your head hurting again?

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.410
A little.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.250
These ministers

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.290
are actually quite reliable.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.180
Let's follow their plan

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.240
step by step.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:57.790
Maybe we really can

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.380
prevent the drought.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:00.900
Yes.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.330
You finally have

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.290
right-hand men,

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.500
no longer fighting alone.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.130
But you don't sound happy about it.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.670
Are we being too optimistic?

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.790
What if Prince Duan

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.659
and the Empress Dowager get in our way?

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.210
Or what if

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.639
they get suspicious

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.699
and discover our entire plan?

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.860
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.659
Leave it to me.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:42.620
So you've already thought it through.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:48.070
Wanyin.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:49.639
Sit down.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.840
There's something

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.910
I've been wanting
to ask you for a long time.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.700
Who do you think leaked the news

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.280
of our meeting
with the scholars on the lake

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.300
to Prince Duan?

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:21.260
I haven't figured that out either.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.800
You think it was me,

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:24.680
right?

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.300
You think I leaked the news
to Prince Duan,

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.300
then put on a show for the scholars,

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.480
going so far as to

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.160
sacrifice a life

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:37.570
just to win their trust.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:42.420
Oh, right.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.400
The fire in the library—

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.410
do you also think I did it?

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.820
After all, judging by the outcome,

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.480
Xu Yao was backed into a corner

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.890
and indeed handed over that book.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.740
And all these incidents,

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.250
the one who benefited the most

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.990
was me.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.340
It's not because of that.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.000
Then why?

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:15.870
That day on the boat,

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.120
we talked to the scholars
for four whole hours.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.730
Today in the Imperial Study,

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.590
we talked for another four hours.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.500
You said a lot

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.750
and showed off a lot of knowledge,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.690
but your knowledge of economics

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.250
is just as sad as mine.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.170
Which company are you from?

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:40.970
What does this company do?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.190
When was it listed?

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.630
What was its market value

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.770
before you came here?

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.000
Who are you?
