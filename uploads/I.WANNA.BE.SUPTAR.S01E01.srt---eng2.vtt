00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.280
(Suvarnabhumi Airport)

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.200
This is the final boarding
announcement for flight...

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.600
Is that P’Win Pawee?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.480
How would I know which Win?

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.760
Is that P’Win Pawee?

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.040
- Right?
- Is it? Are you sure?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.800
Win Pawee? Or maybe...

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.520
- Win Pawee?
- Is it really?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.680
Hurry, over there! Hurry!

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240
It really is P’Win Pawee!

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.320
I’m a huge fan!

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.480
P’Win, where have you been
all these years?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.080
Can we take a photo with you?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.840
Excuse me, I have to go now.
Thank you.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.720
P’Win Pawee! P’Win!

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.800
Please look at the camera.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.840
Confident, gorgeous.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.000
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040
- Win.
- Tom.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.080
Sorry.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.920
Sorry.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.440
P’Win! P’Win!

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.680
- P’Win.
- Excuse me.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.880
P’Win.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.360
P’Win.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.000
Still has so many fans.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.560
Fans or sasaengs, honestly?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.200
So...

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.040
Going home now?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.640
Not yet. I’m hungry.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.120
Hello, My FC?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.360
This is Wanneung speaking.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.880
May I take a photo, please?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.760
The place is in front of Building A, right, Tom?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.960
Wrong building.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.080
Okay, I’ll be right there.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600
Is that a celebrity?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040
Excuse me.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.200
Sorry, I just need a moment of your time.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.760
I picked up your wallet.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.280
Thank you.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.800
Win Pawee.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.400
When did you get back to Thailand?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.680
Is this your wallet?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.080
I found your wallet.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.760
I found a superstar’s wallet.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.200
- P’Win.
- P’Win!

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.080
Win Pawee.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.080
I’m just excited.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.960
Win Pawee’s wallet.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.680
My hands totally froze.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.960
Thank you for finding it.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.160
Win Pawee thanked me. Oh my God.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.560
May I take a photo, please?

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.240
Just one selfie, please.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.840
Excuse me.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.520
- Hello?
- Is that Wanneung?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.880
- You have a shoot today. You didn’t forget, right?
- I remember. I’m on my way.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.120
Stand-in, stop messing around.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.000
- Yes.
- On five, four, three, two, one, then join in.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.480
- Got it.
- Ready. Three, two, one.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.000
Recording, right?

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.400
Raise your left side.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.840
Excuse me.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.480
Where’s the director?

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.560
The director?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.160
Up front, briefing the camera crew.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.840
Please let them know Wanneung has arrived.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.960
If there’s a briefing, I’m ready.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.520
Sure.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.000
And could I get some water?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.520
Room-temperature mineral water, please.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.480
It’s just that...

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.560
We’ll need to use your voice today.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.200
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.360
Who is this?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.200
Hi, I’m Wanneung.
I’m the actor for today’s commercial.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.720
Wait, are you the armpit stand-in?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.640
- Yes.
- I’ve been looking everywhere. What are you doing here?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.160
Where’s my script?

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.440
Script?

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.400
There isn’t one.
You’re just the armpit stand-in.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.240
Since you’re here anyway,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.320
raise your arm so the director can check.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.880
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.280
P’Jiw, can you check the armpit?

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.280
- Let me check.
- Sure.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.360
Got it.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.600
It’s so cold.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.480
A bit more powder and it should work.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.240
Got it.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.040
- Hurry up so we can shoot the insert.
- We’ll start with the insert.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.760
- Insert first.
- Insert.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.240
- Hurry up, Wutthi.
- You.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.440
Move, now.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.680
Okay.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.480
Okay.
- Hurry!

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120
Mom.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.320
Mom, please take care of the armpit stand-in for me.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.200
- Sure.
- Make it perfectly smooth.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.120
- Okay.
- May, please.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.560
I’ll need to squeeze in your schedule for a bit.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.520
The crew needs to shoot the insert first.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.280
That’s fine.
Sorry for the trouble finding a stand-in.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.960
I’m just not very confident.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.640
No problem at all.
It’s totally fine.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.920
Then I’ll go shoot a review first.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.040
It’s just that,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.600
it’s almost time to post.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.960
Sure thing.
Go ahead, May.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.080
Hello, you,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.160
Oh, sit down.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.280
Come sit here.
We’re on a tight schedule.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.600
- Hello.
- Let’s move quickly.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.440
Why are you leaning in?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.360
We’re only shooting the armpit.
No need to do the face.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.960
Mom, Mom.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.600
Didn’t May just finish the funeral
for parents lost in an accident?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.360
Why is May already back at work?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.000
That’s what being professional means.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.920
That’s why May is a superstar.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.600
So… is May not married anymore?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.360
I saw gossip saying,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.600
May’s spouse didn’t even attend the funeral.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.560
- So, did they really break up?
- Quiet.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.560
Stay still.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.680
All done.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.360
Thank you.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240
Thank you.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.160
Do you really have to be
this professional to be a superstar?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.360
How do they even do it?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.560
If the first meeting is coincidence,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.280
the second must be fate.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.840
You’re done parking, right, Tom?

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.520
Always confident when I see you.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.600
All set. Let’s meet at the Thai restaurant
on the third floor.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.760
Okay.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.080
Order first, Tom.
I’ll follow in a bit.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.560
May.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840
Win.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.720
What?

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.000
Nothing. That’s all.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.880
Ms. May. Ms. May.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.800
You can change outfits now.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.080
This way, please.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.520
- Stand-in ready?
- Ready.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.600
Camera ready.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.840
- Ready, P’Jiw.
- Okay.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.280
- Stand-in.
- Yes.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.800
- Follow the acting we agreed on.
- Okay.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.920
Wutthi, good to go.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.680
- Ready.
- Take one.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.840
Ready.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.000
Action.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.840
- Cut.
- Cut.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.440
Why did you jump?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.520
Stay still. I’m only shooting your armpit.
Got it?

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.920
- Got it?
- Yes.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.240
- Wut, take two.
- Take two. Reset and get back in position.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.480
Good, good.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.640
Cut.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.520
Why are you waving? Stay still.
I only need the armpit, nothing else.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.120
Stay still.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.040
- Stay still.
- Yes.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.000
- Let’s go again. Take three.
- Okay, take three.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.120
Ready.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.760
Action.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.040
Hold still.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.880
Hold still.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.360
Hold still.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.560
- If we meet,
- Cut. Okay, that’s a wrap.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.800
- Okay.
- Approved.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.200
- Bring May in.
- It’s approved already?

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.000
I didn’t even finish my dialogue.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.280
Wait, P’,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.800
I didn’t get to say my line yet.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.040
Hey, where is everyone going?

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.160
I haven’t finished speaking yet.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.720
If the first meeting is coincidence,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.760
the second is fate bringing us around again.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.880
then the third must be destiny.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.040
Great. Cut. Approved.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.560
- Next step.
- Approved.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.680
- Okay.
- Approved already?

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.760
Honestly, I didn’t feel any emotion
from May just now.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.400
- That was perfect. Approved.
- May.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.360
Can we do one more take?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.480
I just think,

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.840
the arm movement earlier wasn’t smooth.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.720
If you’re that good,
why don’t you direct it yourself?

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.120
Or if you think you’re so great,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.160
try becoming a superstar like May.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.240
Got it.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.280
Such a smart mouth
for an extra.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.960
Win.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
Look at this.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.440
News about you being back in Thailand
is trending number one.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.360
So annoying.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.760
I was hoping to come back quietly.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.160
You should’ve been more careful, Win.
Did you think people had forgotten?

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.640
Don’t stress about it, Win.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.880
News comes fast and goes fast.
People will forget soon enough.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.760
Forget what, Tom?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.920
It’s been three years,
and they’re still taking photos of me.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.960
That just means people still care about you.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.600
Come on. Let’s eat.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.840
Didn’t you say you wanted something spicy?

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.480
After being overseas for so long,

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.560
you should start with this.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.680
Have some more shrimp.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.160
Eat up.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.560
I can’t eat anymore.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.200
I’m going to the restroom.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.760
Want me to come with you?

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.920
It’s fine.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.280
You’re not going to guard
the ladies’ room, are you?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.080
Just in case it’s crowded.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.840
It’s really fine.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.000
Just because I’m a nobody extra,

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.600
you think you can talk to me like that?

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.480
Just wait.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.520
If someone like Wanneung
ever becomes a superstar,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.120
I’ll never work with that director again.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.680
I’ll make sure they’re done for.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.960
Win.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.480
Um… Win,

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.920
Win Pawee, may I take a selfie with you?

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.440
I’m a huge fan.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.080
What?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.080
What is this?

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.040
So, Win?

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.200
Do you like the house?

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.440
The price is good, the
owner needed to sell fast.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.160
They moved overseas.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.200
The owner already moved out?

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.840
Why does it still feel like someone lives here?

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.680
They just moved out recently.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.680
That’s why it still feels lived-in.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.720
So, do you like it?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.480
It’s okay.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040
Win.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.560
I’ll head back to the café first.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.320
There’s food and fresh stuff in the fridge.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.760
I stocked it for you.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.840
If you don’t feel like cooking, just call.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.960
I’ll order delivery for you.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.240
Okay.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.560
Or…

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.480
If you want, I can cook for you.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.360
I’m ready.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.360
Thank you so much, Tom.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.760
You’re really lucky
to have Tom as a friend.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.080
Yeah. I’m heading out.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.160
Why did you move in so fast?

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.880
Why is Mom calling right now?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.600
Hello, Mom.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.800
Have you reached the airport, Wanneung?

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.760
Your flight’s at eleven tonight, right?

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.400
Well… I,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.640
Don’t tell me,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.360
I’m sticking with my decision, Mom.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.960
I’m staying here.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.720
Why are you being so stubborn, Wanneung?

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.200
Why stay in Thailand at all?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.520
What is there for you to do?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.480
You’ve entered so many contests
and got eliminated every time.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.000
You never pass any auditions.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.640
Isn’t it obvious by now

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.000
that you’re not meant to be an actress?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.440
You’re the ones being stubborn, Mom and Dad.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.400
Do you think selling the house
and leaving me nowhere to stay

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.800
will force me to move to England?

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.440
To work as a server at your restaurant, just like that?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.520
If you don’t come back,
you’ll have to take care of yourself.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.160
From now on, we won’t be sending you
a monthly allowance anymore.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.520
Then I’ll tell you this too.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.080
I’ve graduated.
I won’t ask you for money anymore.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.480
Wanneung.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.880
Mom, Wanneung believes in Wanneung’s dream.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.920
Even if you don’t support it,
you can’t stop it.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.720
And when I finally make it,

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.560
I’ll fly first class to England
to see you myself.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.680
I’ll talk to you later, Mom.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.360
Win Pawee bought this house?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.040
If the first meeting is coincidence,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.160
the second must be the world coming full circle.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.640
But if we happen to meet a third time,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.560
that must be destiny.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.200
Enough, enough.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.960
Stop daydreaming, Wanneung.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.560
Got it.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.760
May looks so beautiful in this one.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.880
Oh, Win.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.560
Let’s keep one each.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.880
So cute.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.160
What ring is that, May?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.840
I was just about to tell you, Win.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.080
My family found out about us.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.040
So they’re forcing me to get married.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.960
Married?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.960
Married to who?

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.160
He’s my mom’s friend’s son, Win.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.800
Our moms talked about it since,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.880
since I was a kid.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.840
So you’re just going to accept it that easily?

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.400
You’re not going to fight for our love at all?

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.360
I tried, Win.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.560
But you know I can’t go against my parents.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.560
May.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.360
What if we move abroad together?

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.080
I’ll take care of you.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.160
Okay?

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.040
Win.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.960
You know my career is taking off right now.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.280
I’m about to star in a film.
It’s my dream, Win.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.160
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Samma-sambuddhassa

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.320
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Samma-sambuddhassa

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.320
I’ll just take this much.
An ex-superstar’s leg hair like Win Pawee’s

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.960
won’t fall out that easily, right?

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.280
Whose car is that?

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.040
Wanneung.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.440
Tom.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.400
Does this house have any history?

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.880
Is something wrong, Win?

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.560
It feels strange.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.160
Like,

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.840
there’s some kind of energy here, Tom.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.320
Stop here.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.800
I’m not going.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.600
What’s wrong with you?

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.960
You said we’d eat near the alley.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.880
Now you’ve changed your mind again?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.160
I just suddenly lost my appetite.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.080
Did you have a guest over?

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.480
I saw a car parked outside.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.480
Well,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.640
it’s my mom’s friend’s car.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.000
Meedee, tomorrow I have a hospital audition.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.840
You’re a doctor, can you coach me?

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.960
Win.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.840
Didn’t you say you were going to watch the café?

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.520
I passed by a porridge shop.
I remembered you like it.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.120
So I grabbed some for you.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.560
I’ll head to the café after this.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.680
Thanks.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.040
Want some coffee first?
I’m making it anyway.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.400
You do run a café, after all.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.640
I’ve had so much I’m wide awake already.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.360
Win.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.560
(May)

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.040
Should I pick up?

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.240
Hello, May.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320
What’s up?

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.760
You never call, what’s going on?

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.440
Did something happen?

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.360
What can I do for you?

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.000
Tom, can I have Win’s number?

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.160
I tried the old one, but it won’t connect.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.480
If there’s something you want to say to Win,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.480
you can tell me.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.360
I’ll pass it along.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.600
I have something personal.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.040
Then,

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.320
I’ll ask Win first

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.480
if Win wants to talk to someone
who hurt them.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.800
Then just tell Win I called.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.680
Win will be happy to know I reached out.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.160
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.680
Honestly,

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.680
the fact that Win changed
both his number and his LINE,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.680
and even moved to a new place,

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.640
the answer is already pretty clear.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.560
I don’t think I need to ask Win at all,

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.640
right?

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.440
If there’s nothing else,
I’ll hang up now.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.840
Wait.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.560
Tell Win that I’m divorced now.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.680
And I’m using my old number again.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.560
In case he wants to call me.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.960
That’s all, right?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.080
Win.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.680
Is something wrong?

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.960
It’s nothing.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.160
Weren’t you going to the café?

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.400
I’m not going.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.760
Okay.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.960
I’ll go then.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.160
So…

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.240
what are you going to do today?

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.040
Want to hang out at my café?

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.360
That’s better.
I don’t feel like seeing people yet.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.720
Up to you.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.280
I’m heading out now.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.440
Anyway,

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.720
thank you.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.360
Make sure you finish it.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.960
Bye.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.160
I’m totally ready.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:38.840
As I mentioned earlier,
the audition today

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.600
is for a viral clip
for a hospital.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.480
And in this clip,
there’s a CPR scene.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.600
So we’ve invited an instructor
to teach the basic steps,

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.480
so your acting looks
as realistic as possible.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.080
This is Instructor Nam,
who’ll be teaching you.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.840
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.120
Instructor Nam, please begin
the demonstration.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.680
Alright, who’s first?
Ready?

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.680
She’s here.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.400
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.720
You again?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.080
Yes.
We keep running into each other.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.000
- Alright, I’ll start then.
- Okay.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.720
So the situation is like this.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.640
- Someone collapses in a mall.
- Okay.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.600
And you’re a hospital staff member.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.400
You happen to pass by,
so you step in to perform CPR.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.200
- Okay.
- That’s the setup.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.920
Give me a moment.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.240
About what time of day
does she encounter the situation?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.640
In the afternoon, after lunch.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.400
Ready?

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.400
One more thing, may I ask?

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.800
What kind of mall is it?

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.560
Is it crowded, or not many people?

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.560
A famous downtown mall.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.920
Super crowded.
People are gathered all around you.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.000
So you have to do the CPR calmly,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.720
- focused and professional.
- And will the person survive?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.400
Yes, they will.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.720
Bank, ready? Okay.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.080
Camera rolling. Action.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120
You,

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.880
Someone has collapsed. You!

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.920
You, you, you!

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.880
Everyone, please step back.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.840
We need space for air circulation.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.080
I’m going to start CPR now.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.120
One, two, three, four, five.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.680
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.240
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.760
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.720
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.880
What the hell?

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.360
Tell Win I’m divorced now.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.440
And I’m using my old number too.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.360
In case he wants to call.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.240
(May)

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.080
Where did my bag go?

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.680
I don’t even have a towel.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.680
Seems normal.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.600
Must be a power dip.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.440
You…

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400
You…

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.640
One two three four five
six seven eight nine ten

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.160
(NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW)
Why did you invite a monk, Tom?

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.480
Didn’t Win say this house is haunted?

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.360
This is the most direct solution.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.000
We’ll invite him right here,
at the scene.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.240
You again?

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.160
You followed me all the way home?

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.040
Do you know this is illegal?

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.960
- I’m calling,
- Win Pawee.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.280
If you want me gone,

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.920
then kill me instead.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.920
Please let me stay here.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.120
Don’t drive me away.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.160
(BEHIND THE SCENES)
Don’t go yet.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.840
(Don’t ignore me.)
I’m not done yet.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.760
Hey!

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.800
(It really fell.)
Hey!

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.400
Where did she go?

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.600
(So professional, keeps going.)

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.760
Does it hurt?

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.120
(It barely missed.)
No, it doesn’t.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.800
Win Pawee,

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.000
you,

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.520
Look at that face, all smiles.

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.160
(They’re having way too much fun.)

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.000
(What are you two whispering about?)

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.720
The wallet,

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.800
(Someone sneaks in smoothly.)
