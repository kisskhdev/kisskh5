00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.240
boys myth brave

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:40.770
Stop acting like a houshi-sama.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.510
What are those eyes?

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.110
It's gonna make me cry

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.370
evoke people's memories

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.950
Teacher every time you rub

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.130
Pick up a brush that makes you want to say

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.650
But the feeling is the same

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.010
fluffy wrinkles

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.770
What's wrong with me, it's okay?

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.390
What have you been doing since a while ago?

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.370
You can tell by looking at me

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.690
His name is Tetsuhiro Takasugi.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.410
Mori High School 3rd year Bali

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.610
It's a Balinese Yankee.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.910
I understand, but it's already morning

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.250
It's been a long time since

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.510
It's a battle you can't lose

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.290
I wish I had it here

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.490
Again, those same dogs.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.070
Recently studied in high school

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.270
This is the first time I've let it happen.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.010
Harmony or howl in Komori

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.710
Olivan's Mal

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.030
Cheesy or bushy

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.410
Rumor has it that it's better to bundle up

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.770
A year in the back alley

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.250
It's remidokukar

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:16.740
I guess it's too late.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.060
Who am I?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:31.410
The one who is always

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.070
Nky's pride

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.670
I read it in tatters

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.090
It's red that I'm going to sleep with you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:50.620
I look like you

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.660
You can study with the video of

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:07.660
One after another

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:21.350
Very soft

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.370
Weak is my territory

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.510
The man who is not here today is also studying.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.010
Let's do our best, okay?

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:46.790
What is Zunano?

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.050
So in the end I was squeamish

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.990
Become obedient to Shino's commands

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.890
I'm dreaming today

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.250
I'm also looking for the real thing

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.530
I have no desire to get angry though

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.430
I can't help but sigh

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.450
One more time, you

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.130
If I can meet you, I will continue to study.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.950
I dream of gnats

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.550
It's a walk that I don't talk about

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.050
It would be painful if I gave up

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.510
The first thing to bloom even if it's cold

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.570
Blooming towards the sky like

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.510
Iku-kun's shout

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.650
Let's not be stupid lol

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:44.760
I don't know, I don't know at all

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.700
Hey, why did we end up like this?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.680
Maybe it's going to happen

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.620
Perfume strange doll

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.340
You're thinking about other things right now

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.820
It was there, I found out.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.780
Kishi satay is espa

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.900
-Look, there are numbers.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.900
I'm turning into a worm

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.700
this is the smell of shampoo

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:25.790
Thank you for your hard work.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.170
I'll grade you, Toru-kun.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.710
Please take a little break.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.850
No matter how you look at it, it's 0 points.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.750
There's no need to point it out.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.950
Even if you got 0 points

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.950
How did Toru-kun answer?

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.090
did you try to derive

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.490
can be seen from this answer

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.400
What do you mean, Thor?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.620
is solving a problem

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.500
This is what I was thinking

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.660
I can see it when I see the paper

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.360
Maybe it's too late

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.260
This perfume has changed.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.860
Is it the smell of pudding?

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.020
No no no no definitely no

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.780
I can't wait to be known

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.300
Why is it so obvious?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.320
Stop it and burn it.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.000
Is that all? Anyway, what do you think?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.180
It's all wrong, so I accepted it.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.400
They say there's no point in scoring.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.880
That's not true.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.420
Thor-kun, you're wrong.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.020
It's a great teaching material.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.360
I wonder if I made a mistake

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.520
Should I have done it?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.600
to understand thoroughly

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.360
Next similar problem

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.960
I'm sure it will be solved when

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.780
You should now be able to

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.880
to derive the meaning

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.060
Thinking gets you points on the test

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.000
bigger than taking

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.740
Maybe it's a sad thing.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.020
No no, that can't be true.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.300
Because it's a test, 0 points.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.520
There's no point in taking it.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.160
Even I know it's that simple

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.000
It's true, Thor.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.500
If I keep looking back

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.420
Toss it in the trash without doing anything

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.800
Thor if you throw it away

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.740
you admit defeat

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:31.620
It's like lose 0

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.880
From the point question paper

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:41.680
There's something to learn, right?

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:52.600
It's eye-opening

00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:05.010
Kodana scales de desu (Watch on www.kisskh,id or www.kisskh,la to support Admin)

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.090
Why did you lose in the fight?

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.680
Got it, next strategy idea

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.820
That's what you get

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:22.680
It's Tohru-kun and I and this guy.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.460
Please understand, Toru-kun.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.060
xyxytol kuniki

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.480
xikitol-kunkishi

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.100
xytol kunebune

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:40.850
That guy messed up his voice.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.990
Kishi makes me dance

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.470
If it stays like this, today too

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.570
Damn it to me!

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.050
How about Jigiri suddenly?

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.290
I did it, Thor-kun, no, no, no, that's it.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.790
My lines are between my eyebrows

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.830
It's wrinkled

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.290
This is a cute face

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.530
Without it, what a medo

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.290
I don't know because I'm sad, but ki

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.650
Shikishi loves me

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:20.730
That's right, it's a different kind of relaxing.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.310
luxe man face

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.410
It is normal to touch

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:45.090
Is there one too?

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:52.330
It's become Jumpai

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.550
It's seriously good

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.370
Damn it I should do more

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.510
I'll wait for the second half.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.430
Come on, you

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.090
What is ramata skipping class?

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.370
I'm doing it, please

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.110
Come to this bastard school

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:22.490
A mountain that can only be praised

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.850
Sesugea Thorga

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.030
I'm glad I'm back to normal

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.250
What do you mean, you idiot Yamase?

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.150
Words that I don't understand

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:45.070
What are you saying?7

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:52.790
points 3 points 2 points 0 points this

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.050
Shameless kids score

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.250
It's not even for me

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:04.530
It's a waste of my time

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.800
was the smartest

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.800
But I'm going to try my best to return home.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:20.150
It's amazing that people say that to me

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.070
have tea with you

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.590
Please fill in the blank here.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.130
After all, the battery is

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.050
Kishi Kishi was a night

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:36.980
Can you do something like this?

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.640
Yeah, I've used English all my life.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.640
Hey, I'm leaving Japan too.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.660
I don't think I'm interested, huh?

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.840
Just search for the word

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.260
Even if it's from Thor

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:58.450
0 points is funny though.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.370
I don't care about the test

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.190
The senior we admire

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.790
Focus on test points

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.830
There's no one like that

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:11.070
That's right!

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.210
I'm coming, I'm coming to you

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.830
Let's make it powerful

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.570
I have the strongest premonition

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.090
I made it so I'll show it to you soon.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.690
Come on, are you serious?

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.090
If I keep looking back

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:30.990
Toss it in the trash without doing anything

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.390
Thor if you throw it away

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.330
you admit defeat

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.470
It's like 0 points answer

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.970
What you can learn from draft papers

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:59.360
There is

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.650
So all A? All A?

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.590
If you do it, where will it be?

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.170
That's true, but here

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.910
I was a little confident in that

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:24.800
Yes, I serve it often.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.980
That's not true.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.260
Ryan's error is

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.000
It's just a shortcut.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.920
Ru-kun Try and Era

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.760
-Baseball? 1 point next.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.860
Let's do our best to aim for

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.380
No, 1 point, 1 point doesn't matter.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.700
0 points and 1 because it doesn't taste good

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.260
We're together, we're not together 1

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.300
It's a point. Get even one point.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.060
That's Thor from before.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.380
It means that you have grown

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.480
That's one step on the road to victory.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.860
I'm looking forward to it 100

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.880
Eiya is born to the point

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.800
No, it's too far, but now

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.780
getting further away

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.200
No, Thor-kun is growing.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.500
There is only white, it grows

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.100
It's a ghost and it's growing

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.540
The ghost is here, so we're together

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:27.470
Let's do our best. Got it.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.970
Let's quickly review the test

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.990
Let's start with this.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.990
From sentence A, I have tea 〇〇

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.010
you this is me with you

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.590
means to drink tea

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.730
Fill in the blank here.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.990
The preverb is with so-and-so.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:56.990
It means iswithis

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:13.140
withwithnowaitwithah

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.740
I don't understand Thor anymore.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.600
Are you careful with me?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.540
Please look at my mouth

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.500
Just look at me, eh, eh, eh, eh.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:25.980
what?

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.980
What's the sudden situation?

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:38.740
Let's go, what?

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:50.440
This is my first wait in my life

00:15:54.210 --> 00:16:00.810
repeat after mewait Thor

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.630
It's okay even if you make a mistake

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:12.030
It's ry and error, waitwith

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:21.310
waitwithExcellent!

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.390
Toru-kun, you can do it if you try.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:33.660
Yes, you can do it if you try.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.840
Now with this drill

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.150
Let's review it.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:55.510
ba2

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.820
2 points?

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.020
Immediately double the target score

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.160
I hit a number of

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.240
No, it's totally fine, isn't it?

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.599
That's not true, Thor.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.240
I can do what you can't do

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.339
It's amazing what happened

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:15.970
Don't give up and work hard

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.829
That's why Toru-kun is like this

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:18.910
understanding the problem

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:29.390
Looks like it's done

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:38.080
Yes, that's some kind of test

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.500
My shoulders continued to stiffen.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.020
You did a great job today.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.540
Something good for Thor

00:17:44.540 --> 00:18:05.450
I brought

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.590
in?

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.510
Why did you take the tea out of your bag?

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.830
-Set?

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.980
Yes, this is with tea.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.080
I'm thinking of leaving.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.220
Tea?

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.020
I'm so lazy

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.300
I always carry it with me

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:32.200
Red red

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.240
Tea has a relaxing effect

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.560
I'm tired from the test.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.260
Toll-kun who lost his life

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.180
For healing between mosquitoes

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.320
I wish I could deliver it

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.240
Maybe it's because he's a knight, but only knights

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.740
this is natural

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:54.480
After all, a knight knight

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.460
It was night, no.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.830
This is my first time trying tea.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.190
The scent of 17 years old

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:23.690
I'm a Yankee now

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:28.350
-I feel like I'll forget that it was

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:37.860
Reasonable Thor

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:50.050
In you

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.330
Thor, are you okay?

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.590
After taking a hot bath

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.890
drink it like milk

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:18.270
I'll get burned, like this.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:54.290
In this way, Kouo

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.770
Did it suit your mouth?

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.820
Yu, freshly brewed black tea

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.520
What a first in my life

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.160
Ru's first time is scary.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:24.320
But I'm honored.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.700
It's not a formal thing though

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.520
meet a knight knight

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.340
If it wasn't there, I'd never know

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:40.680
Oh, I guess so.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.040
What is important is that

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.960
I forgot what.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.680
Suddenly very sexy

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.880
Adult sex appeal

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.460
This is like backing up a car

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.740
of a woman when

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:10.000
Child's favorite gesture sand

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.660
I forgot to add sugar.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.200
Can I also include it?

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.060
Well then, it's also a bag

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:34.060
Yes, I feel better now.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.180
It sounds like it's going to happen

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.160
Dad will be back next week too.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.480
That's what it looks like. Good thing.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.600
Ah, European soil

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:48.720
Birth?

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.640
Don't worry about tea.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.600
I wonder if it will be nice

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:08.880
That's right, Thor, what do you think?

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:18.120
What has he done since then?

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:26.710
Masa hasn't changed either

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.890
That weakness is swe

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:28.050
T?

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.390
First aid kit?

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:31.230
This bag has a four-dimensional port

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.870
Is it connected to Kett?

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.210
win all battles

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.230
It's not the best for me

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.670
Believe and follow me

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:42.390
Please, Thor, help me.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.310
What if I get 100 points?

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.010
Think about giving me a reward.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.550
I'll leave it
