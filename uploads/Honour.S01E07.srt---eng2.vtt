00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:39.915
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:41.155
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:42.715
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:24.825
Are you coming to your senses?

00:01:29.535 --> 00:01:30.905
You remember this place, don't you?

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:33.305
This used to be your favourite spot.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:35.375
Because no one would come even if you beat someone.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:37.005
Min Seo, what's gotten into you?

00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:39.245
What are you doing?

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:40.545
You know, right?

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:42.215
And no one's coming today either.

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:44.545
Min Seo.

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:48.685
Min Seo.

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:50.255
Please.

00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:54.195
You're not like this. You're a good kid, right?

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.255
How could you do this to your own mother?

00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:58.195
Min Seo, please.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.025
Please.

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:01.695
Please.

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:04.065
Please, Min Seo.

00:02:34.665 --> 00:02:35.665
Sweet dreams,

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:37.665
Mom.

00:02:59.185 --> 00:03:00.925
(Episode 7)

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:08.995
Min Seo, I'm here.

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:20.375
- Min Seo? - Yes, Attorney.

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:26.015
Can you come out for a second? I have a few questions for you.

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:38.265
- Min Seo. - I'll be right out.

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.355
What? Lee Seon Hwa's missing?

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:05.255
I waited a long time for her at our meeting place,

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:08.225
- but now I can't get ahold of her. - Find her. Whatever it takes.

00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:09.925
Now!

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:35.215
I know you're awake.

00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:16.755
The number you have dialled is not available. After the beep...

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.125
She's not picking up my calls either.

00:05:18.725 --> 00:05:22.695
Is there anyone else we can call? Family, friends?

00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:28.175
As for a place she might've gone,

00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:31.275
there is one place that comes to mind.

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.545
So this is the place you meant, Min Seo?

00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:41.985
- We came here often as a kid. - I see, but...

00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:44.725
I doubt she'd come here now.

00:05:45.255 --> 00:05:48.225
She wouldn't have any money, and she'd need to stay hidden.

00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:52.765
This is the safest place that Lee Seon Hwa knows.

00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:01.205
Aren't you going in?

00:06:44.845 --> 00:06:46.445
Looks like kids still come here.

00:07:05.905 --> 00:07:08.535
I really don't think she's here.

00:07:18.445 --> 00:07:19.445
Watch your step.

00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:21.955
Thanks.

00:07:23.815 --> 00:07:24.825
Should we get going?

00:07:29.295 --> 00:07:32.025
Let me try calling one more time, just in case.

00:07:45.645 --> 00:07:46.775
(Lee Seon Hwa)

00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:37.625
Min Seo, are you all right?

00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:46.035
Hang on a second. I'm calling it in first.

00:09:23.175 --> 00:09:24.575
(Investigation in progress)

00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:33.215
How did you know her?

00:09:34.015 --> 00:09:35.415
She was a witness in our case.

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.255
We haven't been able to reach her since yesterday.

00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:40.285
What's the cause of death? An overdose, you think?

00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:44.525
That's what it looks like at first glance.

00:09:47.595 --> 00:09:50.295
- Do you see this? - Are those ligature marks?

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:51.965
Min Seo.

00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:58.645
We'll have to see if this was an accident or a homicide.

00:10:00.775 --> 00:10:02.345
A laptop is missing.

00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:07.115
- A laptop? - It had critical information on it,

00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:09.715
but it went missing from our office yesterday.

00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:12.185
Right after Lee Seon Hwa visited. But...

00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:14.525
I don't see it anywhere around here.

00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:17.195
What kind of data was on it?

00:10:18.795 --> 00:10:20.225
That's complicated.

00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:22.565
How did you know she'd be here?

00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:27.305
She and Min Seo knew each other.

00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:30.075
So...

00:10:30.575 --> 00:10:31.875
you're the one who told her about this place?

00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:37.645
- Excuse me, Detective Kim. - Seung Jin.

00:10:37.915 --> 00:10:39.345
This isn't indoors.

00:10:40.415 --> 00:10:41.415
Detective Gu!

00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:46.285
There's no CCTV around here. It's too secluded.

00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:48.555
But there's a car parked on the road up ahead,

00:10:48.625 --> 00:10:49.955
and I've secured its dashcam footage.

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.095
- Let me see. - Yes, sir.

00:10:51.165 --> 00:10:52.195
Do you mind if I take a look?

00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:54.765
Excuse me.

00:10:56.765 --> 00:10:58.265
Could I bum a cigarette?

00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:02.575
Are you nuts?

00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:06.975
What? It's not like we're strangers.

00:11:09.815 --> 00:11:12.515
- What is it? - What? Nothing.

00:11:22.055 --> 00:11:23.055
That's him, right?

00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:24.925
The same culprit from Hyeon Jin's case.

00:11:29.935 --> 00:11:32.965
Detective Gu brought this photo. Find out who it is.

00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:54.925
- First, canvass the neighbourhood. - Yes, sir.

00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:58.225
Ra Young. Hold on a second.

00:12:03.935 --> 00:12:06.565
Are you out of your mind? You got a death wish or something?

00:12:10.135 --> 00:12:12.845
I'm pissed enough as it is with this being messed up.

00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:14.875
Give me the cigarette.

00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:20.845
I dropped it.

00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:22.385
What?

00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:41.175
Who did this? Was it Prosecutor Park Je Yeol?

00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:44.745
Why would he go this far? And what was on that laptop?

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:47.275
If you need me for more questioning, you can call me.

00:12:50.415 --> 00:12:52.614
Why are you going to such lengths to hide this?

00:12:52.615 --> 00:12:54.144
What if this puts Hyeon Jin in danger again?

00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:55.885
They have an accomplice. Someone inside the police force.

00:12:58.455 --> 00:12:59.455
What did you just say?

00:13:00.925 --> 00:13:02.955
I'm sorry. I'm just on edge.

00:13:06.865 --> 00:13:09.165
I understand. We'll talk later.

00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:12.064
It's a shame we met like this.

00:13:12.065 --> 00:13:13.705
I didn't even get to congratulate you on the baby.

00:13:15.505 --> 00:13:16.705
I guess you haven't heard yet.

00:13:17.675 --> 00:13:18.675
Sorry?

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:21.175
You should head in, then.

00:13:28.585 --> 00:13:29.585
That brat...

00:13:30.255 --> 00:13:31.625
I'll kill her with my own two hands.

00:13:34.925 --> 00:13:35.925
Seung Jin!

00:13:37.325 --> 00:13:39.325
Gosh, where did he run off to?

00:13:48.805 --> 00:13:50.205
Seung Jin! What are you doing?

00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:51.505
Hey.

00:13:53.005 --> 00:13:54.715
The cigarette butt.

00:13:55.275 --> 00:13:56.715
You're the one who told me to take care of it, right?

00:13:58.615 --> 00:13:59.615
Is the lawyer gone?

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:03.655
All right.

00:14:05.085 --> 00:14:06.085
Let's go.

00:14:11.425 --> 00:14:12.665
You're not feeling great, are you?

00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:19.305
If I still can't bring myself to forgive them,

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:21.305
does that mean something's wrong with me?

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:26.605
Sometimes, forgiveness isn't the right answer.

00:14:29.845 --> 00:14:30.845
Then...

00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:33.445
what am I supposed to do in a situation like this?

00:14:36.085 --> 00:14:37.085
You just...

00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:40.425
have to take it one day at a time.

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:44.795
Some days, you'll hate them, and other days, you'll be in agony.

00:14:47.395 --> 00:14:49.165
Then one day, you'll suddenly look back,

00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:52.765
and see just how far you've come, carrying that memory with you.

00:14:53.565 --> 00:14:54.575
And when you do,

00:14:55.305 --> 00:14:56.435
it'll feel a little better.

00:14:57.745 --> 00:14:59.405
Even if the wound never fully heals,

00:14:59.705 --> 00:15:01.045
you'll find that even with your scars,

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:05.285
you can still keep moving forward.

00:15:08.615 --> 00:15:10.755
It's okay if you can't forgive. And it's okay if you can't forget.

00:15:10.885 --> 00:15:13.655
Just try to get through each day.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:15.795
Just like I did.

00:15:34.045 --> 00:15:36.475
I'm mean and selfish.

00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:38.715
I've been a total mess lately.

00:15:39.715 --> 00:15:41.615
But still, she didn't deserve this.

00:15:43.685 --> 00:15:45.885
They're going to pay the price.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.455
Every last person involved with Connect.

00:15:50.025 --> 00:15:51.265
I assume they're the ones...

00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:53.025
who took the laptop?

00:16:00.765 --> 00:16:01.775
It's okay to tell him.

00:16:02.975 --> 00:16:05.145
- What? - What happened with Park Je Yeol.

00:16:05.845 --> 00:16:09.215
If you've been holding back from telling Seon Kyu because of me,

00:16:09.615 --> 00:16:10.975
it's okay to tell him now.

00:16:11.445 --> 00:16:12.445
I'm against it.

00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:15.215
At least, not until this case is completely over.

00:16:15.655 --> 00:16:17.515
That's for Hyeon Jin to decide now.

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:21.995
If Connect infiltrated the police, we might need Seon Kyu's help.

00:16:25.325 --> 00:16:26.465
I might...

00:16:27.265 --> 00:16:29.395
end up divorcing him.

00:16:30.135 --> 00:16:31.135
What?

00:16:32.165 --> 00:16:34.235
The baby might not be his.

00:16:34.705 --> 00:16:36.875
What on earth are you talking about? Then whose...

00:16:39.005 --> 00:16:40.005
Don't tell me...

00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:41.545
Is it Reporter Lee's?

00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:47.815
- They said it's a possibility. - Hwang Hyeon Jin!

00:16:49.815 --> 00:16:51.725
I regret it so much, it's driving me crazy.

00:16:52.485 --> 00:16:54.725
I feel so bad for Seon Kyu, I could just die.

00:16:55.025 --> 00:16:57.965
If I could turn back time, I would!

00:16:58.465 --> 00:17:01.395
But what am I supposed to do? It already happened,

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:03.265
and I'm the one who did it.

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:15.975
Get up. Let's go get something to eat.

00:17:21.515 --> 00:17:23.955
Use this. Get something nice and expensive.

00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:25.425
You're not coming with us?

00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:26.985
I have plans.

00:17:27.685 --> 00:17:31.925
It's one thing to make mistakes, hurt people, and do wrong,

00:17:32.425 --> 00:17:33.665
but you have to clean up your own mess.

00:17:34.565 --> 00:17:38.265
If you act like a coward at our age, there's no coming back from it.

00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:40.735
Where are you going? What plans?

00:17:42.505 --> 00:17:44.135
I'm going to marry CEO Baek.

00:17:45.505 --> 00:17:46.505
Are you serious?

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:51.144
Why do you always announce your marriage like that?

00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:52.745
It's not like you're ordering food.

00:17:54.045 --> 00:17:55.055
I'm going to be late.

00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:58.925
Haeil won't push us around anymore. Just hang in there a little longer.

00:18:24.815 --> 00:18:28.485
All that talk about justice, and this is what you do in the end.

00:18:29.415 --> 00:18:31.555
- Where's CEO Baek? - He's waiting inside.

00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:38.325
Why aren't you asking me this time?

00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:40.195
Why I chose CEO Baek.

00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:43.535
For your first marriage, and your second,

00:18:43.695 --> 00:18:46.035
you fought me on every single little thing.

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:49.375
You must have figured he'd be easy to control.

00:18:50.335 --> 00:18:52.105
He doesn't have a powerful family backing him up.

00:18:53.475 --> 00:18:55.145
Men like that are a dime a dozen.

00:18:57.045 --> 00:18:58.045
Then why him?

00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:00.885
You two are cut from the same cloth.

00:19:02.255 --> 00:19:05.855
There may not be love, but he'll be able to understand you.

00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:09.395
That's the impression I got.

00:19:11.225 --> 00:19:12.225
As for Jung Hyeon.

00:19:17.835 --> 00:19:19.405
If you're really that uncomfortable seeing him,

00:19:20.205 --> 00:19:21.905
I'll have him reassigned.

00:19:23.235 --> 00:19:24.235
After the wedding.

00:19:24.905 --> 00:19:25.905
That won't be necessary.

00:19:27.345 --> 00:19:28.815
You don't need to do that anymore.

00:19:42.295 --> 00:19:43.525
The press release is already out,

00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:45.695
so we're thinking of skipping the engagement ceremony.

00:19:46.765 --> 00:19:49.965
That must have been her idea. She always finds them a hassle.

00:19:50.665 --> 00:19:53.435
Well, moving up the wedding isn't a bad idea either.

00:19:54.005 --> 00:19:55.975
The two of you can decide on a date.

00:19:56.305 --> 00:19:59.075
Picking an auspicious date, following all the traditions...

00:19:59.475 --> 00:20:00.605
I can't stand all that nonsense either.

00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:02.645
I'll discuss it with Shin Jae.

00:20:04.985 --> 00:20:08.755
I didn't take you for the type, but it's always "Shin Jae."

00:20:09.055 --> 00:20:10.985
So you're the doting-husband type, CEO Baek? Is that what you are?

00:20:11.115 --> 00:20:13.225
I'll do everything in my power for her...

00:20:13.285 --> 00:20:14.855
if it's what Shin Jae wants.

00:20:16.355 --> 00:20:17.995
My daughter is so lucky.

00:20:19.825 --> 00:20:21.795
LnJ is leaving Haeil.

00:20:23.065 --> 00:20:24.195
It's going independent...

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.635
along with my marriage.

00:20:28.375 --> 00:20:30.335
I'm supposed to get it as a wedding gift.

00:20:30.505 --> 00:20:31.505
A non-profit foundation.

00:20:37.545 --> 00:20:38.985
It's what Shin Jae wants.

00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:45.185
I'm sure you know what it really means to start one.

00:20:45.925 --> 00:20:49.755
It means Shin Jae has no intention of inheriting Haeil, right?

00:20:52.595 --> 00:20:56.235
- And you're okay with that? - If Shin Jae is okay with it,

00:20:56.895 --> 00:20:58.165
then I'm okay with it too.

00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:03.005
I...

00:21:03.835 --> 00:21:07.205
didn't raise my daughter just to be some chaebol's wife.

00:21:07.605 --> 00:21:11.545
That's a big reason why she's been divorced twice.

00:21:14.015 --> 00:21:17.915
It doesn't matter to me what Shin Jae becomes or doesn't.

00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:20.725
She should be the one to decide what she wants and do it.

00:21:21.025 --> 00:21:22.455
Whatever she decides,

00:21:22.755 --> 00:21:25.865
I'll be right by her side to support her.

00:21:34.905 --> 00:21:36.835
So you'll take the axe I gave you...

00:21:38.745 --> 00:21:40.475
and strike me with it?

00:21:43.675 --> 00:21:45.145
It's my life, isn't it?

00:21:46.615 --> 00:21:49.755
I'm the one in the driver's seat now, Mom.

00:22:01.595 --> 00:22:04.195
You really have no concept of money.

00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:06.435
Throwing up all that expensive food.

00:22:16.215 --> 00:22:17.215
Honey?

00:22:18.745 --> 00:22:21.045
You're home late.

00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:24.985
You should've told me you were coming.

00:22:27.885 --> 00:22:31.595
No, it's just... I get nauseous on an empty stomach,

00:22:31.895 --> 00:22:33.995
but then I feel sick when I actually eat something.

00:22:34.765 --> 00:22:37.335
You can do that later. Come sit down.

00:22:49.515 --> 00:22:50.545
What are you doing?

00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:52.085
Sit.

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:56.185
I still have some shame.

00:22:56.555 --> 00:22:59.755
I'm not so shameless that I can eat the food...

00:23:00.025 --> 00:23:01.425
you made for me right now.

00:23:05.995 --> 00:23:07.825
And you have to be this clueless too?

00:23:08.395 --> 00:23:09.395
Eat.

00:23:10.195 --> 00:23:11.495
It's not the baby's fault.

00:23:57.215 --> 00:24:00.715
The green hoodie who attacked you killed Lee Seon Hwa.

00:24:00.985 --> 00:24:04.285
You already know that, right? I'm sure Ra Young already told you.

00:24:05.285 --> 00:24:06.285
Yes.

00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:14.095
I want to hear it.

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:16.695
Everything that happened to you.

00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:20.065
If this is because you still don't trust me...

00:24:20.135 --> 00:24:21.405
That's not it.

00:24:22.275 --> 00:24:24.675
It wasn't because I didn't trust you.

00:24:25.345 --> 00:24:27.905
It's because I didn't go through it alone.

00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:32.615
Even though we're husband and wife,

00:24:33.485 --> 00:24:36.285
speaking recklessly about a pain that isn't mine to share...

00:24:37.355 --> 00:24:39.685
I didn't believe it was my place to do so.

00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:42.055
And...

00:24:44.395 --> 00:24:46.795
I didn't want to burden you.

00:24:47.225 --> 00:24:49.995
I knew you would have been torn.

00:24:50.935 --> 00:24:53.435
Between being a detective and being my husband.

00:24:58.005 --> 00:25:00.045
This is going to be a long story.

00:25:01.475 --> 00:25:03.515
And there are parts that will be painful...

00:25:04.645 --> 00:25:05.815
for you to hear.

00:25:12.555 --> 00:25:13.755
I'm prepared for that.

00:25:21.765 --> 00:25:23.335
So, how does it feel to declare your independence?

00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:25.265
Liberating?

00:25:27.565 --> 00:25:29.475
I doubt this is the end of it.

00:25:30.605 --> 00:25:31.975
My mother has never once...

00:25:32.905 --> 00:25:34.375
backed down in her life.

00:25:36.675 --> 00:25:38.515
Do you know what's so scary about that?

00:25:39.715 --> 00:25:41.785
It means she doesn't know how to give up.

00:25:42.385 --> 00:25:45.585
And here I was thinking that went well comparatively.

00:25:46.955 --> 00:25:49.825
The calm before the storm? Or are we in the eye of the storm?

00:25:50.925 --> 00:25:52.595
Does that scare you?

00:25:55.735 --> 00:25:58.465
- How about one more drink? - I'd like that.

00:25:58.705 --> 00:25:59.835
At my place.

00:26:05.505 --> 00:26:08.375
You know what the difference is between my mother and me?

00:26:10.145 --> 00:26:12.285
I've been knocked down more times than I can count.

00:26:12.845 --> 00:26:14.845
And I've come back fighting every single time.

00:26:17.985 --> 00:26:19.555
I'm going to see this through to the end.

00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:22.225
Whatever storm comes,

00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:24.625
I'll fight my way through it.

00:26:58.895 --> 00:27:03.065
A woman in her 20s was found dead in an abandoned building in Seoul.

00:27:03.335 --> 00:27:06.665
A blood test revealed a lethal dose of a drug,

00:27:06.905 --> 00:27:10.575
and police have requested an autopsy after finding evidence of foul play.

00:27:21.385 --> 00:27:22.385
Sang A.

00:27:22.655 --> 00:27:25.325
Dad, I'm late. Hurry up.

00:27:29.155 --> 00:27:31.225
- What's with Sang A? - I don't know.

00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:33.865
Maybe you should ask yourself that.

00:27:43.305 --> 00:27:45.675
What's wrong, sweetie? Did something happen?

00:27:55.885 --> 00:27:56.885
Mom...

00:27:57.615 --> 00:27:59.525
I thought her treatment was over.

00:28:02.025 --> 00:28:04.725
Your mom let you down again, didn't she?

00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:08.735
You and I always try so hard,

00:28:09.595 --> 00:28:12.105
so why does your mom always have to make us so sad?

00:28:23.645 --> 00:28:25.245
(Mujin National Forensic Service)

00:28:28.285 --> 00:28:29.315
Ms. Hong Yeon Hee.

00:28:31.755 --> 00:28:32.955
I need a word with you.

00:28:33.225 --> 00:28:35.255
- I'm running late. - It'll only take a minute.

00:28:39.295 --> 00:28:40.665
Why haven't you called?

00:28:43.435 --> 00:28:45.965
I understand you're nervous, and I know why you're hesitating.

00:28:46.035 --> 00:28:47.835
- But... - Let me make one thing clear.

00:28:48.805 --> 00:28:50.835
I want nothing to do with any of this.

00:28:51.105 --> 00:28:52.875
- Ms. Hong. - I hope we don't meet again.

00:28:52.945 --> 00:28:56.245
Yesterday, a body was brought in, right?

00:28:56.515 --> 00:28:58.445
Cause of death, drug overdose. A woman in her 20s.

00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:02.115
Park Je Yeol killed her.

00:29:03.455 --> 00:29:05.454
- What are you talking about? - The reason I asked you...

00:29:05.455 --> 00:29:06.625
to cloning his phone...

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:08.995
was because of an app.

00:29:09.755 --> 00:29:10.895
A prostitution app.

00:29:21.465 --> 00:29:24.475
(Prosecutor's Office)

00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:53.835
I'm disappointed our agreement wasn't properly honoured.

00:29:55.775 --> 00:29:58.105
There's no cause for concern.

00:30:00.145 --> 00:30:02.845
That's what you said when that reporter died.

00:30:03.875 --> 00:30:07.445
And yet, where is that reporter's laptop now?

00:30:10.185 --> 00:30:13.925
You still haven't identified who took the laptop.

00:30:15.185 --> 00:30:16.555
We're still looking for it.

00:30:18.225 --> 00:30:21.925
You promised us the highest level of security and safety.

00:30:22.565 --> 00:30:27.435
You'd do well to remember how someone like you...

00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:30.205
got to where you are today.

00:31:20.785 --> 00:31:21.955
I looked into her.

00:31:22.055 --> 00:31:25.025
Park Je Yeol gave her a suspension of indictment a while back.

00:31:25.095 --> 00:31:29.165
Suspended for aggravated assault. Smells fishy, doesn't it?

00:31:29.935 --> 00:31:32.105
Her only family is a younger sibling, a minor.

00:31:32.665 --> 00:31:35.265
Like you said, it seems he targets vulnerable young people.

00:31:35.675 --> 00:31:37.205
There's also what happened with Yoo Jeong.

00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:40.705
Lee Seon Hwa was murdered even though she gave us intel.

00:31:41.045 --> 00:31:43.115
The other victims could be in danger too.

00:31:43.915 --> 00:31:46.285
Got it. I'll start by finding Lee Da Eun.

Where'd Detective Kim go?

00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:01.825
Detective Kim? He said he was just stepping out for a moment.

00:32:03.595 --> 00:32:06.005
- All right. I'm heading out. - Yes, sir.

00:32:06.065 --> 00:32:09.635
(Seoul Mujin Police Station)

00:32:38.495 --> 00:32:40.164
- Are you sure? - Yes.

00:32:40.165 --> 00:32:41.835
On the syringe from the scene,

00:32:41.905 --> 00:32:44.305
- we found a fingerprint. - What about inside the department?

00:32:45.035 --> 00:32:48.605
No one at the station knows yet. I acted on my own.

00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:05.295
Was this all you?

00:33:14.565 --> 00:33:17.235
I thought I could use you as a double agent,

00:33:17.805 --> 00:33:20.245
but you wouldn't follow a single one of our orders.

00:33:21.005 --> 00:33:24.575
I figured you'd completely thrown in your lot with LnJ.

00:33:24.645 --> 00:33:25.915
But that wasn't it either.

00:33:27.585 --> 00:33:30.685
You were hiding your own agenda all along.

00:33:42.735 --> 00:33:44.095
Who are you, really?

00:33:49.005 --> 00:33:50.235
Where's the laptop?

00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:51.675
I don't know.

00:33:52.345 --> 00:33:53.345
Really?

00:33:54.405 --> 00:33:55.715
Then I'll help you remember.

00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:03.485
You're going to regret everything.

00:34:05.925 --> 00:34:07.255
Even the day you were born.

Yes, I'm fine.

00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:09.785
I meant it when I said I wanted to get you out.

Why would you?

00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:13.625
Because maybe...

00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:28.265
and desperately trying to save my child...

00:35:28.935 --> 00:35:31.435
from that same fate.

00:36:19.025 --> 00:36:20.855
(The late Lee Seong Hyeok, the late Park Jeong Yeon)

00:36:31.935 --> 00:36:34.465
(The late Lee Ga On)

00:36:57.755 --> 00:36:59.994
(The late Lee Seong Hyeok, the late Park Jeong Yeon)

00:36:59.995 --> 00:37:02.225
(The late Lee Ga On)

00:37:04.935 --> 00:37:08.235
(The late Lee Ga On)

00:37:17.475 --> 00:37:19.185
I didn't mention it on purpose, but you all came anyway.

00:37:20.515 --> 00:37:21.515
Hey.

00:37:22.715 --> 00:37:24.515
Did you really think we'd forget this day?

00:37:25.755 --> 00:37:27.755
What do you think? For this year's birthday,

00:37:27.825 --> 00:37:29.595
I picked something a little more colourful.

00:37:35.265 --> 00:37:36.434
(The late Lee Seong Hyeok, the late Park Jeong Yeon)

00:37:36.435 --> 00:37:37.565
(The late Lee Ga On)

00:37:56.055 --> 00:37:57.315
Would things have been different?

00:38:00.955 --> 00:38:03.725
If that incident hadn't happened when I was in my 20s,

00:38:04.225 --> 00:38:05.865
but a little later in life...

00:38:07.025 --> 00:38:08.025
If I...

00:38:08.595 --> 00:38:10.235
had been a stronger person.

00:38:12.605 --> 00:38:15.005
And if I hadn't put my child up for adoption...

00:38:15.735 --> 00:38:17.635
and had made a different choice.

00:38:18.605 --> 00:38:19.605
I wonder if maybe...

00:38:21.175 --> 00:38:22.915
Would everything have been different?

00:38:23.745 --> 00:38:26.485
At no age are you strong enough to handle that.

00:38:31.715 --> 00:38:33.455
You had the right to choose...

00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:36.325
how you wanted to live your own life.

00:38:36.625 --> 00:38:38.825
No one has the right to judge your choice.

00:38:42.065 --> 00:38:43.395
(The late Park Jeong Yeon, the late Lee Ga On)

00:38:43.895 --> 00:38:45.235
Do you really think so?

00:38:53.445 --> 00:38:54.775
You've never regretted it?

00:38:55.305 --> 00:38:56.345
That day,

00:38:57.945 --> 00:38:59.445
you guys coming to save me.

00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:04.755
If we hadn't gone, you could have died.

00:39:07.125 --> 00:39:10.595
Of course, it would've been better if it never happened at all.

00:39:11.995 --> 00:39:15.835
Then Shin Jae would've taken over her mom's company quietly,

00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:19.605
and I wouldn't have the nightmare of waking up in prison,

00:39:19.805 --> 00:39:22.035
haunting me for the rest of my life.

00:39:22.635 --> 00:39:25.035
A lawyer for sexual assault survivors.

00:39:25.575 --> 00:39:28.645
My foot. I'd own three buildings by now.

00:39:28.805 --> 00:39:30.575
You know? Cleaning up after rich scumbags.

00:39:31.945 --> 00:39:34.945
She'd be on TV, you know? Arguing against you on a panel.

00:39:37.155 --> 00:39:41.125
And as for you, you'd still be smiling now,

00:39:41.825 --> 00:39:44.895
like you were before it happened, without a care in the world.

00:39:46.525 --> 00:39:48.225
But even if I could turn back time,

00:39:48.525 --> 00:39:52.035
I'd do the same thing and go save you.

00:39:52.835 --> 00:39:55.165
For you, of course.

00:39:55.905 --> 00:39:59.135
But that's not the only reason.

00:39:59.775 --> 00:40:02.405
And for all the people we've been able to help since then.

00:40:02.675 --> 00:40:04.145
I'd do it all over again for them too.

00:40:05.345 --> 00:40:07.685
I would do the same.

00:40:13.925 --> 00:40:15.655
(The late Lee Seong Hyeok, the late Park Jeong Yeon)

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.595
When I wake up in the morning,

00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:20.965
I still find myself wondering.

00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:23.565
What if all of this...

00:40:25.035 --> 00:40:27.605
is just a terrible dream?

00:40:31.905 --> 00:40:35.245
If it's a bad dream, let's keep dreaming it together.

00:40:36.145 --> 00:40:37.745
We'll be right there with you.

00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:40.285
In this nightmare.

00:41:06.075 --> 00:41:07.075
Well?

00:41:07.805 --> 00:41:09.145
You still don't get it?

00:41:11.675 --> 00:41:12.715
I don't know.

00:41:14.715 --> 00:41:15.845
Don't worry.

00:41:16.685 --> 00:41:18.715
I'm just getting started.

00:41:32.965 --> 00:41:35.035
I was going to leave your face alone,

00:41:35.835 --> 00:41:37.205
but you've left me no choice.

00:41:38.105 --> 00:41:40.105
Maybe if I carve something into your skin,

00:41:40.645 --> 00:41:42.475
you'll finally learn a lesson.

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:44.375
Right?

00:41:47.885 --> 00:41:48.885
How about it?

00:41:49.585 --> 00:41:50.685
Still nothing?

00:41:55.225 --> 00:41:56.595
I don't know about the laptop.

00:41:57.825 --> 00:42:00.795
But I do know your wife teamed up with them...

00:42:00.865 --> 00:42:02.735
to mess you up.

00:42:07.565 --> 00:42:11.075
Please. Whatever tricks they're up to...

00:42:11.705 --> 00:42:13.645
Do you really think it will matter?

00:42:14.075 --> 00:42:16.915
Yoon Ra Young told her to clone your phone.

00:42:18.175 --> 00:42:19.485
I overheard their call.

00:42:21.285 --> 00:42:24.685
For all you know, LnJ might already have it.

00:42:25.655 --> 00:42:27.885
The proof that you're Connect.

00:42:56.485 --> 00:42:57.515
What should I do with her?

00:42:58.615 --> 00:42:59.855
Let her go for now.

00:43:01.255 --> 00:43:04.795
If she just disappears, they'll start causing trouble.

00:43:51.835 --> 00:43:52.975
You guys heading to the office?

00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:57.515
- I have to finish my statement. - Me too.

00:43:57.575 --> 00:43:59.215
Okay, I'll see you at our spot later.

00:43:59.515 --> 00:44:00.745
I'm heading straight there.

00:44:04.155 --> 00:44:05.355
Goodness.

00:44:10.355 --> 00:44:11.355
It's Ms. Hong Yeon Hee.

00:44:12.325 --> 00:44:13.725
(Hong Yeon Hee)

00:44:15.525 --> 00:44:19.095
- Hello? - I'll accept your offer, Ms. Yoon.

00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:21.535
But in return, you have to help me.

00:44:22.435 --> 00:44:23.435
Understood.

00:44:24.405 --> 00:44:26.745
- What? What'd she say? - I'll call you later.

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:33.845
(Husband)

00:44:41.655 --> 00:44:43.925
I'm here. I'll be waiting.

00:44:58.975 --> 00:45:00.605
Mom, what are you doing?

00:45:01.205 --> 00:45:02.375
Just the essentials.

00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:04.475
Pack only the absolute essentials. Hurry.

00:45:05.115 --> 00:45:07.785
- What's going on? - We're getting out of here.

00:45:08.245 --> 00:45:09.585
What are you talking about?

00:45:11.955 --> 00:45:14.825
From now on, it's just going to be the two of us.

00:45:15.285 --> 00:45:16.395
If you want to go, go by yourself.

00:45:18.695 --> 00:45:19.695
Sang A.

00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:24.135
Sang A.

00:45:26.235 --> 00:45:28.035
I know this must be hard for you to accept.

00:45:28.465 --> 00:45:31.375
But, Sang A, I have my reasons for this.

00:45:32.135 --> 00:45:33.675
Even if you don't understand,

00:45:34.245 --> 00:45:36.375
- please, just trust me... - Trust you?

00:45:36.775 --> 00:45:37.775
You?

00:45:47.925 --> 00:45:50.855
You said you'd quit. You promised.

00:45:52.155 --> 00:45:53.265
Sang A, this is...

00:45:53.465 --> 00:45:57.735
I know exactly what's been going on in this house.

00:46:15.885 --> 00:46:19.015
Every time it happens, I get scared you're going to die.

00:46:19.415 --> 00:46:21.255
Do you have any idea how scared I've been?

00:46:21.685 --> 00:46:23.895
And do you have any idea how hard I'm trying?

00:46:24.695 --> 00:46:25.825
Thinking that if I did well,

00:46:27.225 --> 00:46:28.765
if Dad was in a good mood,

00:46:29.565 --> 00:46:31.295
I thought he wouldn't treat you like that.

00:46:32.935 --> 00:46:34.535
But Mom, what is this?

00:46:35.305 --> 00:46:39.435
- Sang A. - If you do this, what can I do?

00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:47.345
Sang A.

00:46:50.255 --> 00:46:52.715
Sang A.

00:47:10.105 --> 00:47:12.105
(Where are you? What are you up to?)

00:47:12.175 --> 00:47:14.745
(I ran away. Fought with my mom.)

00:47:14.805 --> 00:47:17.315
(Want to meet up?)

00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:29.825
(Yes)

00:48:05.695 --> 00:48:08.165
I'm sorry. My meeting ran a little late.

00:48:08.925 --> 00:48:10.235
What a charming hobby.

00:48:11.065 --> 00:48:13.665
- Did you make all this yourself? - Yes.

00:48:13.735 --> 00:48:15.705
(CEO Baek Tae Joo)

00:48:15.765 --> 00:48:17.875
Making these helps calm my mind.

00:48:18.635 --> 00:48:19.675
How should I put it?

00:48:20.175 --> 00:48:23.075
You see, even this tiny world has its own balance and order.

00:48:25.675 --> 00:48:27.315
Is this one not finished yet?

00:48:29.715 --> 00:48:30.955
This one ran into a bit of a problem.

00:48:31.585 --> 00:48:35.655
It's infested. If I leave it, it will contaminate the whole thing.

00:48:37.695 --> 00:48:38.925
So, you use pesticides?

00:48:39.325 --> 00:48:40.365
Rather than that,

00:48:41.595 --> 00:48:42.865
this method is a bit more...

00:48:43.535 --> 00:48:44.635
effective.

00:48:51.105 --> 00:48:52.205
The pests...

00:48:52.535 --> 00:48:54.745
take the bait without ever knowing it's a trap.

00:49:04.685 --> 00:49:06.455
Yes, we're about to head out now.

00:49:08.425 --> 00:49:11.025
- What? - We found a Connect victim.

00:49:11.425 --> 00:49:13.264
She's a suspect in a case of Park Je Yeol's.

00:49:13.265 --> 00:49:14.695
She's been unreachable for three days.

00:49:14.865 --> 00:49:18.165
Her last known activity was a social media post from yesterday.

00:49:18.465 --> 00:49:19.535
So where is she now?

00:49:19.735 --> 00:49:23.205
Magan Hotel. Seon Kyu tracked her phone,

00:49:23.335 --> 00:49:26.175
- and the victim's there now. - Wait, I'm on my way.

00:49:26.235 --> 00:49:27.775
No, that'll take too long.

00:49:28.305 --> 00:49:31.515
What if it's an emergency? I'll call you.

00:49:35.515 --> 00:49:38.285
Sorry, Tae Joo. Something's come up. We'll have to do this another time.

00:49:38.355 --> 00:49:39.355
Is something wrong?

00:49:42.455 --> 00:49:45.595
Magan Hotel. I saw it in The Prime's portfolio.

00:49:46.395 --> 00:49:48.965
That hotel's management system runs on The Prime's solution, right?

00:49:49.495 --> 00:49:53.735
I'm Hwang Hyeon Jin, LnJ attorney. I need to speak with the manager.

00:49:53.805 --> 00:49:55.705
(Magan)

00:49:58.375 --> 00:50:01.345
This is an urgent matter, and I require your cooperation.

00:50:01.805 --> 00:50:04.715
I'd like to do a wellness check on one of the guests staying here.

00:50:05.145 --> 00:50:06.985
An urgent matter? What kind of...

00:50:07.045 --> 00:50:10.385
I'm concerned for the safety of my client, one of your guests.

00:50:10.855 --> 00:50:12.615
May I have the guest's name?

00:50:13.155 --> 00:50:15.255
Lee Da Eun. Born in 2006.

00:50:15.325 --> 00:50:17.255
(Staff Only)

00:50:18.825 --> 00:50:21.925
Check the guest registry and the status of the room.

00:50:22.325 --> 00:50:24.835
- The name is Lee Da Eun. - Yes, sir.

00:50:35.705 --> 00:50:36.875
(Connect In)

00:50:39.215 --> 00:50:40.215
(Yoon Ra Young, Age 42)

00:50:40.285 --> 00:50:41.285
(Kang Shin Jae, Age 42)

00:50:41.345 --> 00:50:43.145
(Hwang Hyeon Jin, Age 42)

00:50:43.215 --> 00:50:45.115
(Attorney Hwang Hyeon Jin)

00:50:48.125 --> 00:50:49.225
(Reservation Search: Lee Da Eun)

00:50:50.925 --> 00:50:52.025
(Reservation Date)

00:50:52.095 --> 00:50:53.465
(Room: 1908)

00:50:53.525 --> 00:50:54.865
Room 1908.

00:50:55.195 --> 00:50:56.695
(Lee Da Eun)

00:51:02.965 --> 00:51:04.805
(I think Tae Joo can help. Tell me Lee Da Eun's room number.)

00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:06.405
(Room 1908)

00:51:09.105 --> 00:51:11.215
(Got it. Making an emergency call.)

00:51:15.985 --> 00:51:17.615
Thank you for your patience.

00:51:18.315 --> 00:51:20.985
Regarding the safety of the guest you mentioned,

00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:23.655
we've confirmed that there are no issues.

00:51:24.925 --> 00:51:28.525
Did you check the room and see the guest in person?

00:51:28.595 --> 00:51:33.095
Due to guest privacy, I can't provide more details.

00:51:33.335 --> 00:51:35.305
If law enforcement makes an official request,

00:51:35.565 --> 00:51:37.835
we will fully cooperate at that time.

00:51:37.905 --> 00:51:39.805
Okay, hold on. Just one more thing.

00:51:40.275 --> 00:51:44.045
Each room has an emergency button, right?

00:51:44.645 --> 00:51:45.745
Yes, that's correct.

00:51:46.375 --> 00:51:48.945
So if the emergency alarm in a room is triggered,

00:51:49.245 --> 00:51:51.185
what is the protocol?

00:51:51.615 --> 00:51:56.385
Protocol requires a staff member to check the room for safety.

00:51:57.955 --> 00:51:59.025
Right.

00:51:59.555 --> 00:52:00.665
I see.

00:52:02.225 --> 00:52:04.265
Then let's go have a look.

00:52:04.565 --> 00:52:07.935
- Excuse me? - The alarm. It should've gone off.

00:52:09.035 --> 00:52:10.305
(Emergency call alert: Room 1908)

00:52:12.935 --> 00:52:15.705
I'll take full responsibility if the hotel gives you any trouble.

00:52:16.105 --> 00:52:18.115
You're the one who said the victim might be in danger.

00:52:18.415 --> 00:52:21.545
If you're right, Shin Jae, the hotel won't want trouble either.

00:52:22.045 --> 00:52:23.045
Thank you.

00:52:31.595 --> 00:52:34.525
(Emergency call alert: Room 1908)

00:52:34.595 --> 00:52:35.595
(Staff only)

00:52:36.525 --> 00:52:38.435
This alarm is for Room 1908, right?

00:52:39.435 --> 00:52:42.835
- Is that right? - Yes, the call came from Room 1908.

00:52:42.935 --> 00:52:44.635
Then why are you just standing here?

00:52:44.905 --> 00:52:45.905
I'm sorry, but...

00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:49.105
Only hotel staff are allowed up to the guest rooms.

00:52:49.445 --> 00:52:53.845
- Unless you're with the police... - Here comes a detective now.

00:52:54.985 --> 00:52:57.755
Lee Da Eun's family just filed a missing person report.

00:52:58.285 --> 00:52:59.615
Take us to her room.

00:53:00.125 --> 00:53:02.585
I guess we can go check on her now?

00:53:04.255 --> 00:53:05.325
Shall we?

00:53:11.465 --> 00:53:13.465
(Front desk)

00:53:15.235 --> 00:53:16.235
(VIP list)

00:53:17.975 --> 00:53:19.105
(VIP 38)

00:53:19.175 --> 00:53:20.175
(Emergency alert)

00:53:20.245 --> 00:53:22.005
(VIP 38 emergency alert, Critical security threat detected)

00:53:22.645 --> 00:53:24.145
My husband's home.

00:53:24.715 --> 00:53:26.075
Just wait a little longer.

00:53:32.585 --> 00:53:36.425
- Where's Sang A? - She went to meet a friend.

00:53:36.825 --> 00:53:38.295
Tell her not to be too late.

00:53:52.135 --> 00:53:53.905
Can't you put your work away while we eat?

00:54:12.555 --> 00:54:13.695
Why aren't you eating?

00:54:15.365 --> 00:54:16.765
I was just thinking.

00:54:18.395 --> 00:54:19.465
About what?

00:54:22.105 --> 00:54:26.175
Was it the side dishes, the soup, or the rice?

00:54:26.575 --> 00:54:27.675
Or maybe the water?

00:54:31.575 --> 00:54:32.645
What was?

00:54:36.185 --> 00:54:37.815
Where you slipped the drug.

00:54:42.055 --> 00:54:45.125
And after that, were you planning to steal the data?

00:54:45.195 --> 00:54:47.195
Or have you already stolen it?

00:54:47.665 --> 00:54:49.995
I doubt it's been passed to Yoon Ra Young yet.

00:54:50.765 --> 00:54:54.065
Otherwise, they wouldn't be this quiet.

00:54:55.835 --> 00:54:57.405
What on earth are you talking about?

00:55:32.935 --> 00:55:34.845
Ma'am, this is an employee from the Magan Hotel.

00:55:35.275 --> 00:55:37.615
We're here in response to your emergency call.

00:55:37.945 --> 00:55:40.045
If you're in there, please respond.

00:55:42.215 --> 00:55:44.155
(My husband is home. Just wait a little longer.)

00:55:59.635 --> 00:56:01.265
Nothing's wrong, is it?

00:56:09.605 --> 00:56:12.415
(Hong Yeon Hee)

00:56:16.515 --> 00:56:17.555
Help me.

00:56:30.935 --> 00:56:31.935
Ma'am?

00:57:54.645 --> 00:57:55.885
(Where are you?)

00:58:12.735 --> 00:58:13.735
(I'm almost there.)

00:58:15.865 --> 00:58:17.005
(I'm almost there.)

00:58:44.365 --> 00:58:45.435
Ms. Hong Yeon Hee.

00:58:49.505 --> 00:58:50.505
Ms. Hong Yeon Hee.

00:58:57.275 --> 00:58:58.615
I've been waiting for you.

00:59:00.815 --> 00:59:01.845
Ra Young.

00:59:29.575 --> 00:59:33.575
(Honour)

01:00:25.195 --> 01:00:29.135
I gave you plenty of chances. Let's see you break.

01:00:29.535 --> 01:00:30.805
What have you done?

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.035
What room is the patient, Lee Da Eun, in?

01:00:33.175 --> 01:00:34.975
How dare you hide my daughter from me?

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:39.775
Unless you make them suffer more, it's meaningless to me.

01:00:40.315 --> 01:00:42.385
You can fool me once, but you can't fool me twice.

01:00:42.515 --> 01:00:45.415
This should be enough evidence to put Park Je Yeol away.

01:00:47.585 --> 01:00:51.595
There's a sex trafficking app, and a prosecutor is involved.
