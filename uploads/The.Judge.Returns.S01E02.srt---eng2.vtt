00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:35.055
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:39.893
SHIN NAM-SUK

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.711
But if you still insist that you were fair

00:01:06.628 --> 00:01:08.714
look at me straight in the eyes
and tell me.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:09.798
"Mother"

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.467
"I made a fair judgment."

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.136
"I'm a judge of justice."

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.431
Then, I'll believe you,
no matter what, okay?

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.134
I was very fair in court.

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.471
I'm a judge of justice.

00:01:58.138 --> 00:01:59.806
I know it's too late

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:01.725
but...
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:07.898
But...

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.991
you'll be on my side, right, Mom?

00:02:39.513 --> 00:02:43.100
SUPREME COURT

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:46.061
EPISODE 2

00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:47.187
Where's Chairman Jang?

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.690
He should be with his attorney right now.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.234
- Is that so?
- Yes.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:02:59.616
How is it?

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.536
How's the food there?

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:11.670
I'll just think of this
as a little holiday

00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:16.258
but won't the Haenal Partner's daughter
be disappointed?

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.148
Seriously.

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:36.153
Why would you act so out of character?

00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:39.573
How pesky.

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:42.367
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG'S OFFICE

00:03:55.797 --> 00:04:00.010
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:07.934
I didn't order that.

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:09.770
It's on the house.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.065
Thank you.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.611
How much will that be?

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.030
I'll transfer the money.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.573
So, it's you.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.910
You haven't told me the price yet.

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:27.788
It's you, Attorney Lee Han-young.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.728
Who the hell are you?

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:15.585
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:26.573
Oh, no...

00:06:36.124 --> 00:06:37.167
Excuse me.

00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:40.504
Hello?

00:06:42.797 --> 00:06:43.840
Excuse me?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.644
ATTORNEY LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:07:37.894 --> 00:07:39.145
Any information about him?

00:07:40.313 --> 00:07:41.481
Hold on.

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:42.816
I found his wallet.

00:07:45.735 --> 00:07:47.571
Kim Yong-jin, born in 1989.

00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:51.575
You can come out now

00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:52.993
Mr. Kim.

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:01.459
You know the flash drive I gave you?

00:08:02.502 --> 00:08:03.920
I got it from him.

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:07.424
Leave the site immediately.

00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:12.095
They must've left your fingerprints
all over the weapon of murder.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.016
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:08:19.352 --> 00:08:21.271
This must be Jang Tae-sik
getting his revenge.

00:08:21.688 --> 00:08:24.024
I'm heading over. Let's meet.

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:27.068
There's no way you can handle it alone.

00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:30.238
Are you listening?

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:31.990
Judge Lee.

00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:34.492
I'll prove

00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:36.411
my own innocence.

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:38.913
I'll call you later.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.373
Hello?

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:42.000
Hello?

00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:43.918
Damn it.

00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:05.482
ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION

00:09:30.924 --> 00:09:32.217
Okay, I can do this.

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:39.057
Oh, gosh.

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.150
Over there!

00:09:49.234 --> 00:09:51.069
That's him.

00:09:51.152 --> 00:09:52.153
This way!

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:56.741
Hey.

00:09:57.075 --> 00:09:58.076
Hey!

00:10:10.213 --> 00:10:11.339
Get him!

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:13.341
Over there! That's him!

00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:18.430
No, it's not me.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.765
- Stay still!
- It's not me.

00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:23.017
I didn't do it.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.733
It's not me.

00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:33.945
I didn't do it.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.823
I'm innocent.

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:46.958
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:10:51.796 --> 00:10:52.797
Mr. Lee Han-young.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:57.218
You're no longer a judge

00:10:57.886 --> 00:10:59.304
nor an industry senior to me.

00:10:59.888 --> 00:11:00.972
So

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.558
before those pants slip off

00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:05.810
just be nice and work with me here.

00:11:11.608 --> 00:11:15.069
EVIDENCE

00:11:15.153 --> 00:11:16.654
We found your fingerprints on this

00:11:19.073 --> 00:11:20.575
and a trace of the victim's blood.

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:23.995
Do you admit to your murder charge?

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:29.667
I've been framed.

00:11:31.085 --> 00:11:33.338
How does it seem to you, as a judge?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.467
If I brought these to the court

00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:41.179
would Defendant Lee Han-young be
guilty or not?

00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:52.357
I didn't kill him.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.200
VICTIM

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:10.959
I'm not the murderer!

00:12:11.042 --> 00:12:12.544
Stop him!

00:12:14.337 --> 00:12:17.549
I've never even met the victim!

00:12:17.632 --> 00:12:19.467
All evidence has been doctored.

00:12:19.551 --> 00:12:21.719
Are you saying you didn't know him at all?

00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:23.221
Exactly! I don't know him at all.

00:12:23.304 --> 00:12:25.557
How can you explain
all the evidence found, then?

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.142
A corrupt judge who's been involved

00:12:28.226 --> 00:12:30.144
in blackmailing, extortion,
and taking bribes for cases

00:12:30.228 --> 00:12:32.730
killed an accomplice to destroy evidence

00:12:32.814 --> 00:12:35.650
in this horrifying, unprecedented case.

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:38.528
According to the police

00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:41.030
this judge has been taking bribes
of hundreds of millions of won

00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:42.907
from politicians and corporate leaders

00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:45.076
to rule in their favor in court for years.

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:48.413
And when investigations began
on his accomplice

00:12:48.496 --> 00:12:49.497
he made a plan

00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:52.667
to murder him.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.503
Several traces of his attempt
to destroy any evidence were found

00:12:55.587 --> 00:12:57.505
at the site of the murder.

00:12:58.047 --> 00:12:59.841
The man was respected in society.

00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:01.676
Still, underneath his judge's robe

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:05.096
he was just a criminal
who abused his authority for his benefit.

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:06.598
DEFENDANT

00:13:09.183 --> 00:13:10.935
Defendant Lee Han-young

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.980
murdered his accomplice

00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:15.857
and blackmailed him.

00:13:16.608 --> 00:13:18.276
Hence, the prosecution files charges

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.320
against Mr. Lee Han-young.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.866
Defendant, do you admit to the charges?

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:39.797
No.

00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:40.882
No!

00:13:42.133 --> 00:13:43.468
Defendant!

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:45.428
I didn't do it!

00:13:51.643 --> 00:13:52.644
I didn't do it.

00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:55.063
I'm...

00:13:55.813 --> 00:13:57.565
I'm innocent.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.319
I'm innocent!

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.656
I'm innocent.

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:06.991
I'm innocent.

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:09.369
I didn't do it.

00:14:09.786 --> 00:14:11.204
I'm innocent.

00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:21.923
Witness, are you the wife
of Accounting Manager Kim Yong-jin

00:14:22.757 --> 00:14:25.635
the S Construction employee murdered
by Judge Lee Han-young?

00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:27.345
Yes.

00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:31.015
Has your husband told you anything

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:32.850
about Mr. Lee Han-young?

00:14:34.602 --> 00:14:35.603
Yes.

00:14:41.442 --> 00:14:42.694
Could you tell me

00:14:42.777 --> 00:14:44.112
what he said?

00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:47.699
JUDGE

00:14:49.117 --> 00:14:52.203
My husband said

00:14:52.787 --> 00:14:54.956
Judge Lee was
S Construction's legal counsel

00:14:56.874 --> 00:14:59.460
who took bribes
to rule in favor of people in court.

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:07.802
Then, my husband got his hands

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:11.139
on the company's funds with Mr. Lee

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:14.809
and said that he feared
being caught in an internal audit.

00:15:15.476 --> 00:15:16.477
So

00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:21.107
he went out to see Judge Lee...

00:15:23.234 --> 00:15:25.236
I had no idea when I was sitting up there.

00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:28.448
I had no idea

00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:33.244
why everyone sitting here

00:15:33.828 --> 00:15:35.621
so desperately said it was unfair.

00:15:37.415 --> 00:15:38.916
This is so unfair.

00:15:44.172 --> 00:15:45.423
So unfair.

00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:47.759
My husband took bribes

00:15:50.762 --> 00:15:52.305
to play in favor of people in court.

00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:57.101
He wanted to open an attorney's office

00:15:57.602 --> 00:15:59.353
for money laundering reasons, too.

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:03.441
I tried to stop him

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.278
and he said he wanted a divorce.

00:16:08.946 --> 00:16:10.948
Article 152, Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act.

00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:14.702
"A witness who,
having sworn according to Acts"

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:16.704
"gives false statement, shall be punished"

00:16:16.788 --> 00:16:20.291
"by imprisonment for less than five years
or by a fine under ten million won."

00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:22.376
- Defendant.
- Paragraph Two.

00:16:23.294 --> 00:16:25.963
"As regards a criminal
or disciplinary case"

00:16:26.047 --> 00:16:29.550
"a witness who, for the purpose
of causing injury to an accused"

00:16:29.842 --> 00:16:31.511
"commits the crime
of the preceding paragraph"

00:16:32.887 --> 00:16:36.307
"shall be punished by imprisonment
for less than ten years."

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.768
Defendant, what do you think you're doing?

00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:42.313
I'm just stating the violations

00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:45.024
Ms. Yu Se-hee is making

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:48.152
right now.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.328
What is he talking about?

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:02.333
You're kidding me.

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:09.549
What happened to you?

00:17:14.595 --> 00:17:17.140
You know your father was kicked out

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:19.308
of his care home, right?

00:17:21.853 --> 00:17:22.854
You didn't know?

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:26.357
Here.

00:17:33.906 --> 00:17:35.116
What did they do with my dad?

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:37.368
There's one more.

00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:41.205
Have you no conscience?

00:17:41.622 --> 00:17:43.958
You should've seen it coming.
You betrayed them first.

00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:48.880
What the hell did you do with my dad?

00:17:48.963 --> 00:17:51.382
You're such a terrible son.

00:17:54.552 --> 00:17:55.553
Seriously.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:57.763
But the worst thing would be

00:17:58.097 --> 00:17:59.640
for you to die before your father.

00:17:59.724 --> 00:18:01.392
What did you do with my dad...

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:05.980
What do you mean?

00:18:10.484 --> 00:18:11.986
Some guys will be waiting for you

00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:14.405
at the detention center.

00:18:15.907 --> 00:18:17.658
Don't let them torture you.

00:18:18.034 --> 00:18:19.160
Take this as soon as you get there.

00:18:19.452 --> 00:18:21.662
Whatever kills you,
it'll be recorded as an accident.

00:18:26.584 --> 00:18:28.336
Is this how you killed Choi Jong-hak, too?

00:18:30.671 --> 00:18:33.090
I guess this isn't so bad for you yet.

00:18:33.174 --> 00:18:34.926
You still have time to care about others?

00:18:35.593 --> 00:18:36.677
Is Chairman Jang behind it?

00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:39.597
You're so curious.
Of course, you're a judge.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.557
But you weren't like this in trials.

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:44.435
Think about it carefully.

00:18:44.727 --> 00:18:46.270
Starting from your wife

00:18:46.354 --> 00:18:48.940
it's odd that you have
absolutely nobody, isn't it?

00:18:51.108 --> 00:18:53.361
Chairman Jang wasn't the only one
in on this.

00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:56.948
From the arrest
to the prosecution and the trial

00:18:57.782 --> 00:19:00.284
don't you think things have progressed
too quickly?

00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:04.789
Chief Justice Kang is
very interested in the upcoming trial.

00:19:05.373 --> 00:19:07.124
Chief Justice Kang Sin-jin.

00:19:09.293 --> 00:19:11.712
At least you won't die in confusion,
knowing who's behind it.

00:19:11.796 --> 00:19:13.965
And let me tell you this
in case you're curious.

00:19:14.382 --> 00:19:16.300
You know the money you hid

00:19:16.884 --> 00:19:19.720
in the safe in the closet
of the care home? I took that all.

00:19:20.471 --> 00:19:22.056
You saved quite a bit for a puppet.

00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:24.475
What? What's wrong?

00:19:24.558 --> 00:19:26.644
You can't even use that money
after you die.

00:19:26.727 --> 00:19:27.728
What?

00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:30.564
You piece of shit!

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.110
This is what happens
when a shithead tries to be a judge!

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:36.904
You should've just lived your life
as a piece of shit.

00:19:36.988 --> 00:19:39.407
Who knows?
Maybe you could've been recycled.

00:19:40.491 --> 00:19:41.826
You dumbass.

00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:57.508
Take it as soon as you get there, alright?

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:39.383
Thanks for your hard work.

00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:42.136
He's such a jerk, you know?

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.478
Emergency!

00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:52.980
Call an ambulance!

00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:55.066
Ambulance!

00:20:57.943 --> 00:20:59.820
I told you to take it
at the detention center.

00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:01.989
Idiot.

00:21:03.949 --> 00:21:05.785
His heartbeat and breathing are
very unstable.

00:21:05.868 --> 00:21:07.244
- Please prepare gastric lavage.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:07.453 --> 00:21:08.871
He's reacting to a drug.

00:21:08.954 --> 00:21:11.207
- Where's the closest hospital?
- Within 15 minutes away.

00:21:17.463 --> 00:21:19.382
Check on the patient in 30 minutes

00:21:19.465 --> 00:21:21.092
- and let me know.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:42.655 --> 00:21:43.864
Help!

00:21:46.867 --> 00:21:47.952
Have you checked upstairs?

00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:49.286
Contact the prison guard.

00:21:49.453 --> 00:21:50.579
Sorry.

00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:52.206
I told you to keep an eye on him!

00:21:59.839 --> 00:22:01.382
I can't die a piece of shit.

00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:16.439
Yes, Kim Yoon-hyeok speaking.

00:22:16.814 --> 00:22:17.815
Go on.

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:52.433
CLOTHING DONATION BIN

00:25:38.724 --> 00:25:40.684
- Who's that man?
- What is he doing?

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.980
The Seoul Metropolitan Council has passed

00:26:27.064 --> 00:26:28.315
the 18th ordinance of 2025

00:26:28.399 --> 00:26:30.984
to expel all the homeless on the streets

00:26:31.068 --> 00:26:34.988
for improved city aesthetics
and public safety.

00:26:35.698 --> 00:26:38.492
This has left the homeless

00:26:38.575 --> 00:26:40.994
to hide in underpasses

00:26:41.078 --> 00:26:43.163
abandoned buildings, and sewers.

00:27:18.198 --> 00:27:19.700
Die!

00:27:19.783 --> 00:27:21.702
Die! What do you want?

00:27:32.337 --> 00:27:33.380
Dad.

00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:35.382
Dad!

00:27:35.883 --> 00:27:37.843
Dad!

00:27:38.218 --> 00:27:39.553
Please

00:27:39.636 --> 00:27:41.597
save me.

00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:11.251
This is where it ends.

00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:34.084
It's so unfair to die like this.

00:29:34.918 --> 00:29:36.211
When I've only begun

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.800
to want to live
as the real Lee Han-young now.

00:31:09.096 --> 00:31:10.180
Mother.

00:31:16.853 --> 00:31:17.854
Mother.

00:31:57.686 --> 00:31:59.312
I'm sorry, Mother.

00:32:24.755 --> 00:32:25.756
Sorry.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.261
I'm so sorry.

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:40.604
Give me a chance.

00:32:40.729 --> 00:32:42.272
Please give me a chance...

00:32:42.898 --> 00:32:45.400
Mother, I'm sorry.

00:32:46.818 --> 00:32:49.237
I'm so sorry.

00:32:52.991 --> 00:32:55.327
Please. I'm sorry.

00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:04.544
Defendant Lee Han-young.

00:33:08.548 --> 00:33:10.550
Does this still feel unfair to you?

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.563
Do you still believe you're innocent?

00:33:25.816 --> 00:33:27.317
I'm a cowardly son.

00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:30.737
I'm a murderer.

00:33:40.914 --> 00:33:41.915
I'm

00:33:42.833 --> 00:33:44.584
an accomplice with the devil.

00:33:47.003 --> 00:33:48.004
I'm

00:33:49.756 --> 00:33:51.174
guilty.

00:33:57.514 --> 00:33:58.682
Defendant Lee Han-young is

00:34:03.103 --> 00:34:04.104
guilty.

00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:17.742
SHIN NAM-SUK

00:34:22.539 --> 00:34:25.208
THE VICTIMS OF GOJIN CHEMICAL

00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:27.669
PRESIDING JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:34:48.023 --> 00:34:50.483
On April 20, 2025, around 1:30 a.m.

00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:51.985
the Defendant attempted
to break into a home

00:34:52.068 --> 00:34:53.987
on Jeongeui-ro, Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.864
through a window

00:34:55.947 --> 00:34:58.074
with the intention to steal
money and goods.

00:34:58.533 --> 00:35:00.619
However, the victim's boyfriend found him

00:35:00.702 --> 00:35:02.037
leaving it as a theft attempt.

00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:04.206
Your Honor, are you okay?

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.632
Your Honor.

00:35:15.091 --> 00:35:16.259
Your Honor!

00:35:20.096 --> 00:35:21.223
Your Honor!

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.101
Huh?

00:35:28.313 --> 00:35:29.314
Oh!

00:35:34.694 --> 00:35:35.695
Huh?

00:35:44.788 --> 00:35:46.039
- Oh!
- Huh?

00:35:46.248 --> 00:35:48.041
He was the prosecutor for my first case.

00:35:48.124 --> 00:35:49.125
That is all.

00:35:49.209 --> 00:35:51.461
I heard about life flashing
before our eyes when dying.

00:35:52.003 --> 00:35:53.380
I guess my flashback isn't over?

00:35:53.505 --> 00:35:54.547
Your Honor.

00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:58.009
Defendant Kim Sang-jin committed the crime

00:35:58.093 --> 00:35:59.427
out of impulse, in starvation.

00:35:59.511 --> 00:36:00.637
Kim Sang-jin?

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.764
He admits to all his charges

00:36:03.014 --> 00:36:05.141
and deeply regrets his actions.

00:36:07.811 --> 00:36:09.646
Kim Sang-jin.

00:36:11.064 --> 00:36:12.482
Kim Sang-jin.

00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:15.819
Kim Sang-jin!

00:36:16.403 --> 00:36:17.570
What?

00:36:17.696 --> 00:36:20.115
Kim Sang-jin, you son of a bitch.

00:36:20.198 --> 00:36:21.449
Your Honor.

00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:24.661
Your Honor, please calm down!

00:36:26.454 --> 00:36:29.332
I still wake up from time to time
at the thought of you.

00:36:29.416 --> 00:36:31.293
Why? It was just an attempted theft!

00:36:31.376 --> 00:36:33.753
Theft, my ass! You know nothing.

00:36:34.921 --> 00:36:36.172
Okay, hold on.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.258
Why do I sound like this?

00:36:38.758 --> 00:36:41.761
Sure, this is my chance to get
all my anger out before I go, right?

00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:46.266
Okay.

00:36:46.933 --> 00:36:48.727
It's okay. I'm fine.

00:36:52.731 --> 00:36:55.442
Hey, don't play dumb.
Look straight into my eyes.

00:37:05.618 --> 00:37:07.620
I'm sorry.

00:37:10.332 --> 00:37:12.334
Do you know what you've done? Yeah.

00:37:14.169 --> 00:37:15.378
You know what you did.

00:37:15.462 --> 00:37:17.672
Defendant Kim Sang-jin!

00:37:17.756 --> 00:37:19.799
I sentence you to the death penalty!

00:37:24.888 --> 00:37:27.307
You know how much I wanted to do that?

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.558
You have no idea!

00:38:07.222 --> 00:38:08.890
I'm ready!

00:38:08.973 --> 00:38:10.183
Let's go!

00:38:10.266 --> 00:38:12.185
Wherever it is, heaven or hell, I'm ready!

00:38:12.268 --> 00:38:13.269
Alright!

00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:17.690
Yes!

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:27.951
Am I in hell?

00:38:28.034 --> 00:38:29.035
Sure, then.

00:38:30.703 --> 00:38:33.832
Alright, let's go!

00:38:33.915 --> 00:38:35.333
Just go already.

00:38:35.417 --> 00:38:37.585
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:38:55.145 --> 00:38:56.646
Don't tell me I'm in hell.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.606
Man.

00:38:58.815 --> 00:39:00.817
I didn't think
I'd need to use the bathroom after death.

00:39:27.427 --> 00:39:29.095
Is this some post-mortem service?

00:39:30.013 --> 00:39:31.014
Wow!

00:39:31.514 --> 00:39:33.600
I had these glasses ten years ago.

00:39:34.934 --> 00:39:35.935
Watch your feet.

00:39:37.854 --> 00:39:39.439
Stop getting in my way!

00:39:42.025 --> 00:39:43.943
MAY 7, 2025

00:39:44.027 --> 00:39:45.111
2025?

00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:47.780
2025?

00:39:54.704 --> 00:39:55.705
Wow!

00:40:00.251 --> 00:40:01.544
Get your head away.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:07.634
No way.

00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:12.388
Damn it!

00:40:12.472 --> 00:40:13.556
"Damn it"?

00:40:14.474 --> 00:40:15.642
If this is 2025

00:40:15.725 --> 00:40:17.602
is this Lim Jeong-sik,
the Senior Presiding Judge?

00:40:18.561 --> 00:40:20.188
Yes, sir.

00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:21.814
Are you back in your right mind now?

00:40:22.899 --> 00:40:23.900
Judge Lee

00:40:23.983 --> 00:40:25.568
I know that was your first sole trial

00:40:25.652 --> 00:40:26.986
but you went too far!

00:40:28.655 --> 00:40:31.574
How can you sentence
an attempted theft to death?

00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:33.993
You think Kim Sang-jin is a serial killer?

00:40:34.077 --> 00:40:35.078
How did you know?

00:40:35.161 --> 00:40:36.162
You're still crazy.

00:40:36.246 --> 00:40:37.830
Wake up!

00:40:38.248 --> 00:40:40.208
You were fine as an accompanying judge.

00:40:40.542 --> 00:40:42.669
I'll take care of this.
You'll be on probation.

00:40:42.752 --> 00:40:45.004
- No, that's not it.
- Say that one more time!

00:40:47.006 --> 00:40:49.092
Or I'll make
your first sole trial your last.

00:40:57.350 --> 00:40:59.602
Maybe this is for real.

00:41:01.604 --> 00:41:02.605
Sir

00:41:02.689 --> 00:41:05.024
is it 2025 this year?

00:41:05.108 --> 00:41:06.609
I'm taking a dump!

00:41:06.693 --> 00:41:07.944
Just leave already!

00:41:08.027 --> 00:41:10.321
Why are you still talking?

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.448
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:18.454
CASE NUMBER: 2025H141121
COURT: CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:41:25.044 --> 00:41:26.212
Stop it!

00:41:26.296 --> 00:41:31.092
Can you just leave already?

00:41:38.182 --> 00:41:39.225
Oh?

00:41:39.642 --> 00:41:40.893
Kim Yoon-hyeok?

00:41:43.021 --> 00:41:44.814
Look at that.

00:41:46.608 --> 00:41:47.817
What the hell did you do with my dad?

00:41:50.987 --> 00:41:52.238
Take this as soon as you get there.

00:41:52.572 --> 00:41:54.699
Whatever kills you,
it'll be recorded as an accident.

00:41:57.076 --> 00:41:58.661
You piece of shit!

00:41:58.745 --> 00:42:01.748
This is what happens
when a shithead tries to be a judge!

00:42:01.831 --> 00:42:02.915
Huh?

00:42:06.336 --> 00:42:08.421
You son of a bitch!

00:42:14.177 --> 00:42:15.928
Why?

00:42:18.097 --> 00:42:19.974
This is before anything happened!

00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:23.770
Oh, what?

00:42:23.853 --> 00:42:25.438
You okay, Lee?

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.691
What's wrong? Are you okay?

00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:32.654
I'm so thankful to have you
when nobody is here to help me!

00:42:32.737 --> 00:42:34.030
Hey.

00:42:34.113 --> 00:42:35.198
What's with you?

00:42:35.281 --> 00:42:37.116
Did Mr. Lim scold you big time?

00:42:37.742 --> 00:42:39.452
In the bathroom.

00:42:39.535 --> 00:42:41.746
Forgive him. You went too far.

00:42:41.913 --> 00:42:43.623
Yeah, and what you did was

00:42:43.706 --> 00:42:45.541
way beyond going too far.

00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:46.709
Okay!

00:42:47.835 --> 00:42:48.878
Alright.

00:43:05.478 --> 00:43:06.604
Let's see.

00:43:08.439 --> 00:43:09.482
What do I do?

00:43:13.736 --> 00:43:14.737
What do I do now?

00:43:22.578 --> 00:43:24.831
Oh, yes, Mother.

00:43:33.923 --> 00:43:36.843
What brings the busy man to call,
Your Honor?

00:43:36.926 --> 00:43:38.678
Are you out of food to eat?

00:43:46.936 --> 00:43:48.187
No

00:43:49.272 --> 00:43:51.274
I just wanted to hear your voice, Mother.

00:43:52.608 --> 00:43:54.235
Huh? "Mother"?

00:43:55.236 --> 00:43:56.279
Mother

00:43:56.904 --> 00:43:58.156
you're healthy, right?

00:43:59.157 --> 00:44:00.658
Are you taking your asthma meds?

00:44:00.742 --> 00:44:02.493
And your inhaler.

00:44:04.495 --> 00:44:06.581
You always have it on you, right?

00:44:11.377 --> 00:44:12.670
Who are you?

00:44:13.546 --> 00:44:15.173
This is a scam, isn't it?

00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:17.759
- Listen, my son is a judge.
- Mother, it's me.

00:44:17.842 --> 00:44:19.761
How dare you try to scam a judge's mother?

00:44:19.844 --> 00:44:22.346
You sound like a young man.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.681
If you have time for scams

00:44:23.765 --> 00:44:25.808
call and check on your mom instead.

00:44:25.892 --> 00:44:26.934
No, Mother, it's me.

00:44:27.018 --> 00:44:30.104
I don't know who you are, alright?

00:44:30.188 --> 00:44:34.025
My son has never called me "Mother"
in his life.

00:44:35.526 --> 00:44:36.694
Mother! Mom!

00:44:36.778 --> 00:44:37.945
Mom!

00:44:40.031 --> 00:44:41.699
- Mom...
- Crazy guy.

00:44:43.367 --> 00:44:44.786
What was that about asthma?

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.954
My Han-young

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:50.541
has never called me "Mother" in his life.

00:44:51.375 --> 00:44:52.376
But wait.

00:44:54.796 --> 00:44:56.380
He sounded just like him.

00:45:05.723 --> 00:45:06.724
Huh?

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:09.185
Oh!

00:45:09.268 --> 00:45:11.562
Oh, right!

00:45:13.314 --> 00:45:16.484
This is before I started calling her
"Mother."

00:45:16.567 --> 00:45:17.652
MS. SHIN

00:45:18.277 --> 00:45:21.656
Right, this was before she got asthma.

00:45:22.657 --> 00:45:24.575
Hello there, Ms. Shin!

00:45:24.659 --> 00:45:26.494
That's my son, for sure.

00:45:26.577 --> 00:45:29.497
- Were you the one who called just now?
- No.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:30.998
Did something happen?

00:45:33.125 --> 00:45:34.544
S GROUP

00:45:34.627 --> 00:45:37.421
COMPANY PROFILE

00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:38.714
S Group...

00:45:39.298 --> 00:45:40.508
JANG TAE-SIK

00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:41.592
Ten years?

00:45:41.676 --> 00:45:42.718
- Please.
- Let go!

00:45:42.969 --> 00:45:45.346
Jang Tae-sik is
still just the owner of S Shopping now

00:45:45.513 --> 00:45:48.516
and the Chairman of S Group is
his father, Jang Yong-hyeon.

00:45:49.433 --> 00:45:51.477
S Shopping had a lot of issues
from tax evasion

00:45:51.561 --> 00:45:53.187
to embezzlement and slush funds

00:45:53.396 --> 00:45:54.605
but wiggled out every time.

00:45:55.356 --> 00:45:56.983
KOREAN COURT KNOWLEDGE SUPPORT SYSTEM

00:45:57.066 --> 00:45:58.985
KANG SIN-JIN

00:46:00.862 --> 00:46:03.281
SEARCH RESULT

00:46:06.868 --> 00:46:08.452
Kang Sin-jin hasn't become

00:46:08.536 --> 00:46:10.121
the Chief Justice yet, either.

00:46:10.204 --> 00:46:11.205
Wow.

00:46:13.791 --> 00:46:14.917
Unbelievable.

00:46:15.209 --> 00:46:16.544
How is this even possible?

00:46:18.713 --> 00:46:20.882
I've come exactly ten years back in time.

00:46:31.726 --> 00:46:33.144
Please

00:46:33.227 --> 00:46:35.062
save me.

00:46:37.231 --> 00:46:40.067
It's so unfair to die like this.

00:46:40.943 --> 00:46:42.194
When I've only begun

00:46:42.904 --> 00:46:46.616
to want to live
as the real Lee Han-young now.

00:46:47.491 --> 00:46:48.993
Defendant Lee Han-young is

00:46:49.493 --> 00:46:50.536
guilty.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:53.831
That's right.

00:46:54.498 --> 00:46:57.835
I'm a sinner who wasted his life
by making wrong choices.

00:46:58.753 --> 00:47:01.923
This means this life is a probation period

00:47:02.924 --> 00:47:04.675
for Defendant Lee Han-young.

00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:12.183
That means

00:47:12.266 --> 00:47:15.102
I should straighten things out,
starting with Kim Sang-jin's case.

00:47:17.188 --> 00:47:18.606
Gosh, my outfit.

00:47:19.357 --> 00:47:20.608
Haven't worn these in forever.

00:47:31.118 --> 00:47:32.954
Wait, which car was mine?

00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:35.623
My car back then was...

00:47:36.624 --> 00:47:38.876
non-existent.

00:47:52.014 --> 00:47:53.808
STONE JEONG-HO

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.355
When I became Haenal's puppet

00:47:59.438 --> 00:48:02.066
I even ditched my best friend,
Seok Jeong-ho.

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:04.568
But if this is 2025, I can still...

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.824
- Jeong-ho.
- Hey!

00:48:09.907 --> 00:48:11.993
What brings my crazy judge to call?

00:48:12.243 --> 00:48:15.538
You became a star
after moving to Chungcheongnam-do.

00:48:16.038 --> 00:48:17.957
You know, you've gone viral
as "the crazy judge."

00:48:18.332 --> 00:48:19.792
Did you call me to show off?

00:48:19.875 --> 00:48:21.419
DEATH PENALTY FOR THE FAILED THIEF

00:48:21.794 --> 00:48:22.878
What do you mean?

00:48:22.962 --> 00:48:25.673
You sentenced a thief to the death penalty

00:48:25.756 --> 00:48:27.508
when he hadn't even eaten in three days.

00:48:27.591 --> 00:48:30.845
No wonder they call you "the crazy judge."

00:48:30.928 --> 00:48:33.180
Kids don't want to become judges
because of you.

00:48:33.264 --> 00:48:34.390
Hey!

00:48:34.473 --> 00:48:37.435
You just don't know who he really is.

00:48:37.518 --> 00:48:39.186
What don't I know?

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:40.980
He's just a petty, failed thief.

00:48:41.647 --> 00:48:42.940
Forget it.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.442
Let me ask you a favor.

00:48:44.525 --> 00:48:45.609
I need to get a used car.

00:48:45.693 --> 00:48:46.861
Do you know anyone?

00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:50.114
You didn't sound drunk
when we called yesterday.

00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:51.407
- What?
- Remember?

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.201
You already called me
about a used car yesterday.

00:48:54.285 --> 00:48:55.369
Don't you remember?

00:48:56.203 --> 00:48:58.873
Oh, yeah, of course, I remember it.

00:48:58.956 --> 00:49:00.624
I'm just asking again.

00:49:01.125 --> 00:49:02.835
- When will the car be ready?
- Tomorrow.

00:49:03.461 --> 00:49:05.046
Tomorrow? Tomorrow...

00:49:05.421 --> 00:49:07.131
Okay, sure.

00:49:08.049 --> 00:49:09.133
Thanks.

00:49:10.134 --> 00:49:11.260
Hey, Han-young...

00:49:11.343 --> 00:49:12.636
Hey, Han-young...

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.225
Maybe being a judge is tiring.

00:49:26.567 --> 00:49:28.986
Don't mess with the mayor, alright?

00:49:29.487 --> 00:49:30.821
- Clean them up.
- Okay.

00:49:32.198 --> 00:49:33.199
Damn it.

00:49:49.423 --> 00:49:51.217
Nobody had known it by this point

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.678
but Kim Sang-jin was a serial killer
who'd killed three people already.

00:49:55.596 --> 00:49:57.765
But I fell for his tears

00:49:57.848 --> 00:49:59.600
and sentenced him to probation.

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:02.770
I started getting nightmares

00:50:02.853 --> 00:50:04.897
because the guy I put on probation killed

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.775
yet another victim.

00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:10.027
Sir...

00:50:19.203 --> 00:50:20.204
Huh?

00:50:20.955 --> 00:50:22.123
Judge Lee!

00:50:23.541 --> 00:50:26.335
Prosecutor Park Cheol-woo?
What are you doing here?

00:50:26.418 --> 00:50:27.878
What are you doing here?

00:50:28.337 --> 00:50:30.047
I'm here for a field inspection.

00:50:30.631 --> 00:50:32.133
Don't you read case files?

00:50:32.216 --> 00:50:34.552
The site is the house near the terminal,
not here.

00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:35.803
Why are you here?

00:50:36.178 --> 00:50:37.471
Well, no wonder.

00:50:39.974 --> 00:50:41.600
How can you get in here?

00:50:41.934 --> 00:50:43.227
Why would you go in?

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.395
Why are you here, then?

00:50:44.478 --> 00:50:45.646
Because you...

00:50:47.731 --> 00:50:49.817
- You said you knew nothing!
- You scared me.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.278
You should be near the terminal,
at the crime scene.

00:50:52.361 --> 00:50:53.571
Why are you here?

00:50:53.654 --> 00:50:55.447
I asked you first.

00:50:55.531 --> 00:50:58.492
Why don't you answer first, too, then?

00:50:58.576 --> 00:51:00.911
You already broke the Internet
as "the crazy judge."

00:51:00.995 --> 00:51:02.580
I guess I'll add "rude" to that.

00:51:02.663 --> 00:51:05.166
We don't know if I'm the rude one yet.

00:51:05.249 --> 00:51:07.501
Aren't you also here
because something is fishy?

00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:08.586
What's fishy?

00:51:08.669 --> 00:51:10.254
He climbed a wall out of hunger.

00:51:10.337 --> 00:51:11.589
I came to check just in case

00:51:11.672 --> 00:51:13.674
but I doubt we'll find anything here.

00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:14.925
What would we...

00:51:16.677 --> 00:51:18.053
possibly find around here?

00:51:18.762 --> 00:51:19.763
Huh?

00:51:25.686 --> 00:51:26.687
Oh?

00:51:41.952 --> 00:51:43.078
- What are you, a princess?
- My gosh.

00:51:43.162 --> 00:51:44.205
Let me do it.

00:51:55.883 --> 00:51:56.926
Just like this.

00:51:57.718 --> 00:51:59.637
- Easy. All good.
- Wow.

00:52:01.388 --> 00:52:02.848
See? Easy.

00:52:02.932 --> 00:52:04.725
Isn't this property damage?

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:08.229
I wouldn't call it "damage."
Nothing's broken.

00:52:08.312 --> 00:52:09.313
Without a warrant?

00:52:12.149 --> 00:52:14.318
Anyway, since you took it off,
get the door for me.

00:52:25.246 --> 00:52:26.830
I shouldn't have colluded with him.

00:52:27.164 --> 00:52:28.582
This is crazy.

00:52:38.968 --> 00:52:40.594
What are you possibly trying to find?

00:52:41.345 --> 00:52:42.846
You've dealt with violent crimes, right?

00:52:43.514 --> 00:52:44.598
Of course.

00:52:49.812 --> 00:52:50.854
I'm opening it.

00:52:51.522 --> 00:52:52.523
One

00:52:53.399 --> 00:52:54.400
two

00:52:56.777 --> 00:52:57.778
three!

00:53:00.614 --> 00:53:01.907
Goodness!

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.457
Corpses.

00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:13.210
What are corpses doing here?

00:53:15.754 --> 00:53:17.965
Let go! My goodness.

00:53:20.884 --> 00:53:22.011
Corpses...

00:53:23.554 --> 00:53:25.306
There's something inside! What is it?

00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:27.725
It's almost open.

00:53:28.475 --> 00:53:30.477
- Oh? Hold on.
- Why?

00:53:34.857 --> 00:53:36.025
What?

00:53:39.278 --> 00:53:40.321
Huh?

00:53:41.322 --> 00:53:42.781
Do you just like to scream

00:53:42.865 --> 00:53:44.408
- every time you open a fridge?
- It's not here.

00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:45.492
It should be here.

00:53:45.576 --> 00:53:46.994
What are you even looking for?

00:53:47.077 --> 00:53:49.455
Stop asking me questions
and start looking!

00:53:49.538 --> 00:53:50.539
Whatever!

00:53:51.206 --> 00:53:52.583
I thought these were bones!

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.835
You're not explaining anything!

00:53:57.296 --> 00:54:00.341
I must find proof
that Kim Sang-jin is a serial killer.

00:54:00.799 --> 00:54:01.884
His third murder happened

00:54:01.967 --> 00:54:03.927
three days before getting arrested
for attempted theft.

00:54:04.011 --> 00:54:05.387
And it was recorded

00:54:05.471 --> 00:54:07.681
that the victim was found in the fridge.

00:54:11.852 --> 00:54:14.188
That's enough. Come back out now.

00:54:14.772 --> 00:54:17.775
Before we get caught
for breaking in and property damage.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:19.193
Come out.

00:54:22.029 --> 00:54:23.906
BLEACH

00:54:32.247 --> 00:54:36.210
Could he have had a temporary place
for keeping his corpses?

00:54:37.211 --> 00:54:39.171
BLEACH

00:54:39.254 --> 00:54:40.756
PURE BLEACH

00:54:41.715 --> 00:54:42.966
That's a different brand.

00:54:43.592 --> 00:54:46.470
Why are people in this area so serious
about house cleaning?

00:54:48.389 --> 00:54:49.807
Is that death sentence-worthy, too?

00:54:51.225 --> 00:54:53.727
I didn't know
you were the type to hold grudges.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.105
Do you even know me?

00:54:56.438 --> 00:54:58.232
No, I just get a vibe.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.162
What's with those hands behind his back
like an old man?

00:55:16.375 --> 00:55:18.502
That's a good counterstrike.

00:55:18.585 --> 00:55:21.797
Good choice! Good eye.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.424
This is what I find disappointing.

00:55:23.507 --> 00:55:26.969
What if he'd taken some swings
before this?

00:55:27.052 --> 00:55:28.178
You an Eagles fan?

00:55:29.847 --> 00:55:31.014
How did you know?

00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:37.938
I'm here because you said you'd pay,
but I'm leaving right away.

00:55:38.021 --> 00:55:40.023
I don't want to have anything
to do with you...

00:55:40.941 --> 00:55:41.942
Hey!

00:55:42.192 --> 00:55:43.902
Hey!

00:55:43.986 --> 00:55:45.362
Oh, my gosh!

00:55:45.446 --> 00:55:46.738
That was...

00:55:46.822 --> 00:55:48.323
Another out at first base!

00:55:48.407 --> 00:55:50.784
It's okay. The Eagles will win, anyway.

00:55:51.118 --> 00:55:52.536
But it'll go overtime.

00:55:52.619 --> 00:55:54.371
A walk-off home run
in the bottom of the 11th.

00:55:54.705 --> 00:55:55.873
The Eagles wins.

00:55:57.416 --> 00:55:58.709
Are you spreading false information?

00:55:58.792 --> 00:55:59.793
You want to bet?

00:56:00.461 --> 00:56:03.046
The loser has to grant the winner's wish,
no matter what.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:09.511
You down?

00:56:11.889 --> 00:56:12.890
Down?

00:56:14.892 --> 00:56:16.185
- Down.
- Water.

00:56:16.518 --> 00:56:18.145
DISABLED THE DOOR LOCK SOUND

00:56:18.562 --> 00:56:19.646
THE ALIBI AND THE FACTS MATCH

00:56:25.277 --> 00:56:27.446
All of this is about theft.

00:56:38.707 --> 00:56:40.250
No.

00:56:40.959 --> 00:56:43.504
The third victim's body was
definitely found

00:56:43.587 --> 00:56:45.547
in the fridge.

00:56:46.757 --> 00:56:48.759
Was the case record wrong?

00:56:50.219 --> 00:56:51.220
No.

00:56:51.803 --> 00:56:55.474
From what I remember,
there were even photos from the site.

00:57:36.181 --> 00:57:37.516
Unbelievable.

00:57:37.933 --> 00:57:40.060
It's like he's lost his mind.

00:57:43.939 --> 00:57:45.274
Good morning.

00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:48.110
Hey.

00:57:49.403 --> 00:57:50.529
Was he here all night?

00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:53.031
It seems like it.

00:57:54.366 --> 00:57:56.076
Why did he sentence him
to the death penalty?

00:57:57.786 --> 00:57:59.621
I'm not really sure, either.

00:58:01.748 --> 00:58:02.874
Weren't you classmates?

00:58:03.458 --> 00:58:04.459
Yes, sir.

00:58:05.877 --> 00:58:07.337
Tell him to come to my office
after breakfast.

00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:10.716
Come on. It's too early for this.

00:58:11.466 --> 00:58:13.260
My stomach has been so upset lately.

00:58:13.885 --> 00:58:15.304
Tell him to come to my office.

00:58:15.387 --> 00:58:16.388
Yes, sir.

00:58:17.848 --> 00:58:19.600
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

00:58:24.688 --> 00:58:27.316
It's too early for something so gross.

00:58:28.025 --> 00:58:30.652
Why does he keep coming here?
It's so awkward.

00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:39.244
It's the good Kim Yoon-hyeok.

00:58:39.328 --> 00:58:41.038
I know I'm a good person.

00:58:42.372 --> 00:58:43.582
Did you sleep here?

00:58:43.707 --> 00:58:44.750
Yeah.

00:58:46.668 --> 00:58:48.545
Mr. Lim wants to see you in his office.

00:58:49.212 --> 00:58:50.255
Okay.

00:59:01.516 --> 00:59:04.770
It hasn't changed a bit.

00:59:17.366 --> 00:59:18.867
It's all the same.

00:59:22.329 --> 00:59:23.622
Look at the phone.

00:59:23.705 --> 00:59:26.541
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:59:29.586 --> 00:59:30.629
Are you kidding?

00:59:34.132 --> 00:59:35.300
Did you call me, sir?

00:59:44.351 --> 00:59:45.769
I'll close the door for you.

00:59:47.354 --> 00:59:48.689
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

00:59:51.942 --> 00:59:53.443
Gosh, you startled me.

01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:04.538
Acting like a presiding judge
means nothing.

01:00:06.164 --> 01:00:07.708
Keep causing trouble from the start

01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.377
and you'll spend your whole career
moving around regional courts.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.795
I know Chief Judge Baek Yi-seok

01:00:11.878 --> 01:00:13.672
got on the wrong side of the higher-ups
and came here

01:00:13.755 --> 01:00:15.215
but you need to move up to Seoul.

01:00:16.883 --> 01:00:18.218
What's your plan for Kim?

01:00:20.846 --> 01:00:22.764
It was a theft attempt out of hunger.

01:00:22.848 --> 01:00:25.642
I'll make an appropriate verdict
as per the standards.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.561
You're not crazy now?

01:00:30.105 --> 01:00:31.440
Please continue

01:00:32.733 --> 01:00:35.444
to supervise me with a critical eye.

01:00:36.903 --> 01:00:39.698
Taking over the Internet as a judge is
an experience, too.

01:00:40.115 --> 01:00:42.159
Let me know anytime if you want attention.

01:00:42.242 --> 01:00:43.493
I'll give you some.

01:00:43.869 --> 01:00:44.870
Yes, sir!

01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:49.040
You may leave.

01:01:05.974 --> 01:01:08.727
Why do I still feel like something is off?

01:01:09.644 --> 01:01:10.645
The verdict is ready.

01:01:11.563 --> 01:01:13.064
I sentence Defendant Kim Sang-jin

01:01:13.356 --> 01:01:15.108
to one year in prison.

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:16.651
However

01:01:17.235 --> 01:01:19.488
the court grants probation of two years

01:01:19.571 --> 01:01:21.531
starting from the date
of the final judgment.

01:01:25.827 --> 01:01:28.830
DEFENDANT

01:01:45.514 --> 01:01:46.681
Where have I seen him?

01:01:48.099 --> 01:01:49.351
- He's coming.
- Judge Lee!

01:01:49.434 --> 01:01:51.436
Judge Lee.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.021
It was the death penalty last time.

01:01:53.104 --> 01:01:54.773
Isn't a year in prison
and two on probation

01:01:54.856 --> 01:01:56.358
too dramatic?

01:01:56.691 --> 01:01:58.860
My verdict last time was more dramatic.

01:01:59.319 --> 01:02:02.531
I sincerely apologize as a judge

01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:04.449
who should make fair, logical judgment.

01:02:06.618 --> 01:02:08.537
- Oh, I...
- Let's wrap it up here.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.830
Has everyone eaten?

01:02:10.872 --> 01:02:13.250
Eat something and get some rest.

01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:14.709
Excuse me, then.

01:02:17.754 --> 01:02:19.047
Look at that charisma.

01:02:19.798 --> 01:02:21.508
Was that a presiding judge just now?

01:02:21.675 --> 01:02:23.385
Wasn't that his first sole trial?

01:02:24.219 --> 01:02:25.679
Hey, did we get a photo of him?

01:02:25.762 --> 01:02:27.222
- Hold on.
- Darn it!

01:02:27.305 --> 01:02:28.932
Let's go.

01:02:46.658 --> 01:02:48.410
He really has a killer smile.

01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:57.210
Judge Lee, please let us take
a photo of you.

01:03:06.928 --> 01:03:10.515
- Any word for the bereaved?
- Look this way!

01:03:13.727 --> 01:03:15.437
It's her! Kang Ju-yeong.

01:03:20.525 --> 01:03:21.735
It's the kimchi fridge.

01:03:21.818 --> 01:03:24.696
Kim Sang-jin's third victim was found
in a kimchi fridge

01:03:24.779 --> 01:03:26.364
for a horrifying reason.

01:03:26.448 --> 01:03:28.450
I was dispatched
to fix the air conditioner

01:03:28.533 --> 01:03:30.076
in the main bedroom

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:32.954
and the kimchi fridge was blocking
the outdoor unit.

01:03:33.455 --> 01:03:35.707
So, I tried to push it a bit to the side

01:03:35.999 --> 01:03:37.959
- and the woman freaked out.
- Why won't it move?

01:03:38.043 --> 01:03:39.711
- What's inside that it's so heavy?
- And

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.838
it was odd to see the fridge

01:03:41.922 --> 01:03:44.257
- in their bedroom.
- Please don't touch this.

01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:46.384
She made such a big deal about it

01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:47.594
so I got curious.

01:03:48.219 --> 01:03:50.680
So, when she went to the bathroom

01:03:50.931 --> 01:03:52.807
I secretly opened it.

01:03:54.517 --> 01:03:55.644
I was mortified.

01:04:07.739 --> 01:04:09.407
What?

01:04:09.991 --> 01:04:11.117
Hey!

01:04:30.929 --> 01:04:32.097
Ha-yeon!

01:04:32.681 --> 01:04:33.932
Did you have fun?

01:04:34.933 --> 01:04:37.310
Ha-yeon, let's eat dinner at home

01:04:37.394 --> 01:04:38.603
and come back out to play.

01:04:38.687 --> 01:04:40.480
- Okay, Mommy.
- Shake your hands off.

01:04:40.563 --> 01:04:42.190
Don't forget your things.

01:04:43.775 --> 01:04:45.026
Let's go. Hold my hand.

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:46.528
Let's go. Good girl.

01:04:46.945 --> 01:04:47.946
Look at it.

01:04:48.822 --> 01:04:51.449
This car comes at a used car price

01:04:51.533 --> 01:04:53.076
but it's as good as new.

01:04:53.159 --> 01:04:54.202
There's a scratch.

01:04:54.285 --> 01:04:56.579
I mean, it's almost new.

01:04:57.247 --> 01:04:59.708
Please put in a good word for me

01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:01.209
to Jeong-ho, the angel.

01:05:01.292 --> 01:05:02.293
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:05:02.377 --> 01:05:04.796
ILJJA MART

01:05:21.771 --> 01:05:22.772
Hello.

01:05:22.856 --> 01:05:24.232
Oh, hello.

01:05:24.315 --> 01:05:25.567
Could I ask you a question?

01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:26.651
- Sure.
- Has anyone

01:05:26.735 --> 01:05:28.319
come by to buy these in bulk?

01:05:28.403 --> 01:05:29.404
Oh...

01:05:30.488 --> 01:05:31.489
I'm not sure.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.992
What do they look like?

01:05:34.159 --> 01:05:36.745
She had a hat on, so I'm not sure.
It was a woman.

01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:39.247
I'm not sure.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:40.498
This is the brand.

01:05:40.582 --> 01:05:41.833
We don't carry that.

01:05:43.168 --> 01:05:44.669
- Okay, then.
- Have a good day.

01:05:44.753 --> 01:05:45.837
Thank you.

01:05:46.588 --> 01:05:48.590
- Hello, Prosecutor Park.
- Hey.

01:05:48.923 --> 01:05:51.259
Sang-jin won't move
an inch out of his house.

01:05:51.342 --> 01:05:52.594
Forget that.

01:05:52.927 --> 01:05:54.512
Yesterday's game wasn't a rerun.

01:05:54.596 --> 01:05:55.597
How did you know?

01:05:56.723 --> 01:05:59.809
And it goes all the way to the left!

01:05:59.893 --> 01:06:02.353
And it keeps going!

01:06:02.437 --> 01:06:03.438
Yes!

01:06:04.939 --> 01:06:06.357
- Huh?
- Another home run!

01:06:06.649 --> 01:06:08.902
I was just stating my hope. I guessed.

01:06:09.235 --> 01:06:11.529
Anyway, don't lose sight of Sang-jin.

01:06:14.115 --> 01:06:16.701
Because that match made me become
an Eagles fan.

01:06:20.288 --> 01:06:22.749
We're leaving tonight. Get ready.

01:06:27.128 --> 01:06:29.881
DALLAE APARTMENT

01:06:32.383 --> 01:06:34.052
Sang-jin is outside.

01:06:35.261 --> 01:06:37.180
Kim Sang-jin is a serial killer.

01:06:37.263 --> 01:06:39.057
He'll kill a six-year-old girl today...

01:06:39.766 --> 01:06:40.767
No.

01:06:42.393 --> 01:06:44.062
I can't let the kid die again.

01:06:44.145 --> 01:06:45.355
KIM SANG-JIN IS A SERIAL KILLER

01:06:47.315 --> 01:06:48.399
Excuse me!

01:06:48.483 --> 01:06:51.444
There was a woman who bought
loads of something else.

01:07:03.581 --> 01:07:06.668
- Ms. Kang Ju-yeong.
- She almost became Kim's third target.

01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:09.045
I know you're being blackmailed
by Mr. Kim Sang-jin.

01:07:09.796 --> 01:07:10.922
Another victim.

01:07:15.802 --> 01:07:16.845
Ms. Kang.

01:07:20.849 --> 01:07:21.891
I know it all.

01:07:22.183 --> 01:07:23.726
You have no choice but to obey him

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:25.854
because he's threatening to kill

01:07:25.937 --> 01:07:27.689
your mother and niece
working at the market.

01:07:28.439 --> 01:07:30.608
I'm so sorry.

01:07:30.692 --> 01:07:32.569
- Please forgive me.
- Please open the door.

01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:35.822
I'm so sorry.

01:08:03.892 --> 01:08:05.476
I'm sorry.

01:08:05.894 --> 01:08:07.103
I'm sorry.

01:08:07.312 --> 01:08:09.814
I'm so sorry.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:11.983
It's okay.

01:08:12.483 --> 01:08:13.484
You'll be okay.

01:08:14.319 --> 01:08:16.154
I should've died then.

01:08:16.404 --> 01:08:18.489
I should've let him kill me.

01:08:18.573 --> 01:08:19.991
I should've died!

01:08:30.752 --> 01:08:32.086
What's wrong? Are you okay?

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:33.838
Please save me.

01:08:33.922 --> 01:08:35.423
Hold on.

01:08:50.438 --> 01:08:51.439
Your Honor

01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:53.441
please give me the death penalty.

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:56.236
I deserve to die.

01:08:56.861 --> 01:08:59.197
No, why should you die?

01:08:59.489 --> 01:09:01.282
You sentenced him to the death penalty

01:09:01.366 --> 01:09:02.659
but you let him out.

01:09:03.034 --> 01:09:04.285
Why did you do that?

01:09:04.369 --> 01:09:06.120
Why did you lie?

01:09:07.538 --> 01:09:11.960
Now, he'll kill my mom and niece, too.

01:09:13.419 --> 01:09:14.796
I didn't lie.

01:09:16.965 --> 01:09:18.675
I let him go to get him for good.

01:09:19.717 --> 01:09:21.261
To arrest him for murder charges

01:09:22.011 --> 01:09:23.513
instead of mere housebreaking.

01:09:25.515 --> 01:09:26.516
So

01:09:30.186 --> 01:09:31.271
trust me.

01:09:39.696 --> 01:09:41.281
- Ye-na.
- Yes?

01:09:41.364 --> 01:09:42.365
It's dinnertime.

01:09:42.448 --> 01:09:43.866
- Hey, come on.
- Hurry.

01:09:58.423 --> 01:10:00.883
Sang-jin is at a nearby playground.

01:10:03.136 --> 01:10:04.971
I'm done after this.

01:10:05.471 --> 01:10:07.473
- As for the rest...
- Arrest him right now.

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:08.891
You're kidding!

01:10:09.392 --> 01:10:10.560
Have you gone mad?

01:10:11.311 --> 01:10:12.729
For what do I arrest a man

01:10:12.812 --> 01:10:14.063
just eating snacks at a park?

01:10:15.315 --> 01:10:16.566
Did you not see my text?

01:10:16.649 --> 01:10:19.027
Yeah, about him being a serial killer.

01:10:19.444 --> 01:10:20.820
Are you still onto that?

01:10:21.738 --> 01:10:22.739
There's a girl in a duck shirt

01:10:22.822 --> 01:10:24.324
at the playground, right?

01:10:28.578 --> 01:10:29.746
How did you know?

01:10:29.829 --> 01:10:30.830
Where are you?

01:10:31.164 --> 01:10:32.582
Arrest him right now.

01:10:33.416 --> 01:10:34.667
Or she'll die.

01:10:39.339 --> 01:10:41.674
What nonsense are you...

01:10:42.675 --> 01:10:43.760
saying?

01:10:47.805 --> 01:10:50.016
He called me.

01:10:50.933 --> 01:10:52.101
Don't worry.

01:10:52.226 --> 01:10:55.313
I'll make sure
he can never call you again.

01:11:01.986 --> 01:11:03.071
Did you arrest him?

01:11:08.534 --> 01:11:10.119
He seemed to be on his phone

01:11:10.203 --> 01:11:11.371
and suddenly ran away.

01:11:11.746 --> 01:11:14.123
I'm chasing after him,
but are you sure he's a murderer?

01:11:14.207 --> 01:11:16.334
Don't let him go. Get him, no matter what.

01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:17.460
Fine.

01:11:20.004 --> 01:11:21.047
Are there spy cams here?

01:11:22.632 --> 01:11:23.633
The teddy!

01:11:29.389 --> 01:11:30.473
I forgot

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.725
that he'd openly installed spy cams

01:11:32.809 --> 01:11:34.644
to threaten Kang Ju-yeong.

01:11:35.978 --> 01:11:37.146
Where are you right now?

01:11:43.736 --> 01:11:45.029
A very steep set of stairs.

01:12:06.175 --> 01:12:07.176
And now?

01:12:07.677 --> 01:12:10.930
On my way down after reaching the top.

01:12:14.267 --> 01:12:15.435
Do you know where he is?

01:12:16.394 --> 01:12:19.021
He's going to kill my mom and niece.

01:12:19.689 --> 01:12:21.190
Please, sir.

01:12:21.274 --> 01:12:22.775
I have to see my mom.

01:12:22.859 --> 01:12:24.735
Please let me go to my mom!

01:12:24.819 --> 01:12:27.655
That's right. I'm a judge.

01:12:28.948 --> 01:12:29.991
So

01:12:30.533 --> 01:12:32.493
let's put Sang-jin on trial together.

01:12:33.202 --> 01:12:36.038
So that he can never mess
with your mother or niece.

01:12:42.587 --> 01:12:44.130
Do you know the way down?

01:13:16.496 --> 01:13:18.664
Ju-yeong, repeat it out loud after me.

01:13:20.082 --> 01:13:22.001
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin...

01:13:25.046 --> 01:13:27.173
"The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin..."

01:13:27.256 --> 01:13:29.258
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

01:13:30.343 --> 01:13:32.303
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

01:13:32.595 --> 01:13:34.680
Say it louder!

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.975
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

01:13:38.059 --> 01:13:39.060
Even louder!

01:13:40.436 --> 01:13:42.605
The court sentences
the murderer, Kim Sang-jin!

01:13:42.688 --> 01:13:44.607
To death!

01:13:45.525 --> 01:13:47.777
To death!

01:13:52.198 --> 01:13:53.824
So ordered!

01:14:27.358 --> 01:14:30.945
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:14:55.011 --> 01:14:56.220
A judge shouldn't do this.

01:14:56.304 --> 01:14:57.513
Do I have to be nice, too?

01:14:57.597 --> 01:14:58.764
Whatever it is

01:14:58.848 --> 01:15:00.349
don't you know
all court decisions are recorded?

01:15:00.433 --> 01:15:02.518
I hear there's an interesting judge
at the Chungnam Court.

01:15:02.602 --> 01:15:04.770
Find a case and assign it to Judge Lee.

01:15:04.854 --> 01:15:07.815
A bride-to-be died in a car accident.

01:15:07.898 --> 01:15:09.358
At first, I thought it was an accident.

01:15:09.442 --> 01:15:10.860
The issue is, all her insurances had

01:15:10.943 --> 01:15:12.445
an assigned beneficiary.

01:15:12.903 --> 01:15:14.989
Bring my Seong-hui back to life!

01:15:15.072 --> 01:15:16.699
Do your job! You're a judge!

01:15:16.782 --> 01:15:18.200
Do you think Park Hyeok-jun really did it?

01:15:18.284 --> 01:15:21.078
Success ends quickly
without a good leader.

01:15:21.162 --> 01:15:22.330
Who are you, really?

01:15:22.413 --> 01:15:23.539
Are you a real judge?

01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:28.544
