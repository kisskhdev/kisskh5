[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.120
[Episode 2]

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.890
Om mani padme hum.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.390
May you soon be liberated

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.520
from the Six Realms of Reincarnation.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.250
Don't move!

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.680
Dongzhiba!

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.790
There's only food and gasoline.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.730
You're from the Mountain Patrol?

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.760
How did you find this place?

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.030
By chance.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.330
Where are the others?

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.130
I don't know.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.220
Boss,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.640
she looks like a cop.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.190
Are you a cop?

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.820
Yes.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.140
What are you looking at?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.770
Ju?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.000
Go to work.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.820
The Mountain Patrol is here!

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.420
The Mountain Patrol is here!

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.679
Pack up the pelts.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:34.200
Let's go.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.340
Bai Ji!

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.790
The Mountain Patrol is here!

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.200
Ju!

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.670
Ju!

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.460
Ju!

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.510
Are you okay?

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.910
Ju. Ju.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:35.360
Ju.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.630
Are you okay?

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.370
Ju.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.170
Grandma.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.860
I'm sorry.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.670
I didn't take good care of Dongzhiba.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.090
Don't say that.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.340
Dongzhiba followed

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.960
the person he respected most.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.870
And now he has gone

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.550
to the place he wanted to go.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.510
This is his karma,

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.700
his destiny.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.050
May the Buddha bless him.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.420
May his soul ascend to heaven safely.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.780
Burn them even if you can't bear to.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.330
Don't disturb his reincarnation.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.270
What are you doing?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:31.970
Move!

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.600
What are you doing?

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.310
Don't fight!

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.790
Why are you fighting?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.050
Who wants to fight him?

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.790
Move. I want to go home.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:49.620
You brat.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.740
You coward.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.120
What's the use of having guts?

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.240
Today, it was Dongzhiba who died.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.720
Tomorrow, who knows

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.250
which one of us will be next?

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.290
Are you quitting, too?

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.250
Then tell me,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.790
are sheep's lives more important

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:00.740
than human lives?

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.340
The people who killed him

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.840
are still in the mountains.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.460
If you leave like this,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.980
you're no bro of Dongzhiba.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.710
If you want to go back in, you go.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.270
They each have a submachine gun

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.140
and semi-automatics,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.500
and they've got an endless supply of ammo.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.300
But look at us.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.510
We have just these few broken guns.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.330
The ammo ran out before we even

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.440
made it out of the mountains.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.640
Even if you find them,

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.770
what will you use to fight against them?

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.700
Stones?

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.930
Just like Dongzhiba?

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.040
I'll teach you a lesson for your dad!

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.850
What's going on downstairs?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.750
Liu and Jiumei wanted to leave,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.320
but Zhacuo got into a fight with them.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.990
Then why didn't you go help?

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.890
You still haven't returned

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:49.820
that copy of Light Weapons

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.020
you borrowed from me.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.130
I haven't finished reading it yet.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.460
I want it now.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.690
Are you leaving?

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.340
Aren't you leaving, too?

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.480
Climb over the wall.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:28.930
Don't use the door.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.350
The Public Security Bureau
is organizing an arrest

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.950
and setting up checkpoints
on all major roads.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.670
But the suspect

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.020
hasn't been caught yet.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.630
I take full responsibility

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.910
for this incident.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.620
[Party Secretary of Mazhi
County Party Committee, Chen Cheng]

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.820
We set off too hastily

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.859
and didn't have time to prepare

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.859
enough supplies.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.900
This caused Comrade Dongzhiba

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.560
and Bai Ju to be
in life-threatening situation.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.550
I will accept whatever punishment

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.010
the higher-ups hand down.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.349
The county is aware

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.440
of the Mountain Patrol's difficulties.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.680
As for the county's difficulties,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.339
Deputy County Mayor Duo
surely knows them, too.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.810
This meeting

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.150
is not just
about assigning responsibility.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.900
We also need to decide

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.050
what to do next.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
County Mayor Lin,

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.990
why don't you speak first?

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.920
The Mazhi County
Economic Development Company

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.250
has been established
for a year and a half.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.240
And the county finance department

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.580
allocated funds four times,

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.990
totaling 236,800 yuan.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.030
Is that correct?

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.050
At the beginning,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.900
we brought in an external company

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.160
to attempt silver mining.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.470
However,

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.920
due to inaccurate survey reports

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.580
and substandard ore quality,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.180
it ultimately failed.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.110
We still owe that company

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.240
over a million yuan.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.960
Besides that,

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.670
we haven't produced a single

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.380
valuable

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.260
survey report.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.810
So I want to ask,

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.550
Deputy County Mayor Duojie,

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.950
what have you been doing?

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.020
I admit that I have failed

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.020
in my duties.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.660
But as work progressed,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.270
we found that the Uninhabited Zone

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.170
is not

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.390
what we imagined it to be.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.160
So our work plan

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.480
and scope

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.130
have to be adjusted.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.620
The current Bolamula

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.530
isn't some uninhabited zone anymore.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.720
It's full of people—

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.570
Antelope poachers,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.420
brine shrimp catchers,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.520
and placer gold panners.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.090
These are all

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.200
tangible profits.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.090
Right now, the priority

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.330
isn't development.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.570
Our most urgent crisis is

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.480
that we can't even guarantee

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.540
the most basic laws

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.030
and regulations here.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.140
Who's stopping you from cracking down on crime?

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.270
Who's stopping you?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.290
I know it's chaotic in there,

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.110
but why?

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.810
Isn't it because people are poor?

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.370
Isn't it all

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.030
because the county's economy

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.810
can't grow?

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.500
Everyone wants to live a good life.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.190
Tell me,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.280
what is a good life?

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.020
Are people ever really satisfied?

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.920
People's desires

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.610
is just like the Uninhabited Zone,

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.270
boundless.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.330
Alright, alright.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.840
Arguing won't solve the problem.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.120
County Mayor Lin,

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.010
let's hear your opinion.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.700
My proposal is

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.440
to disband the Mountain Patrol,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.070
cut all

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.750
county funding

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.810
for it,

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.230
and reorganize a geological survey team

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.490
to produce a survey report

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.880
as quickly as possible.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.100
Then let's follow
the organizational protocol

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.500
and decide this through a democratic vote.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.680
Those who agree with County Mayor Lin,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.100
please raise your hands.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.670
Six votes. Passed.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.720
Next item.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.710
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.110
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.930
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.320
Next item.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.800
Feng Keqing
from the Xihai Chamber of Commerce

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.270
contacted me recently.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.850
He wants to organize

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:48.400
a site visit

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.640
to Mazhi County

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.190
and its surrounding areas.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.440
Isn't he

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.060
in the restaurant business?

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.770
Does he do mining, too?

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.610
I guess he's just a middleman.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.730
He's acting as a go-between,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.330
trying to make a commission.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.810
Regardless,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.420
it's a rare opportunity.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.800
The altitude here is so high.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:13.250
Make sure they're well received.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.610
I went down to get something.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.310
Let's stick to the agenda.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.660
Please continue.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.020
If you're not going to speak,

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:54.830
fine,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.000
then I'll speak first.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.860
I brought you some

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.660
local specialties from Bolamula.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.460
Share them.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.830
Good stuff. They're valuable.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.460
Duojie, what are you doing?

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.790
I won't waste your time.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.170
Since you can't go see for yourselves,

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.900
I brought it here for you to see.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.330
What it's really like

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.440
inside Bolamula.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.510
The Tibetan antelope

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.400
is a rare species

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.130
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.760
At the scene where Dongzhiba died,

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.750
the poachers killed

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.420
364 Tibetan antelopes.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.030
Over 100 of them

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.430
hadn't been skinned yet.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:35.270
This is only

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.350
a fraction of it.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.930
This single sheepskin alone

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.990
goes for eighty dollars
on the black market,

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.690
which is

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.980
over six hundred yuan.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.790
How much does a local earn

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.190
working for a whole year?

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.190
Imagine the temptation.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.330
If no one patrols

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.590
the Uninhabited Zone,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.620
the poachers will do anything

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.990
for money.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.100
Before long,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:22:59.760
the Tibetan antelope

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.070
will be wiped out!

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.810
What will be next—

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.050
Tibetan sand fox,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.650
wild yaks,

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.720
or snow leopards?

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.640
When these animals

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.680
are all slaughtered,

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.530
what will be left

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.260
on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau?

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.110
Now,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.820
they even dare to kill people!

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.010
I did say

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.110
we can't modernize

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.750
just by relying on livestock.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.480
Mazhi County

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.060
has no future, just staring

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:23.330
at the backs of cows and sheep.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.680
But the problem now is,

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.360
we can't even protect
the native wild herds

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.660
that have lived here

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.940
for generations!

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.780
Comrades!

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.830
I am a member of the Mazhi County
Party Standing Committee

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.290
and a Deputy County Mayor.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:40.980
I accept

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.660
the County Party Committee's
democratic vote.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.640
You can cut the funding,

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.350
but this work

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.790
must go on.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.500
If the county won't approve it,

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.880
I'll take those kids

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.570
and keep this going as a civilian group.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:00.450
and keep this work

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:00.980
going.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.070
Comrade Duojie,

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:03.860
what do you mean by that?

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.690
Bolamula

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.760
doesn't belong to you alone.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.960
Stop playing the hero.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.480
Enough.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.470
Sit down, both of you.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:11.700
Sit down.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.380
Deputy County Mayor Duo

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.290
had a point.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.200
Poaching is a crime.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.110
Fighting crime

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.350
is the Party and government's duty.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.570
County Mayor Lin,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.880
what do you think?

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.510
County Mayor Lin's suggestions just now

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.270
were simply planning for the county's

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.330
long-term future.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.470
Deputy County Mayor Duo,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.180
what do you think?

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.040
As for

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.630
whether to keep

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.830
the Mountain Patrol,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.140
the County Party Committee can discuss it

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.400
and vote again.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.070
But

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.380
the county needs to see results.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.060
How about this?

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.650
I'll give you a deadline.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.530
One month.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.200
In a month,

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:13.180
no matter how far along

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.220
your survey is,

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.460
whether it's fifty percent

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.440
fifty percent or thirty

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.250
you turn it in.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.240
That way, the investment promotion work

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.240
can move forward.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.300
Then we can report to our superiors

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.270
and ask for more support

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.750
for the Mountain Patrol.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.680
Okay, Party Secretary.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.090
The Mountain Patrol's
mineral exploration plan

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.890
won't change.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:43.460
Sangba!

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.770
Stop!

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.960
Sangba, stop!

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:51.440
What are you doing?

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.520
Even you are leaving?

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.170
Are you a Khampa or not?

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.680
Sangba.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.610
You always said

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.940
what we do is meaningful

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.590
and that you like being with everyone.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.260
Why are you leaving?

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.610
Are you afraid to die, too?

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.810
I'm not afraid to die.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:04.050
But I came here to work

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.720
because I wanted a permanent position.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.050
Don't you guys want one?

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.660
I don't!

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:09.520
Zhacuo.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.920
Didn't the Captain say so?

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.050
When the Economic Development Zone
is established,

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.400
we'll all get permanent positions.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.290
Don't you trust the Captain?

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.220
From the day
the Captain posted the notice,

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.090
I came here.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.030
We were promised that within a year,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.160
an Economic Development Zone
would be set up,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.680
along with non-ferrous metal

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.610
and salt mining companies

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.510
with official

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.240
permanent positions.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.030
But since that first six months passed,

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.790
look at us—

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.230
what have we been doing?

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.330
Chasing after poachers

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.610
and catching illegal gold panners.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.590
We drive a hundred out today,

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.920
and two hundred go back in tomorrow.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.360
The county's funding is gone.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:31.900
Our monthly salary

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.180
is only two hundred yuan,

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.160
yet we have to wait

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.310
four or five months
just to see a single cent.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.980
I wanted to pass the adult self-study exam

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.980
while on the team.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.050
If I couldn't be a manager later,

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.090
being an office clerk

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:39.640
would have been fine.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.290
Now,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.370
even if I pass the exam,

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.210
do I still have to go in there

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.810
and catch poachers with you?

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:44.520
Can catching poachers

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.120
get us a permanent position?

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.900
Permanent position?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.770
Do you believe it?

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.970
I'll teach you a lesson for your father.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:52.480
Zhacuo.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.240
No hitting!

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.440
Sangba.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.140
You're always studying.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.610
Have you thrown everything you've learned

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.900
to the dogs?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.800
Let me ask you.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:01.290
Is the Captain a good man?

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.210
Of course he is.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.290
Rain follows the clouds.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.310
Sheep follow the grass.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.030
Stop babbling.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:05.690
Spit it out.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.980
Good men follow good men.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.160
If you don't follow the good man,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.680
do you want to be a bad one?

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.610
The Captain went
to the county for a meeting.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.520
We all know

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.050
that this time

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.710
our unit is definitely getting disbanded.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.740
What's the difference between leaving now

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.000
and leaving tomorrow?

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.090
Let go.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.970
Captain.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.050
Captain.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.690
I'm sorry.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.380
This is the money for Dongzhiba.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.580
His grandma didn't take it.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:33.960
You take it.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.990
It's not just for you.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.720
If you see the others

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.610
who already left,

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.750
make sure everyone gets their share.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.590
My good bro.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.660
Go.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:30.920
Sangba.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:43.590
Captain.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.840
What did the county decide?

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.880
Who is starting the car?

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.150
Where is Bai Ju?

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.190
She's at the station.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:59.450
Where are the car keys?

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:41.990
Get out of the way!

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.700
Get out!

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.290
What are you doing?

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:55.950
Give me the gun.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:56.510
What are you doing?

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.440
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.350
What are you doing?

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.250
What are you doing?

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:00.770
Leaving without a word?

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.690
Where are you going?

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.450
Let go of me!

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.420
I'm going into the mountains
to find Bai Ji!

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.440
Who authorized you to take a gun?

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.520
You left it unlocked.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.360
I am a police officer.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.020
I have the right to carry a gun.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.670
What do you want?

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.760
You're a cop, and you're stealing?

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.760
I'm borrowing it.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:16.710
I'll return it.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.440
A horse without a bit won't listen.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.010
Since when did you ever bother

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.770
to give me a heads-up

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:21.500
before coming over for dinner?

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.350
I know

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.620
Bai Ji did those things.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.300
He deserves to die in there.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.550
But he is my brother.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.990
Whether he's dead or not,

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.610
I have to bring him out.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.200
Otherwise, I can't

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.160
face my mother.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.180
Where do you plan to look for him?

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.400
This is where it happened—

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.260
Zhuoyuan Lake.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.440
Bai Ji ran off

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.590
somewhere near here.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.510
To get out,

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:17.240
the closest way is east.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.340
If he walk for two days,

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.030
he'll reach the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.940
So I'll follow this route
to search for him.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.550
A round trip takes

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.700
three to four days.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.230
Food, supplies,

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:25.980
and fuel—

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.530
I‘ve brought enough.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:28.660
That's ridiculous.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.730
If you run into a blizzard in there,

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.190
you won't even be able
to tell the direction.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.020
What if you run into poachers?

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.120
I excelled in marksmanship

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.380
at the police academy.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.530
The map won't tell you

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.730
where the swamps are.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.080
If the car gets stuck,

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.940
how will you pull it out yourself?

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:48.770
If you meet a wolf pack,

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:49.770
is one gun enough?

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.970
I know what you're saying.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.290
But I must go in.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.530
Even if there's only

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.400
a one percent chance

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:03.790
of finding him,

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:04.920
I still have to go in.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.600
If it were your family

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.530
trapped inside,

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.220
would you go?

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.590
Would you?

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.880
The team is in a tough spot.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.610
Going into the mountains isn't easy.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.270
This is my personal business.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.520
I have no reason to drag you into this.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.310
My plan isn't perfect.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:30.520
But no plan

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.800
ever is.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.670
I'll deal with

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.150
the consequences myself.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.270
When were you planning

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.140
to go in?

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.090
The plan was

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:45.960
that after Dongzhiba's funeral,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.560
we'd go in.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.600
Now, it's time to head out.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.230
All her gear will be useful.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.360
Bring them all.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:52.900
Okay.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.830
Did you think the Captain

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:56.380
would leave Bai Ji behind

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.440
in there?

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.180
It was too chaotic back then.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.640
You and Dongzhiba

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.240
were both down on the ground.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:03.790
We had no choice

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.520
but to bring you two back first.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.260
Yeah.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:10.679
Now that Bai is okay,

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.900
it's time to head out.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.650
Let's go.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:23.710
Thank you.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.580
As long as you're on the team,

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.909
you're one of my people.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:28.989
Your problem is our problem.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.610
Understood.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.040
Let's go.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.470
We'll drive through the night.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.240
and will reach Zhuoyuan Lake

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.410
just as the sun is coming up.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:10.710
The water in that lake

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.170
is incredibly beautiful.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.030
I often get up early to see it.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:19.820
Dongzhiba is gone.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.140
Sometimes death feels like

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.180
someone you know well

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.520
has just stepped out

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:26.650
on a trip.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.630
He left without saying goodbye

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.780
and never came back.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:34.960
The last time

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.730
someone left me

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.490
was when my father was on night shift

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.750
and ran into a fugitive

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.540
The last time

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.800
I saw him,

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.320
I saw his bloodstained uniform.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.330
That color

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.690
was as red as the sunset
over Zhuoyuan Lake.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.710
There's no point
in trying to hold on to someone.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.300
Whether in the Uninhabited Zone

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.720
or a populated place,

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.060
accidents can happen anywhere.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.360
So, Dongzhiba,

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.070
I've found the meaning

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.000
of this job.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.610
I want to take your eyes with me

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.570
to see tomorrow's sun.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.570
I'll do everything within my power

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.110
until

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.940
the day I see the sunset

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.540
for the very last time.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.030
Dad.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.780
You're back.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.800
Where is your mom?

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.320
She went to the hospital.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:14.930
What did she go there for?

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.280
To see a doctor.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.390
What's wrong with her?

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.050
I don't know.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.780
Why didn't you go with her?

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.450
You didn't go, either.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.480
Dad, what did you

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.310
just take?

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.110
I was looking for a book.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.640
That wasn't a book. I saw it.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.050
I lied.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.050
I was looking for...

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.140
Is it a secret?

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.630
It's my secret.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.500
Can you promise me

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.290
don't tell your mom

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.260
about this?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.230
Okay.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:06.900
Here, put these in your bag.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.630
Remember to take the medicine I prescribed

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.730
on time.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:10.320
Do not take the medicine

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.930
at home anymore.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.140
You must stop using wool.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.290
Use toilet paper instead.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.710
Before using the sanitary belt,

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:18.910
remember to steam it.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.900
You know how to use
a menstrual belt, right?

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.110
Yes, I do.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.730
Okay, hurry back now.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.110
Remember to come back for your follow-up.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:28.590
Okay.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.670
Thank you.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.670
You didn't go home after work?

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.470
Have you eaten?

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.730
I brought an extra dish

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:39.740
for you.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.090
Fried dace with salted black beans?

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:44.840
It's been years

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.040
since I last ate this.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.340
You've had it before?

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.130
You didn't remember

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.510
where I'm from?

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.140
Right, right.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.200
The young lady from Nanjing.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.280
You're different from us

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.340
country bumpkins.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.610
I thought about

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:02.460
finding something rare

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:04.190
to present to you.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.210
If you're not going to eat it,

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.210
I'll take it away.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.010
Put it down.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:09.820
Open it.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160
Come on, try some.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.010
How is it? Is it good?

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.050
It's just a little salty.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.210
You should be glad you've got this at all.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.230
Don't be picky.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.400
Wait a minute.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:28.630
Have you seen Bai Ji
these last couple of days?

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.340
No.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.910
That kid.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.040
How many days has he been gone this time?

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.090
It's

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.570
five or six days this time.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.170
Where did he go?

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.050
Come in.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.410
County Mayor Lin.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:52.840
County Mayor Lin.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.170
Why is your room so cold?

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.050
Didn't Han

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.210
send over some cow dung for you?

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.670
He did.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.330
I sent it to the County Primary School.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.420
I still have some in my room.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.000
I'll go get you some.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.930
No need, no need.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.940
There are many people in your room.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.360
Besides, there are female comrades there.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:04.980
Once those two rooms

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:05.840
are heated up,

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.200
my room will be warmer.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:08.870
On that table,

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:09.260
there is a report

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.820
on reducing the animal husbandry tax.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.500
Take this

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:12.650
to the leadership team right away,

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:13.840
and get a meeting organized immediately.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.420
Okay.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:17.130
County Mayor Lin.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:18.280
Feng.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.460
Didn't you say

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.590
you'd arrive tomorrow?

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:21.900
We heard it might snow tomorrow,

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.030
so we are here early.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.280
Who is...

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.690
Let me introduce you.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.320
This is the person I mentioned before.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.380
He is Zhao Yuji,

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.000
a manager from

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.330
Tengda Mining Company.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.530
Welcome.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.590
Nice to meet you, County Mayor Lin.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.710
The County Mayor on horseback.

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:35.590
I've heard so much about you.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.620
The County Mayor on horseback—

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:37.340
You flatter me.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:37.940
Right now,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.660
I'm the Zhongbu County Mayor—

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:41.710
more like a beggar County Mayor.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.280
You've got a great sense of humor.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.280
County Mayor Lin.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.360
Why does your room feel

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.020
even colder than the hallway?

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.260
Let's sit by the stove.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:48.900
It's warmer there.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.330
County Mayor Lin Lin is being selfless.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.520
-He's given his own cow dung
-Let me do it.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.410
to the County Primary School.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:53.000
Here.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.210
County Mayor Lin.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:55.860
I'll go get some cow dung from my room.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.290
Okay, go get it.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.220
No need. No need.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.820
Look, isn't this a coincidence?

00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.880
When Manager Zhao came,

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.000
he specially brought two truckloads
of coal.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.440
It's all the best anthracite.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.940
The trucks are parked downstairs.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:04.510
Really?

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:05.110
Look.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.460
That's two truckloads!

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.960
Two full loads. Ten tons.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.550
That should be enough
for your winter, right?

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:14.780
That's wonderful.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.340
Zhang,

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.090
hurry, hurry.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:17.530
Well.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.710
Take these two truckloads of coal,

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.420
and divide them into three parts.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.610
Send one part
to the County Primary School,

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:21.890
and one part to the County Hospital.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:22.670
Don't worry, I'll arrange it immediately.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:23.130
Go, go.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:25.420
Manager Zhao,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.200
thank you.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.820
I really...

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:29.650
feel a bit embarrassed.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:30.530
You see, we...

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.880
haven't reached
a cooperation agreement yet,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.210
yet I'm accepting such a heavy gift.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:35.550
You're being too polite.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:36.900
Let me pour you some water.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.100
Thank you. Thank you.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.000
I heard from Feng long ago

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.800
that your county is in difficulty.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.490
Thank you.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.420
County Mayor Lin, have a seat.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.080
Let me do it.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.240
I wouldn't have known if I hadn't come.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.440
I didn't expect it to be this difficult.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.400
I've read

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.030
that geological survey report

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.760
Feng gave me.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.620
In the Bolamula area,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.320
there are plenty of gold, silver

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.570
and rare metals.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.790
So why...

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.940
County Mayor Lin,

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:02.780
let me say something

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.240
you might not like to hear.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.000
You're sitting on a gold mine

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.960
and still begging for scraps.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:10.140
Actually,

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:11.450
we welcome

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.180
all the entrepreneurs willing

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.800
to come to our remote place

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.050
to invest.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.900
And

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.510
we believe

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:19.860
those enterprises who are introduced

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.820
by Feng

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.550
are capable and responsible.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.650
You are right.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.840
Our Xihai Chamber of Commerce

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.880
does have a few

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.880
high-quality enterprises

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.010
that want to come here for a site visit.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:32.780
This way,

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.090
they can determine
their investment intentions.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:37.070
I just don't know if the county

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.630
is available to host them.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.340
Hello?

00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:59.230
Why can't I get through

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.170
to Deputy County Mayor Duojie's

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.170
Mountain Patrol?

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:02.460
County Mayor Lin.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.300
The Mountain Patrol's phone bill

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:04.160
is way overdue.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.550
It was disconnected two months ago.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:06.510
That's ridiculous.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.440
Get it reconnected immediately.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.610
Let the Telecom Bureau come to me
for the money.
