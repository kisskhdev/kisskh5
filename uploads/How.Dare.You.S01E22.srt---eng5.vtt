00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.940
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.940
[Episode 22]

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.020
His Majesty didn't attend court yesterday.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.170
Is he not attending today either?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.039
I've heard that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.840
not only was Her Majesty
severely injured,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.170
but even His Majesty...

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.270
If that's true,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.760
how can we possibly compete
against Prince Duan's faction?

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.640
All right.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.360
Both of you, keep your voices down.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.960
Don't frighten yourselves.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.240
Lord Jia.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.710
From what I've heard,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.120
His Majesty

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.150
will not be able to come,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.540
as we expected.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.120
This is precisely

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.850
our golden opportunity to rise to power.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.280
But why isn't

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.570
Prince Duan showing his face?

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.910
You're asking me?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.000
Who should I ask then?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.590
Prince Duan trusts you the most.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.100
His Highness also trusted Zhao Wucheng.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.840
Wasn't he

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.070
assassinated at the street corner
yesterday?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.120
Lord Zhao is dead?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.560
Today's court session

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.120
is like walking into a trap.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.180
We might not be able

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.030
to stay alive.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.030
Lord Mu's scheme

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240
has put us in a terrible position.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.190
I haven't practiced my makeup skills
for a long time.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.910
I'm rusty.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.530
Let me do your makeup again.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.040
That's enough, Wanyin.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.440
You've already redone it once.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.470
Are you tired?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.750
Not at all.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.840
I think it looks quite good now.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.600
I don't look as haggard anymore.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.040
No.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.310
In court,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.750
dozens of eyes will be watching you,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.980
each person with countless schemes.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.570
We absolutely cannot let them
spot any flaws.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.740
Maybe you shouldn't attend court today.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.730
Let's delay for a few more days.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.980
If the treaty is signed one day later,

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.290
it gives our enemies
one more day to counterattack.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.800
By the time Xiahou Bo realizes
what's happening,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.290
we won't have the lead anymore.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.270
But...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.130
I know you're worried about my health,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.890
but look,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.430
the wound has stopped bleeding.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.150
If such a powerful poison
couldn't kill me,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.040
attending court

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.700
is nothing to worry about.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.910
Your Majesty,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.240
Physician Xiao is here.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.510
If you don't trust me,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.690
surely you'll trust

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.610
Physician Xiao's opinion?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.530
Physician Xiao,

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.600
tell the Noble Consort—

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.560
my wound

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.580
is healing well, isn't it?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.060
Your Majesty's wound is indeed healing.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.960
Some moderate activity

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.510
would help with blood circulation.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.920
See?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.420
Then make it quick.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.500
I'll wait for you here.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.560
That won't do.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.240
While I'm pretending at court,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.010
you need to go comfort the ladies
in the harem.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.040
We have to make it look real.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.360
Xie Yong'er did say

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.760
that in these three days,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.950
my Zhaoyang Palace

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.360
is being trampled upon
by all those women of yours.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.690
Then go quickly. What are you waiting for?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.560
I still need Physician Xiao
to change my dressing.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.600
I'm worried that—

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.570
How about

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.510
you help me change it?

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.120
No one wants to help you with that.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.850
I'm leaving.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.360
Your Majesty!

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.159
Your Majesty.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.990
Your Majesty.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.050
Physician Xiao.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.170
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.990
Please speak, Your Majesty.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.870
Is there any strong medicine

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.200
that can quickly

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.560
boost energy and spirit?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.310
His Majesty arrives!

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.040
Long live Your Majesty.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.120
Rise, my dear ministers.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.310
Your Majesty,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.400
after the trip to Mount Bei,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.410
we heard
the Empress Dowager suddenly fell ill.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.410
However, when we

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.870
tried to visit, we were all turned away.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.870
Now,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.930
three days have passed,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.830
and rumors spread throughout the court

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.330
that the Empress Dowager didn't fall ill.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.059
Then what is it?

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.280
It's that...

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.080
she was assassinated
by the Yan State envoys!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.929
Assassination?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.960
How did you know?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.290
Those Yan people

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.450
massacred over

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.970
50 of our soldiers
in front of the posthouse.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.150
Then they vanished without a trace.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.840
If not them,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.280
who else could it be?

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.400
Lord Mu is truly well-informed.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.210
You even know the exact number

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.630
of fallen soldiers.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.520
That's right.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.200
The Empress Dowager didn't fall ill.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.130
She was attacked by conspirators.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.030
After the shock,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.050
she suddenly took ill.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.600
And the mastermind is...

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.600
Imperial Astronomer Yang Duojie.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.080
Yes.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.630
You're eloquent.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.560
Why don't you explain to everyone?

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.030
Yes.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.670
Your Majesty,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.600
I

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.600
observed celestial signs at night

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.570
and discovered that
Imperial Guards Commander Zhao Wucheng

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.960
harbored treasonous intentions.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.720
Three days ago,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.840
he deployed forces to raid the posthouse,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.550
attempting to kill the Yan envoys.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.430
He then personally led men
to Mount Bei for an assassination.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.230
Fortunately,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.720
I made calculations

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.500
and anticipated this.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.870
Not only did I rescue
the Yan envoys in advance,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.500
but with their help,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.560
I also foiled Zhao Wucheng's plot.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:12.870
Although

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.550
we paid a heavy price...

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.700
Nevertheless,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.880
to honor the Empress Dowager's desire
for peace talks

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.550
and not let it go to waste,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.240
I request Your Majesty to proceed
with peace talks immediately!

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.770
Granted.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.670
Summon

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.430
the Yan envoy!

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:50.880
But...

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.600
But we haven't gotten
to the bottom of this yet.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.660
We can't trust the Yan people!

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.640
Your Majesty!

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.880
I, Prince Tu'er of Yan State,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.930
pay respects to the Emperor of Xia!

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.120
I never expected

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.630
that Prince Tu'er

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.120
would come in disguise himself.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.440
To be frank,

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.720
I came under the Emperor of Yan's orders

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.360
to not just sign the peace treaty

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.950
but also to observe
your people's conditions and customs.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.390
I concealed my identity earlier

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.700
to see

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.790
what Great Xia truly looks like.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.150
So how did

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.480
your investigation turn out?

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.230
Your Majesty upheld justice

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.360
at the Grand Longevity Banquet

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.480
and restored our innocence.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.070
I believe

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.790
your example inspires your people
to be equally loyal and righteous.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.150
The alliance between our two countries

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.600
will surely be a long-lasting one.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.550
You flatter me.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.360
Prince Tu'er,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.230
you are brave and mighty,

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.630
generous in your assistance,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.630
and truly someone

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.500
I sincerely admire.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.150
You're too kind.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.320
Your Majesty is straightforward,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.050
and I, Tu'er,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.100
cannot be indecisive either.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.080
I've brought my official seal.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.390
Where is the peace treaty?

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.720
Where should I stamp it?

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.660
[Official Seal of Yan]

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.910
Lord Mu.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.400
Your Majesty.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.800
The Empress Dowager values you highly.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.600
After court is dismissed,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.070
you shall lead everyone

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.650
to convey this good news

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.770
of the successful peace talk
to the Empress Dowager.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.600
I

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.780
obey your command.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.080
Noble Consort.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.000
I've just learned
a fashionable peony makeup style.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.240
-Here. Have a try.
-No need.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.150
I already applied makeup this morning.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.840
Just try it.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.840
Our Noble Consort is absolutely gorgeous.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.120
If she wears heavy makeup,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.240
it would only diminish her beauty.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.480
Let me style your hair
in a simple cloud bun instead.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.490
No need.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.600
Styling hair is too troublesome.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.510
All these external things
are too superficial.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.260
The Noble Consort values inner beauty.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.390
Why not try my rose essence?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.600
It also sparks passion.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.810
Well,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.240
that's hardly necessary.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.320
It is necessary.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.440
If we have

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.240
done anything wrong in the past,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.440
please don't hold it against us,
Your Highness.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.360
Not at all.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.550
What do you mean by that?

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.550
Is our Noble Consort

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.910
a petty person?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.050
Indeed.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:48.710
No, no.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.120
That's not what I meant.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.320
Then what did you mean?

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.150
-She means...
-I—

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.360
you didn't understand what she meant.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.260
What do you mean by that?

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.440
-What are they arguing about?
-Hey!

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.550
I didn't mean anything.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.150
What do you mean?

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.440
-Stop arguing.
-What's wrong with me?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.200
All those things you did,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.750
I remember them all.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.270
All right, enough.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.600
What do you mean by that?

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.910
You know perfectly well what I mean.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.000
-Consort Shu is the most jealous one.
-I didn't.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.600
Honestly speaking...

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.440
You two were arguing,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.320
-why bring me into it?
-You guys are really interesting.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.270
I didn't say anything about you,
why are you talking about me?

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.480
Noble Consort.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
A few days ago you asked me
to refurbish the courtyard,

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.480
but

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.630
it's impossible

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.480
with just me alone.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.800
-Refurbish the courtyard?
-I didn't!

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:27.770
Noble Consort,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.390
please don't worry.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.270
I excel at gardening.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.190
On my way here, I noticed

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.630
the fish in this pond

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.850
are of poor quality.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.050
They should all be replaced with koi.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.080
Kois!

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.240
Please leave the carpentry work to me.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.440
After all, my grandfather
shares the same surname

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.360
as one of the greatest carpenters.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360
No need to work too hard!

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.870
I don't have many talents,

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.390
but I have plenty of money.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.390
For this renovation,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.720
there's no need to use
funds from the treasury.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.250
Use mine.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.480
Go on.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.840
Thank...

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.720
Thank you all.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.330
You see,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.300
isn't the problem solved?

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.080
Come on.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.900
Take a look.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.490
That one!

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:10.630
Yes.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:11.910
Fish it up.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.800
What's going on?

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.580
Why am I suddenly

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.870
so popular?

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.480
Once the Empress Dowager left,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.340
you, as the most favored consort,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.480
have naturally become

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.480
the palace's CEO.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.960
But honestly,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.080
compared to all this

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.910
cringe-worthy flattery,

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.510
I actually miss the days
when they hated me.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.150
Of course.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.630
At least they weren't
tearing the place apart back then.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.080
My fish!

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.650
Stop!

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.500
It's over.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.840
I can't watch this anymore.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.720
You can enjoy this on your own.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.510
I'm going to look for Physician Xiao.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.320
Don't leave!

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.480
Xie Yong'er!

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.670
Reach down there!

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.110
Is no one
going to do something about this?

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.030
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.630
Rise.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.720
Her Majesty means

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.530
for all of you to rise.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.980
Y-Your Majesty.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.329
Wh-What happened?

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.990
Your Majesty,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.060
His Majesty asked me to inform you

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.500
that the peace talks
have been successfully concluded

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.900
and asks you not to worry.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.460
If the Your Majesty cannot speak,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.380
perhaps you could
write down your thoughts?

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.870
Your Majesty?

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.680
Your Majesty?

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.910
Are you okay, Your Majesty?

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.750
What is this?

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.350
A shuttlecock.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.070
What's it for?

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.800
For kicking.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.550
For whom?

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.590
Us, of course.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:21.880
Why?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.950
I think

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.830
in this palace,
everyone's always comparing looks,

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.680
family background,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.720
and His Majesty's favor.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.850
The atmosphere is really unfriendly.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.680
Besides,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.350
throughout history,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.890
the concubines in the palace

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.350
have had short lifespans.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.440
This situation is bad for everyone.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.880
So

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.720
I've decided to introduce
shuttlecock kicking.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.070
Let's channel the competitive spirit

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.930
into something more meaningful.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.240
And redirect your energy

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.960
elsewhere.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.510

-Coming.
-Steady.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.550
Mr. Bei.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:22.810
-Don't fall.
-Mr. Bei.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.530
In this cold winter,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.140
water will freeze

Please talk to me.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.350
-Madam Bei.
-All right.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.680
All of you may leave now.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.640
Mr. Bei.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.400
Mr. Bei!

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880
I was wrong

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.840
for what I did this morning.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.480
But at that time,

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.080
I truly had no other choice.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.280
Do you know how much blood

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.210
you've lost?

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.490
Not resting is bad enough,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.750
but you dare to use
such dangerous methods.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.680
You really don't care about your life.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.440
I know

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.070
you care about me.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.350
But in that situation—

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:17.280
What situation?

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.270
No matter what situation it was,

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.870
you shouldn't have
taken your life so lightly!

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.200
I've told you before,

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.640
Nan's child

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.400
is my child too.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.950
In this world, I have

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.840
no family and no relatives.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.880
The reason I protect you with all my might

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.830
is not for any grand cause
of the country or family.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.110
If you dare risk your life again

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.310
for this darn throne,

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.030
I...

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.270
I will tie you up and take you away!

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.330
Do you understand?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.000
I understand.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.250
You care for me the most.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.590
I know.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.150
Stop with these sweet words.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.830
They don't work

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.290
with me.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:10.950
Let me see!

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.550
Is your wound hurting again?

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.200
Mr. Bei...

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.260
This water is a bit hot.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.700
You're so naughty!

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.090
Come, cover up properly.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.460
Don't catch a cold.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.470
Let me wash it for you.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.920
Bring your feet out.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.130
Isn't the temperature just right?

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.110
Hot water drives away the cold.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:49.750
Mr. Bei...

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.070
If only...

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.410
you and Wanyin had appeared earlier.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.030
How wonderful that would have been.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.270
I want to play too.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.030
So impressive!

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.290
Who would have thought

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.730
Noble Consort Wei would be such an expert?

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.270
Now that I've taught my apprentice,

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.600
I'm useless as a master—

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.630
no wonder that's a saying.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.430
She's so good.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.290
Your Highness.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.840
Are we returning to the palace

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.170
or going to His Majesty?

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.210
Let's go to His Majesty.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.640
Yes.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.080
The palace is so huge.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.930
Why isn't there bike-sharing?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.750
Isn't there a shortcut?

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.150
You're right!

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:51.900
Like this?

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.160
Just admit it.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.610
Seeing a bunch of women fighting for you—

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.770
you're secretly enjoying it, aren't you?

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.880
You're turning your head away?

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.010
What does that mean?

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.790
I know men too well.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.440
You say no,

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.230
but inside you're probably delighted.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:27.960
Fine.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.920
I admit I'm jealous.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.790
Sorry about that.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:01.870
Let's go.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.240
What are you doing?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680
I'm stuck.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.800
Look at you.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.670
You call yourself a hero?

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.480
Hero?

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.500
More like your scapegoat!

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.030
Bai...

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.720
You don't snore, do you?

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.200
If you're afraid of noise,
go sleep upstairs.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.030
Dream on.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.490
How nice.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.150
Your Majesty,

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.750
the Imperial Medical Bureau
is now focusing

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.150
entirely on treating the Empress Dowager,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.240
but the results aren't promising.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:21.830
If they can't handle it, you step in.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.240
Make sure the Empress Dowager

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.640
can hold on for one month.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.380
Yes.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.800
What do you plan to do now?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.450
What's with that look?

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.410
What kind of attitude is that?

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.240
I know you don't trust me.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.790
If it weren't for Yu Wanyin,

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.390
I wouldn't trust you either.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.830
But I'm telling you,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:55.900
we're allies now.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.970
If you don't tell me your plan,

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.870
how can I cooperate with you?

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:07.920
If the Empress Dowager doesn't die,

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.780
those factions

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.560
will keep their hopes alive

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.530
and won't immediately
side with Prince Duan.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.590
You mean

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.510
you want to win over
the Empress Dowager's faction,

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.040
stabilize the court first,

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:20.590
then settle scores later?

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.790
You figured that out?

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.310
Not bad.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.510
Yu Wanyin said
you've only been here half a year,

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.750
but the way you use these imperial tactics

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.950
doesn't look like you're acting at all.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.240
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.120
But your plan has one flaw.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.720
There's a troublemaker
in the Empress Dowager's faction

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.450
named Mu Yun.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.520
You must get rid of him first.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.980
Or the plan won't work.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.140
The self-torture ruse,

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.840
the chain stratagem,

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.270
and the counter-espionage tactic.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.480
My brother

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.480
has really studied "The Art of War."

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.260
He's even using double agent tactics.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.920
So what do you plan to do?

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:01.090
Kill him?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.600
That would be too easy on him.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.290
Stir-fry him on high heat,

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.490
then simmer him on low heat.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.770
Now that his cover's blown,

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.290
there are plenty of people

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.050
eager to deal with him.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.730
I knew you were a tyrant.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.200
If there's nothing else,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.400
I shall take my leave.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.780
Farewell, my dear.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.240
Tyrant.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.740
How long do you plan to eavesdrop?

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.590
I wasn't just checking up on you.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.450
Just wanted to take the shortcut.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.120
Why do you look worse than this morning?

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.240
Before and after makeup
make a huge difference.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.070
Liar.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.690
Things didn't go well at court?

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.840
It went well—

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.270
very well.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.410
What about you?

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.240
It's a long story.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.150
What's wrong?

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.270
How come
after being out for the whole day,

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:35.290
you smell so good?

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.830
Concubine He
just sprayed me with rose essence.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:42.610
Why not try my handmade rose essence?

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.600
It also sparks passion.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.510
No wonder.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.880
It's driving me crazy.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.520
I'm talking about serious matters.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.920
This is a serious matter.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:54.960
No.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.310
Just one kiss.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.720
Control yourself!

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.250
Oh, one more thing—

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:10.200
I...

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.480
Well...

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.380
How immoral.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.800
How unethical.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.310
No bottom line at all.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:27.810
Shameless.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.970
They know nothing but love!

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.950
I won't be like you—

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.780
Your Highness!

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.160
Your Highness, are you alright?

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.940
Imperial Physician Xiao?

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.280
Careful.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.830
That hurt.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.640
Why haven't you left yet?

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.680
I was thinking

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.510
the palace is unsafe right now.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.570
It's getting late,

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.830
and it's not safe for you to return alone.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.110
You've been waiting here for me?

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.140
Imperial Physician Xiao,

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.770
you have something to say?

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.780
Imperial Physician Xiao.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.290
I consider you a friend.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.740
You can be yourself
in front of me.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.180
Feel free to speak your mind.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.240
Consort Xie,

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.480
there's something

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.810
I don't understand.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.920
You're wondering

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.790
how before,

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.310
I hated His Majesty
so much I wanted to abort his child,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.440
but now I'm running around everywhere

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.940
trying to save his life?

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.350
Is that right?

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.270
Imperial Physician Xiao.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:57.870
I'm sorry.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.880
I lied to you before.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.830
Your Highness, what are you doing?

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.480
That child

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.700
was Prince Duan's.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.570
Prince—

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.170
Your Highness.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.230
You must never speak of this.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.590
If word gets out, it's a capital offense.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.650
His Majesty knows.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.120
He...

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.830
He knows?

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.410
Yes.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.310
The power struggles at court

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.570
are no longer a secret.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.990
Before, to survive

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.530
and for personal reasons,

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.500
I made some wrong choices.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.440
I've tasted backlash
of my own making.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.440
Thankfully, His Majesty
and the Noble Consort are willing to help.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.500
I've also realized

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.650
that Prince Duan is not a good man.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.240
So rest assured, Imperial Physician Xiao.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.170
I'm safe for now.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.720
F-For now?

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.390
What about after His Majesty
and Prince Duan settle their score?

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.030
Perhaps

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.310
I'll need to find a way to escape?

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.350
Isn't it funny?

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.280
I wanted to possess the whole world,

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.449
but I'm trapped within these high walls.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.630
I didn't even know

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.489
what the world looked like.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.949
My dear, were you waiting for me?

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.150
Come,

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:57.190
My sir,

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.410
take your medicine.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.630
I've already taken the medicine
Imperial Physician Xiao gave me.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.070
I spent two hours brewing this,

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.330
waiting for you to finish work

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.170
so you could drink
this cooling tonic right away.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.230
I don't think that's necessary.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.030
How so?

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.370
You're fighting all day long.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.320
If you don't drink it,

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.380
you won't survive.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.990
What was it I forgot to do?

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.280

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:35.760
Fine, fine.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.720
That's more like it.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.580

of course it's sweet.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.880
You're so good to me, my dear.

You...

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.620
Why are you still so irritable?

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.320
If you have energy, take it out on work.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.700
Didn't you say there are
memorials left to review?

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:09.100
Go.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.590

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.200
I have to criticize you for this.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.590
Why do you think you're a bad actor?

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:19.150

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:20.920
No matter what industry you're in,

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.710
you require general knowledge.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.940
Just a few memorials

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:24.920
got you good?

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.490

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.830

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:35.410
can be solved with some overtime.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480
