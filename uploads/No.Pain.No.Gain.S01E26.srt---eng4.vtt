=Episode 26=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:53.020
The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.900
This newly updated 2.0 version

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.490
is genuinely fascinating.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.980
(A true genre-defining masterpiece)
(Tengda is still Tengda.)

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.540
(Still that familiar feel.)

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:03.180
(All those solid suggestions
everyone put forward,)

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.290
(he will definitely listen.)

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.770
(I believe)

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.850
(Tengda)

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.220
(will always stay true to itself.)

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.340
Pei Qian.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.610
It really can only be you.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.290
One thought to heaven,
one thought to hell.

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:23.835
(This humble room may be small,)
Anything you touch

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:25.450
(but virtue gives it worth.)
pulls traffic instantly.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.220
No wonder.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.170
You can even turn

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.780
a company into a brand.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.740
(Shenhua International)

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.820
Lv,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.410
here we are again.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.260
Looking at you now,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.540
you really remind me of the old days.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.980
Come on, Huang.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.060
You must have forgotten.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.057
On our first day here,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.450
we met right at this spot.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.130
Same seat.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.380
How could I forget?

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820
I never expected

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.660
to end up back at Tengda.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.010
Who would have thought?

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.290
I am still mad at Mr. Pei, you know.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.260
If it were not for missing Yintang,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.410
I would not have come back.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.940
Yintang.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.290
Coming back to Tengda,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.220
I feel younger again.

00:03:07.946 --> 00:03:08.980
Coming back is good.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.780
I have to pick up my kid anyway.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.660
This place is closer to school.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.500
That is great.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.220
Exactly.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.500
Tengda really is good.

00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:19.220
Picked the wrong one again.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.340
This is not a cherry.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.100
Yeah.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.610
Given where we are now,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.280
finding work out there is really tough.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.380
Bao, I honestly thought

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.902
there was no way you would come back.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:34.060
You cursed really harshly
on the day you left.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.060
Go easy.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.980
Games are better when they are old,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.450
so are friends.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.060
Exactly.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.290
Why do you show up everywhere?

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.730
Ma Yang.

00:03:47.057 --> 00:03:48.610
Even though we argue all the time,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.730
ever since I met everyone here,

00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:52.690
I truly felt like I finally had

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.820
a group of real friends.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.060
And I came back to help of my own will.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.690
Tengda will win.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.100
Li Shi.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.540
My brother.

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.780
From today on, you get the same
treatment as Qian. Come here.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.130
No.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.730
Come on.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.100
No.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.730
Just hug it out.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.320
I thought this
was headed for a bad ending,

00:04:07.324 --> 00:04:09.146
but somehow
season two is starting again.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.010
Getting back together after a breakup

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.380
is my favorite.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.980
Welcome, female lead.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.370
Female lead?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.610
Then, where is the male lead?

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.370
I am sorry.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.580
Earlier,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.700
I made a very serious mistake.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.700
Thank you, everyone,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.340
for coming back.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.930
This time, we reset the game.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.490
I want to ask you all,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.980
are you still willing

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.490
to keep going with me?

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.780
Let us clear
the Tengda instance together,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.580
and beat it to the very end.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.340
This round is a sure win.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.100
- A sure win!
- A sure win!

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.490
For those top-tier authors,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.140
give them the highest-tier treatment.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.270
Five-star standard is enough.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.250
Yes, the top standard.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.368
About this Mid-Autumn Festival plan

00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:23.100
I made for
the Divine Mountains and Seas,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.220
what do you think?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.780
Players can now team up

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.580
to open the
Mid-Autumn Lantern Festival map,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.610
admire the moon,

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.730
and enjoy the lanterns.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.540
With four players,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.780
they can play mahjong together.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.730
With five players,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.250
they can do an escape room.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.610
I think it is pretty fun.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.340
Any other ideas?

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.730
If Mr. Pei planned it himself,

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.100
it is bound to be special.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.540
I was thinking,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.100
could we add a lantern-riddle event
to the festival?

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.370
With real-world prizes.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.140
Perfect.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.140
Add it tomorrow.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.730
For the riddles,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.568
should we put them
into Returning to Shore?

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.340
Yes, add them.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.490
Right.

00:06:57.524 --> 00:06:59.435
I have also finished
the other event plans.

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:00.930
I will send them to the group later.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.724
Please take a look.

00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:02.340
Sure.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.900
Alright then, Mr. Pei,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.229
could you come over for a moment?

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.959
I have a proposal

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.457
I need to go through with you carefully.

00:07:07.457 --> 00:07:08.700
This one is a bit long.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.900
Let me wet my throat first.

00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:12.724
I have split it into six sections.

00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:14.100
We could still add a few seats.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.780
Do not add more.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.250
If we do it that way...

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.540
Is M&Y Internet Cafe reopening?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.700
Chen Lei?

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.250
Yeah.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.250
Chen Lei is back?

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.791
(Back to Thank Our Old Friends)
Our M&Y Internet Cafe

00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:44.490
has reopened.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.340
Really?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.140
Really.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.460
Chen Lei is back,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.780
returning to perform for everyone.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.250
Thank you for your support.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.900
Can we book tickets in advance?

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.700
Of course.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.780
Then we want...

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.020
Five tickets.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.660
No problem.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.370
Waiter.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.020
Come here.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.368
Please take these three ladies
to the counter to register.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:00.320
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:02.020
Thanks for your support. Thank you.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.140
M&Y Internet Cafe

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.660
has reopened!

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.250
Thank you everyone

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.900
for your support.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.410
We hope you

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.610
come here to have fun.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.580
Chen Lei

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.250
will return for a comeback performance.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.370
This is to thank everyone.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.610
Thank you all for your support.

00:08:23.613 --> 00:08:24.449
Thank you.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.690
(Chen Lei Returns to the Stage)

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.460
(Crafted by skilled hands
to build a better world.)

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.730
Is this a new character
from the Divine Mountains and Seas?

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.940
Is it the Little Prince?

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.610
This is the Guardian of Light.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.980
This new character is so cute.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.850
Yes.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.580
Come on.

00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:52.130
The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.100
has released the 2.0 new version.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.530
New characters.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.980
New storylines.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.300
It is very fun.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.220
Scan the code,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.980

The 2.0 new version.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.100
New characters and new storylines.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.180
Yes.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.580
Just scan here.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.610

(Card Cancellation)

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.700
I will handle it.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.490
Yaling.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.820
You are back.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.130
You are back too, Tian Mo.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.220
(Sloth Gym Upstairs)

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.100
Sloth Gym?

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.980
Is it open again?

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.700
It was closed before, right?

00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:50.580
- Sleep and eat when you want.
- Sleep and eat when you want.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.835
- Welcome back to Sloth Gym.
- Welcome back to Sloth Gym.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:57.530

Clear.

Your illness
came at just the right time.

Ms. Xin kept saying

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.580
that you had some

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.180
important plan to handle.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.420
So that important plan

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.420
was me.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.250
That is exactly what I like about you.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.490
You always react
faster than anyone else.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.340
Mr. Sima.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.060
The truth is, your illness

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.060
had already cleared up.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.370
But you stayed on the sidelines,

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.730
waiting for me

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.940
to put out the fires
caused by your sons.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.250
No need to get so worked up.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.300
My sons

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.220
are indeed no pushovers.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.420
But rest assured.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.700
From now on,

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.420
they will not cause you trouble again.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.820
And

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.530
they will certainly have no

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.124
ulterior intentions toward Tengda.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:02.940
I sent them abroad.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.890
Looks like Sima Wan was right after all.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.180
In your eyes,

00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:10.057
even family members
are just chess pieces.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.490
Being young really is nice.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.940
But when you reach my age,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.730
the things you have to consider

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.650
naturally become much more complicated.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.010
For me,

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.060
deciding where to spend

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.370
my limited time and energy

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.460
is what matters most.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.220
Let's skip the empty talk.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.820
Tell me, what do you really want?

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.300
I came to congratulate you, Mr. Pei.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.180
All the tests are finally over.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.850
I plan to

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.650
revise the agreement between us.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.650
From now on,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.770
as long as Tengda turns a profit,

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.420
you will be the primary beneficiary.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.290
You won't have to worry anymore

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.980
about losing money like before.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.530
Of course,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.530
I...

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.220
will still stay behind the scenes,

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.290
helping keep things on track,

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.770
so you don't go astray.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.490
I think I get it now.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.220
You want

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.250
to move me, this small chess piece,

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.900
from a small chessboard

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.530
onto a much bigger one,

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.090
but in the end,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.940
I am still under your control.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.010
You are getting closer and closer

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.730
to the truth of this world.

00:17:48.613 --> 00:17:50.010
No need to answer right away.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.420
Go back and think it through carefully.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.810
Tell me once you've decided.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.140

You talked for quite a while.

00:18:19.035 --> 00:18:20.570
An old friend from another generation.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:21.490
By the way,

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.090
isn't Sibo about to wrap up over there?

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.102
When are you heading over?

00:18:24.124 --> 00:18:24.860
No rush.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.860
Tell me first,

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.368
after all this time without me around,

00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:28.302
did you miss me?

00:18:29.035 --> 00:18:31.090
Have you been busy socializing
every single day?

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.460
Who are you even...

Can you even keep up with all this?

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.620
You need to separate work

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.924
from your personal life, Qian.

00:18:39.924 --> 00:18:40.730
Look at me. Come on.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:41.620
I will show you.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.250
Take a look.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.570
Personal life is personal life.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.760
I even have a fruit shop account.

00:18:46.768 --> 00:18:47.490
Nice and clean.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.220
Ma Yang, do not
push yourself too hard either.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.810
You still need to rest when it is time.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.330
I am not tired.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.180
I am here to shine for Tengda,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.480
to charge through fire and water,

00:18:56.524 --> 00:18:57.620
and expand our territory.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.980
Alright, Mr. Ma.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.180
Then go conquer new ground.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.140
I am heading out.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.730
Try to socialize less.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.700
At that age, can you
really click with them?

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.540
(WeChat)

00:19:28.524 --> 00:19:29.530
(Congratulations on the Wrap)
Come on.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.280
(of Northern Continent)
To all members of the cast and crew,

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.380
please turn your attention
to our camera.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.140
Three, two, one.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.940
- Congratulations on wrapping!
- Congratulations on wrapping!

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.920
Great.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.620
From the first cut to the last.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.490
- Smooth sailing all the way.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.330

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:53.490

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.220
Victory.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.940
Nice.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.530
Come on, look over here.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.250
Yes.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.980
- Very good.
- Great.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:00.490
Alright.

00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:01.980
Okay, thank you.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:02.660
Thank you.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.290
Thank you.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.460
Mr. Shi.

00:20:06.613 --> 00:20:08.220
This is our first time working together,

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.257
and I guess we got to know
each other the hard way.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:11.770
How about

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.880
we add each other on WeChat?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:14.380
Sure.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.010
Here.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.340
(Shi Huo)

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.457
Why did you send me
my stills from the show?

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.940
Take a closer look.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.980
That should do it.

00:20:58.057 --> 00:20:59.420
You really took him as a friend?

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.290
Let's go.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.140
Give me the flowers.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.968
(Congratulations on the wrap
of Northern Continent)

00:21:04.968 --> 00:21:06.980
(The Wizard and Demon King Love You)

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.460
It is finally wrapped.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.035
Director, it's wrapped, so I don't have
to revise the script anymore, right?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.460
After everything we went through,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.460
the leading fights
and the pulled investments...

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.810
Thank goodness.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.180
It is finally wrapped.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.330
I only have one request.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.050
Absolutely no second season.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.620
Who said anything about a second season?

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.460
But Sibo,

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.010
I do have an idea.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.660
From now on,

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.250
let's focus on animated films.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.530
Animated films are the future.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.220
No need to worry
about pleasing anyone else.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.220
We shoot however we want.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.810
Right?

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.490
Animated films?

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.900
Then who plays the lead?

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:43.660
The lead?

00:21:44.057 --> 00:21:45.835
What do you think about Nezha?
[* A mythical Chinese child god with fiery powers.]

00:21:45.835 --> 00:21:46.730
Nezha?

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.940
That's actually a solid idea.

00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:58.570
They really installed
this elevator just like that?

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.180
Who managed to talk Ge into it?

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.700
Who else but our son?

00:22:07.324 --> 00:22:10.180
No wonder I've been thinking about him
these past couple of days.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.980
Give him a video call.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.090
Son.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.250
Dad.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.290
What did you say to Ge

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.257
to get him to agree
to installing this elevator?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.013
The construction crew is already here.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.140
Yeah, son.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.570
How did you pull that off?

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.660
Well, Dad,

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.290
Mr. Ge's son-in-law

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:33.010
wanted to work at Tengda,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.591
so I helped make some arrangements.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.380
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.380
I let you down.

00:22:38.768 --> 00:22:40.050
The place at Mingri Apartments

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.140
still couldn't be kept.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.530
You had to stay at home.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.490
It's just one apartment.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.900
It's really not a big deal.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.810
There's no talk of disappointment here.

00:22:48.968 --> 00:22:50.368
Your mom and I are doing just fine.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.810
Let me tell you this.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.140
Never put pressure on yourself.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.860
Exactly.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:58.420
Your dad and I feel that

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.700
the life we have now
is the best.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.420
Look, our family is safe and healthy,

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.980
and our hearts are still together.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:05.900
How wonderful is that?

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.290
Son,

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.770
if at work,

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.250
something makes you unhappy,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.700
or if you want to try something else,

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.570
then just do it.

00:23:13.591 --> 00:23:14.860
Your dad and I will always support you.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.490
That's right.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.420
No matter when,
you have your parents behind you.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.490
Thank you, Mom and Dad.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.090
Alright.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.730
Let's hang up.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:21.860
Bye.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.620
You're much earlier than we agreed.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.900
Looks like

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.490
you've made up your mind.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:25.980
I know.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.900
Before,

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.220
the terms of our cooperation

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.220
were a bit too harsh.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.900
We can discuss

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.490
this revision properly.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.490
Say whatever is on your mind.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.530
From now on,

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.330
you just lead everyone

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.810
and do solid work at Tengda.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.290
You will not need
to rack your brain anymore

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.940
over how to lose money.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:47.980
I believe,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.250
under your leadership,

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.290
Tengda

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.460
will expand into more fields

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.220
and create even greater value.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.010
You are still so young.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.460
In the future,

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.860
you will go much further
than I ever did.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.860
The path you laid out for me

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.420
is not the path I want to take.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.050
As for how this game should continue,

00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:33.924
this time,
you will have to listen to me.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.700
My condition is

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.090
that Tengda must operate independently.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.730
Only then will Tengda
never lose its integrity,

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.050
and never turn into your Jinghong.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:13.330
Mr. Pei.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.050

Ms. Xin,

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.090
please notify everyone at Tengda.

Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Jinchuan Financial View.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.090
Today's main headlines are as follows.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.810
Jinghong Group
has issued an announcement.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.702
(Sima Ming Steps Down as Chairman)
Founder Mr. Sima Ming,

00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:51.700
(of Jinghong)
due to health reasons,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.860

Financial reports show that

00:31:00.524 --> 00:31:01.810
in recent years, Jinghong Group's

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.250
performance has continued to decline.

effective immediately, Tengda Group

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.940

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.050
Wu Bin from Tengda's HR department.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.460
Welcome to Tengda.

00:31:48.346 --> 00:31:50.050
This newly built complex
looks impressive.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:51.940
This is Tengda's Office Building A.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.730
Tengda operates across many industries.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.140
This entire area
is Tengda's industrial park.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:00.420
By the way,

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.660
this is only Tengda's
headquarters in Jinchuan.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.860
Tengda also has branches

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.380
in many other cities.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.460
In the future, everyone
can choose freely

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.570
the city where you work

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:09.870
and live, based on your own needs.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:11.660
Oh my god.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.380
That's amazing.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.380
Who is that person?

00:32:14.235 --> 00:32:16.010
There are often visitors
downstairs at Tengda.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.900
It's quite common.

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:17.860
This way, please.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:20.380
Tengda is really impressive.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.330
I heard they
built everything from scratch.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:24.810
(Tengda)

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:25.940
I really want to work here.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.460
Me too.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.050
Who wouldn't?

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:27.730
Exactly.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:31.620
Lin Wan,

00:32:31.657 --> 00:32:32.835
how many more trophies from

00:32:32.835 --> 00:32:35.257
the Divine Mountains and Seas
are you planning to bring back?

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.490
My desk can't fit anymore.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:39.770
Wei.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.940
Look, I still have plenty on my desk.

00:32:41.968 --> 00:32:44.013
- Wan, where should these go?
- Wan, where should these go?

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.940
I will ask Lv.
Let's put them at his place.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.460
Alright.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.770
I did not expect
that after all this time,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.530
the Divine Mountains and Seas
would still have the most players.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:00.660
Of course, it would.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.570
Lv, let me tell you...

00:33:02.768 --> 00:33:03.420
Stop right there.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.010
I do not like trophies.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.180
I like peace and quiet.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:07.530
Got it.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.090
Put them with Bao.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:21.620
Bao.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:22.730
Still working out?

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.140
Life is about movement.

00:33:25.946 --> 00:33:27.570
The Divine Mountains and Seas animation

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:28.730
is launching today.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.902
Do not forget to watch it.

00:33:29.968 --> 00:33:31.490
Look. I am all set.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.620
Running while watching.

00:33:34.168 --> 00:33:34.900
By the way...

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.140
Wei.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.940
Bao.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.090
Stop running.

00:33:39.191 --> 00:33:40.690
I need to talk to you about something.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.490
Well,

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.810
Wei, give me a second.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.050
Isn't the animation

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.050
launching today?

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.900
I will go ask Huang

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.730
how the live-action version
is coming along.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.290
I need to talk to Huang
about the budget anyway.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.730
Keep training. I'll go ask.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:52.570
Alright, thanks.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:53.490
No problem.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:54.810
No, stop training.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.835
This is serious business.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.530
Go on.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.620
Let me give a brief summary.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:01.490
This past year

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.900
has been very fulfilling for us.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.420
At Feihuang Pictures,

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:05.857
we produced four projects in total.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.502
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.820
Huang.

00:34:10.657 --> 00:34:11.746
How is the progress on

00:34:11.746 --> 00:34:13.980
the live-action series for
the Divine Mountains and Seas?

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.090
The Divine Mountains and Seas

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.210
is a massive IP.

00:34:16.324 --> 00:34:17.460
Let's talk about it next year.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.130
Alright, you carry on, then.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.050
We will talk later.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:21.740
Okay.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:24.940
Everyone,

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.130
I need to make a formal announcement.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.260
Director Zhuang and his team

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.570
are honestly just too unreliable.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.650
I have decided

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.260
to direct it myself.

00:34:33.591 --> 00:34:34.724
What do you think?

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.260
No need to get too excited.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.380
I will do my best.

00:34:42.768 --> 00:34:43.980
I am going to see Mr. Ma.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.210
Mr. Ma, in the dining
and leisure sector,

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.650
this year, our M&Y Internet Cafe

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.980
and Sloth Gym physical locations

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.030
have basically covered first
and second-tier cities.

00:34:54.035 --> 00:34:55.460
Four Wall Apartments, Ponytail Live,

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.902
Against Wind Delivery, Wayfarer Travel,

00:34:56.924 --> 00:34:58.249
(Key business upgrades)
as well as the upgrades

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.430
to Against Wind Logistics
have been progressing smoothly.

00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:01.940
In addition, our subsidiary projects,

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.690
Jingji Hostel

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.690
and the Cold and Warm Self Aware Zoo,

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.860
are also underway.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.780
Good.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.340
Very good.

00:35:09.057 --> 00:35:11.260
DreamForge Capital
has done a great job this year.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:12.340
I hereby announce

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.380
that this year's year-end bonuses
for all departments

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.170
will be doubled.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.260
- Great!
- Great!

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.410
- Thank you, Mr. Ma.
- Thanks!

00:35:17.413 --> 00:35:18.340
Go get back to work.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.090
Year-end bonuses doubled?

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.210
Is that okay?

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:28.340
Mr. Ma.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.170
I have a small dream.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.900
I think you will help me
make it come true.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.010
Sure. Go ahead.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.124
Mr. Pei.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:03.900
Long time no see.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.860
You are still not off work?

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.650
That is not very nice of you.

00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:10.170
You came back without telling us.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:11.860
Mr. Pei.

00:36:11.968 --> 00:36:13.502
Skipping the move was one thing,

00:36:13.524 --> 00:36:15.090
but you said nothing when you came back.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.191
We could have picked you up.

00:36:16.235 --> 00:36:17.940
That was one long vacation you took.

00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:19.849
No wonder you kept telling me
to travel before.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.324
Turns out you love traveling yourself.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:23.820
Why do I feel like

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.050
Mr. Pei seems a bit different somehow?

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.820
You look preoccupied.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.090
Different how?

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.300
You have just been away too long.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.170
Feeling shy, maybe?

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:33.300
Right?

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:34.860
Come on.

00:36:35.146 --> 00:36:37.724
Take a look at the night view
of our new Tengda building.

00:36:38.702 --> 00:36:39.420
Impressive, right?

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.570
(If you were to start a business,)

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.740
what would I be?

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:47.780
BA.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.340
BA?

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.780
I want to be the chairman.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.860
General manager.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.690
Vice chairman.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.130
(General manager.)

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:55.130
(Just a vice chairman.)

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.690
Does any of this feel familiar to you?

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.650
Back then,
in that rental apartment of ours,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.740
out on the balcony,

00:37:05.346 --> 00:37:07.690
you told me you wanted
to start a business with me.

00:37:07.857 --> 00:37:09.650
What did you say you
would make me again?

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.010
BA, right?

00:37:11.435 --> 00:37:12.946
Security guard.
[* Security guard means "Bao An" in Chinese.]

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.340
Honestly,

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.340
back then, did you already know

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.010
that Tengda would become
what it is today?

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.490
Wei.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.820
What are they talking about?

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.860
I cannot hear clearly.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.050
They seem pretty happy.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:44.460
Yeah.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.813
Maybe they're deliberately
hiding something good from us?

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:48.690
Come on.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:49.650
Let's go listen in.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.170
Alright.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.902
I actually have some work
to report anyway.

00:37:51.924 --> 00:37:53.090
Why are you working so hard?

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.380

Mr. Pei.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:15.650
So it's settled?

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.946
We're really leaving it empty
instead of renting it out?

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.010
This place is prime real estate now.

00:39:23.213 --> 00:39:24.490
We're not leasing it out at all.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.340
I just think, well,

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.570
leaving it vacant like this...

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.420
Listen to me.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:28.724
Just leave it as it is.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:30.900
Alright.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:31.940
Then I'll

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.168
take care of the paperwork.
