WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.960
Then, today as well...

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.420
did you bring me here to organize my thoughts?

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.670
Well, that's part of it...

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.630
I also thought about where you'd feel comfortable talking,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.510
and this is the result.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.640
Ian.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.940
Don't you have something to tell me?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.530
What do you mean?

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.200
Do you not want to tell me yet?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.240
Or do you plan on never telling me?

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.950
Sunbae...

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.200
I didn't mean to see it,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
but the notification popped up.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.880
What did you see?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.470
Wasn't that the company you've wanted to go to for a long time?

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.890
You were struggling so much with job hunting.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.310
You should have told me.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.850
I wanted to be the first one to congratulate you, more than anyone.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.150
Sunbae, that's...

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.530
What are you doing?

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.160
Ah, I was checking the application results.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.170
You said you were checking the results. Aren't you going to look?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.510
I'm too nervous to look.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.060
I'll hold your hand tight.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.390
Sunbae.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.230
Is this better?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.190
Yes.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.740
Ian, aren't you going to check?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.780
Ah, yes.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.250
(Job Rejection Email)

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.210
I knew it would be like this.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.170
I fail every time.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.220
That's the company's mistake.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.260
How could they reject such a talent?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.800
No...

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.850
It's because I'm lacking.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.770
No. You'll definitely pass next time.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.980
Where else can they find someone as hardworking as you?

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.110
I really wish I could be just like you, Sunbae.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.440
Me?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.190
Yes.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.490
You had good grades in school,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.700
and got a job quickly...

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.370
And you're about to be promoted...

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.370
You're probably the only one

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.790
getting promoted within a year of joining, Sunbae.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.000
No. That was only possible because you were by my side.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.960
I could never have done it alone.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.630
Ian.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.590
Next time, you'll definitely get into the place you want.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.510
Shall we eat something delicious today?

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.760
I found a good restaurant.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.520
Lean on me when things are tough.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.940
Just as you stood by me,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.320
I'll hold your hand tight too.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.650
Hyung.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.540
Finally, a smile.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.010
Aren't you going to tell me yourself?

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.640
I was going to tell you myself.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.850
But I just got contacted recently too,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.270
so I was wondering how to say it...

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.600
Then tell me now.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.610
I'm waiting with a happy heart.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.490
I got accepted into Core Line.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.240
And... my departure is the day before our 1st anniversary.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.790
Congratulations, Ian.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.160
Ha... Sunbae...

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.290
Ian... Look at me.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.170
Why is your head down?

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.010
I'm sorry. For not telling you sooner.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.550
I should have discussed it with you from the time I applied.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.220
Did you think I'd be upset about that?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.770
You could be upset.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.190
Hmm... Well, I guess I am?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.150
Hyung.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.650
I'm kidding, just kidding.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.570
The disappointment is only momentary.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.610
I'm really happy that things worked out well for you.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.240
I'm sorry.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.540
Can't you smile for me a little?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.460
How can I smile in this situation?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.090
It's the place you wanted.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.670
You got into the place you dreamed of.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.130
Be happy for yourself too.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.050
Hm?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.220
I really want to see you smile.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.220
Sunbae.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.360
What's so difficult about it?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.440
Just say it.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.570
Are we breaking up just because you're going to America?

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.530
But we haven't been dating for that long...

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.410
We can't even celebrate our 1st anniversary...

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.250
What's the big deal about the 1st anniversary?

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.160
7 years, 10 years...

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.080
We're going to be together for a lifetime, aren't we?

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.960
Ah, Sunbae, really...

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.170
Why are you so good to me?

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.300
Why do you understand everything?

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.390
Because I don't want any more misunderstandings.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.100
And because I decided

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.520
to tell you all my honest feelings.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.440
As much as I like you,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.150
I want things to go well for you even more.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.240
Come back.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.540
Do everything you want to do...

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.500
Show them all your talent, and come back.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.830
Mm-hm. I will.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.550
Let's have our 1st anniversary party in advance,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.010
and go to the places you wanted,

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.350
and do everything you wanted to do.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.310
Yes.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.240
Did you pack everything?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.530
If you need anything, just say it and I'll send it.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.240
I packed everything...

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.990
It's just...

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.540
Can't bring yourself to leave?

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.000
Yeah...

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.920
Just leave coolly.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.550
You're making me want to hold onto you.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.220
I'm sorry.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.220
That again.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.470
Do you know you've been

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.640
apologizing once a day since you told me?

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.350
Did I?

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.890
Yes.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.070
Ah, I don't want to let you go.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.900
I want to keep you by my side.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.450
What if I miss you too much?

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.030
Should I not go?

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.030
Don't say such scary things.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.160
You have to go.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.250
I don't want to be the bad guy who crushes his boyfriend's dream.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.670
It's because I don't want to go either.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.300
I'll miss you.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.970
Me too.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.970
I'll call you every day.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.810
Tell me you love me every day too.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.690
I love you.
