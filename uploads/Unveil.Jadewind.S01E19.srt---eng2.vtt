{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.265
The murderer slaughtered him
and didn't take any money.

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:41.185
Do you have enemies here?

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:44.585
We don't have much contact
with the locals.

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:46.985
But doing business is dealing with people.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.145
How is that possible?

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:51.265
We sell Ping'en specialty to the south

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:55.145
and mostly deal with rural farmers
and southern merchants.

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:56.985
We never had to know the locals.

00:01:58.545 --> 00:02:00.745
You know your family business quite well.

00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:04.825
Madam.

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:07.905
Well…

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:09.144
Just say it.

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:12.665
Someone opened the side door
to Young Master's courtyard.

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:18.505
Mr. Xiao, shall we?

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:41.425
This place is unattended?

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:42.745
Of course it is.

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.545
But the bamboos keep dropping leaves.

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.145
So it's hard to keep it clean.

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:51.185
That's the side door over there.

00:02:54.865 --> 00:02:56.345
A tragedy happened at home.

00:02:56.425 --> 00:02:59.185
Instead of checking on Young Master,
you came to check the door?

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:03.425
I sent someone
to check on him this morning.

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:05.065
He's just fine.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.945
What's so special about this side door?

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:09.185
Why did you panic?

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:17.585
Master minded the manor layout.

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:18.865
This door is here to gather energy.

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:20.985
No one is ever allowed to pass through.

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:22.545
Master even added a lock

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:23.945
with a mechanism

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:25.425
that only he can open.

00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:28.865
Let's check on Young Master.

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:31.145
He's too weak to see guests.

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:44.105
WU MUJIN, YOUNG MASTER OF WU'S MANOR

00:03:52.305 --> 00:03:53.465
Mother.

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:57.065
Meet Fuchang County Princess
and Astronomer Xiao.

00:03:57.145 --> 00:03:59.225
They are our guests.

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:02.585
Greetings, Your Ladyship, Mr. Xiao.

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:06.025
May you be well, Mother.
May you find peace and solace.

00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:08.705
When did you sleep last night?

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:11.865
Father asked me to go to bed
at the Xu hour.

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.345
So early? Can you fall asleep?

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:16.184
No.

00:04:16.265 --> 00:04:18.425
But lying in bed
and watching the bamboo shadows

00:04:18.504 --> 00:04:20.825
eventually puts me to sleep.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:23.305
Do you burn incense in your room?

00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:39.825
Young Master.
Did you sleep well last night?

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:44.465
The wind and rain
along with the thunder scared me.

00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:45.385
I didn't sleep well.

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:48.585
Did you hear anything else
apart from the thunder?

00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:51.345
I was awakened by thunder
in the middle of the night

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:52.705
and saw a figure.

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:54.545
Right there.

00:04:56.585 --> 00:04:57.425
A figure?

00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:02.065
It may have been too dark,

00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:03.545
but did you make out
that person's height and build?

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.145
Did that person speak?

00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:31.585
Young Master.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.425
Did that person look like this?

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.105
You have to be his friend.

00:05:57.705 --> 00:06:00.025
Mujin. You are amazing.

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:02.025
Do you want to avenge your father?

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.585
If you can recall
what that person looks like,

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:06.185
I'll catch him right away.

00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:14.185
It was so dark last night.
How did you see a figure?

00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:18.545
Did the room suddenly brighten up?

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:20.585
A big lightning bolt

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:22.905
made my room brighter than in the day.

00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:25.145
So you did see that person.

00:06:27.825 --> 00:06:30.905
I… I was going to see who that person was.

00:06:30.985 --> 00:06:33.225
But the thunder followed.

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.465
I… I was scared.

00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:38.945
I covered my ears and counted to ten.
The thunder finally stopped.

00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:41.465
Then, the room went dark.

00:06:41.545 --> 00:06:42.905
I didn't dare to go out.

00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:45.505
Good boy. Go play.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.065
Can you tell who it is?

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:04.145
No.

00:07:07.145 --> 00:07:09.585
Why don't we see
any servants in the vast courtyard?

00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:14.865
This courtyard is quiet
and adopts a geomantic formation.

00:07:14.945 --> 00:07:17.225
Master didn't allow us to enter at will.

00:07:17.825 --> 00:07:19.705
Even I can't come at will.

00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:21.545
Only Mr. Zhong

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:23.745
gets to come and go
because his Four Pillars of Destiny

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:24.985
are compatible with this place.

00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:28.065
He takes care of Mujin here.

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:31.385
Does Mr. Zhong burn incense in his room?

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:34.065
I checked it for you.

00:07:34.145 --> 00:07:35.385
It also contains

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:38.265
that… that flower…

00:07:42.145 --> 00:07:44.505
Did my uncle have
a deep affection for you?

00:07:45.785 --> 00:07:49.825
We were more like family members
rather than a loving couple.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:54.305
This child is not your own, is he?

00:07:56.905 --> 00:07:58.425
You figured it out?

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:03.025
Mr. Xiao can even read the stars.
He noticed at a glance.

00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:05.665
That's right.

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:08.025
I can't have children.

00:08:08.585 --> 00:08:10.625
Master brought him back.

00:08:11.985 --> 00:08:14.225
It wasn't easy for my uncle
to have a child.

00:08:14.305 --> 00:08:15.865
But he kept the child
in this damp courtyard

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:18.105
just because you didn't like him.

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:20.225
What is it if it's not love?

00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:26.145
Seeing him
does make me grieve over my misfortune.

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:28.345
But I didn't ask for him

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.985
to live here.

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:31.425
Mr. Wu arranged for it?

00:08:32.305 --> 00:08:33.865
Mujin has always been weak.

00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:36.185
Years of medication had no effect.

00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:40.505
Then Master invited Mr. Xu
to design this place based on Feng Shui.

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:44.024
It's said to save his life
and boost his energy.

00:08:46.265 --> 00:08:47.945
Who is this Mr. Xu?

00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:51.265
Xu Daoyin owns a manor
in Qingtan Town near here.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.545
Many people worship him.

00:08:54.185 --> 00:08:56.825
Master also set up a scripture hall
for Mr. Xu at home.

00:08:58.425 --> 00:08:59.785
Scripture hall?

00:09:00.785 --> 00:09:01.625
Let's take a look.

00:09:04.185 --> 00:09:05.025
Alright.

00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:07.665
You don't have to come.

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:10.265
Wang will lead the way.

00:09:10.345 --> 00:09:11.585
Understood.

00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:15.625
Your Ladyship. This way.

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:23.065
Please look.

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:25.065
This is Mr. Xu's statue.

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:31.745
What are these jade tablets for?

00:09:32.425 --> 00:09:33.265
Please don't.

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:36.625
These jade tablets

00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:38.825
are tokens obtained
from worshipping Mr. Xu.

00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:40.825
How do you worship him?

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:43.345
With money, naturally. To seek protection.

00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:46.625
These jade tablets
have all been blessed by Mr. Xu

00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:49.185
and placed here
to protect the household's peace

00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:50.305
and fulfill Master's wishes.

00:09:51.745 --> 00:09:52.865
That's quite a lot.

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.105
My uncle must have spent

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:57.585
most of the money he made on Xu Daoyin.

00:09:57.665 --> 00:10:00.225
Well, Your Ladyship.
Be careful with words.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.105
Mr. Xu, we pay our respects.

00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:12.705
Please offer Mr. Xu an incense

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:15.865
to seek forgiveness.

00:10:17.425 --> 00:10:19.705
- He found a way to make money.
- Indecent.

00:10:30.745 --> 00:10:33.265
Y-Your Ladyship. What are you doing?

00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:35.225
You have to respect the statue.

00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:40.505
There's blood.

00:10:41.345 --> 00:10:42.345
Blood?

00:10:43.585 --> 00:10:46.225
My master was so pious to Mr. Xu.

00:10:46.305 --> 00:10:49.065
Why would he hurt him with this statue?

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:51.305
This wooden statue is heavy,

00:10:51.825 --> 00:10:53.465
consistent with
the estimated murder weapon.

00:10:54.465 --> 00:10:57.265
The murderer hit the victim repeatedly.

00:10:57.985 --> 00:10:59.065
He must be quite strong.

00:10:59.745 --> 00:11:01.665
What Young Master saw last night

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:04.545
was staged by the murderer
with the wooden statue.

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:08.385
The courtyard is not on the way
from the scripture hall to the bedroom.

00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:09.625
He went by on purpose.

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:13.265
There are many potential
murder weapons in the bedroom.

00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:15.705
But the murderer chose
Mr. Xu's wooden statue.

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:19.305
He even went to wash it
and put it back after the murder.

00:11:19.985 --> 00:11:21.745
He left us so many clues.

00:11:21.825 --> 00:11:24.545
It feels like failing him
if I don't look into them.

00:11:29.945 --> 00:11:30.985
Are you unwell?

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:34.745
That child's courtyard is cold and wet.

00:11:35.265 --> 00:11:38.705
With so many bamboos inside out,
it gets no sunlight at all.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:42.905
Does a courtyard like this
really save his life and boost his energy?

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:45.505
Something is wrong with the layout.

00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:47.305
If he keeps living there,

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:49.705
he may perish in three years.

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:51.425
It's so dangerous?

00:11:51.505 --> 00:11:53.305
The same object,
placed in different positions,

00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:54.505
makes a world of difference.

00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:56.025
Peach wood stake in the Li position.

00:11:56.105 --> 00:11:59.265
Fire clashes with wood,
draining all auspicious energy.

00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:01.305
The stone blocks
resonate with the bamboo grove,

00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:02.465
unable to gather energy.

00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:05.225
Given Wu Mujin's age,
he can't withstand this layout.

00:12:05.305 --> 00:12:06.185
Wait.

00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:08.345
I remember the stone in the courtyard

00:12:08.425 --> 00:12:10.825
wasn't in the grove
but beside the peach wood.

00:12:10.905 --> 00:12:12.585
The formation has been moved.

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.825
But the one who set it
never intended to protect Wu Mujin's life.

00:12:16.745 --> 00:12:18.265
Xu Daoyin deceived my uncle?

00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:21.025
I'm not sure.

00:12:22.265 --> 00:12:23.625
But someone

00:12:23.705 --> 00:12:27.145
wants Wu Mujin dead, while someone else
is trying to keep him alive.

00:12:30.665 --> 00:12:31.945
I don't believe

00:12:32.025 --> 00:12:34.785
a single stake and a few stones
could hold such power.

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:36.745
While they can't alter one's fate,

00:12:36.825 --> 00:12:39.345
they can benefit the occupant
by creating a nice environment.

00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:43.545
This harmful layout blocks wind and light,

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:46.865
greatly limiting vision and movement.

00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:48.905
Even a healthy person

00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:51.545
can't live here, let alone a child.

00:12:54.385 --> 00:12:55.545
I see.

00:12:56.945 --> 00:12:59.065
Gloomy courtyard. Winding corridors.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.585
No sunlight.

00:13:00.665 --> 00:13:03.505
I was there for less than a ke
and already felt a headache.

00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:08.505
No wonder the child is sickly
and no tonic ever improved his health.

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:14.865
Mr. Xiao, are you feeling sorry for him?

00:13:17.465 --> 00:13:18.705
How do you deal

00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:21.625
with the pity for the people
involved in the cases?

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:26.785
All cases derive from nothing but desire.

00:13:26.865 --> 00:13:28.905
Desire for love or profit.

00:13:28.985 --> 00:13:31.065
A single thought can destroy others
and harm oneself.

00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:34.345
I am only human.
How can I remain indifferent?

00:13:34.985 --> 00:13:37.305
But if you want to keep doing your job,

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:39.985
you must learn to treat yourself
as someone else.

00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:41.865
Treat yourself as someone else?

00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:45.025
This is the method I came up with

00:13:45.545 --> 00:13:47.905
to not suffer from caring too much.

00:13:48.465 --> 00:13:49.865
When a case ends,

00:13:49.945 --> 00:13:53.225
let that version of yourself
stay behind in that case.

00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:55.225
Grieve and feel pity as much as you need.

00:13:55.305 --> 00:13:58.425
But the you right now is another self.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.545
You can stride forward
and move on to the next case.

00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:06.625
Then, when the next case ends,
leave another self behind.

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:09.625
You are really clever.

00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:14.305
Do you ever meet the selves
you've left behind?

00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:18.025
Why would I meet them to double the pain?

00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:20.705
I'm not doing this to myself.

00:14:21.465 --> 00:14:23.545
If all the pain can be isolated,

00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:26.465
then I hope you can stay further away
from your former selves.

00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:29.065
What?

00:14:29.145 --> 00:14:31.625
I said I'll try it next time.

00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:41.545
Your Ladyship, I found

00:14:42.265 --> 00:14:43.865
the medicine dregs in the grass

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:45.465
outside the victim's bedroom.

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:53.505
Dang Gui, cinnamon,

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.905
Sichuan lovage,
Achyranthes root, plantain seed,

00:14:58.825 --> 00:14:59.665
and safflower?

00:15:01.265 --> 00:15:02.265
This recipe looks so familiar.

00:15:02.345 --> 00:15:04.145
It's the Tuohua Decoction.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.425
- To induce labor?
- That's right.

00:15:08.505 --> 00:15:09.665
In this prescription,

00:15:09.745 --> 00:15:11.865
Dang Gui and Sichuan lovage
are blood-activating.

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:12.945
The amounts of the herbs

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:15.145
in the medicine dregs
far exceed the normal dosage.

00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:22.705
If the dosage of these two herbs
is not properly controlled,

00:15:22.785 --> 00:15:24.425
it could cause fatal bleeding
during labor.

00:15:25.105 --> 00:15:26.985
The Imperial Medical Office
has prohibited its use

00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:28.385
for many years.

00:15:29.665 --> 00:15:32.665
But the herbs in this prescription
are easy to find.

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:34.745
The authorities are far away.

00:15:34.825 --> 00:15:37.305
The folk people
still induce labor with it.

00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:47.865
Something happened at Wu's Manor.

00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:50.065
Madam Wu claimed to suspect Wu Mujin

00:15:50.145 --> 00:15:53.505
and moved him out of the courtyard
and had people search the courtyard.

00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:56.185
Didn't I ask you to protect Wu Mujin?

00:15:56.265 --> 00:15:58.825
- How did this happen?
- Where did he move to?

00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:01.505
A guest room right next
to Madam Wu's bedroom.

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:04.625
She said she'd put him
right under her nose

00:16:04.705 --> 00:16:05.985
so that he couldn't cause trouble.

00:16:07.945 --> 00:16:09.905
Why did she suddenly
grow suspicious of him?

00:16:09.985 --> 00:16:12.745
Because only Young Master's
incense doesn't contain

00:16:12.825 --> 00:16:13.785
Datura flower.

00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:16.625
Thus, Madam decided that he was involved.

00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:19.705
He's such a feeble child.

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:20.945
How could he kill someone?

00:16:21.025 --> 00:16:22.945
Isn't this ridiculous?

00:16:23.905 --> 00:16:25.905
Let her be.

00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:27.345
Magistrate Wen.

00:16:27.425 --> 00:16:30.345
When will your messenger
come back from the Western Capital?

00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:33.705
It will be tonight at the earliest.

00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:39.225
Your Ladyship.

00:16:40.945 --> 00:16:42.185
Your Ladyship.

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:44.425
Our years of friendship
have gone to waste?

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:46.545
You went and found an outsider
for the investigation?

00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:48.425
Your Ladyship. Wuren insists on coming.

00:16:49.025 --> 00:16:50.345
What do you mean?

00:16:50.425 --> 00:16:52.665
- That messenger won't be here until night.
- I…

00:16:55.505 --> 00:16:56.345
Magistrate Wen.

00:16:57.985 --> 00:16:58.825
Coming.

00:17:00.585 --> 00:17:01.625
Your Ladyship.

00:17:01.705 --> 00:17:03.025
- Get me a horse.
- Understood.

00:17:04.745 --> 00:17:06.224
Your Ladyship. Where are we going?

00:17:07.305 --> 00:17:08.145
To Qingtan Town.

00:17:08.224 --> 00:17:09.545
Find Xu Daoyin.

00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:25.745
SEE SIMPLICITY AND EMBRACE PLAINNESS

00:17:35.025 --> 00:17:36.545
For the Heaven-Inquiry Ceremony,

00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:37.945
line up at the gate.

00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:40.625
We came on behalf
of Wu Siping from the Ping'en County.

00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:51.745
Distinguished guests.

00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:53.865
Forgive me. Please follow me.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.625
This way, please.

00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:14.305
Mr. Xu is preparing for the ceremony.

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:17.025
Everyone. Please rest
in Mr. Wu's courtyard.

00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:21.105
Someone will lead you
to your seats for the grand event.

00:18:21.185 --> 00:18:22.385
Thank you.

00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:23.465
My pleasure.

00:18:28.185 --> 00:18:30.585
He has a courtyard in this manor.

00:18:31.105 --> 00:18:32.665
He's spent a fortune here.

00:18:33.185 --> 00:18:37.385
But how did you figure out
where the door is?

00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:42.785
Wu's Manor adopts a geomantic formation.

00:18:42.865 --> 00:18:45.545
Mr. Xu's manor
must have followed the same design.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:47.825
The manor leans against the mountain,

00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:50.145
and the layout follows the concept
of the Big Dipper.

00:18:50.225 --> 00:18:53.705
The whole manor is, in fact,
a massive geomantic formation.

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:57.065
What about the side gate?

00:18:57.145 --> 00:18:58.385
The side gate we passed through

00:18:58.465 --> 00:19:00.745
is the Gate of Life within this formation.

00:19:00.825 --> 00:19:03.505
So there must be another exit
besides the main gate.

00:19:03.585 --> 00:19:05.985
The mechanism wins your recognition.

00:19:06.065 --> 00:19:07.585
Mr. Xu does have some skills.

00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:11.425
How do you know I took a jade tablet?

00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:14.025
I've been around you long enough to tell.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:26.945
Reading the stars again?

00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:31.705
I'm used to watching the stars
as soon as night falls.

00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:34.785
Aren't you tired of it
after so many years?

00:19:34.865 --> 00:19:35.945
Not at all.

00:19:36.505 --> 00:19:37.905
They like my old friends.

00:19:37.985 --> 00:19:40.385
We communicate without talking.

00:19:42.065 --> 00:19:42.985
Is that so?

00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:46.265
I want to talk to them, too.

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:50.025
What do you want to say to them?

00:19:50.905 --> 00:19:53.385
I bet they know all the secrets.

00:19:54.225 --> 00:19:57.545
They've seen all kinds of crimes and sins.

00:19:58.345 --> 00:20:00.225
Culprits and thugs hit the road at night.

00:20:04.145 --> 00:20:06.265
I thought you could be romantic.

00:20:06.345 --> 00:20:08.385
In the end, it's still about cases.

00:20:10.985 --> 00:20:12.825
I'm not in the mood for romance.

00:20:14.025 --> 00:20:17.705
My mind won't be at ease
until I find an answer.

00:20:18.545 --> 00:20:21.585
I wonder if my father
ever told the stars his worries.

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:27.305
Do you remember

00:20:27.385 --> 00:20:29.545
that the stars have helped us many times?

00:20:30.865 --> 00:20:33.905
Ask sincerely
and they'll offer you the answer

00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:35.585
one day.

00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:40.985
So I wasn't sincere enough?

00:20:42.305 --> 00:20:45.745
It just takes time. They may
make mistakes in their busy days.

00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:52.425
Why did you study astronomy
at the Astronomical Bureau?

00:20:54.785 --> 00:20:57.265
I became an investigator
to figure out the truth.

00:20:57.345 --> 00:20:58.745
Why did you become an astronomer?

00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:04.985
For…

00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:07.385
a promise.

00:21:10.785 --> 00:21:12.305
To whom?

00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:15.985
An old friend.

00:21:21.465 --> 00:21:24.745
It seems that you are
also trapped in the past.

00:21:26.465 --> 00:21:28.785
I hope the stars can solve all confusions

00:21:30.145 --> 00:21:31.345
and help those trapped in the past

00:21:32.585 --> 00:21:33.705
move forward.

00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:45.985
Any progress?

00:21:47.705 --> 00:21:49.185
Nothing.

00:21:49.265 --> 00:21:51.105
The manor is full of twists and turns.

00:21:51.185 --> 00:21:52.745
We almost got lost.

00:21:54.545 --> 00:21:56.065
It seems that the whole manor

00:21:56.145 --> 00:21:59.505
resembles Wu Siping's courtyard,
full of twists and turns.

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:00.785
Why is that?

00:22:00.865 --> 00:22:02.825
Mr. Xu set up this layout.

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:03.905
More importantly,

00:22:03.985 --> 00:22:06.305
they don't want outsiders to walk around.

00:22:06.385 --> 00:22:08.345
This place hides a lot of secrets.

00:22:09.465 --> 00:22:11.625
It should have an unobstructed view,

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.865
but except for Wu Siping's courtyard,

00:22:13.945 --> 00:22:16.145
everything is covered by trees and bamboo.

00:22:16.225 --> 00:22:17.185
We can't see anything.

00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:18.425
That's right.

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:20.145
We made a big circle along the mountain

00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:21.225
and found nothing.

00:22:22.105 --> 00:22:23.745
The manor is so meticulously designed.

00:22:23.825 --> 00:22:26.465
He also managed to earn
the deep trust of Wu Siping

00:22:26.545 --> 00:22:28.145
and make a fortune.

00:22:28.745 --> 00:22:31.625
It seems this Mr. Xu
is no ordinary charlatan.

00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:34.305
We'll see him
at the Heaven-Inquiry Ceremony.

00:23:02.785 --> 00:23:03.625
That is Xu Daoyin?

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:07.225
XU DAOYIN

00:23:51.505 --> 00:23:53.385
Why is the ritual bell hanging in the air?

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:54.985
What's going on?

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:03.785
Mr. Xu is making inquiries.

00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:21.305
‪What's happening?

00:24:21.385 --> 00:24:22.665
- His head…
- It really works?

00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:26.665
First attempt to ask about fortune.

00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:43.945
Second attempt to ask about fortune.

00:24:49.785 --> 00:24:51.625
- His head is gone!
- His head is gone.

00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:56.865
Mr. Xu is quite something.

00:24:56.945 --> 00:24:59.025
Where did he go to make inquiries?

00:25:09.465 --> 00:25:11.145
He moved. He's still alive.

00:25:18.625 --> 00:25:20.225
- Oh no.
- Something went wrong.

00:25:23.385 --> 00:25:25.185
Don't panic, everyone.

00:25:25.265 --> 00:25:26.305
Please.

00:25:26.385 --> 00:25:28.225
Listen to me.

00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:30.185
Mr. Xu

00:25:30.865 --> 00:25:32.065
was summoned to Heaven.

00:25:32.145 --> 00:25:33.585
He will be back.

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:34.945
Someone. Open the gate.

00:25:35.025 --> 00:25:37.185
Everyone, please get some rest.

00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:38.185
Once Mr. Xu is back,

00:25:38.265 --> 00:25:39.825
we will inform you.

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.425
Be careful.

00:25:41.505 --> 00:25:43.345
Dear guests. Please go back and rest.

00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:44.505
Step aside.

00:25:45.505 --> 00:25:46.825
Who dares to stop the investigation?

00:26:07.945 --> 00:26:09.185
A mechanism.

00:26:17.425 --> 00:26:18.625
Such a horrible death.

00:26:18.705 --> 00:26:20.065
It was a murder.

00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:24.705
The incision in the neck

00:26:25.505 --> 00:26:26.745
is very flat.

00:26:26.825 --> 00:26:28.505
Only an extremely sharp blade
can achieve that.

00:26:28.585 --> 00:26:30.425
But the altar was in plain sight.

00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:31.545
There was no blade.

00:26:31.625 --> 00:26:33.185
Such a neat cut

00:26:33.265 --> 00:26:34.465
is beyond human power.

00:26:49.385 --> 00:26:51.385
Human head. Mr. Xiao, don't look.

00:26:54.545 --> 00:26:55.585
Who is it?

00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:06.585
This is Lady Yue.
Mr. Xu's immortal companion.

00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:11.145
I only heard that Mr. Wu
invited distinguished guests.

00:27:11.225 --> 00:27:12.985
I didn't expect it to be Your Ladyship.

00:27:13.905 --> 00:27:14.825
Forgive me for the negligence.

00:27:16.105 --> 00:27:18.065
Things went wrong at the ceremony

00:27:18.145 --> 00:27:19.625
and frightened Your Ladyship.

00:27:20.225 --> 00:27:22.105
I will handle this.

00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:24.185
Please go back and inform Mr. Wu.

00:27:24.265 --> 00:27:25.185
Mr. Wu is dead.

00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:28.145
Has Mr. Xu ever offended anyone?

00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:32.745
I don't understand your question.

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:36.345
The Heaven-Inquiry Ceremony
connects people with the gods.

00:27:36.425 --> 00:27:38.745
If the gods are displeased,
they may punish

00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:40.625
the mortals.

00:27:40.705 --> 00:27:42.305
Save your story

00:27:42.385 --> 00:27:44.305
for those followers
who spent a fortune here.

00:27:44.385 --> 00:27:45.705
One more lie,

00:27:45.785 --> 00:27:47.945
I'll send you and this dead man
to the afterworld.

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:50.585
Don't forget.

00:27:50.665 --> 00:27:52.905
Mr. Xu could be dead by now.

00:27:52.985 --> 00:27:54.065
Don't you care about him?

00:27:58.705 --> 00:28:01.105
This person is named Liu San.

00:28:01.985 --> 00:28:03.545
He is Mr. Xu's protector.

00:28:04.905 --> 00:28:06.145
Protector?

00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:09.425
He was merely a stand-in
for Xu Daoyin's "miracle" performance.

00:28:09.505 --> 00:28:11.305
At the start of the act,

00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:12.425
Xu Daoyin

00:28:12.505 --> 00:28:14.305
stood in front of this curtain,

00:28:14.385 --> 00:28:15.705
which had a hook on it.

00:28:15.785 --> 00:28:17.825
He put the ritual bell on the hook.

00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:19.985
The dark curtain
blended with the moonlight,

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:21.985
making it appear as if
the bell was floating mid-air.

00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:24.065
Liu San, dressed in identical robes

00:28:24.145 --> 00:28:26.065
and wearing a face cover
matching the curtain's color,

00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:27.945
stood behind it.

00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:30.985
During the spray of molten iron sparks,
the two swapped positions.

00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:34.465
Xu Daoyin
stepped onto the platform behind,

00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:36.505
revealing his face above the curtain,

00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:39.105
while Liu San remained
on the altar as the "body."

00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:42.145
With the play of light, shadow, and smoke,

00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:43.905
to the audience down the hill,

00:28:43.985 --> 00:28:46.705
it looked like Xu Daoyin's head
had separated from his body.

00:28:47.505 --> 00:28:48.545
Xu Daoyin's head

00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:50.425
disappeared during the spray
of molten iron sparks.

00:28:51.025 --> 00:28:53.545
A moment later, blood spurted out
from Liu San on the stage.

00:28:54.145 --> 00:28:55.705
Did Xu Daoyin kill Liu San?

00:28:56.785 --> 00:29:00.585
No. Liu San was really decapitated.

00:29:00.665 --> 00:29:02.025
It's more complicated
than changing positions.

00:29:04.425 --> 00:29:05.265
This is the murder weapon.

00:29:05.865 --> 00:29:06.945
Copper wire?

00:29:07.025 --> 00:29:09.265
They didn't use a knife.

00:29:09.865 --> 00:29:10.665
Instead…

00:29:10.745 --> 00:29:13.865
Have you heard of people
getting hurt by a kite string?

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:17.105
Some things
are more dangerous than we imagine.

00:29:18.185 --> 00:29:21.305
Both these pillars
show signs of rope wear.

00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:23.665
Although all pillars are tied
with thin ropes

00:29:23.745 --> 00:29:25.705
for gauze curtains as decoration,

00:29:25.785 --> 00:29:28.105
these two have
the most prominent wear marks.

00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:31.105
They were likely pulled by a heavy force.

00:29:31.185 --> 00:29:32.585
When the mechanism was triggered,

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:34.065
the rope moved rapidly,

00:29:34.145 --> 00:29:36.585
and the sharp copper wire hidden inside

00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:39.065
was enough to sever a head.

00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:43.305
Someone set up the copper wire
before the ceremony.

00:29:43.385 --> 00:29:44.785
Let's check the back.

00:29:56.585 --> 00:29:57.905
This is from Mr. Xu's clothes.

00:30:01.345 --> 00:30:02.745
No blood here.

00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:04.425
So he was likely just abducted.

00:30:04.505 --> 00:30:05.825
There's more than one perpetrator.

00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:07.465
Not necessarily.

00:30:07.545 --> 00:30:08.585
The culprit could seize the moment

00:30:08.665 --> 00:30:11.025
when the guests
were distracted by the iron sparks

00:30:11.105 --> 00:30:12.425
to abduct Xu Daoyin

00:30:12.505 --> 00:30:14.145
and pull the switch to activate

00:30:14.225 --> 00:30:16.825
the mechanism on the altar
to kill Liu San.

00:30:16.905 --> 00:30:20.545
Whoever designed
such an intricate mechanism could have

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:23.585
carried this out alone
if he timed it right.

00:30:23.665 --> 00:30:25.705
Involving more people might bring trouble.

00:30:26.305 --> 00:30:28.665
Who designed the mechanism on the altar?

00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:31.625
Mr. Xu, of course.

00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:33.825
But the mechanisms are heavily guarded.

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.305
Only Mr. Xu and Liu San had the key.

00:30:36.385 --> 00:30:38.265
We've never been inside.

00:30:38.345 --> 00:30:39.905
Your Ladyship.

00:30:39.985 --> 00:30:41.305
Let's save him first.

00:30:41.385 --> 00:30:42.825
He's still missing.

00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:45.865
Once I find the killer, Mr. Xu is safe.

00:30:49.025 --> 00:30:52.145
These four guard the entrance
from the manor to the altar.

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:54.705
Xiao is in charge of the mechanism tower.

00:30:55.545 --> 00:30:57.065
Have you seen anything unusual?

00:30:59.225 --> 00:31:01.545
- No.
- Are you sure?

00:31:02.185 --> 00:31:03.625
Xiao. What about yesterday?

00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:04.825
I…

00:31:04.905 --> 00:31:07.545
I've been here watching.

00:31:07.625 --> 00:31:09.105
I check it every day.

00:31:09.185 --> 00:31:11.905
Last night, I checked one more time.

00:31:11.985 --> 00:31:14.505
When Liu San went in with Mr. Xu today,

00:31:14.585 --> 00:31:16.305
I was watching this door.

00:31:17.265 --> 00:31:19.425
I didn't see anyone suspicious.

00:31:19.505 --> 00:31:21.865
Xiao. Mr. Xu treated you well.

00:31:22.665 --> 00:31:24.785
If you neglected your duty
and got Mr. Xu killed,

00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:26.145
I wouldn't let you off.

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:29.545
I-I have a clear conscience.

00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:31.105
Let's meet Her Ladyship.

00:31:32.425 --> 00:31:33.385
Xiao.

00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:43.665
It's hard to hide out there.

00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:44.745
To enter the tower,

00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:46.745
they have to pass by Xiao.

00:31:46.825 --> 00:31:47.665
Unless…

00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:53.185
The incense?

00:31:54.185 --> 00:31:55.905
Yes. More Datura flowers.

00:31:56.785 --> 00:31:58.745
Xiao. Did you burn this incense?

00:32:02.185 --> 00:32:04.425
My daughter made me a repellent sachet.

00:32:04.505 --> 00:32:06.185
I never use incense.

00:32:06.265 --> 00:32:07.425
Think carefully.

00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:09.465
Were you feeling sleepy, dizzy,

00:32:09.545 --> 00:32:10.665
or a bit drowsy?

00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:11.825
No.

00:32:14.865 --> 00:32:16.105
He didn't enter the tower?

00:32:16.705 --> 00:32:18.025
None of the servants

00:32:18.105 --> 00:32:19.985
in the Wu's Manor admitted
that they fell asleep.

00:32:25.665 --> 00:32:28.425
The person who killed
Wu Siping and Liu San

00:32:28.505 --> 00:32:30.785
and abducted Xu Daoyin
is likely the same individual.

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:33.985
This person has free access
to the manor and the Wu's Manor

00:32:34.065 --> 00:32:35.225
without drawing attention.

00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.225
He's either from the manor

00:32:37.305 --> 00:32:39.265
or a martial artist from outside.

00:32:39.865 --> 00:32:40.985
It's easy to find a traitor.

00:32:41.065 --> 00:32:42.785
But the outsider could be anyone.

00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:49.105
Did Wu Siping and Xu Daoyin
have a common enemy?

00:32:50.585 --> 00:32:52.905
They were all compassionate and kind.

00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:54.265
Why would they have enemies?

00:32:55.425 --> 00:32:56.465
Bad news.

00:32:57.305 --> 00:32:58.665
Lady Yue, bad news.

00:32:58.745 --> 00:33:00.785
- Someone broke into the Vitality Hall.
- Vitality Hall?

00:33:03.505 --> 00:33:04.905
It's just a place in the manor.

00:33:05.745 --> 00:33:08.065
Since someone broke in,
we have to take a look.

00:33:08.145 --> 00:33:09.185
Well…

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:11.425
Let me take care of it.

00:33:11.505 --> 00:33:13.225
It's just a trivial matter.

00:33:13.305 --> 00:33:15.105
Nothing is trivial here.

00:33:15.185 --> 00:33:16.545
The killer is still at large,

00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:18.305
likely waiting to do more evil.

00:33:18.905 --> 00:33:21.585
Keep looking for Xu Daoyin.
We'll go to the Vitality Hall.

00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:29.025
VITALITY HALL

00:33:29.105 --> 00:33:31.545
The Vitality Hall
mostly houses young women.

00:33:31.625 --> 00:33:32.665
This may be inconvenient.

00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:33.625
Please stay.

00:33:57.905 --> 00:34:00.185
Won't you ask about it? Someone broke in.

00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:05.545
Liu discovered it.

00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:07.585
But that person has run away.

00:34:07.665 --> 00:34:09.105
What about the baby?

00:34:09.905 --> 00:34:12.264
It was a bit of a shock. Nothing serious.

00:34:18.304 --> 00:34:19.304
Scared, huh?

00:34:20.185 --> 00:34:21.985
Tell me everything. I'll do you justice.

00:34:34.665 --> 00:34:36.304
Be quiet.

00:34:36.385 --> 00:34:37.225
Be quiet.

00:34:37.304 --> 00:34:38.304
Don't shout.

00:34:38.824 --> 00:34:39.945
‪-Be quiet.
‪-Okay.

00:34:42.985 --> 00:34:44.865
Come with me. I won't hurt you.

00:34:46.385 --> 00:34:48.304
Be quiet. Be quiet.

00:34:56.705 --> 00:34:58.665
Help. Help.

00:35:00.425 --> 00:35:01.265
What's wrong?

00:35:03.265 --> 00:35:04.065
Get him.

00:35:17.665 --> 00:35:18.785
So deep.

00:35:21.025 --> 00:35:21.985
Trace the blood.

00:35:32.905 --> 00:35:33.905
There's blood here.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:35.385
Still wet.

00:35:39.185 --> 00:35:40.185
Here too.

00:35:40.825 --> 00:35:42.425
He ran that way.

00:35:42.505 --> 00:35:43.465
Let's go.

00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:49.065
You took medication?

00:35:51.665 --> 00:35:53.225
To calm the nerves and protect the baby.

00:35:53.305 --> 00:35:55.105
We have it all the time.

00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:05.785
No.

00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:07.745
What do you smell?

00:36:09.785 --> 00:36:11.545
There are too many smells in this room.

00:36:13.785 --> 00:36:15.305
Fine, rest first.

00:36:22.025 --> 00:36:24.025
Why are there so many pregnant women here?

00:36:25.345 --> 00:36:26.865
Mr. Xu took them in.

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:29.025
Some women come from poor families.

00:36:29.105 --> 00:36:31.985
Some were unmarried but got pregnant.

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:33.705
For some reason,

00:36:33.785 --> 00:36:36.025
they couldn't have the baby at home.

00:36:36.105 --> 00:36:38.025
Mr. Xu took these poor women in

00:36:39.065 --> 00:36:40.625
and found good people

00:36:40.705 --> 00:36:42.305
to adopt their children.

00:36:43.905 --> 00:36:45.425
Xu Daoyin was too kind

00:36:45.945 --> 00:36:47.345
to just take in these few, right?

00:36:48.185 --> 00:36:52.305
Orphans, the elderly, homeless people,
those with illnesses or disabilities.

00:36:52.385 --> 00:36:53.585
They all need shelter.

00:36:54.145 --> 00:36:55.385
Can this manor really house so many?

00:36:56.905 --> 00:36:59.545
Mr. Xu also took care of those people.

00:36:59.625 --> 00:37:01.465
He just didn't
accommodate them in the manor.

00:37:03.185 --> 00:37:04.345
So he was kinder

00:37:04.425 --> 00:37:06.385
to a certain group of people.

00:37:15.025 --> 00:37:16.185
Have you mobilized everyone?

00:37:16.265 --> 00:37:18.265
Be sure to find Mr. Xu
before Her Ladyship.

00:37:18.345 --> 00:37:20.985
Everyone is out. Dead or alive.

00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:26.025
Don't make any mistakes
about the delivery tonight.

00:37:26.105 --> 00:37:28.705
We're all set. Nothing will go wrong.

00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:32.105
Pack up everything.

00:37:32.945 --> 00:37:34.025
If Mr. Xu really…

00:37:34.105 --> 00:37:35.465
Rest assured.

00:37:36.105 --> 00:37:38.745
I've contacted the boat
leaving Qingtan Town.

00:37:39.305 --> 00:37:40.665
If Mr. Xu is dead,

00:37:40.745 --> 00:37:43.145
we'll wrap up this deal tonight

00:37:43.225 --> 00:37:44.865
and get out of this manor

00:37:44.945 --> 00:37:46.665
within an hour.

00:37:53.025 --> 00:37:54.145
He got away.

00:37:54.985 --> 00:37:55.945
We deserve punishment.

00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:58.305
It's understandable.

00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:01.865
This manor seems to have
many secret passages.

00:38:01.945 --> 00:38:03.185
Xu Daoyin is not the only one

00:38:03.945 --> 00:38:05.425
who masters mechanical techniques.

00:38:06.705 --> 00:38:07.785
Your Ladyship.

00:38:15.505 --> 00:38:17.345
Lady Yue prepared a meal for you.

00:38:21.025 --> 00:38:22.985
She's so thoughtful. Thank her for me.

00:38:23.745 --> 00:38:25.545
She is grateful for your help

00:38:25.625 --> 00:38:28.265
and told us to look after you.

00:38:28.345 --> 00:38:31.265
The servants are at the door.
Tell us if you need anything.

00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:34.985
It's wise to be cautious of people.

00:38:35.065 --> 00:38:36.625
Xu Daoyin's immortal companion

00:38:36.705 --> 00:38:38.025
can't be a simple woman.

00:38:38.105 --> 00:38:40.785
It seems tonight
is destined to be restless.

00:38:40.865 --> 00:38:42.345
How do you know?

00:38:43.865 --> 00:38:45.065
Persimmon.

00:38:47.145 --> 00:38:49.545
I don't know whether it's good or bad.

00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:34.385
Anything bothering you?

00:39:35.945 --> 00:39:36.785
No.

00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:38.385
I'm waiting,

00:39:38.465 --> 00:39:39.465
just as you said.

00:39:42.785 --> 00:39:44.505
Look at the Alkaid.

00:39:45.105 --> 00:39:46.905
It's too far away. I can't see clearly.

00:39:49.945 --> 00:39:50.785
Do this.

00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:52.945
See through this.

00:40:06.305 --> 00:40:07.145
Now I see it.

00:40:07.785 --> 00:40:08.945
If waiting doesn't work,

00:40:09.465 --> 00:40:10.625
you can take some measures.

00:40:12.585 --> 00:40:13.425
Any wise advice?

00:40:13.505 --> 00:40:14.945
It's getting late.

00:40:15.025 --> 00:40:15.865
Go to bed.

00:40:23.945 --> 00:40:26.305
VITALITY HALL

00:40:26.385 --> 00:40:28.505
I am Madam Wu's servant Wu Lie.
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:40:28.585 --> 00:40:30.225
Please help her.

00:40:32.185 --> 00:40:34.065
Wait outside. Play it by ear.

00:40:38.465 --> 00:40:39.505
Harder.

00:40:40.025 --> 00:40:41.385
- It comes out!
- Your Ladyship.

00:40:42.105 --> 00:40:43.065
Almost there.

00:40:43.145 --> 00:40:44.505
Harder.

00:40:44.585 --> 00:40:45.545
The baby is coming out.

00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:46.825
Get her up.

00:40:47.665 --> 00:40:49.705
Why is Liu giving birth so much earlier?

00:40:49.785 --> 00:40:52.505
- She was probably shocked.
- Harder.

00:40:52.585 --> 00:40:53.425
It's bloody in here.

00:40:53.505 --> 00:40:55.265
Please wait outside.

00:40:55.345 --> 00:40:57.705
- Shocked? She should rest.
- Almost there.

00:40:57.785 --> 00:40:58.625
- Why are you pushing her to give birth?
- Almost there!

00:40:59.345 --> 00:41:00.705
Hold her now.

00:41:00.785 --> 00:41:01.985
Have the medicine.

00:41:03.345 --> 00:41:04.705
Stop it. Don't you hear me?

00:41:05.305 --> 00:41:07.225
The baby is coming out. We can't stop.

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:09.225
Hurry up.

00:41:10.305 --> 00:41:11.145
Hold her.

00:41:14.105 --> 00:41:15.145
Beginning of the Hai hour.

00:41:15.225 --> 00:41:16.065
He's born.

00:41:16.825 --> 00:41:18.225
- He's born.
- Come with me.

00:41:18.305 --> 00:41:19.345
He's born.

00:41:23.265 --> 00:41:24.545
She's bleeding. Hurry.

00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:25.665
Hurry.

00:41:28.625 --> 00:41:29.705
Give me that.

00:41:31.745 --> 00:41:32.665
What's going on?

00:41:32.745 --> 00:41:34.145
Stop the bleeding.

00:41:37.105 --> 00:41:39.705
Your Ladyship.
Let's leave it to the midwives.

00:41:39.785 --> 00:41:41.225
- Why can't you stop the bleeding?
- Look!

00:41:41.305 --> 00:41:42.185
Hurry.

00:41:42.945 --> 00:41:44.105
It doesn't stop.

00:41:54.865 --> 00:41:55.705
She's dead.

00:42:00.025 --> 00:42:02.265
VITALITY HALL

00:42:06.945 --> 00:42:08.185
Your Ladyship is kind.

00:42:08.705 --> 00:42:10.305
Unfortunately,

00:42:10.825 --> 00:42:12.145
Liu was too weak.

00:42:12.945 --> 00:42:15.465
I don't think you care about her at all.

00:42:19.665 --> 00:42:21.105
That's a serious accusation.

00:42:21.185 --> 00:42:24.585
The Vitality Hall
was set up for the poor mothers.

00:42:24.665 --> 00:42:26.945
Of course, we care about them.

00:42:37.105 --> 00:42:38.185
Tuohua Decoction.

00:42:38.265 --> 00:42:39.225
Strong medicine.

00:42:39.305 --> 00:42:41.705
A slight mistake can make
a delivering mother bleed to death.

00:42:41.785 --> 00:42:43.665
The Imperial Medical Office
has prohibited its use.

00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:49.785
Did Liu go into early labor due to shock,
or did you induce her labor?

00:42:51.105 --> 00:42:52.985
She was the one with the child.

00:42:53.065 --> 00:42:54.225
We could only deliver the baby

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.825
when she was ready.

00:42:55.905 --> 00:42:58.305
I know the Tuohua Decoction
can't be abused.

00:42:58.985 --> 00:43:00.785
But once a woman is pregnant,

00:43:00.865 --> 00:43:03.345
the child's life weighs more than her own.

00:43:03.945 --> 00:43:06.385
She told us to prepare
the Tuohua Decoction

00:43:06.465 --> 00:43:08.385
and asked us to save the child,

00:43:08.465 --> 00:43:10.185
even at the cost of her life.

00:43:11.985 --> 00:43:13.985
Since you're innocent,

00:43:14.745 --> 00:43:16.985
then why did you poison our food?

00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:21.905
No, I didn't.

00:43:22.545 --> 00:43:25.385
All the ingredients I prepared
are top quality.

00:43:25.465 --> 00:43:26.425
If you don't believe me,

00:43:26.505 --> 00:43:28.545
take the dishes
to the yamen for inspection.

00:43:30.305 --> 00:43:32.345
You're right again.

00:43:32.425 --> 00:43:34.345
Lady Yue is really skilled and bold.

00:43:34.425 --> 00:43:35.705
At this point,

00:43:35.785 --> 00:43:37.985
she can still respond calmly as usual.

00:43:38.065 --> 00:43:40.905
Roast mutton with veratrum
instead of scallion.

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.905
And ginseng-infused medicinal liquor.

00:43:43.545 --> 00:43:45.825
You've mastered
the "Eighteen Incompatibilities."

00:43:46.425 --> 00:43:47.265
What a pity.

00:43:47.345 --> 00:43:49.265
I've learned from the best.

00:43:49.785 --> 00:43:52.345
She knew the food incompatibilities
much better than you.

00:43:57.105 --> 00:43:58.985
You intended to murder me

00:43:59.065 --> 00:44:01.785
and used banned drugs
to kill the woman in labor.

00:44:01.865 --> 00:44:03.545
What are you trying to do?
