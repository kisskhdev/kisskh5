WEBVTT

00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:50.154
{\an8}The last ten days
have been wonderful for me.

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:51.614
{\an8}That's great to hear.

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:54.534
{\an8}Your letters asking after me
brought me joy,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:57.787
{\an8}hearing that you missed me
gave me comfort,

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:00.999
{\an8}and your goodnight wishes warmed my heart.

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.418
{\an8}I should say those things more.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:04.919
{\an8}Tonight,

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.173
{\an8}I will take your longing with me,

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:13.178
{\an8}so you can sleep peacefully.

00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:16.222
{\an8}And I hope

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.475
{\an8}I will miss you dearly,

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:23.479
{\an8}deeply,

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:25.356
and for a long time.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.442
I can't stop you, right?

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:28.902
No.

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:31.279
- I should go, because I'm offended.
- What?

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.990
She's taking my longing without asking me.

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:36.784
Why don't you at least wait until dawn?

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:39.287
I want it to be tonight.

00:01:40.163 --> 00:01:41.414
What are you going to do?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.042
My old resolution.

00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:03.436
No. If I'm in danger,
it will happen again.

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:13.988
Why is my bracelet…

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:15.990
Could it be…

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.336
Please leave, or I'll call the guards.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.588
- I just want to check one thing!
- What's going on?

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:33.591
Move.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.720
Is Hong Eun-jo in the palace?

00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:39.472
Why? What's going on?

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.018
Who told you that?

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:46.354
Something bothered me, so I went to check.

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:50.149
The prisoner has escaped!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.621
{\an8}He left this for Your Majesty.

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:06.916
Hong Eun-jo is in danger.

00:03:16.634 --> 00:03:17.969
I'm still me.

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:22.348
Try anything foolish,
I'll stab you and kill your mother too.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.159
Why are you doing this?

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.546
You ruined everything…

00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:00.511
Gil-dong.

00:04:06.142 --> 00:04:08.895
I hear everyone's precious.

00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:11.064
That was
what your dead father used to say.

00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:13.399
That foolish delusion

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:18.363
must have made you forget your place.

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:25.828
- Hurry up!
- What is happening?

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:30.041
Don't panic, and do as I say.

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:31.751
We must save Physician Hong.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.720
When I heard the Grand Prince
was fooling around with a physician,

00:04:42.804 --> 00:04:44.222
I just laughed at it.

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:47.975
It turned out that…

00:04:53.106 --> 00:04:54.774
I underestimated you.

00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:59.737
It never even crossed my mind
that a lowborn was worth considering.

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:04.784
He must have received my letter by now.

00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:10.540
What did you write?

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.671
"If you want to save Gil-dong's life,

00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:20.091
come alone."

00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:24.011
It's Im Sa-hyeong's trap!

00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:26.597
Let me go.

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:28.891
It has to be me.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:31.727
I'm the one Im Sa-hyeong is after.

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.563
"Die a miserable death

00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:35.565
at your woman's hand."

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:43.030
It's not too late.

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:48.327
Please go back.

00:05:49.495 --> 00:05:51.080
Please, for the sake of your family.

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.252
Everything I had was taken from me.

00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:59.630
Now, there is only one thing I have left.

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.966
I have no choice

00:06:04.177 --> 00:06:05.761
but to do all I can.

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:10.183
The only thing you have left

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:13.227
could have been deep reflection…

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.733
instead of this petty revenge.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.945
Did you say…

00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:26.741
petty revenge?

00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:35.917
Hear me loud and clear.

00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:41.339
Your father

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:45.092
was not killed by the king.

00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:51.599
They are your people, Your Majesty.

00:06:52.558 --> 00:06:53.851
Please take pity on them.

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:03.736
I will accept the Chief Censor position.

00:07:06.322 --> 00:07:08.866
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.327
I cannot turn away

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.622
from the people's suffering.

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:23.965
I will go
and let His Majesty know my decision.

00:07:54.203 --> 00:07:55.538
It's a tiger.

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:08.175
I used the king's hallucination.

00:08:11.679 --> 00:08:12.763
Remember this.

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:16.434
Your father

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:19.937
was killed by me.

00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:29.572
Do you feel like taking petty revenge now?

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:50.176
What trick

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:52.178
did you pull?

00:08:57.308 --> 00:08:58.184
Songryeon is

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.398
a face oil used by courtesans
to mix with cosmetic powder.

00:09:05.775 --> 00:09:08.527
When exposed to fire, its nature changes

00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:11.781
and reveals its true form.

00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:24.669
A deadly poison
that can paralyze the entire body.

00:09:37.765 --> 00:09:40.101
You asked me
if I feel like taking petty revenge.

00:09:44.522 --> 00:09:45.940
I feel devastated.

00:09:46.607 --> 00:09:48.818
With my mortal enemy before me,

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:51.904
I will soon be

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:56.283
{\an8}too weak even to hold a sword

00:09:57.785 --> 00:09:58.661
and

00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:01.539
breathe my last.

00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:04.875
How dare you…

00:10:09.213 --> 00:10:10.923
How dare you lowborn…

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.104
Hong Eun-jo.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.958
Hong Eun-jo.

00:10:47.209 --> 00:10:48.461
Hong Eun-jo!

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.521
My brother? At this hour?

00:11:07.605 --> 00:11:09.106
A court lady came to the Hyeminseo.

00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:12.401
The king has summoned
all the physicians in the capital.

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:14.487
His Majesty?

00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:16.489
Is someone dying?

00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:35.549
Hong Eun-jo.

00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:41.847
That was close.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:43.807
What a relief.

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:49.730
You will live.

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:53.025
I will make you live, no matter what.

00:11:55.736 --> 00:11:57.029
Not me.

00:11:58.864 --> 00:12:00.366
Well, of course I'm…

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:07.414
I'm fine…

00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:11.460
The physician will be here shortly.

00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:12.753
Please hang in there.

00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:19.635
{\an8}- I…
- You're ill.

00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:21.595
{\an8}Stop talking.

00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:25.933
But if

00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:28.811
I hold this back again,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.772
I think I will regret it.

00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:34.483
Later.

00:12:35.109 --> 00:12:35.943
Later.

00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:41.949
I was

00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:45.661
so fortunate.

00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:49.039
"Fortunate"?

00:12:49.123 --> 00:12:50.499
Don't say that so easily.

00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:53.043
It sounds like I might be
one of the few fortunate things

00:12:53.127 --> 00:12:55.087
among all that misfortune you have.

00:12:57.089 --> 00:12:59.049
Ever since I met you,

00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:04.805
{\an8}every step you took toward me,

00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:10.185
{\an8}despite all the doubt and hesitation…

00:13:13.439 --> 00:13:16.358
you must have felt

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:20.237
after my countless rejections,

00:13:23.073 --> 00:13:24.074
has been

00:13:25.743 --> 00:13:28.203
my blessing.

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:37.004
And it will stay that way.

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:40.090
I will always be

00:13:41.675 --> 00:13:43.969
by your side, as your blessing.

00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:46.680
So…

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.394
Hong Eun-jo.

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:56.482
Hong Eun-jo.

00:14:22.049 --> 00:14:25.469
Lady Sukeui, you knew all along.

00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:28.555
I'm sorry
I'm only answering your letter now,

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:30.057
Your Majesty.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.558
Does that mean,

00:14:32.101 --> 00:14:33.560
on the night the king abdicated,

00:14:33.644 --> 00:14:36.063
you also knew which woman Yeol was with…

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:37.231
Your Majesty!

00:14:38.524 --> 00:14:39.441
What is it?

00:14:43.195 --> 00:14:44.697
In His Majesty's

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.781
bedchamber…

00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:53.038
Madam.

00:14:53.122 --> 00:14:54.123
I'm sorry.

00:14:56.625 --> 00:14:58.419
So what's happening to our Eun-jo?

00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.629
She's received
all the necessary treatment.

00:15:01.588 --> 00:15:03.048
Now, whether she wakes or not

00:15:04.049 --> 00:15:05.592
depends on her will.

00:15:07.052 --> 00:15:08.262
Eun-jo.

00:15:21.817 --> 00:15:24.069
Your Majesty,
Hong Eun-jo's family is here.

00:15:24.153 --> 00:15:25.320
Bring them in at once.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.216
Eun-jo.

00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:48.385
Mom is here.

00:15:54.099 --> 00:15:55.225
My baby.

00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:58.103
You'll sleep for a bit
and then wake up, right?

00:16:00.773 --> 00:16:01.690
I'm sorry.

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:10.741
As her mother, I can feel

00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:14.828
my child is struggling to live.

00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:19.500
I've felt that since I was carrying her.

00:16:21.627 --> 00:16:22.836
Eun-jo is

00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:25.839
trying her best now.

00:16:29.218 --> 00:16:30.886
{\an8}She will definitely wake up.

00:16:35.224 --> 00:16:37.017
I'm not worried.

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:39.228
Eun-jo is

00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:42.272
the most caring person I know.

00:16:43.107 --> 00:16:45.901
There's no way she would leave
without even saying goodbye.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.029
Oh, for sure she wouldn't.

00:16:49.113 --> 00:16:50.989
You know Eun-jo!

00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:52.282
She's strong.

00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:54.368
And a great physician.

00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:56.495
That's not all.

00:16:56.578 --> 00:16:57.871
Gil-dong…

00:17:01.917 --> 00:17:03.001
Let's all

00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:05.963
wish for a miracle.

00:17:31.363 --> 00:17:32.447
Hong Eun-jo,

00:17:33.532 --> 00:17:36.160
I've never wished for anything in my life.

00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:41.206
I've always thought
it was shameless for a prince

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.585
to be born with everything

00:17:45.836 --> 00:17:47.588
and then ask for more.

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:52.634
But now, I wish for something

00:17:55.012 --> 00:17:56.680
way more desperately

00:17:58.098 --> 00:17:59.308
than you did.

00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:06.148
I already have more than I could ask for.

00:18:06.231 --> 00:18:10.194
So I was just going to leave it at that.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.407
I'm not even sure
if I should wish for this.

00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:20.871
Find Hong Eun-jo's sky lantern.

00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:24.291
Out of all of them?

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:26.585
How am I supposed to find it?

00:18:26.668 --> 00:18:29.046
It'll be easy to tell. Her name's on it.

00:18:33.258 --> 00:18:35.594
Hong-si sent that wish to the sky.

00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:37.179
Let the heavens take care of it.

00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:39.681
They're too busy up there.

00:18:39.765 --> 00:18:41.266
I have a feeling

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.101
that I can grant this wish.

00:18:46.563 --> 00:18:47.731
There.

00:18:50.692 --> 00:18:55.280
In my next life,
I wish I could be with the Grand Prince.

00:19:05.832 --> 00:19:07.709
I don't like that wish you made.

00:19:09.586 --> 00:19:11.505
I don't want it to be in your next life.

00:19:12.881 --> 00:19:14.341
I want it to be now.

00:19:16.426 --> 00:19:17.886
So please wake up.

00:19:20.264 --> 00:19:22.057
Wake up and be with me.

00:19:52.838 --> 00:19:53.964
Hong Eun-jo.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.092
Is the royal physician out there?

00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:58.343
I will bring him in.

00:20:03.598 --> 00:20:04.975
What do you need?

00:20:05.058 --> 00:20:06.268
Do you want me to help you up?

00:20:24.286 --> 00:20:26.038
You look thinner.

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.210
It must've been hard for you.

00:20:37.132 --> 00:20:37.966
Not at all.

00:20:40.093 --> 00:20:41.845
It wasn't hard at all.

00:20:52.731 --> 00:20:53.607
Eun-jo!

00:21:03.075 --> 00:21:04.409
Well done.

00:21:04.493 --> 00:21:06.203
Well done, Eun-jo.

00:21:07.621 --> 00:21:09.539
You did a great job, my baby.

00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:24.596
Eun-jo.

00:21:25.222 --> 00:21:26.556
Eun-jo.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.937
You must have heard that Eun-jo woke up.

00:21:32.854 --> 00:21:33.939
Yes.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.234
You must be Eun-jo's brother.

00:21:37.317 --> 00:21:41.029
Yes. Eun-jo is still in the palace.
She isn't well enough to walk yet.

00:21:41.113 --> 00:21:42.823
Only her mother is home now.

00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:47.285
I've been staying away
so she can focus on recovering.

00:21:48.912 --> 00:21:50.956
I'll come back another time then.

00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:01.508
Again?

00:22:02.092 --> 00:22:03.343
Don't hurt your ankle.

00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:24.197
Are you all right?

00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:27.159
Yes, thank you.

00:22:30.453 --> 00:22:31.454
It's you.

00:22:31.538 --> 00:22:33.248
The scholar from that night.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.833
No.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:36.668
I'm sure it's you.

00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:39.337
Did you know Eun-jo was Gil-dong--

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.216
I'm supposed to know nothing.

00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:45.844
Why?

00:22:45.927 --> 00:22:48.722
Because that's my role in this family.

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:51.641
The more I know,

00:22:51.725 --> 00:22:54.728
the more I will worry Eun-jo
and her mother.

00:23:05.906 --> 00:23:07.115
I cooled it down.

00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:10.243
I can eat it myself.

00:23:10.327 --> 00:23:11.995
Didn't you hear what the physician said?

00:23:12.078 --> 00:23:13.747
You're not supposed to do anything.

00:23:16.208 --> 00:23:17.626
I just feel bad.

00:23:18.627 --> 00:23:20.921
The king's hands are not meant for this.

00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:23.924
And that king's hands are getting tired.

00:23:26.635 --> 00:23:27.510
Open up.

00:23:38.647 --> 00:23:42.025
You keep saying you feel bad.
I even moved you to my old residence.

00:23:44.277 --> 00:23:47.697
I wanted to keep you in my bedchamber.

00:23:50.575 --> 00:23:51.409
Open up.

00:23:54.913 --> 00:23:56.206
Good girl.

00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:04.089
Let's get some air after you finish this.

00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:07.342
I don't think I can walk yet.

00:24:07.425 --> 00:24:09.094
I'm not asking you to walk.

00:24:13.098 --> 00:24:14.975
I'm doing the walking for you.
Isn't this nice?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.019
Physically, yes.

00:24:18.103 --> 00:24:20.897
Is it uncomfortable? Is it my back?

00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:22.190
No.

00:24:22.274 --> 00:24:24.693
Your back is broad and steady.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.989
{\an8}Let's go inside.

00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:31.449
I'll take you inside once you fall asleep.

00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:34.577
Sleep? Here?

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:36.288
Yes, right there.

00:24:37.122 --> 00:24:40.208
On my broad and steady back.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.145
It's like a miracle
she's smiling like that right now.

00:25:01.396 --> 00:25:02.689
Maybe it's the power of love.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.902
Do you believe in such a thing?

00:25:07.986 --> 00:25:09.863
I'm starting to.

00:25:09.946 --> 00:25:12.240
Watching these two
has made me want to believe it.

00:25:19.456 --> 00:25:21.583
Is there something on my face?

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.543
It's strange.

00:25:24.127 --> 00:25:27.756
The men I know
seem like different people these days.

00:25:29.758 --> 00:25:30.759
Pardon?

00:25:31.968 --> 00:25:33.470
I'm just saying.

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:35.430
I should get going.

00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:37.265
Aren't you going to meet them?

00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:38.308
What's wrong?

00:25:39.476 --> 00:25:41.478
They weren't switched again, were they?

00:25:43.897 --> 00:25:45.106
Something's strange.

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:47.317
I wonder why we weren't switched.

00:25:47.984 --> 00:25:49.027
Right.

00:25:51.613 --> 00:25:54.115
What happened to your bracelet?

00:25:54.199 --> 00:25:55.950
Right. Where did it go?

00:25:56.659 --> 00:25:58.411
I didn't even realize I lost it.

00:25:59.496 --> 00:26:00.455
That night,

00:26:01.456 --> 00:26:04.042
something felt off,
and I tore my bracelet off.

00:26:04.667 --> 00:26:06.086
It was glowing faintly.

00:26:07.504 --> 00:26:08.338
No way.

00:26:08.922 --> 00:26:11.549
I bet there are thousands of people
wearing bracelets like that.

00:26:12.967 --> 00:26:15.178
That's why I never suspected it either.

00:26:16.304 --> 00:26:17.347
Maybe I was mistaken.

00:26:19.933 --> 00:26:21.184
Maybe the rule broke.

00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:30.985
It's a good thing.

00:26:31.736 --> 00:26:34.072
It means we probably
won't be switching anymore.

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:46.584
I don't like it.

00:26:47.627 --> 00:26:49.212
Then, even if you're in danger,

00:26:49.879 --> 00:26:51.548
I can't step in for you anymore.

00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:20.994
He's awake!

00:27:22.954 --> 00:27:25.582
You heard that now?
Physician Hong woke up a long time ago.

00:27:25.665 --> 00:27:27.417
No, not Physician Hong.

00:27:31.254 --> 00:27:32.172
Im Sa-hyeong?

00:27:35.216 --> 00:27:37.510
Take Im Sa-hyeong
to the Interrogation Hall at once.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.679
Your Majesty.

00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:43.183
The criminal had a message
for Physician Hong.

00:27:43.266 --> 00:27:44.893
- How dare he?
- And the message goes…

00:27:46.394 --> 00:27:48.313
"The revenge

00:27:48.938 --> 00:27:49.856
isn't over yet."

00:27:53.151 --> 00:27:54.235
I can't let you do that.

00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:56.154
I won't let you.

00:27:56.237 --> 00:27:58.406
And if what Im Sa-hyeong said was true,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.074
you shouldn't,

00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:01.784
for your father's sake.

00:28:02.744 --> 00:28:03.745
That's exactly why

00:28:04.412 --> 00:28:05.330
I should do this.

00:28:47.163 --> 00:28:48.706
Finally, I got a reply.

00:28:51.668 --> 00:28:52.877
Am I getting poison?

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:57.006
Physicians don't make poison.

00:28:59.884 --> 00:29:02.178
Their job is to save people.

00:29:17.694 --> 00:29:20.989
As you already know,
you're not a nobleman.

00:29:23.783 --> 00:29:26.619
{\an8}It's been a while
since you were brought down to my station.

00:29:26.703 --> 00:29:27.704
{\an8}SLAVE

00:29:38.548 --> 00:29:40.174
Now, let me ask you a question.

00:29:41.301 --> 00:29:44.679
Are you now a lowly, worthless man?

00:29:46.472 --> 00:29:49.142
Have you thrown away your own worth?

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:02.280
I think not.

00:30:03.656 --> 00:30:04.741
You must not.

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:15.168
The world doesn't decide your worth.

00:30:16.753 --> 00:30:18.755
You do.

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:50.411
"Everyone is precious."

00:30:50.495 --> 00:30:53.331
For the sake of the man
who held that belief,

00:30:53.414 --> 00:30:56.125
I will lay aside my anger.

00:31:06.052 --> 00:31:08.721
I can only hope that giving up revenge

00:31:09.555 --> 00:31:13.101
lives up to what my father taught me.

00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:25.113
You win.

00:31:37.375 --> 00:31:39.043
Min-jik…

00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:43.756
perhaps you were right.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.658
We're having trouble
finding Im Sa-hyeong's body in the sea.

00:32:14.162 --> 00:32:15.913
He was a coward until the end.

00:32:18.332 --> 00:32:19.333
Have his belongings

00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:21.502
sent to Im Jae-i.

00:32:43.066 --> 00:32:45.109
The name of the dead person is missing.

00:32:47.153 --> 00:32:48.863
He spent his whole life

00:32:50.156 --> 00:32:51.908
trying to make a name for himself.

00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:55.995
I will send him off quietly.

00:32:58.206 --> 00:33:00.500
Someone's here to see you.

00:33:09.884 --> 00:33:11.135
How is Hong Eun-jo?

00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:14.388
How is she doing?

00:33:16.015 --> 00:33:17.141
She's doing much better now.

00:33:21.229 --> 00:33:22.063
So, you're leaving.

00:33:24.607 --> 00:33:25.483
Yes.

00:33:33.825 --> 00:33:35.284
My mother was a courtesan.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.583
All my life, I kept my low birth hidden.

00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:44.627
And I never let myself

00:33:45.378 --> 00:33:47.338
get attached to anyone in the house.

00:33:48.756 --> 00:33:50.675
What's that on your face?

00:33:51.217 --> 00:33:52.927
Then I saw Hong Eun-jo.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.805
I did not try to act like his sister.

00:33:56.681 --> 00:33:57.765
I simply

00:33:58.182 --> 00:33:59.892
followed my heart.

00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:03.938
Unlike me, who concealed my true standing,

00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:06.524
she was fighting back bravely.

00:34:10.236 --> 00:34:12.363
I think it began with me feeling inferior.

00:34:13.656 --> 00:34:16.075
Perhaps I needed my misery
to mean something,

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.536
and that's why I was so mean
to Hong Eun-jo.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:22.373
I don't know.

00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:25.668
Hong Eun-jo said she owed you a lot.

00:34:28.588 --> 00:34:30.715
She also said she hasn't paid it back yet.

00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.804
She has.

00:34:39.432 --> 00:34:40.641
More than I deserve.

00:34:46.898 --> 00:34:49.025
I will take my leave
without saying farewell.

00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:55.114
Wherever you go,
don't push yourself too hard.

00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:04.582
I'm saying this,

00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:06.459
ranks and titles aside.

00:35:15.218 --> 00:35:16.552
You'd better keep her smiling.

00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:19.555
Make her cry, and I'll return at once.

00:35:41.035 --> 00:35:43.371
{\an8}Young Master, where are we going?

00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.123
{\an8}I haven't decided.

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:48.042
We'll see how it goes.

00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:51.003
Are you sure you won't regret
just leaving like this?

00:35:52.213 --> 00:35:53.297
Yes.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.259
I left everything behind.

00:35:57.134 --> 00:35:58.386
Everything.

00:36:05.977 --> 00:36:07.353
Mother,

00:36:07.436 --> 00:36:08.938
where's my robe?

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.825
Daughter of Hong Min-jik.
this is the command of the Inner Court.

00:36:26.038 --> 00:36:27.206
I was informed that

00:36:27.873 --> 00:36:30.501
Joseon has become barren
under corrupt officials.

00:36:33.921 --> 00:36:35.923
Order the provincial offices
to cut their staff

00:36:36.007 --> 00:36:38.342
and remove all officials
who extort the people,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.554
and find ways to grant tax exemptions

00:36:41.637 --> 00:36:43.222
on uncultivated fields.

00:36:43.306 --> 00:36:45.850
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:36:46.892 --> 00:36:47.893
Your Majesty,

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:50.271
I have a request.

00:36:51.397 --> 00:36:52.523
I'm listening.

00:36:52.606 --> 00:36:55.026
I humbly advise
that the royal marriage be expedited.

00:36:56.193 --> 00:36:57.486
There will be no royal marriage.

00:36:59.488 --> 00:37:00.573
I am

00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:03.117
not marrying any woman.

00:37:04.493 --> 00:37:05.536
Hong-si.

00:37:05.619 --> 00:37:07.413
Finally, I get to meet you.

00:37:08.706 --> 00:37:09.707
I apologize.

00:37:11.208 --> 00:37:12.376
You've been through a lot.

00:37:13.127 --> 00:37:14.754
I have much to say,

00:37:14.837 --> 00:37:17.298
but today I will speak
only what must be said.

00:37:18.382 --> 00:37:19.342
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:37:19.967 --> 00:37:22.511
Soon, the king will choose his consort.

00:37:23.429 --> 00:37:24.722
As you probably know,

00:37:25.389 --> 00:37:28.059
your name cannot be put
on the selection list.

00:37:30.394 --> 00:37:31.437
However,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.273
we can take you into the Inner Court
as a royal concubine.

00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:39.111
Does it upset you
that he must take a consort first?

00:37:40.029 --> 00:37:41.280
It would be delightful

00:37:41.364 --> 00:37:43.866
to live as a royal concubine
in the palace.

00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:46.202
However…

00:37:47.328 --> 00:37:48.329
However?

00:37:51.582 --> 00:37:54.377
I have things to do outside the palace.

00:37:55.044 --> 00:37:58.964
Is this because of Min-jik's daughter
who was staying in the palace?

00:37:59.048 --> 00:38:02.259
Right now, I'm here as a king, not a man.

00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:06.222
Is it for the Crown Prince?

00:38:09.892 --> 00:38:12.812
It was called an abdication,
but it was closer to a deposition.

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.147
In a single night,

00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:17.274
he became the son of a disgraced man.

00:38:18.401 --> 00:38:20.736
His heart must be deeply unsettled.

00:38:21.737 --> 00:38:24.573
I will not let the boy
grow up in confusion.

00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:29.954
We have all seen
how a child growing up like that

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.915
can turn him into a tyrant.

00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:34.834
We've all experienced it.

00:38:36.794 --> 00:38:38.003
Your Majesty.

00:38:38.671 --> 00:38:40.714
- But--
- The marriage will produce an heir,

00:38:40.798 --> 00:38:42.299
who will depose the Crown Prince.

00:38:42.383 --> 00:38:43.968
Is that what you want?

00:38:44.635 --> 00:38:48.139
Your Majesty,
Her Majesty the Queen Dowager has arrived.

00:38:55.479 --> 00:38:56.605
Mother.

00:39:12.538 --> 00:39:14.290
Where are you going, leaving me behind?

00:39:26.802 --> 00:39:28.762
I will come back another time.

00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:31.182
You must've heard about it.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.434
- The marriage--
- I know.

00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:36.061
I was prepared for this too

00:39:36.854 --> 00:39:38.939
when I decided to change the future.

00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:41.859
Same here.

00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:44.028
I was prepared for this too

00:39:45.279 --> 00:39:46.989
ever since I decided to be the king.

00:39:48.908 --> 00:39:50.951
Right now, I'm the king of Joseon,

00:39:51.535 --> 00:39:53.621
and a king's duty
is to protect his people.

00:39:57.166 --> 00:39:59.168
As one of them,
I feel reassured to hear that.

00:40:04.465 --> 00:40:05.466
Then, now,

00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:08.427
listen to me as a woman,
not one of the people.

00:40:09.762 --> 00:40:10.930
I'm speaking as a man,

00:40:12.097 --> 00:40:13.641
not a king.

00:40:30.824 --> 00:40:31.951
Please wait for me

00:40:34.703 --> 00:40:36.455
until the only thing I must protect

00:40:37.665 --> 00:40:39.250
is my woman,

00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:44.588
and until I can finally dream

00:40:46.632 --> 00:40:48.008
of being with you.

00:41:02.523 --> 00:41:03.691
I'll wear them then.

00:41:04.692 --> 00:41:05.526
Wear what?

00:41:06.569 --> 00:41:07.653
My silk shoes.

00:41:08.862 --> 00:41:10.072
Your silk shoes?

00:41:15.202 --> 00:41:16.787
The silk shoes that

00:41:18.497 --> 00:41:19.582
I never got to wear.

00:41:29.717 --> 00:41:31.802
When you come to me as an ordinary man,

00:41:32.636 --> 00:41:34.305
I'll run to you in them.

00:41:37.391 --> 00:41:39.685
I want you to just stand still then.

00:41:40.477 --> 00:41:42.605
Because I'll run to you as fast as I can.

00:41:57.328 --> 00:41:59.580
Im Sa-hyeong attempted
to assassinate His Majesty,

00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:02.082
but Hong Min-jik's daughter

00:42:02.166 --> 00:42:03.959
threw herself in the way to stop him.

00:42:06.503 --> 00:42:08.213
They saved each other's lives.

00:42:09.632 --> 00:42:11.425
Their love is incredible.

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:14.470
I wonder,

00:42:15.679 --> 00:42:16.597
what if you and I

00:42:23.354 --> 00:42:24.813
were like

00:42:26.023 --> 00:42:27.691
Yeol and Min-jik's daughter?

00:42:30.611 --> 00:42:32.321
Would things have been different?

00:42:39.745 --> 00:42:40.746
Do you regret it?

00:42:58.347 --> 00:42:59.890
I will come back some other time.

00:42:59.973 --> 00:43:01.433
You should stop coming here.

00:43:04.269 --> 00:43:06.480
No, I will come back.

00:43:07.398 --> 00:43:08.857
I will make sure you see me,

00:43:08.941 --> 00:43:12.444
beautiful and dazzling,
for the rest of your life.

00:43:13.654 --> 00:43:14.947
And you will live with regret

00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:17.616
until the day you die.

00:43:22.079 --> 00:43:23.622
This is your punishment

00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:25.916
from your loyal wife.

00:43:41.306 --> 00:43:42.433
I will.

00:43:45.686 --> 00:43:47.813
I'll spend the rest of my life…

00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:55.112
drowning in regret.

00:44:06.123 --> 00:44:07.875
How could you side with the flatterer?

00:44:09.626 --> 00:44:11.170
I hope you pay for this!

00:44:13.297 --> 00:44:14.923
What are you doing? Go away.

00:44:15.007 --> 00:44:18.385
It's my duty
to deliver the criminal alive to exile.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.346
For the sins
you've committed in this world,

00:44:22.014 --> 00:44:23.640
you shall pay dearly in this world.

00:44:24.391 --> 00:44:25.267
That way,

00:44:25.893 --> 00:44:27.853
you will suffer less in the next world.

00:44:32.024 --> 00:44:33.066
I will

00:44:34.193 --> 00:44:36.987
gladly pay for what I did.

00:44:46.497 --> 00:44:47.998
All right!

00:44:48.081 --> 00:44:49.833
Look here.

00:44:49.917 --> 00:44:53.504
No-eul brought the best liquor
in the courtesan's house.

00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:56.215
- Let's drink together.
- To Eun-jo's return!

00:45:05.098 --> 00:45:06.808
I've always wondered,

00:45:07.601 --> 00:45:10.270
how did you two know she was Gil-dong?

00:45:11.271 --> 00:45:13.273
- Right.
- It was that night.

00:45:13.357 --> 00:45:15.442
The night you fell from the roof.

00:45:15.526 --> 00:45:18.737
We found you
and put you back where you were.

00:45:19.488 --> 00:45:22.366
Oh, then!

00:45:23.492 --> 00:45:24.952
That wasn't me, but anyway…

00:45:27.496 --> 00:45:29.540
So, what's happening with His Majesty?

00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:31.041
Mind your own business!

00:45:31.124 --> 00:45:32.751
Stay out of her personal life.

00:45:33.877 --> 00:45:34.836
Wait.

00:45:36.505 --> 00:45:38.632
What about your personal life?

00:45:38.715 --> 00:45:40.842
You should make up your mind now.

00:45:40.926 --> 00:45:41.969
Is it me or this wretch?

00:45:45.097 --> 00:45:46.139
Make up your mind.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.850
We are not meant

00:45:48.934 --> 00:45:50.018
to share one woman.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.825
My lady!

00:46:17.588 --> 00:46:19.214
Where should I put this?

00:46:21.216 --> 00:46:22.384
Why does he sound friendly?

00:46:22.467 --> 00:46:24.928
Deok-jung, you brought it.

00:46:25.846 --> 00:46:27.306
You can just leave it there.

00:46:28.473 --> 00:46:30.183
Did you just change the way you speak?

00:46:30.851 --> 00:46:32.269
- Since when?
- Since when?

00:46:33.145 --> 00:46:35.647
Deok-jung, have you eaten yet?

00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:37.524
Seeing you is enough for me.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.110
What did you say?

00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:42.195
What are you guys doing?

00:46:42.863 --> 00:46:43.697
HWALBIN

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.407
Now go. Stop bargaining.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.742
Have a good day.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.244
Mister.

00:46:50.787 --> 00:46:52.664
Are there any herbs to deliver today?

00:46:53.582 --> 00:46:56.418
Why do you always come here
to work after your shift?

00:46:56.501 --> 00:46:59.755
The people at the leper camp
are always out gathering herbs.

00:46:59.838 --> 00:47:00.797
I want to help.

00:47:01.423 --> 00:47:02.841
I'll watch the shop.

00:47:02.924 --> 00:47:03.884
So now,

00:47:03.967 --> 00:47:06.178
go deliver the herbs. Come on.

00:47:06.928 --> 00:47:08.263
All right, fine.

00:47:08.347 --> 00:47:10.015
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

00:47:43.799 --> 00:47:44.841
How may I help you?

00:47:55.352 --> 00:47:57.062
Is there a man you hold dear?

00:47:59.398 --> 00:48:01.817
Why do you ask, if I may know?

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.652
Are you satisfied with him?

00:48:03.735 --> 00:48:05.195
Do you have any complaints?

00:48:05.278 --> 00:48:06.697
I'm just

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.490
checking in, so to speak.

00:48:09.408 --> 00:48:11.118
That woman already has someone.

00:48:13.537 --> 00:48:14.663
Someone?

00:48:14.746 --> 00:48:15.747
Who's that?

00:48:17.541 --> 00:48:19.835
If you knew who I was,
you'd be quite surprised.

00:48:20.419 --> 00:48:21.878
Because I am

00:48:21.962 --> 00:48:23.755
of pretty high standing.

00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:28.593
Well, I come
from a pretty high place myself.

00:48:32.514 --> 00:48:34.141
You look familiar somehow.

00:48:35.142 --> 00:48:36.184
Have we met before?

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.521
I'll come back.

00:48:47.279 --> 00:48:48.447
What's he saying?

00:48:49.239 --> 00:48:51.324
Hong Eun-jo,
don't let that man come here again.

00:48:52.743 --> 00:48:54.202
Are you out on secret inspection?

00:48:54.953 --> 00:48:56.329
I'm inspecting the six ministries,

00:48:56.872 --> 00:48:58.457
and having a secret date while I'm out.

00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:00.417
- A secret date?
- Yes.

00:49:01.084 --> 00:49:02.169
Get ready.

00:49:02.252 --> 00:49:03.879
You're joining me.

00:49:06.757 --> 00:49:09.593
So this is where kings have secret dates.

00:49:10.427 --> 00:49:12.053
There's no one here,

00:49:12.137 --> 00:49:13.513
and no one can come here.

00:49:13.597 --> 00:49:15.140
The royal villa where my father stayed

00:49:15.223 --> 00:49:17.142
to recover in his later years
is near here.

00:49:18.435 --> 00:49:21.229
I always loved coming here as a kid.

00:49:22.522 --> 00:49:25.734
Outside the palace,
we could just be a family.

00:49:28.945 --> 00:49:31.364
That must be why you look so natural

00:49:31.448 --> 00:49:33.241
when rowing the boat.

00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:38.914
That's because

00:49:38.997 --> 00:49:40.791
I came here often even after I grew up.

00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:44.377
You can't row like this
without experience, you know.

00:49:45.837 --> 00:49:47.714
Oh, I see.

00:49:48.465 --> 00:49:51.218
So, were you here with a woman then?

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.512
No, it's my first time.

00:49:53.595 --> 00:49:55.847
It is your first time, with me.

00:49:56.431 --> 00:49:57.599
It's really my first time

00:49:57.682 --> 00:49:58.683
with a woman.

00:50:01.353 --> 00:50:02.479
That's too bad.

00:50:02.562 --> 00:50:05.607
It's not my first time being here.

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.400
What? Who were you with?

00:50:08.151 --> 00:50:09.236
A man?

00:50:12.072 --> 00:50:13.281
What's that wretch's name?

00:50:13.365 --> 00:50:14.741
Which family?

00:50:16.493 --> 00:50:17.702
He's not a wretch.

00:50:18.286 --> 00:50:19.621
He's a kid.

00:50:19.704 --> 00:50:20.789
It was when I was little.

00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:06.960
He woke up.

00:51:07.043 --> 00:51:08.378
Eun-jo.

00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:10.922
Eun-jo!

00:51:11.464 --> 00:51:12.632
Even back then,

00:51:12.716 --> 00:51:15.343
I was always scolded for being nosy.

00:51:15.427 --> 00:51:16.845
Eun-jo.

00:51:18.346 --> 00:51:19.931
You can go home on your own, right?

00:51:20.015 --> 00:51:21.182
I've got to go.

00:51:22.642 --> 00:51:25.186
So I saved him and left him.

00:51:28.732 --> 00:51:32.485
It looked like he fell into the water
while playing with a leaf boat.

00:51:34.988 --> 00:51:36.698
I wonder if he's doing all right.

00:51:41.369 --> 00:51:42.621
Well, what do you think?

00:51:43.496 --> 00:51:44.748
What do you mean?

00:51:44.831 --> 00:51:45.916
I'm doing all right.

00:51:50.712 --> 00:51:51.755
It was me.

00:51:57.218 --> 00:51:58.637
I woke up at the Royal Villa.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.806
Apparently, someone saved me
and carried me to the shore.

00:52:02.641 --> 00:52:04.309
So what you said earlier…

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.232
I followed my lord there.

00:52:12.067 --> 00:52:15.278
I was waiting for him on the shore
while he was working.

00:52:16.947 --> 00:52:20.283
He was probably there
to visit my father in the royal villa.

00:52:23.745 --> 00:52:25.830
What a funny coincidence.

00:52:25.914 --> 00:52:27.958
I guess it was always our destiny.

00:52:29.334 --> 00:52:30.168
Destiny?

00:52:31.002 --> 00:52:33.630
And of course, my wish played a role too.

00:52:35.674 --> 00:52:38.176
First, destiny, and now your wish?

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.806
What did you wish for?

00:52:44.849 --> 00:52:46.309
Well, obviously,

00:52:46.393 --> 00:52:48.144
I don't care about the next life.

00:52:50.188 --> 00:52:51.398
I wished that…

00:52:58.113 --> 00:53:00.490
I could be with you in this life.

00:53:04.202 --> 00:53:06.454
Why are you even
talking about the next life?

00:53:09.582 --> 00:53:10.792
The next life?

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:13.878
The next life?

00:53:15.046 --> 00:53:17.590
Wait, that sounds

00:53:18.341 --> 00:53:19.926
oddly familiar.

00:53:22.429 --> 00:53:23.263
The sky lantern!

00:53:23.346 --> 00:53:24.639
My… What?

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:27.684
You read my wish, didn't you?

00:53:29.686 --> 00:53:31.396
Since things turned out this way,

00:53:32.313 --> 00:53:35.984
I wish to be someone who can enjoy
music and dance in my next life.

00:53:36.067 --> 00:53:38.778
Come on. Make your own wish.
You're spoiling mine.

00:53:38.862 --> 00:53:39.738
Take that back.

00:53:39.821 --> 00:53:41.489
I can't just take it back.

00:53:41.573 --> 00:53:43.158
Ask the god.

00:53:43.241 --> 00:53:44.325
Which god?

00:53:44.409 --> 00:53:45.744
God who?

00:53:47.412 --> 00:53:49.873
Some god must be hearing this.

00:53:52.417 --> 00:53:54.753
You have an impressive memory, kiddo.

00:54:00.008 --> 00:54:01.718
What are you looking for?

00:54:02.385 --> 00:54:04.929
Anything that would help me find
who saved my life.

00:54:05.013 --> 00:54:07.724
Why? So you can pay them back?

00:54:11.603 --> 00:54:12.437
Yes.

00:54:14.439 --> 00:54:16.149
How will you pay them back?

00:54:16.232 --> 00:54:18.026
By saving their life,
like they saved mine.

00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:20.320
Will you really do that?

00:54:21.446 --> 00:54:22.989
I'm a man.

00:54:23.656 --> 00:54:24.699
A strong man.

00:54:26.201 --> 00:54:29.079
I see. We'll see if it's just a bluff.

00:54:29.662 --> 00:54:32.040
I wasn't going to ask,
but what's your name?

00:54:32.874 --> 00:54:34.167
I don't have a name.

00:54:35.085 --> 00:54:36.294
I'm just an old man.

00:54:37.545 --> 00:54:39.255
An old man from the moon.

00:54:41.674 --> 00:54:43.551
I guess I do have a pretty memorable look.

00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:48.014
This is my problem.

00:54:48.098 --> 00:54:50.892
This is why I always
have to change how I look.

00:55:19.504 --> 00:55:21.172
I know he's my own child,

00:55:21.256 --> 00:55:22.590
but he's really something.

00:55:22.674 --> 00:55:26.553
He carries out all his duties perfectly,
yet still makes time

00:55:26.636 --> 00:55:28.096
to see the woman he loves.

00:55:29.013 --> 00:55:31.099
I know that better than anyone.

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:36.437
Thanks to that, I'm working day and night.

00:55:39.107 --> 00:55:40.316
Your Majesty!

00:55:46.823 --> 00:55:47.740
You little rascal.

00:55:48.366 --> 00:55:49.617
I told you to call me Uncle.

00:55:50.535 --> 00:55:51.619
If I do that,

00:55:52.412 --> 00:55:54.622
my mother will scold me.

00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:04.257
You can do that in front of me.

00:56:04.924 --> 00:56:06.342
Yes, Uncle.

00:56:07.302 --> 00:56:08.553
Ban,

00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:10.930
let the world know how bright you are.

00:56:11.014 --> 00:56:12.682
Look at the world with all your heart

00:56:12.765 --> 00:56:13.892
and shine your brightest.

00:56:15.685 --> 00:56:16.728
You're allowed to do that.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.563
Yes, Uncle.

00:56:20.231 --> 00:56:21.441
One more thing.

00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:23.735
Eat a lot.

00:56:23.818 --> 00:56:26.237
Grow big and strong
so I can pass the throne to you.

00:56:26.988 --> 00:56:29.365
What will you do then?

00:56:31.826 --> 00:56:32.911
I will have

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.956
someone to greet.

00:56:42.795 --> 00:56:43.963
And…

00:57:24.254 --> 00:57:25.421
And…

00:57:27.298 --> 00:57:29.551
I will stand before you just as a man.

00:57:39.269 --> 00:57:42.772
I will welcome you with all my heart
when you come running to me.

00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:49.904
And then,

00:57:52.365 --> 00:57:54.284
I will greet you warmly.

00:58:01.624 --> 00:58:02.709
"Hello."

00:58:03.418 --> 00:58:04.335
"My dream,

00:58:05.962 --> 00:58:07.297
my savior

00:58:08.631 --> 00:58:09.549
and my lover."

00:58:15.096 --> 00:58:17.640
- My beloved thief.
- My beloved thief.

00:58:23.605 --> 00:58:26.149
{\an8}THE EPILOGUE WILL BEGIN SHORTLY

00:59:40.056 --> 00:59:43.309
This artifact was found in a royal tomb.

00:59:44.727 --> 00:59:48.398
It is thought to have belonged
to the Grand Prince's wife.

00:59:48.481 --> 00:59:52.318
At the time of excavation,
it was found wrapped in high-quality silk,

00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:55.822
suggesting a deep affection between them.

00:59:56.739 --> 00:59:58.533
We'll move on to the next exhibit.

01:01:05.808 --> 01:01:07.810
