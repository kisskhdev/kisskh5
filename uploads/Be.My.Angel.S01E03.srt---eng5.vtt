Jin.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.040
He's my connection No. 1.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.540
I think I know who you're looking for.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.960
There's no one else.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.280
Why are you here talking about angels?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.760
That's nonsense.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.440
That heavy wolf cut is so last decade.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.480
- Shit!
- Shit!

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.680
Aren't you curious

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.200
why everyone suddenly
saw you as weird-looking?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.800
Tell your friend to record them
and send them back to me.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.800
"You secretly got my head in the clouds."

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.120
That poem just suddenly felt familiar.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.040
Hello?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.160
Hello, Miss Clare.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.080
Do you have time?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.880
Hey,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
who said you can call?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.840
I'm too busy to talk, alright?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.040
That's why I sent a text.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.080
Just reply to that.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400
I'm sorry.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.320
Miss Clare, do you happen to know

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.680
who sent the demo of this song?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.720
I don't know.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.880
The intern who took in the demo

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.160
already quit.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.120
That's all I can help you with.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.000
Bye.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.350
- What?
- What?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.440
Where do we go from here?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.140
Let's give it another try.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.640
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.279
♫Your smile almost got me on the ground♫

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.520
How was it?
Did anything come to mind?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.760
No matter how many times I listen to this song,
it still sounds like your voice.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.360
Why doesn't it ring a bell?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.240
I'm so useless.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.280
Sorry, Jane.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.340
It's fine.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.920
How about this?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.720
Close your eyes.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.460
Close them!

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.960
Now, do as I say.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.600
Inhale.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Exhale.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.600
And think of it as the song's playing.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.040
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.640
♫Your smile almost got me on the ground♫

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.080
How was it?

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.600
Does that ring a bell?

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.960
I don't even have a heart anymore,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.120
so why does it feel like it's still beating?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.600
Does it jog your memory?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.560
Not at all.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.760
What kind of angel
can't remember their past life?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.720
Nothing came to mind?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.480
I'm so sorry, Jane.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.159
I'll try harder.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.120
It's okay.

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.320
I'll go to bed now, then.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.280
Goodnight!

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.159
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.280
♫Your smile...♫

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.200
Aren't you going to bed?

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.520
I forgot that you never have to.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:22.920
That's right.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.520
I'm your angel.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.920
If I went to sleep,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.480
who'd take care of you?

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.960
Am I right?

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.760
Wow!

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.919
How totally safe I am,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.159
having a milk-breath angel
protecting me.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.080
I'm going back to bed, then.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.280
Okay.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.040
Why did you take me here?

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.120
If I could help it,
I wouldn't have brought you here,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.720
but I had no choice.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.400
As of now, our six degrees of separation

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.440
started with Jin.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.180
He led us to Clare,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.920
who gave us a clue:

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.360
the demo.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.680
Unfortunately,
she doesn't know who sent it,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.240
so we’ll have to start over

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.760
with someone close to me.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.210
And the person who probably knows

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.800
the most people
in the music industry is

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.400
Tom, my former boss.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.560
That's not six anymore.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.840
It still is!

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.520
It's just that we have to
go back to square one.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560
You're making things up.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960
I'm not.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.000
Stuff like this happens.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.280
Come on, let's go.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.920
- Oh!
- Oh...

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.440
I'm sorry.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.520
It's all good.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.640
Do you work here?

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.200
I don't. I just interned here before.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.040
I see...

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.920
Okay, then.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280
That's a pirate!

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.000
You're in a pirate costume today.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.520
What...

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.920
Didn’t you say
you were gonna be your own boss?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.880
Have you finally
come crawling back to me?

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.660
Oh!

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.920
I brought some shio pans for you to try.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.120
After I quit,
I started my shio pan business.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.000
- For me to try?
- Of course.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.600
Pretty good.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.160
They're good, but don't sell well,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.000
bad enough that you had to come back?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.160
Actually, the sales are amazing.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.360
But I do need your help
with something else.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.640
Called it.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.320
It's about this friend of mine.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.200
What?

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.200
Please try listening to this song.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:14.320
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:20.960
♫Your smile almost got me on the ground♫

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.720
Have you ever heard it before?

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.320
Nuh-uh.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.880
I've never heard
this person's voice before.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.080
What?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880
Alright, alright.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.840
I'll find a way to help you then,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.000
but I have a lot on my plate right now.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.400
Can you two give me a hand first?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.680
Of course.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.960
What do you want me to do?

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.800
Here's the thing...

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.280
This is Master Satanfah.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.120
He's the most precise, unmatched
fortune teller this year.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.360
I couldn't find his contact info.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.920
I want to invite him to my show,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.280
but he believes that...

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.360
only when fate smiles and luck favors you
will we all come together.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.240
- When fate smiles on you, luck favors you.
- When fate smiles on you, luck favors you.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.640
In short, he doesn't have a manager

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.120
or any contact info.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.000
So if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.280
Get it?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.160
Based on how your friend dresses

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.870
and that confidence,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.280
I think she'd go well with him.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.060
I don't wanna go anywhere anymore.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.680
Even here, people look at me strangely.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.040
There, there. Don't be fussy, Milk Breath.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.040
Your drip is pretty fire.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.440
You even have a straw hat like in anime.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.440
Try dressing like me for once.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.120
Walking around in this
is so embarrassing.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.320
I've got an idea,
so you're not alone in this.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.960
By the way,

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.680
you're pretty invested in that outfit.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.160
Of course, I am.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.800
That way, you won't have
to be embarrassed alone.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.600
Anyways,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.200
what's the deal with Master Satanfah?

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.320
About love.

But I haven't said anything.

Hey, give me that!

She's researching about you, Master.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.080
She probably doesn't believe
you can read fortunes.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.520
For research, huh?!

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.200
See? She's really in disguise!

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.080
Yeah, I can see the wig.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.520
Take her out!

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560
I'm not reading her fortunes!

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.400
There you have it.
[Fortune-telling now closed]

Don't worry about it.

There you go.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.840
All done?

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.480
That's 30 people for the day.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.480
Alright, that's that.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.960
One moment, please.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.880
May I have a second of your time, Master?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.000
No, we already reached the 30-person limit.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.400
Isn't that right?

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.960
You're right.

you should've come yesterday.

Whoa!

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.800
I'm sorry...

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.360
I dragged you into this mess today.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.440
And it's...

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.440
for nothing.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.680
It's fine.

is pretty fun.

Hello, Tom?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.680
Jane,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.400
your shio pans are causing a mess now.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.120
What?

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.220
What's happening?

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.400
My office is no different from
a zombie apocalypse!

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.000
What you brought us wasn't nearly enough!

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.520
I'm placing an order for 50 shio pans

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.200
for tomorrow at my office!

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.680
We have 50 shio pans to make in one night!

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.440
Who could do it?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.100
Come on.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.080
Soon, if the business takes off,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.040
the orders might be overwhelming.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.800
What should I do?

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.120
Here.

Hey!

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.800
I think this will save you some time.

Yay!

You're amazing, Jane!

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.120
Wow...

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.440
Why did you push me away?

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.920
Tonight...

Go sleep outside.

I don't have to, you know.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.280
Just go outside.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.640
Close the door behind you.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.200
Are you okay?

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.020
Yep.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.560
Your mouth says yes, but your hands say no.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.960
This way, right?

We met her yesterday, didn't we?

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.760
She's probably an employee here.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.680
Right. Let's go.

- Bye.
- Okay.

What? Isn't she one of your employees?

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.600
But I've seen her at your office
for two days now.

That's possible?

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.040
Of course.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.300
These are the people I know
from the music industry.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.920
they'll get back to us.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.640
Has anyone gotten back to us?

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.000
I'm not spilling anything

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.440
unless you get Master Satanfah on my show.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.560
- What?
- What?

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.560
I bet no one has come forward
about anything.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.520
Actually, someone has.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.600
But a deal's a deal.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.120
I'm not doing this for free.

Just a flower vendor.

and the deity acknowledged that!

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.280
Unacceptable!

- I asked for four!
- Isn't that the lady who helped us?

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.360
- Why are there only three?
- Yeah.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.440
- Think of it this way,
- It's her!

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.720
imagine if you pray for something

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.800
- and promise a pig's head,
- She's being chewed out.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.200
but you show up with a fish head.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.720
What do you think would happen?
The deities would be mad!

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:33.560
They'd be enraged,
and I'd be damned! What am I gonna do?

No, I want what I asked for.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.920
I asked for four dancers.

I can dance.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.920
You can dance?

Yes, I was in a Thai traditional dance club.

- Yeah!

You lucked out.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.520
The last person who made me mad,
I stabbed them with my hair.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.920
They ended up in the hospital.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.360
Come on, let's make it four.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.480
Dance now.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.280
You're so lucky.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.240
Your girlfriend is
beautiful and talented.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.420
She's not my girlfriend.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.760
Really?

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:14.960
What?

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.640
Ask her out.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.720
You'd make a cute couple.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.920
It would be nice
if we could be girlfriends.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.320
How was that? Told you so.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.240
I didn't know you were this good
at traditional dance.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.260
You're amazing!

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.200
Sure am.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.800
You danced so beautifully.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.840
No wonder you made it into
the Thai traditional dance club.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.800
Without you, I'd be screwed.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.240
Oh, no problem at all!

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.280
Truly, when fate smiles on you,
luck favors you.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.960
I couldn't find his contact info.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.440
I want to invite him to my show,

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.600
but he believes that...

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.720
only when fate smiles and luck favors you
will we all come together.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.120
Now that fate smiles on us
and luck favors us,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.600
could I ask for a favor?

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.760
What a bummer!

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.560
Even with fate and luck on our side,

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.160
plus all that dancing and begging,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.520
this is all we got?

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.080
Come on.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.280
We did our best.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.120
If he doesn't want to be in the media,

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.640
there's nothing we can do.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.680
Just let it go.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.880
But this puts my whole plan on hold.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.260
By the way,

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.000
what does the card say?

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.360
Are you lucky?

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.880
I haven't looked at it yet.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.960
- "Your heart awaits right next to you,
- "Your heart awaits right next to you,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.880
- the dedicated soulmate who stays true."
- the dedicated soulmate who stays true."

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.080
I think...

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.040
I should call Tom.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.960
- Okay.
- Hey?

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.440
Can I ask you something?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.880
You know Tom, don't you?

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.800
Right, I do.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.760
I knew it.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.160
I've got the right one.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.560
You were the girl I met
in front of Tom's office.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.240
My...

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.880
My name is Tuck.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.000
I'm Tom's sister.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.880
Is there anything I can help you with?

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440
So...

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.160
Tom left our family a long time ago.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.440
We could never reach him.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.600
He never picked up when I called.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.040
Did you have an argument before then?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.840
If it's okay to ask...

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.640
It's just...

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.740
As you can see,

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.340
our family...

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.800
has run a traditional dance troupe
since my grandmother's time,

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.420
and...

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.480
most of us are women.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.440
Since Tom was a boy,
we never really knew what role to give him,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.840
so he didn't get much attention.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.200
He always said that he felt like...

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.720
a second-class citizen.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.360
"A second-class citizen"?

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.940
Alright, let's eat.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.800
Get me some rice.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.080
Eat now.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.320
Your exams are coming up.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.560
Thank you, Jin.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.520
Some people here

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.360
need to know their place
at the dining table.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.360
If you know you're of no use,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.400
don't eat so much.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.840
You'd better listen
to what I've taught you

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.720
so that you don't embarrass
yourself in public.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.120
People are going to think

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.280
I don't discipline you.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.400
Come on, eat.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.400
Don't cry, sweetie.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.680
Why does A-Mah hate me so much?

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.700
What did I ever do?

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.880
She doesn't hate you.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.520
She's just like that.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.640
Don't be sad, Jane.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.520
How could I not be?

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.400
My exams are coming up,

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.560
and all I get is bean sprouts and tofu.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.440
Jane, in this world,

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.760
you're not the only one in sorrow.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.760
Everyone struggles.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.960
Don't take it personally.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.440
Just live your life...

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.560
and you'll find happiness.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.600
It'd be great

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.500
if it were that easy.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.480
My mom felt guilty

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.720
for making her own son feel that way...

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.720
but by then it was too late to apologize.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.920
You failed your mission,
and you're still asking for my help.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.440
That's not really nice, is it?

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.480
I'm sorry, Tom.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.440
I did everything I could.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.660
Whatever.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.280
If you can't invite him to my show,

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.800
I'm not giving you his contact info.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.840
What now?

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.840
Tom.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.120
So...

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920
So?

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.320
I...

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.680
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.680
I forgive you.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.120
Thanks.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.280
Are you alright?

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.680
Here.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.600
What's that?

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.960
Isn't this what you're looking for?

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.000
It's the number of the person
who sent in the demo.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.680
Really?!

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.520
Try giving him a call.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.600
He owns a TV show,

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.080
so he might be busy.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.160
And...

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.720
What are you gonna do
about Master Satanfah?

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.300
Just forget him.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.240
If it's no, it's no.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.480
If fate laughs in my face
and luck doesn't favor me,

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.480
I don't know what else to do.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.760
I'll come up with new content.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.800
That's hilarious.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.920
Hey, little girl.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.680
She's your friend, right?

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.240
Yes.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.040
She's pretty fun to talk to.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:25.760
I like her.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.680
So talkative!

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.360
I thought she was about to go on stage
in this bold costume.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.320
Truly, this is when fate smiles at you
and luck favors you!

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.840
So, I've been thinking

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.500
about that show...

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.560
The show you want me on.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.560
I changed my mind.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.680
I met your friend,

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.080
and I can feel my chakra
growing stronger.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.920
What's that show called again?

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.960
It's '7 THINGS.'

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.240
'7 THINGS'?

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.640
Bring it on!

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.040
Come on, let's do it right now.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.600
- Come on.
- Right.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.720
Wait, wait.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440
Don't forget that

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.720
your heart awaits right next to you,

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.280
the dedicated soulmate who stays true.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.560
I'm heading out.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.760
Let's go.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.120
'7 THINGS.'

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.280
Now I get why he said that.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.760
You're in a Likay costume today.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.320
Miss and Z, take a look at this.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.320
Look at Z's score right now.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.120
I've got one condition.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.160
Shio pan, shio pan.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.720
Would you like some?

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.840
We got a customer!

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.280
What a dramatic prediction.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.760
Good luck.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.960
I hope you don't die

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.280
or move out.
