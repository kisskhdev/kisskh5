WEBVTT

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:30.302
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:35.014
CHARACTERS, EVENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:36.308
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.574
Chan, I saw a vapor trail earlier.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:56.661
But that made me want
to get on a plane to go see you.

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.290
Chan.

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:07.464
I love you.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.097
I love you, Chan.

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:52.341
EPISODE 2

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:55.387
The accident in the US
happened last summer, right?

00:01:56.263 --> 00:02:00.642
It has already been three months
since you came to Korea for treatment.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.354
Have you recalled any more memories
after our last session?

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:05.981
No.

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.776
I just keep

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:12.195
remembering one person.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:16.532
I keep remembering
how she called my name and woke me.

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:23.122
But no matter how much I try to remember,

00:02:23.123 --> 00:02:25.875
I can't recall who she is
or why I'm remembering her.

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.339
Do you get images of her
in certain situations?

00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:34.301
No, she's always just there.

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:37.929
She's buried in my brain,

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:41.641
just like that shrapnel.

00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:44.769
Could it be someone you met

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.189
during that year before the accident,
back when everything's a blur for you?

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.568
I've always been alone.

00:02:52.903 --> 00:02:56.030
There can't be anyone
who says they love me.

00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:03.246
I'm not even sure if she exists,

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:05.749
or if it's an illusion in my head.

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:07.542
Or…

00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:09.544
if I'm just crazy.

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:11.880
I wouldn't feel

00:03:12.798 --> 00:03:15.884
so frustrated if I at least knew that.

00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:20.680
What kind of person
does she feel like to you?

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:24.935
Someone I have to meet…

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:36.195
Sir, I'll just get off here.

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:44.287
Someone who brought me back to life

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:50.126
and seems to hold the keys to my life.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.326
Try listening to it.

00:05:05.327 --> 00:05:06.744
I saw a vapor trail earlier.

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:07.828
Chan.

00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:11.248
Hold on. Let me start over.

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:12.833
Try listening to it.

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.294
Hey, engineering student.

00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:16.128
Chan.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.255
Hey, Chan!

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.178
Hey. Sorry, Haran.

00:05:24.554 --> 00:05:26.306
Oh, that song?

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.432
Sure. Send it to me.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.392
I'll listen to it.

00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:40.277
I have to go in a hurry.

00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:43.280
Can you message her back
and say I have to go to the lab?

00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:45.283
Sorry. Do me a solid.

00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:48.410
Tsk.

00:05:49.496 --> 00:05:50.872
Tsk.

00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:04.260
Sorry, I'm heading to the lab.

00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:08.138
I was feeling trapped.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.225
I feel like I'm surrounded by walls today.

00:06:11.226 --> 00:06:14.603
I just messaged you
because I wanted to talk to someone.

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:17.524
But you're busy. Sorry I bothered you.

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:20.235
"Surrounded by walls"?

00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:23.279
I FEEL LIKE I'M SURROUNDED BY WALLS TODAY

00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:32.747
If it's okay with you,

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:35.959
you can talk to me.

00:06:37.794 --> 00:06:39.087
I'll be away for a few weeks.

00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:43.633
I'm traveling around the East Coast
during vacation.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.936
Hyeokchan,
you took my laptop.

00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:57.312
My research data is in there.

00:06:57.313 --> 00:06:59.606
I must've confused it with mine. Sorry.

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:00.983
I'll send you the data.

00:07:00.984 --> 00:07:02.985
- Just use my laptop for now.
- I…

00:07:05.572 --> 00:07:08.282
- How do I turn off that sound?
- The messenger alarm?

00:07:08.283 --> 00:07:10.242
Just mute it and ignore the messages

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:13.203
or tell her I'm at the lab.

00:07:13.204 --> 00:07:15.080
Anyway, send me your email address.

00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:16.165
Hey.

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.708
Kang Hyeokchan!

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.181
Chan.

00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:32.765
I love you.

00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:34.184
I love you,

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:36.727
Kang Hyeokchan.

00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:09.010
Seonu Chan… who are you?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.241
Oh.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.368
Gosh, my eyes are so dry.

00:08:34.369 --> 00:08:35.786
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:08:35.787 --> 00:08:38.664
It's not like I have some big secret.

00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:40.165
Dry eyes?

00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:44.211
You follow me around, take photos of me,
then send them to my office.

00:08:44.212 --> 00:08:45.880
Why are you stalking me?

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:49.091
- Stalking?
- I found an art museum ticket

00:08:49.092 --> 00:08:50.717
in your shirt,

00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:53.137
stamped with the date I went there.

00:08:53.138 --> 00:08:56.640
I did go to the art museum,
but I wasn't following you.

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.476
I just received a ticket.

00:09:00.353 --> 00:09:02.647
You're the one who called my name, right?

00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:07.067
My name and my face.

00:09:07.068 --> 00:09:08.570
You couldn't have known.

00:09:09.946 --> 00:09:11.990
I guess you gathered a lot of info
while stalking me.

00:09:13.032 --> 00:09:14.158
I…

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.703
I think this… will explain it.

00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:24.710
I always check my partners' websites
before working with them.

00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:29.548
You saw one photo and recognized me
from so far away? That's--

00:09:29.549 --> 00:09:32.552
I saw you up close earlier,
looking at the Sisley painting.

00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:36.722
Then why didn't you say so
when we met at our office?

00:09:36.723 --> 00:09:39.392
I'm sorry if I upset you
by not telling you about it.

00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:46.941
I guess… I misunderstood.

00:09:47.984 --> 00:09:48.985
I'm sorry.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.374
Then what are you doing at this hotel?

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:05.709
I'm staying here.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.670
My company booked it for me
since it's close to Nana Atelier.

00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:11.799
Uh… Here's my card key.

00:10:12.383 --> 00:10:13.551
Room 3017.

00:10:15.637 --> 00:10:17.179
Then why did you run away--

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.183
I wasn't running away.
I was just heading out…

00:10:20.892 --> 00:10:23.269
Because I forgot to buy this.

00:10:23.978 --> 00:10:26.271
It's my favorite.

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:28.691
I didn't even know you were in the lobby.

00:10:29.275 --> 00:10:30.276
Yeah.

00:10:31.778 --> 00:10:34.113
Once again, I'm sorry.

00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:50.922
"Stalking"?

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:54.216
Darn it.

00:10:54.217 --> 00:10:56.469
Then who could have sent those photos?

00:10:58.096 --> 00:10:59.347
Song Haran!

00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:03.976
It's the stalker!

00:11:06.229 --> 00:11:07.897
Stalker!

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:12.610
You darn stalker!

00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:14.903
Don't you dare touch my sister!

00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:16.322
I'm reporting you!

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:19.534
What is he doing here?

00:11:24.872 --> 00:11:27.417
Thank you.

00:11:29.627 --> 00:11:30.628
What?

00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:35.258
Stalker! Stalker!

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.426
I'll get him.

00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:01.575
Are you okay?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.499
Huh?

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:21.970
Answer me.

00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:23.931
What was in that bottle?

00:12:25.641 --> 00:12:26.808
You'd better talk.

00:12:26.809 --> 00:12:28.727
Do you want to film a vlog in prison?

00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:30.605
Song Hayeong, be quiet.

00:12:31.898 --> 00:12:33.190
From the smell,

00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:36.110
it seemed like
a diluted sodium hypochlorite solution.

00:12:39.322 --> 00:12:41.199
Ah, I mean, NaClO.

00:12:41.783 --> 00:12:43.910
Sodium hypochlorite…

00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:48.372
I mean, it seemed similar to chlorine.

00:12:48.373 --> 00:12:49.956
Oh, chlorine?

00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:52.377
I guess you majored in that field.

00:12:53.628 --> 00:12:55.587
Why were you trying to throw that at her?

00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:57.214
I wanted to ruin her.

00:12:57.215 --> 00:12:59.509
She was always getting on my nerves.

00:13:04.222 --> 00:13:05.598
Do you know each other?

00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:08.600
The design contest winner is…

00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:10.519
Song Haran!

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.728
Thank you!

00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:13.438
I'll treat everyone today.

00:13:13.439 --> 00:13:16.441
I always wondered why
you were always at the center of attention

00:13:16.442 --> 00:13:18.277
and why everyone loved you.

00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:19.946
It was because of Kim Nana.

00:13:21.572 --> 00:13:25.075
You're lucky
your grandmother's a famous designer.

00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:27.703
I quit my job
because I hated the sight of you…

00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:31.165
but it's all because
of your grandma.

00:13:31.916 --> 00:13:33.418
You made me lose everything.

00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:36.962
Weren't you great
at pretending to be the main character

00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:40.049
and acting like you were happy
without a concern in the world?

00:13:40.508 --> 00:13:41.509
So why…

00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:43.718
Why now?

00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:46.139
- Are you crazy?
- What are you doing?

00:13:50.852 --> 00:13:52.353
I don't want to press charges.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.313
Just end this here, please.

00:13:55.898 --> 00:13:56.982
GEUMWON POLICE STATION

00:13:56.983 --> 00:13:59.151
She ruined her own life.

00:13:59.152 --> 00:14:02.780
You went through so much
while you were at that company.

00:14:04.282 --> 00:14:06.868
But why were you here? And you, Mr. Yeon?

00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:10.704
Oh... Well…

00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:14.959
The photos really bothered me,
so I had to do something.

00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:16.418
LOCATION TRACKER

00:14:16.419 --> 00:14:19.045
- What are you doing?
- There's a smudge on it.

00:14:20.256 --> 00:14:21.339
HARAN

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.176
Something could really happen to Haran.

00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:27.387
I didn't dig through
your phone or anything.

00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:29.514
I just downloaded a location tracking app.

00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:31.933
But I saw you were here
when there was no meeting.

00:14:31.934 --> 00:14:34.520
- I got a bad feeling, so I came--
- Are you mad?

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.772
Why would you do that?

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.816
What if it really was someone dangerous?

00:14:39.817 --> 00:14:41.277
If something happened to you…

00:14:41.944 --> 00:14:44.946
Come on. I'm fine.

00:14:44.947 --> 00:14:46.781
Bad things don't come with a warning.

00:14:46.782 --> 00:14:48.950
People can get hurt in an instant.

00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:50.911
"What if I'd done something differently?"

00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:54.372
You can regret it hundreds,
thousands of times after the fact,

00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:55.707
but it won't change a thing.

00:14:55.708 --> 00:14:57.125
That's it!

00:14:57.126 --> 00:15:00.754
Hayeong,
if anything happens to you too…

00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:03.090
Haran, look at me.

00:15:03.716 --> 00:15:04.884
Look at me.

00:15:07.637 --> 00:15:08.721
I'm right here.

00:15:09.472 --> 00:15:10.514
I'm okay.

00:15:11.432 --> 00:15:12.641
We're all fine.

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:15.561
Nothing will happen now.

00:15:17.563 --> 00:15:18.564
It's okay.

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:22.276
It's all right.

00:15:24.403 --> 00:15:26.905
You must have been startled. I'm sorry.

00:15:26.906 --> 00:15:29.617
But why were you running
with my sister earlier?

00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:32.161
Oh, well…

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:36.164
My hotel was nearby.

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:39.459
I spotted someone suspicious
following her, by coincidence.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.752
Wow.

00:15:40.753 --> 00:15:44.090
You're her savior.
Thank you so much for helping her...

00:15:45.424 --> 00:15:48.635
Thank you.

00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:50.553
Oh?

00:15:50.554 --> 00:15:51.846
Your jacket got bleached.

00:15:51.847 --> 00:15:53.265
Why did she have to throw…

00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:54.724
I'm sorry.

00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:56.435
I troubled you with a personal issue.

00:15:56.936 --> 00:15:59.104
And I'm sorry about earlier too.

00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:01.731
It's fine.

00:16:01.732 --> 00:16:03.234
Then I'll head back now.

00:16:04.568 --> 00:16:06.529
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

00:16:07.613 --> 00:16:09.739
What did you mean by
"sorry about earlier"?

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.866
I grilled him,

00:16:11.867 --> 00:16:13.618
thinking he was the stalker.

00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:16.371
Geez. Ungrateful much?

00:16:16.372 --> 00:16:18.833
He even ruined his jacket
trying to help you.

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:20.583
Huh?

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:23.128
Did the other guy leave?
He probably needs treatment.

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:25.673
Hmm? Treatment? He just left.

00:16:26.674 --> 00:16:28.800
Hayeong, go home first.

00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:30.844
No, take me with you.

00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:32.429
I can't let you go alone.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.763
I'm really fine.

00:16:33.764 --> 00:16:35.516
And keep this a secret, okay?

00:16:36.392 --> 00:16:38.019
Don't report this to Grandma.

00:16:40.896 --> 00:16:42.188
Hurry home, okay?

00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:43.899
And keep your phone on.

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:49.030
My heart…

00:16:50.406 --> 00:16:52.907
I thought something might happen.

00:16:52.908 --> 00:16:54.242
Are you all right?

00:16:54.243 --> 00:16:55.244
Gosh.

00:16:55.786 --> 00:16:57.996
Of course. I'm fine.

00:16:57.997 --> 00:16:59.749
I'm always fine.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.460
Did you need something
approved by Grandma?

00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:05.004
Let's go. It's late.

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:06.964
It's that way.

00:17:08.758 --> 00:17:10.134
Come on.

00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:18.184
Excuse me.

00:17:18.768 --> 00:17:19.977
Excuse me!

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:22.312
No, not that way…

00:17:22.313 --> 00:17:23.647
Excuse me!

00:17:25.858 --> 00:17:27.026
Mr. Seonu.

00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:29.362
Oh…

00:17:30.446 --> 00:17:32.657
You hurt your hand earlier,
didn't you?

00:17:33.783 --> 00:17:36.243
I'm sorry I got you mixed up in this.

00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:39.954
Charge me for the hospital fees,
your jacket,

00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:42.332
and any inconveniences
caused by your injury--

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:43.417
Are you a lawyer?

00:17:44.543 --> 00:17:46.586
I thought you were a designer.

00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:47.797
What?

00:17:50.257 --> 00:17:52.300
As you can see, I'm fine.

00:17:52.301 --> 00:17:54.177
So you don't have
to draw a line like that.

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:56.221
I don't feel okay with it.

00:17:56.222 --> 00:17:57.973
I hate causing trouble for others.

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:08.650
I'm really sorry about today.

00:18:08.651 --> 00:18:10.611
Make sure to get your hand treated.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.710
Why does this keep happening?

00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:29.046
It's scaring me.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:38.013
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

00:18:44.562 --> 00:18:47.105
She rejected me firmly.

00:18:47.106 --> 00:18:48.690
I want to live like this.

00:18:48.691 --> 00:18:50.066
I feel comfortable this way.

00:18:50.067 --> 00:18:53.070
I know I'm being stupid and weird.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.614
But…

00:18:57.032 --> 00:18:58.242
I'm too scared.

00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:12.422
She's here.

00:19:12.423 --> 00:19:14.884
Don't do this anymore, Grandma.

00:19:15.468 --> 00:19:16.761
I'll handle things myself.

00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:19.637
Pushing everyone away

00:19:19.638 --> 00:19:22.223
and wasting time outside,
then hiding in a cave…

00:19:22.224 --> 00:19:24.058
Is that how you handle things?

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:25.518
She…

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:27.313
She was with a guy.

00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:29.773
- What?
- I was with them.

00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:33.485
I came home early,
and she spent more time with him alone.

00:19:33.486 --> 00:19:35.445
- Don't lie to me.
- I mean it.

00:19:35.446 --> 00:19:36.946
Mom, Dad. You saw it, right?

00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:38.073
I'm not lying, right?

00:19:38.657 --> 00:19:39.658
Is it true?

00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:41.911
I'll head upstairs first.

00:19:46.332 --> 00:19:49.043
Tell me. Who is he?
And what's their relationship?

00:19:51.879 --> 00:19:52.963
Uh…

00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:55.048
Well…

00:19:55.049 --> 00:19:56.759
- They're just talking.
- "Talking"?

00:19:58.302 --> 00:20:01.847
Just leave her be.
Meddling will only ruin it.

00:20:02.932 --> 00:20:04.433
Then good night.

00:20:05.851 --> 00:20:06.852
Sleep tight.

00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:11.607
"Talking"?

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:18.696
Gosh, Song Hayeong.

00:20:18.697 --> 00:20:21.158
You've helped your sister again.

00:20:22.034 --> 00:20:23.660
This household is ruined without me.

00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:25.412
You're lucky to have such a great sister.

00:20:25.996 --> 00:20:27.580
You made her get the wrong idea.

00:20:27.581 --> 00:20:30.542
What? It's true that you were with a guy.

00:20:30.543 --> 00:20:32.753
Won't it be good for her
to get the wrong idea?

00:20:34.547 --> 00:20:36.381
Just pretend you're seeing someone.

00:20:36.382 --> 00:20:38.217
That will save you from a lot of nagging.

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:41.428
No, there's no need to thank me.

00:20:42.012 --> 00:20:44.598
I'll take this instead.

00:20:45.975 --> 00:20:48.017
How is the animator's hand?

00:20:48.018 --> 00:20:50.186
I gave him my business card
so he can charge me.

00:20:50.187 --> 00:20:52.605
Business card?

00:20:52.606 --> 00:20:54.315
Did I raise you like that?

00:20:54.316 --> 00:20:57.485
If it weren't for him,
you would've gotten that chlorine…

00:20:57.486 --> 00:20:58.695
Oh God.

00:20:58.696 --> 00:21:00.572
Listen, Haran.

00:21:00.573 --> 00:21:03.867
You should at least buy him dinner
and thank him in person…

00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:08.414
But of course…

00:21:09.123 --> 00:21:11.542
you're not the type to do that.

00:21:12.418 --> 00:21:15.336
Ah. Give him some new clothes.

00:21:15.337 --> 00:21:16.504
His jacket was ruined.

00:21:16.505 --> 00:21:18.381
Right. Clothes.

00:21:18.382 --> 00:21:20.091
Then next week at our meeting--

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:21.342
Next week?

00:21:21.343 --> 00:21:24.889
He's here on a business trip.
He won't have many clothes.

00:21:25.472 --> 00:21:26.557
Would that be too late?

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.309
- Then a delivery…
- Delivery?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.770
You should at least say,
"I'm sorry, your jacket's ruined."

00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:35.690
"I'm not sure if you'll like them,
but I got you some clothes."

00:21:35.691 --> 00:21:41.113
Shouldn't you at least give them to him
in person and show some sincerity?

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:45.492
I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

00:21:46.702 --> 00:21:48.078
Hayeong.

00:21:48.704 --> 00:21:50.289
Thank you for today.

00:21:50.873 --> 00:21:54.919
You were telling me
to shut up earlier.

00:21:56.045 --> 00:21:57.046
Good night.

00:21:59.173 --> 00:22:00.882
Bad things don't come
with a warning.

00:22:00.883 --> 00:22:02.884
People can get hurt in an instant.

00:22:02.885 --> 00:22:04.970
If something happened to you…

00:22:07.806 --> 00:22:08.807
What's this?

00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:11.352
Why are all our shoes in the bathtub?

00:22:11.977 --> 00:22:14.438
What do you mean? What shoes…

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.524
I'm going to wash them.
They were pretty dirty.

00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:21.694
I have an exam in an hour.
What am I supposed to do?

00:22:21.695 --> 00:22:23.821
What is it? Are our shoes gone?

00:22:23.822 --> 00:22:25.281
How do I go to school today?

00:22:25.282 --> 00:22:27.575
I have an important meeting.

00:22:27.576 --> 00:22:29.661
You can all stay home today.

00:22:29.662 --> 00:22:31.872
- No, I have to go.
- Don't go!

00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:36.250
Just don't go.

00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:38.671
What if something happens to you outside?

00:22:39.338 --> 00:22:40.964
It happened to Mom and Dad.

00:22:40.965 --> 00:22:44.009
So don't go, okay? Don't go!

00:22:44.593 --> 00:22:45.885
Haran…

00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:48.596
- Don't go.
- It's okay. It's okay.

00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:49.806
Haran, it's all right.

00:22:49.807 --> 00:22:51.307
Just stay home.

00:22:51.308 --> 00:22:53.977
Don't go. Don't go. Please. Please.

00:22:58.774 --> 00:22:59.775
What?

00:23:00.651 --> 00:23:01.734
What?

00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:03.612
You just looked ugly. Good night.

00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:13.539
Meet him in person?

00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:17.376
Yes?

00:23:19.753 --> 00:23:20.878
What brings you here?

00:23:20.879 --> 00:23:24.007
Someone dropped this off for you
at the front desk.

00:23:24.008 --> 00:23:26.135
- Who?
- A young lady.

00:23:27.136 --> 00:23:29.430
She asked me to give this to you and left.

00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:36.937
How did she know my room number?

00:23:38.397 --> 00:23:41.025
Ah. My card key.

00:23:41.608 --> 00:23:43.776
I'm sorry your jacket's ruined.

00:23:43.777 --> 00:23:46.612
I'm not sure if you'll like them,
but I got you some clothes.

00:23:49.825 --> 00:23:50.826
Huh?

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:55.371
No.

00:23:55.372 --> 00:23:56.789
No.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:57.833
Don't get involved.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.047
Please, please, please don't be here.

00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:19.813
You know that particular smell
before it rains?

00:24:21.148 --> 00:24:22.900
I love that smell.

00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:27.029
But it disappears so quickly,
so I just stand there smelling it.

00:24:28.197 --> 00:24:31.658
But the catch is that
you always end up with a nasty cold.

00:24:58.936 --> 00:25:00.228
From the smell,

00:25:00.229 --> 00:25:03.022
it seemed like
a diluted sodium hypochlorite solution.

00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:04.816
Ah, I mean, NaClO.

00:25:04.817 --> 00:25:07.986
There's another guy
who speaks like him.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.575
Ah…

00:25:14.576 --> 00:25:16.285
You'll catch a cold.

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.664
You came here because of me, so take this.

00:25:27.214 --> 00:25:29.090
No, it's okay.

00:25:29.091 --> 00:25:30.676
I'm the one who's not okay.

00:25:36.557 --> 00:25:38.141
Oh…

00:25:38.142 --> 00:25:40.769
I have another one in my room.
I'll go get it.

00:25:41.436 --> 00:25:42.980
- Hang on.
- No, I…

00:25:44.398 --> 00:25:45.899
Hey! Haran!

00:25:48.152 --> 00:25:50.403
Song Haran! You're actually alive!

00:25:50.404 --> 00:25:51.904
Gosh.

00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:57.326
You suddenly cut all contact with us
and said you were going to the US.

00:25:57.327 --> 00:26:00.746
I went to your workplace, but you quit,
and your number wasn't in service.

00:26:00.747 --> 00:26:02.457
I was so worried about you.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.333
I'm glad I bumped into you.

00:26:04.334 --> 00:26:06.377
I actually booked a wedding here.

00:26:06.378 --> 00:26:07.628
It's next spring.

00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:10.089
- You'll be able to see everyone--
- Sorry, Yujeong.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.383
I'm in a hurry right now. Sorry.

00:26:12.384 --> 00:26:13.385
Huh?

00:26:13.886 --> 00:26:15.095
Haran, wait!

00:26:15.721 --> 00:26:16.805
Haran!

00:26:19.975 --> 00:26:22.352
- I'll come with you to get the umbrella.
- Pardon?

00:26:22.936 --> 00:26:24.520
Huh? Why isn't it here?

00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:25.772
Hang on.

00:26:26.315 --> 00:26:28.649
Ben, my umbrella… Mmm…

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.901
Is he not here?

00:26:29.902 --> 00:26:31.235
Oh, the concierge…

00:26:31.236 --> 00:26:32.946
No, it's fine.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.864
Hello?

00:26:34.865 --> 00:26:37.867
Hello. It's Room 3017.

00:26:56.094 --> 00:26:57.721
It's taking a while.

00:26:59.848 --> 00:27:00.974
I'm sure they'll come.

00:27:01.767 --> 00:27:02.768
Right.

00:27:12.986 --> 00:27:15.071
Oh! The umbrella…

00:27:15.072 --> 00:27:17.449
No, it's Ben.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.117
- Ben.
- Oh.

00:27:20.118 --> 00:27:21.285
Where were you?

00:27:21.286 --> 00:27:24.580
My mother-in-law wanted
to give me some chicken stew.

00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:26.707
Oh? Ms. Song?

00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:27.833
Hello.

00:27:27.834 --> 00:27:30.336
I was dropping off something
and came to borrow an umbrella.

00:27:30.337 --> 00:27:32.380
Oh! This is great.

00:27:32.381 --> 00:27:34.007
You can have a meal with us…

00:27:34.758 --> 00:27:36.175
An umbrella!

00:27:36.176 --> 00:27:38.219
Here.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.680
You can take this.

00:27:40.514 --> 00:27:43.683
- It's pouring, so get home safely.
- Right.

00:27:43.684 --> 00:27:47.020
I'll see you at our next meeting.

00:27:48.981 --> 00:27:50.148
Bye.

00:27:56.154 --> 00:27:59.907
What was that?
You become an idiot in front of Ms. Song.

00:27:59.908 --> 00:28:01.242
Is there something going on?

00:28:01.243 --> 00:28:02.618
Are you dating?

00:28:04.871 --> 00:28:06.415
There is something…

00:28:07.332 --> 00:28:08.959
But there shouldn't be.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.128
Ben.

00:28:11.628 --> 00:28:13.672
Don't you feel suffocated in this hotel?

00:28:14.256 --> 00:28:16.716
Should we just rent a house
while we're here?

00:28:16.717 --> 00:28:20.302
Is it the hotel or your own heart
that's suffocating you?

00:28:43.326 --> 00:28:45.871
SHIM
Coffee House

00:28:49.124 --> 00:28:50.750
It must be closed today.

00:28:50.751 --> 00:28:52.960
We've been waiting,
but Mr. Park's not coming.

00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:54.045
Thank you.

00:28:54.046 --> 00:28:55.464
Where should we go?

00:28:57.799 --> 00:28:59.009
Hey, Genius.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.522
I'LL BE BACK SOON

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.070
Hello?

00:29:19.154 --> 00:29:21.072
Isn't this Mr. Park's phone?

00:29:21.073 --> 00:29:23.449
It is, but he's asleep right now.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.202
I'll take that.

00:29:25.827 --> 00:29:27.621
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:29:32.084 --> 00:29:35.920
Give me your paw. Good boy!

00:29:35.921 --> 00:29:38.839
Hi, I'm Genius.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.966
Aren't I big and adorable?

00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:42.384
Why is there a dog here?

00:29:42.385 --> 00:29:46.097
The owner of a coffee shop
Big Sis is a regular at was hospitalized,

00:29:46.098 --> 00:29:47.932
so she said she'd take care of him.

00:29:47.933 --> 00:29:50.059
I wish I could keep him.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.353
Song Hayeong, that little brat.

00:29:52.354 --> 00:29:54.230
What? It wasn't Hayeong.

00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:57.192
- What?
- You're here.

00:29:57.692 --> 00:30:00.861
Park Genius.
Isn't that such a cute name?

00:30:00.862 --> 00:30:02.905
He was named after the coffee shop owner.

00:30:02.906 --> 00:30:05.157
- His name's--
- Hadam. Your academy.

00:30:07.953 --> 00:30:11.497
Hey, Genius. I'll be back soon. See you.

00:30:11.498 --> 00:30:12.999
See you, Grandma.

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:19.255
Were you close enough to someone
to look after their dog?

00:30:19.256 --> 00:30:21.340
Sorry, I brought him without asking.

00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:33.811
WE MISS YOU

00:30:33.812 --> 00:30:36.022
GET PLENTY OF REST AND FOCUS ON RECOVERING

00:30:42.654 --> 00:30:44.948
Should I get some toys for Genius?

00:30:47.117 --> 00:30:49.661
You're a dog, and this is a yard.

00:30:50.996 --> 00:30:52.873
Run around all you want.

00:30:59.254 --> 00:31:01.381
- Who is it?
- Excuse me.

00:31:03.258 --> 00:31:04.925
Hello.

00:31:04.926 --> 00:31:07.553
Is my dog Genius here?

00:31:07.554 --> 00:31:08.555
Hey, Genius!

00:31:09.514 --> 00:31:11.682
Genius!

00:31:11.683 --> 00:31:14.810
Good boy.

00:31:14.811 --> 00:31:17.813
You must have been startled
being here without me.

00:31:17.814 --> 00:31:20.065
- Good boy.
- Hello.

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:21.150
Ah…

00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:24.028
My eldest granddaughter
isn't here right now.

00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:26.447
Gosh. Where are my manners?

00:31:26.448 --> 00:31:29.117
Thank you so much
for taking care of Genius.

00:31:29.743 --> 00:31:32.329
It's fine. It wasn't hard
taking care of him.

00:31:32.913 --> 00:31:34.330
But how did you…

00:31:34.331 --> 00:31:35.749
I got discharged early.

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:38.959
I heard it was the house
with the coffee-colored door.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.838
I was worried I'd come to the wrong house
for a moment.

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:45.175
I'll thank you formally next time.

00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:47.801
- Let's go, Genius.
- Goodbye.

00:31:47.802 --> 00:31:48.803
Bye.

00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:54.225
Park Genius.
Isn't that such a cute name?

00:31:54.226 --> 00:31:56.185
He was named after the coffee shop owner.

00:31:56.186 --> 00:31:58.563
- His name's--
- Park Manjae?

00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:02.025
Are you Manjae, who lived in Chuncheon?

00:32:07.489 --> 00:32:08.572
Who…

00:32:08.573 --> 00:32:09.823
It really is you.

00:32:09.824 --> 00:32:11.910
It's me.
The house with the persimmon tree.

00:32:13.078 --> 00:32:14.079
Who?

00:32:17.832 --> 00:32:19.583
PARK MANJAE

00:32:33.098 --> 00:32:35.225
Manjae!

00:32:36.184 --> 00:32:37.893
Manjae!

00:32:37.894 --> 00:32:39.645
Nabong!

00:32:54.869 --> 00:32:58.080
The fashionista Nabong from Chuncheon?

00:32:59.624 --> 00:33:00.916
Yes, it's me.

00:33:00.917 --> 00:33:02.626
It's Nabong.

00:33:02.627 --> 00:33:03.961
It really is you?

00:33:05.046 --> 00:33:08.133
You're really Nabong?

00:33:12.387 --> 00:33:13.388
Huh?

00:33:24.065 --> 00:33:25.775
Huh? That's…

00:33:27.193 --> 00:33:31.114
Mr. Park, the clutter box
you're throwing away…

00:33:35.035 --> 00:33:37.036
Hello.

00:33:37.037 --> 00:33:39.414
What are you doing here?

00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:43.167
I'm going to live here. What about you?

00:33:43.168 --> 00:33:46.046
You're living here? Why?

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.756
I'm close with Mr. Park.

00:33:48.757 --> 00:33:51.343
- What brings you here?
- Why are you close?

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.470
Why?

00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:57.766
The hotel's nearby,
so I came here every day.

00:33:58.516 --> 00:34:01.769
And I actually received the exhibit ticket
from Mr. Park

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.145
after fixing the ice machine.

00:34:03.146 --> 00:34:05.648
Then the regular
who fixed the ice machine…

00:34:08.568 --> 00:34:10.862
But why stay here instead of a nice hotel?

00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:19.745
You heard the doctor, right?

00:34:19.746 --> 00:34:22.247
Make sure to take your meds
and get plenty of sleep.

00:34:22.248 --> 00:34:24.500
And no overworking or drinking alcohol.

00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:25.877
Enough with the nagging.

00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:28.254
My ears are going to bleed.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.090
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

00:34:31.091 --> 00:34:34.426
There's nothing like being back home.

00:34:34.427 --> 00:34:38.555
There are a lot of rooms here.

00:34:38.556 --> 00:34:41.642
Oh. It's a bit big for one person.

00:34:41.643 --> 00:34:44.812
Mmm-hmm. You must feel lonely--

00:34:44.813 --> 00:34:47.107
Mr. Park, can you let me
stay in one of the rooms?

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.401
Just for three months.
Three months.

00:34:50.402 --> 00:34:54.406
I was going to rent a house,
but he had some empty rooms.

00:34:55.532 --> 00:34:58.575
And Ben is at his in-law's.

00:34:58.576 --> 00:34:59.993
So what brings you here?

00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:02.497
Then the regular
who called an ambulance for him…

00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:05.624
Hang on. Then it was you
who answered the phone?

00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:10.671
Ah. I heard the regular I talked to
on the phone was taking care of Genius.

00:35:10.672 --> 00:35:13.340
Yes, that regular is me.

00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:15.635
Ah. Regular.

00:35:16.803 --> 00:35:17.971
Regular… Mmm.

00:35:20.932 --> 00:35:25.269
I think Mr. Park
was around here somewhere.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.146
By the way, is he all right?

00:35:27.147 --> 00:35:28.940
I'm all right.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.236
They said
it's variant angina or something.

00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:36.364
I just have to take medicine.

00:35:37.198 --> 00:35:39.491
By the way, it's been so long.

00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:43.078
You suddenly disappeared
from Chuncheon one day.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:45.289
It's been over 50 years.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.042
But I'm quite famous now.
You really didn't know?

00:35:49.043 --> 00:35:51.712
Well, I knew the name Nana Kim,

00:35:51.713 --> 00:35:54.882
but I never imagined
it would be you.

00:35:54.883 --> 00:35:59.094
Gosh, you were always
going on about la vie en rose,

00:35:59.095 --> 00:36:03.015
and you really went to France
and achieved that dream.

00:36:04.768 --> 00:36:09.855
But I've been running a coffee shop
in this neighborhood for over 10 years.

00:36:09.856 --> 00:36:13.859
How is it that
we never ran into each other?

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.487
That's how the world is.

00:36:16.154 --> 00:36:19.990
It can feel small at times
but big at others.

00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:24.119
But how did you get so close
to my granddaughter?

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.164
She never lets anyone get close to her.

00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:30.167
She's a regular at my coffee shop.

00:36:30.168 --> 00:36:33.630
She stays there
almost every day until I close.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.092
I wondered where she was staying out
so late every day.

00:36:38.843 --> 00:36:40.260
She was there?

00:36:43.056 --> 00:36:44.474
I guess she felt more at ease

00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:48.394
at your coffee shop than at home with me.

00:36:49.229 --> 00:36:51.606
I guess you did something for her
that I couldn't.

00:36:52.273 --> 00:36:55.442
- Thanks.
- All I did was give her coffee.

00:36:55.443 --> 00:36:56.986
I didn't do anything special.

00:36:59.405 --> 00:37:00.615
It's been seven years,

00:37:01.616 --> 00:37:03.910
but I never knew

00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:07.246
she had a place to rely on.

00:37:07.247 --> 00:37:08.248
Seven years?

00:37:09.332 --> 00:37:13.044
That's around the time I first met her.

00:37:14.337 --> 00:37:15.880
I think it was around summer.

00:37:16.923 --> 00:37:19.133
I'm not sure if it's okay to ask this,

00:37:19.884 --> 00:37:22.345
but did something happen to her

00:37:23.012 --> 00:37:24.347
back then?

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.943
My gosh.

00:37:37.944 --> 00:37:40.697
Hey, Genius.

00:37:41.197 --> 00:37:42.824
It's raining cats and dogs.

00:37:43.366 --> 00:37:44.993
It's pouring, isn't it?

00:37:46.077 --> 00:37:51.291
It was a day when it suddenly poured.

00:37:56.921 --> 00:37:59.424
But she was sitting in the rain,

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.550
crying.

00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:08.766
Her boyfriend died back then.

00:38:09.684 --> 00:38:12.895
He went to study in Boston,
but he suddenly died.

00:38:39.088 --> 00:38:40.632
BEN

00:38:43.343 --> 00:38:45.761
You're getting a call…

00:38:45.762 --> 00:38:46.804
Can you…

00:38:47.388 --> 00:38:50.475
Can you hold it
on the other side?

00:38:54.062 --> 00:38:55.437
Yes.

00:38:55.438 --> 00:38:56.731
Hey, Ben.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.232
A meeting on Monday?

00:38:59.233 --> 00:39:01.110
Okay. Bye.

00:39:02.236 --> 00:39:04.656
Thank you. Can you put it here?

00:39:05.365 --> 00:39:07.032
Right.

00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:10.535
I'm back!

00:39:10.536 --> 00:39:12.245
Genius, house!

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:13.873
Were you at our house?

00:39:14.457 --> 00:39:17.501
You only just got discharged.
You should've called me.

00:39:17.502 --> 00:39:21.421
It's the first time I've heard you talk
this much in seven years.

00:39:21.422 --> 00:39:23.840
Are you all right?

00:39:23.841 --> 00:39:25.592
Yes, thanks to you.

00:39:25.593 --> 00:39:30.347
But it's a surprise seeing
my VVIP regulars here together.

00:39:31.516 --> 00:39:33.475
Roomie, say hi. She's…

00:39:33.476 --> 00:39:35.644
Oh. I know her.

00:39:35.645 --> 00:39:38.313
She's a designer
at the company I'm working with.

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:40.983
You were working with Nabong…

00:39:40.984 --> 00:39:43.694
I mean, the designer Nana Kim?

00:39:43.695 --> 00:39:45.988
How do you know my grandmother's name?

00:39:45.989 --> 00:39:48.073
It turns out she was my childhood friend.

00:39:48.074 --> 00:39:49.449
Oh, really?

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.285
We lived in the same neighborhood
for 10 years, but I never knew.

00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:53.662
I was so excited,

00:39:53.663 --> 00:39:56.623
I almost did a backflip.

00:39:59.043 --> 00:40:00.877
Right, I forgot.

00:40:00.878 --> 00:40:02.254
Thank you.

00:40:02.255 --> 00:40:05.465
You locked the doors for me
and even looked after Genius.

00:40:05.466 --> 00:40:06.633
It's nothing.

00:40:06.634 --> 00:40:09.803
And you can talk to me informally.
You're Grandma's friend.

00:40:09.804 --> 00:40:13.057
Then should I start
talking to you casually?

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:14.975
Like a friend.

00:40:14.976 --> 00:40:17.061
Ah. Yes.

00:40:17.562 --> 00:40:19.938
This is the first time
I've seen you smile like that too.

00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:24.609
But… you must feel comfortable
on your own.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.653
Why did you let him live here?

00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:31.659
I thought I'd feel safer
if there was someone with me.

00:40:32.452 --> 00:40:34.954
And he's adorable.

00:40:35.955 --> 00:40:38.166
He's a really good man.

00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:41.543
Come sit down. I'll make you coffee.

00:40:41.544 --> 00:40:43.545
No, it's fine. Get some rest.

00:40:43.546 --> 00:40:46.548
Even if I don't drink coffee,

00:40:46.549 --> 00:40:49.761
is it okay to stay here
until closing hours?

00:40:51.179 --> 00:40:55.641
You're young.
You should be having fun outside.

00:40:56.142 --> 00:40:58.477
You shouldn't stay cooped up
in this boring place.

00:40:58.478 --> 00:41:00.562
This place is the most fun for me.

00:41:00.563 --> 00:41:01.855
I can focus on work,

00:41:01.856 --> 00:41:04.859
and I feel at ease
because it feels like nothing will happen.

00:41:05.693 --> 00:41:06.694
Mmm.

00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:19.706
Bring the dancheong data
I mentioned to my office.

00:41:19.707 --> 00:41:21.541
I'll give you the files now.

00:41:23.961 --> 00:41:25.670
If it's a work call, take it.

00:41:25.671 --> 00:41:26.922
Mr. Yeon, take the files.

00:41:26.923 --> 00:41:28.007
- Sure.
- Here.

00:41:30.468 --> 00:41:32.302
- Hello.
- Here, Ms. Kim.

00:41:32.303 --> 00:41:34.638
I called about the fabric materials.

00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:37.224
Yes, I'd like the 0.8 mm ones.

00:41:37.225 --> 00:41:39.559
SEONU CHAN

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.686
- Ah, yes.
- She…

00:41:41.687 --> 00:41:43.481
- Thank you.
- She was with a guy.

00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:12.676
It's an original character
that Chan created.

00:42:12.677 --> 00:42:16.180
That character. Was it based on someone?

00:42:17.515 --> 00:42:19.392
No, it just came to mind.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.772
He drew his ideal type,
but he met her in real life?

00:42:27.859 --> 00:42:31.195
Mr. Yeon, keep an eye on Ms. Song

00:42:32.155 --> 00:42:33.322
and Seonu Chan.

00:42:34.073 --> 00:42:35.241
Yes, ma'am.

00:42:41.122 --> 00:42:43.165
That expression.

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:46.418
You look like a robot that's been given
an order you can't refuse.

00:42:46.419 --> 00:42:48.628
It's not like that.

00:42:48.629 --> 00:42:50.089
What is it? Did Grandma…

00:42:51.048 --> 00:42:53.633
I mean, did Ms. Kim order you
to do something again?

00:42:53.634 --> 00:42:54.759
No, she didn't.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.678
"No, she didn't"?

00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:58.972
All right. Then keep working
in your robot mode.

00:42:58.973 --> 00:43:01.100
Beep, beep, beep.

00:43:05.062 --> 00:43:08.190
It's pretty fun teasing him.

00:43:08.191 --> 00:43:09.608
Let's take a photo.

00:43:09.609 --> 00:43:10.734
One plus one is what?

00:43:10.735 --> 00:43:11.943
Two.

00:43:16.949 --> 00:43:18.867
I'm a huge animation fan.

00:43:18.868 --> 00:43:20.202
Where did you learn art?

00:43:20.203 --> 00:43:21.494
At CalArts.

00:43:21.495 --> 00:43:25.540
CalArts? That's insane!

00:43:25.541 --> 00:43:29.252
Sweetie, can you draw me a caricature…

00:43:29.253 --> 00:43:31.504
- …with your professional skills?
- Sure.

00:43:31.505 --> 00:43:32.714
Me too.

00:43:32.715 --> 00:43:33.798
- Me too.
- What?

00:43:33.799 --> 00:43:36.092
- I'll get some paper.
- When did they get so close?

00:43:36.093 --> 00:43:37.595
Is he a capybara or what?

00:43:38.262 --> 00:43:39.722
Is this better, or this?

00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:42.600
- The second one.
- Is this better?

00:43:43.976 --> 00:43:45.602
How should I pose for this?

00:43:45.603 --> 00:43:46.729
Like this?

00:43:46.938 --> 00:43:48.356
Hmm.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.441
Using a dancheong pattern

00:43:51.442 --> 00:43:54.654
to show that she's Korean
just with her outfit…

00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:58.449
Wow. This might be a problem.

00:44:01.369 --> 00:44:03.204
Because it's so good.

00:44:05.831 --> 00:44:10.710
Then let's develop this
with dancheong as the basic concept.

00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:14.006
All right. I'll send this to HQ
and schedule a video call.

00:44:15.925 --> 00:44:18.885
I feel a bit hungry.

00:44:18.886 --> 00:44:22.389
I'd like to continue our discussion
over dinner. Are you free?

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:24.599
Yes, I'd love that.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.726
How about the new
Italian restaurant nearby?

00:44:26.727 --> 00:44:27.937
It seemed really wild.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.942
Your appetite must be wild too.
No wonder your jawline disappeared.

00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.571
Have dinner without me.

00:44:42.076 --> 00:44:43.077
What do you like?

00:44:43.703 --> 00:44:45.370
You can eat without me. I--

00:44:45.371 --> 00:44:47.873
You're joining.
I said we're discussing work.

00:45:04.265 --> 00:45:06.517
They look good together.

00:45:07.226 --> 00:45:08.311
What?

00:45:09.729 --> 00:45:12.064
I said the interior is nice.

00:45:16.986 --> 00:45:18.528
Hello?

00:45:18.529 --> 00:45:20.031
All right.

00:45:21.032 --> 00:45:24.075
Sorry, I have to go.
Something urgent came up.

00:45:24.076 --> 00:45:25.201
Then let's--

00:45:25.202 --> 00:45:27.413
Sit. I didn't mean you were going.

00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:31.208
I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.

00:45:32.084 --> 00:45:33.209
See you at the meeting,

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.589
Animator Seonu Chan.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.467
Right. I'll see you at the meeting.

00:45:47.892 --> 00:45:51.394
If you feel uncomfortable, we can just…

00:45:51.395 --> 00:45:52.938
Here are the menus.

00:45:53.939 --> 00:45:56.067
I'm sorry, but we'll just…

00:45:57.902 --> 00:46:02.947
You should at least buy him
dinner and thank him in person…

00:46:02.948 --> 00:46:04.324
Let's just eat.

00:46:04.325 --> 00:46:06.034
I'll buy.

00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:07.243
What?

00:46:07.244 --> 00:46:09.872
Ah. Okay…

00:46:12.541 --> 00:46:14.209
Can you recommend something?

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.295
- Take your time. Just look here.
- Ah.

00:46:17.296 --> 00:46:20.840
Our rollatini is our signature dish,
made with sliced eggplants…

00:46:20.841 --> 00:46:23.969
- She doesn't like eggplants.
- How did you know I don't like eggplants?

00:46:25.179 --> 00:46:26.680
What? Oh…

00:46:27.973 --> 00:46:29.724
Many people dislike eggplants.

00:46:29.725 --> 00:46:31.476
Right?

00:46:31.477 --> 00:46:32.936
- Right…
- Me too.

00:46:32.937 --> 00:46:35.021
I dislike them as well.

00:46:35.022 --> 00:46:37.982
Can you just give me
something you can prepare quickly?

00:46:37.983 --> 00:46:40.111
- Me too.
- All right.

00:46:44.698 --> 00:46:47.785
The interior really is nice.

00:46:50.121 --> 00:46:52.997
Repetition means
your heart has already stirred.

00:46:52.998 --> 00:46:56.334
Instead of writing his name over and over,
follow your heart.

00:46:56.335 --> 00:46:57.378
"Name"?

00:46:58.629 --> 00:47:00.047
Mr. Yeon, take the files.

00:47:11.142 --> 00:47:12.810
Let me apologize first.

00:47:14.812 --> 00:47:15.937
SEONU CHAN

00:47:15.938 --> 00:47:18.148
Oh? Why is my name there?

00:47:18.149 --> 00:47:19.275
Well…

00:47:20.317 --> 00:47:23.611
I wrote this when I thought
you were my stalker,

00:47:23.612 --> 00:47:27.115
but I think Ms. Kim saw this
and thought I had feelings for you.

00:47:27.116 --> 00:47:29.826
That's probably why
we ended up having dinner alone.

00:47:29.827 --> 00:47:31.162
Ah…

00:47:34.248 --> 00:47:35.707
I'll explain this to her…

00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:38.334
Just pretend
you're seeing someone.

00:47:38.335 --> 00:47:41.379
That will save you from a lot of nagging.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.341
I should tell her…

00:47:45.342 --> 00:47:46.886
But is it okay if I don't?

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.345
Pardon?

00:47:49.346 --> 00:47:50.930
It's a bit complicated,

00:47:50.931 --> 00:47:53.600
but I think
this will be a good opportunity

00:47:53.601 --> 00:47:55.686
to put my grandmother's mind at ease.

00:47:56.437 --> 00:47:59.356
Oh. Sure.

00:48:00.149 --> 00:48:02.568
If it helps you, then it's fine with me.

00:48:03.527 --> 00:48:06.405
Thank you. I'll make sure
this won't cause you any trouble.

00:48:07.114 --> 00:48:08.281
All right.

00:48:16.165 --> 00:48:19.417
There must have been
an issue with the connection. I'm sorry.

00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:20.835
It's fine.

00:48:31.722 --> 00:48:33.265
How did the two seem?

00:48:34.475 --> 00:48:36.392
I'm not sure yet.

00:48:36.393 --> 00:48:37.394
REPRESENTATIVE
KIM NANA

00:48:38.395 --> 00:48:40.689
I set things up for them,
so we'll know soon.

00:48:41.732 --> 00:48:44.067
- You can go now.
- I'll take you home.

00:48:44.068 --> 00:48:45.945
I'm not a child. I can go home by myself.

00:48:46.612 --> 00:48:49.364
You don't look well these days.

00:48:49.365 --> 00:48:51.825
And you haven't gotten
any checkups for years.

00:48:53.994 --> 00:48:56.705
At least take these. They're vitamins.

00:48:58.499 --> 00:49:01.377
You're not my chauffeur
or secretary anymore.

00:49:01.877 --> 00:49:05.213
If you've become the COO,
you should stop doing such things.

00:49:05.214 --> 00:49:07.883
Why would a COO take care
of my granddaughters as well?

00:49:08.676 --> 00:49:10.594
I'm doing it because I want to.

00:49:11.178 --> 00:49:12.429
Then don't work too late.

00:49:28.529 --> 00:49:30.573
I wonder what they're up to now.

00:49:38.706 --> 00:49:42.125
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked
what I did earlier.

00:49:42.126 --> 00:49:43.377
I'll take that back…

00:49:46.255 --> 00:49:48.465
- Are you not feeling well?
- What?

00:50:03.439 --> 00:50:04.565
Excuse me…

00:50:12.114 --> 00:50:14.032
I'm so sorry. I'll pay for all this.

00:50:14.033 --> 00:50:16.118
Can you put in the order again?
Just a moment, please.

00:50:16.702 --> 00:50:17.828
All right.

00:50:19.663 --> 00:50:21.874
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:32.760
Are you okay? Do you feel dizzy?

00:50:34.386 --> 00:50:35.804
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

00:50:37.556 --> 00:50:41.143
I'm sorry.
I don't do well in noisy places.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:43.896
- Is it hard being around crowds?
- No.

00:50:45.356 --> 00:50:46.606
Mmm…

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.031
I can't hear… on this side.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.325
I'm usually fine,

00:50:57.326 --> 00:51:00.037
but the sounds get mixed up
when it's noisy inside.

00:51:00.663 --> 00:51:02.830
And I can't even hear
the person right in front of me.

00:51:02.831 --> 00:51:05.668
It's hard to tell
the direction of the sounds.

00:51:07.252 --> 00:51:08.586
Excuse me.

00:51:08.587 --> 00:51:11.172
Excuse me! No, not that way…

00:51:11.173 --> 00:51:13.675
Can you hold it on the other side?

00:51:16.637 --> 00:51:19.430
But I'm a skilled artist, I'm friendly,

00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:21.599
and with my looks…

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.685
What?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.022
I'm a really lucky guy besides the fact
that I can't hear on one side,

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.858
so you don't have to look at me like that.

00:51:32.486 --> 00:51:35.447
I'll go deal
with the mess I caused in there.

00:51:36.073 --> 00:51:39.243
No, it's noisy in there.
I'll go bring our stuff.

00:51:47.376 --> 00:51:48.502
I…

00:51:49.294 --> 00:51:50.295
Hang on.

00:51:55.968 --> 00:51:58.053
Excuse me for a moment.

00:52:19.032 --> 00:52:22.744
I'm just taking care
of your ruined clothes, as a designer.

00:52:22.745 --> 00:52:24.788
It's not because I feel bad or anything.

00:52:25.372 --> 00:52:28.541
- Why are you drawing a line like that?
- Think however you want.

00:52:28.542 --> 00:52:29.543
Thank you.

00:52:33.714 --> 00:52:34.965
Thanks

00:52:36.133 --> 00:52:37.134
for caring.

00:52:45.517 --> 00:52:47.393
I took care of it for now.

00:52:47.394 --> 00:52:48.644
There.

00:52:48.645 --> 00:52:50.563
No, you'll catch a cold…

00:52:50.564 --> 00:52:52.274
It was just to style my outfit.

00:52:53.108 --> 00:52:55.860
I'll tell my grandmother
she had a misunderstanding.

00:52:55.861 --> 00:52:58.029
It's a good opportunity.
It's fine with me--

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:00.491
I'm not fine with it.

00:53:01.158 --> 00:53:02.493
I don't like feeling indebted.

00:53:03.827 --> 00:53:05.704
Anyway, I'll bring our stuff.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.049
How did you get close to Ms. Song?

00:53:17.674 --> 00:53:20.552
What? Well…

00:53:21.303 --> 00:53:25.015
I think we're close,
but I'm not sure about her.

00:53:25.724 --> 00:53:27.141
But why do you ask?

00:53:27.142 --> 00:53:28.227
Well…

00:53:29.353 --> 00:53:31.063
It feels like she always draws a line

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:33.690
and doesn't let me cross it.

00:53:34.483 --> 00:53:36.109
She didn't use to…

00:53:38.445 --> 00:53:42.281
It just feels like it's hard
to get close to her.

00:53:42.282 --> 00:53:45.409
I've seen her every day
for the past seven years,

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:48.704
but I had no idea what she did
or where she lived.

00:53:48.705 --> 00:53:50.624
She never talks about herself.

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:55.963
She was always drawing clothes,

00:53:56.505 --> 00:53:59.675
so I just assumed she was a designer.

00:54:00.592 --> 00:54:04.136
She always came by herself
and stayed here quietly.

00:54:06.223 --> 00:54:08.641
Did she ever come with anyone else?

00:54:08.642 --> 00:54:10.017
No, never.

00:54:10.018 --> 00:54:11.562
Not once in seven years.

00:54:12.312 --> 00:54:14.231
She was always by herself.

00:54:15.065 --> 00:54:16.108
Always.

00:54:22.948 --> 00:54:24.991
Did you catch a cold?

00:54:24.992 --> 00:54:27.034
No, I was just sneezing.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.921
Huh? Where did it go?

00:54:43.385 --> 00:54:45.636
Gosh, you're stirring up dust.

00:54:45.637 --> 00:54:46.762
What are you doing?

00:54:46.763 --> 00:54:48.890
I can't find my drawing pen.

00:54:50.392 --> 00:54:51.602
Where did it go?

00:54:56.523 --> 00:54:58.734
Where are you going?
It's time for our meeting.

00:55:04.364 --> 00:55:06.616
I really liked
the, uh... the dancheong idea.

00:55:06.617 --> 00:55:08.993
So could you tell me
a little bit more about it?

00:55:08.994 --> 00:55:12.538
Of course.
Director Song will go over it for you.

00:55:12.539 --> 00:55:13.665
Director Song?

00:55:17.085 --> 00:55:19.630
The data overview.

00:55:20.922 --> 00:55:22.424
Oh, the data…

00:55:24.217 --> 00:55:27.637
Dancheong is
a traditional Korean coloring technique.

00:55:27.638 --> 00:55:28.721
Thank you.

00:55:28.722 --> 00:55:31.350
Commonly found in palaces and temples.

00:55:31.933 --> 00:55:35.811
It involves painting
wooden architecture with…

00:55:35.812 --> 00:55:39.273
Okay, so I'll see you at the next meeting.
We'll talk more about it then.

00:55:39.274 --> 00:55:40.566
All right. Bye-bye, everybody.

00:55:40.567 --> 00:55:41.692
Bye!

00:55:41.693 --> 00:55:42.903
See you.

00:55:44.237 --> 00:55:47.240
Great work, everyone.

00:55:52.496 --> 00:55:53.997
What kind of attitude was that?

00:55:55.248 --> 00:55:57.417
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

00:56:16.103 --> 00:56:17.312
Gosh. It's not here!

00:56:19.106 --> 00:56:21.692
Hang on. Where did I last use it?

00:56:22.484 --> 00:56:23.943
Right. The restaurant!

00:56:29.491 --> 00:56:30.784
The restaurant?

00:56:32.536 --> 00:56:34.371
NAUM LOST-AND-FOUND LIST

00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:39.418
We haven't found anything like that.

00:56:40.585 --> 00:56:42.461
Could I search for it myself?

00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:44.213
There are customers eating inside.

00:56:44.214 --> 00:56:47.591
But if you dropped it,
we would have found it while cleaning.

00:56:49.344 --> 00:56:53.556
I'm really sorry,
but can I take a look after you're closed?

00:56:53.557 --> 00:56:55.599
Just for 30, no, 10 minutes.

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.436
It's really valuable to me,
so I have to find it.

00:56:58.437 --> 00:56:59.770
Please.

00:57:02.023 --> 00:57:03.107
No.

00:57:03.108 --> 00:57:05.443
You're going downtown later anyway.

00:57:05.444 --> 00:57:07.194
Just get me something I can gift.

00:57:07.195 --> 00:57:10.698
Anything that a woman
in her twenties can use.

00:57:10.699 --> 00:57:12.951
We're not close enough
to ask for favors like that.

00:57:13.493 --> 00:57:14.578
Do that for me, okay?

00:57:25.213 --> 00:57:28.841
Is it a gift?
I could engrave it if you'd like.

00:57:41.021 --> 00:57:42.022
Did you find it?

00:57:42.814 --> 00:57:44.316
I'll look for it after they close.

00:57:44.816 --> 00:57:45.942
I'm sure it'll be there.

00:57:46.568 --> 00:57:49.528
Let's go. We can stay at SHIM
and come back to look for it.

00:57:49.529 --> 00:57:52.699
No, this is a personal matter.
I can find it by myself.

00:58:02.667 --> 00:58:04.752
- Wear this for now.
- No…

00:58:04.753 --> 00:58:08.131
I'm just trying to help
with your coughing, as an animator.

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.676
Plus, even if you dropped it here,
someone could have taken it.

00:58:13.762 --> 00:58:16.138
Anyway, let's go somewhere warm--

00:58:16.139 --> 00:58:17.140
I'll…

00:58:18.183 --> 00:58:19.684
deal with this by myself.

00:58:21.728 --> 00:58:23.188
Thanks for your concern,

00:58:23.939 --> 00:58:25.565
but leaving is helping me.

00:58:29.027 --> 00:58:30.903
What are you going to do, then?

00:58:30.904 --> 00:58:33.364
Wait out here
when you're coughing like this?

00:58:33.365 --> 00:58:34.825
It's just some pen.

00:58:37.452 --> 00:58:38.954
You don't know anything about it.

00:58:39.871 --> 00:58:43.667
I'm already upset
without you making it worse, so just…

00:58:48.255 --> 00:58:51.048
Where are you going?

00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:53.259
You won't leave me alone, so I'm leaving.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:57.680
It might be "just some pen,"
but I have to find it, no matter what.

00:58:59.683 --> 00:59:00.892
Fine, I'll leave.

00:59:01.768 --> 00:59:03.519
- So wear this.
- Please, just…

00:59:05.814 --> 00:59:06.857
Just take it.

00:59:38.555 --> 00:59:39.973
"Just some pen."

00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:44.435
I feel bad for saying that.

00:59:44.436 --> 00:59:45.729
Hey, roomie.

00:59:46.855 --> 00:59:48.648
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

00:59:49.524 --> 00:59:52.359
Gosh. Sorry.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.612
Oh, my…

00:59:54.487 --> 00:59:57.156
You must have gone through
something awful.

00:59:57.157 --> 01:00:00.076
- You always seemed so cheerful.
- Oh…

01:00:00.869 --> 01:00:02.745
Do you want to try touching it?

01:00:02.746 --> 01:00:04.872
It doesn't hurt at all now.

01:00:06.374 --> 01:00:10.086
It seems you got something drawn
on your chest.

01:00:10.795 --> 01:00:12.379
Ah. My tattoo?

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.590
But why is it "memento mori"
of all phrases?

01:00:14.591 --> 01:00:17.760
It's like a warning to myself.

01:00:17.761 --> 01:00:19.971
- A warning?
- Yes.

01:00:20.764 --> 01:00:23.850
"You never know when you might die."

01:00:24.768 --> 01:00:28.188
"So live your life without regrets."

01:00:28.688 --> 01:00:30.065
Something like that.

01:00:32.817 --> 01:00:34.610
But what's that for?

01:00:34.611 --> 01:00:36.779
Didn't you just pick this up somewhere?

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.530
Yes, it was snapped.

01:00:39.783 --> 01:00:42.201
Well, it grew roots.

01:00:42.202 --> 01:00:43.662
What?

01:00:46.414 --> 01:00:48.916
I thought it would wither soon.

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:51.336
I think it's time
to take it out of the glass.

01:00:52.212 --> 01:00:56.758
If I move it into a pot
and take good care of it, it'll grow well.

01:00:58.927 --> 01:01:00.929
Here you go.

01:01:08.228 --> 01:01:10.021
"Time to take it out"?

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:13.108
By the way, roomie.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:18.154
- Yes?
- So, are you living without any regrets?

01:01:26.037 --> 01:01:29.164
Why would you do that?
If something happened to you…

01:01:29.165 --> 01:01:32.751
Gosh.
You suddenly cut all contact with us.

01:01:32.752 --> 01:01:35.588
Sorry, Yujeong. I'm in a hurry right now.

01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:38.549
It's really valuable to me,
so I have to find it.

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:41.428
It might be "just some pen,"
but I have to find it.

01:01:44.264 --> 01:01:46.974
I think it's time
to take it out of the glass.

01:02:00.447 --> 01:02:02.323
Chan, do you remember

01:02:03.033 --> 01:02:06.119
how I said I felt like
I was surrounded by walls?

01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:17.296
I suddenly found myself
unable to sketch anything,

01:02:17.297 --> 01:02:19.173
and I had no energy.

01:02:19.174 --> 01:02:21.009
I just wanted to give up on everything.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.394
But when I first held the pen
you gave to me for my birthday,

01:02:32.395 --> 01:02:34.939
I was suddenly able to draw something.

01:02:35.774 --> 01:02:38.026
And I won first place
in the contest with it.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.279
I would have run away
if I hadn't gotten such great results.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.697
Excuse me.

01:02:43.698 --> 01:02:45.658
So you saved me.

01:02:46.868 --> 01:02:49.411
Thanks to you and this pen,

01:02:49.412 --> 01:02:51.873
I realized how much I love my job.

01:02:52.957 --> 01:02:55.501
It's a really precious pen to me.

01:02:55.502 --> 01:02:57.628
- "Haran" is engraved on the lid.
- Thank you.

01:02:57.629 --> 01:03:01.673
I'll draw lots of amazing clothes
and become a great designer.

01:03:01.674 --> 01:03:04.010
Excuse me.

01:03:04.886 --> 01:03:07.137
I'm sorry, but we have to go home now.

01:03:07.138 --> 01:03:09.056
Right. I'm sorry.

01:03:09.057 --> 01:03:13.103
If you ever find it,
can you contact me through this number?

01:03:17.607 --> 01:03:21.903
So, are you living
without any regrets?

01:03:23.488 --> 01:03:24.738
No.

01:03:24.739 --> 01:03:26.991
I think I'll have a lot of regrets later.

01:03:27.826 --> 01:03:30.453
Then what should you do
to not have regrets?

01:03:31.496 --> 01:03:34.374
I want someone
to have joy in their life.

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:37.376
Instead of their bleak life now,

01:03:37.377 --> 01:03:40.796
I want it to be vibrant, like before.

01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:43.299
I lived like that thanks to her.

01:03:44.092 --> 01:03:46.552
Then you can give her that joy.

01:03:46.553 --> 01:03:50.890
I'd love to,
but I'm not sure if I have the right.

01:03:51.391 --> 01:03:56.312
I don't think you need rights
to want someone to be happy,

01:03:57.063 --> 01:04:00.399
as long as you're sincere about it.

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:11.827
- Hello? Did you find--
- You're still there, right?

01:04:11.828 --> 01:04:14.079
Are you there?
I have something to tell you.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.664
No, I'm…

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.714
I guess you haven't found it yet.

01:04:23.339 --> 01:04:24.673
Well…

01:04:24.674 --> 01:04:26.843
I'm sorry. I was rude earlier.

01:04:29.137 --> 01:04:30.679
Hang on…

01:04:35.977 --> 01:04:38.979
"Let's live so I won't have any regrets
when they close my coffin."

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:42.442
That's my life motto.
But I thought I'd have regrets.

01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:45.570
That's why I came here.
I didn't want that to happen.

01:04:47.906 --> 01:04:51.950
I return to the US in three months,
and I probably won't come back to Korea.

01:04:51.951 --> 01:04:53.368
Why are you telling me this?

01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:56.330
I want to meddle in each other's affairs,
feel indebted,

01:04:56.331 --> 01:04:59.042
and have fun together with you, Ms. Song.

01:05:00.627 --> 01:05:02.044
What are you saying?

01:05:02.045 --> 01:05:04.380
Let's not think about the past or future.

01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:06.382
Let's just have fun

01:05:07.133 --> 01:05:08.717
until I head back.

01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:11.095
Just until next spring.

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:14.139
Let's have fun like we're on a picnic.

01:05:18.186 --> 01:05:21.022
But I'm really curious.

01:05:21.606 --> 01:05:25.610
Who is this person you want to be happy?

01:05:51.678 --> 01:05:53.263
I was trying to die…

01:05:56.516 --> 01:05:58.059
And I almost died.

01:05:59.269 --> 01:06:01.688
But she brought me back twice.

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:05.191
A grateful disruption

01:06:06.192 --> 01:06:07.819
that made me live again.

01:06:10.905 --> 01:06:14.784
Is it okay if I start being
really nice to you from now on?

01:06:29.132 --> 01:06:30.883
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

01:06:54.991 --> 01:06:57.617
I don't think
we'll ever be friends.

01:06:57.618 --> 01:07:00.704
Someone who's "talking" to a guy
is home at this hour?

01:07:00.705 --> 01:07:04.124
I can't even go to the cafe
I love the most because of you!

01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:06.543
I don't need any new variables.

01:07:06.544 --> 01:07:11.089
A lot of them
just wither and die.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:15.761
I'll move out
so we don't have to see each other again.

01:07:15.762 --> 01:07:20.057
I'll be gone
once our contract is over in three months.

01:07:21.267 --> 01:07:25.229
I'd like to step away
from this collaboration project.

01:07:37.116 --> 01:07:38.200
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

01:07:38.201 --> 01:07:39.202
