00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.490
Ren said he fought with an important friend of his.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.700
I've never seen Ren like that before.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.250
I'm too prideful to let some girl trouble ruin our friendship.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.990
That's some weird sense of pride you've got.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.680
All I know is that Ichinose bought her a keychain

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.880
to replace the one he broke.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.110
She probably likes Ichinose.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.630
That's none of your business.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.670
Kinoshita. Want to join our groups together?

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.140
That girl needs to learn about personal space.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.660
I regret breaking up with you, Uehara.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.410
Are you okay being "just friends" forever?

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.930
Even though I'm right at his side...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.410
I'm the closest,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.240
yet furthest I've been from him.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.600
There's already a crowd here.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.780
Lots of groups chose this temple as their last spot.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.910
Seems like it.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.650
How should we kill time until our trip's officially over?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.260
- Maybe another selfie?
- Look, there's Daiki.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.920
I'll help take it.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.210
Are they... arguing?

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.230
I'm going to see what's up.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.100
She kissed him?

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.560
- Sayu!
- Uehara.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.980
Uehara.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.840
Let go.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.480
Sayu!

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.440
- She probably wasn't...
- What do I do?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.010
What if those two really were...

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.190
If Daiki already likes her more,
nothing I do will change his mind.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.190
We can't be sure of how Daiki feels yet.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.800
I'm sorry.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.950
This is my fault.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.250
Your ex-boyfriend was Terada?

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.170
I'm sorry I never told you two.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.470
I thought I was over the whole ordeal,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.180
but I guess it still bothers me after all.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.750
Another girl stole him from right under my nose.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.470
So have you asked Daiki about the supposed "kiss" yet?

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.910
No, not yet.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.760
Sayuri!

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.040
Morning.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.430
- Morning.
- You didn't pick up when I called last night. Everything okay?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.070
I went to sleep early after the trip yesterday.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.040
- Sorry.
- Don't sweat it. I'm making up for it now.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.220
Daiki, hurry up.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.460
Coming.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.970
- I'll see you again later.
- Yeah.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.260
He seems as devoted to you as ever.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.730
I'm sure it just looked like those two were kissing.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.930
You should go ask him about it now.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.330
- What?
- I'd feel bad for him if it was all a misunderstanding.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.030
Agreed.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.050
You're right.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.110
This isn't like you, Sayu.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.800
Yeah.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.440
What does it even mean to be "like" me?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.010
You'd never understand how I feel right now, Ninako.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.730
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I was just taking it out on you.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.320
I'm so sorry.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.290
I'm sorry, too.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.220
I'm going to go cool my head.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.340
It seems like this is really bothering her...

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.660
What did you need from me?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.990
And on the roof, no less.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.210
It's my fault...

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.210
that you're afraid to ask your boyfriend the truth, isn't it?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.190
That's not...

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.480
Uehara, I've always wanted to apologize to you.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.940
What happened back then wasn't solely your fault, Terada.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.400
I always asked for too much.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.660
I took your kindness for granted, too.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.740
I really think I did something awful to you.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.990
I shouldn't have put that other girl's confession on hold
when I already had you.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.690
The fact that I even considered dating her instead,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.930
is unforgivable.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.650
Hold on a second.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.260
You weren't two-timing me with that girl?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.410
No.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.270
No way.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.460
That's not what I heard.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.690
Who told you that?

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.560
I don't know.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.630
But that's definitely what I heard...

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.420
Maybe we wouldn't have broken up

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.590
if the two of us actually talked it out.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.340
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.190
It does.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.830
Uehara.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.770
Are you going to repeat our mistakes?

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.240
Go tell your boyfriend what's on your mind.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.590
[Episode 3]

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.560
Sayuri, let's go grab some juice together.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.250
Sure.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.950
Genta apparently bought out
all the new bread they just stocked.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.060
I can't believe he'd hog it all, that jerk.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.630
Daiki.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.280
What's up?

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.260
There's something I want to ask you.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.800
Yesterday, at the end of our school trip, did you...

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.430
Kiss a girl?

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.910
What?

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.950
Of course not. Why the heck would I...

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.220
No, wait. I was just helping her.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.210
I got a bug in my eye. Get it out, Daiki!

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.430
Ew, no. Get it out yourself.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.520
I'm asking you because I can't do it myself!

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.610
Then quit acting so pushy.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.210
Sorry. Please get it out, I'm begging you.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.930
Fine.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.870
I was getting a bug out of her eye!

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.880
You were getting a bug out of her eye?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.040
Yeah. That's all that happened. Seriously.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.920
Daiki! What're you up to?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.100
Hey, we didn't kiss each other yesterday, right?

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.490
What? Why in the world would I kiss you?

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.880
See? You heard her.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.820
Thank god.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.200
Is that what's been on your mind?

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.040
Silly Sayuri.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.810
But...

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.470
Sorry.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.470
I didn't mean to make you worry so much.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.720
Next time, tell me if there's something on your mind.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.740
You're the one who said we share our burdens, remember?

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.360
Sorry.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.410
I'm also sorry.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.950
But don't worry,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.800
I don't see Daiki as a guy at all.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.390
Don't get so close to him.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.040
Do you find my selfishness annoying?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.940
This is just how I am, okay?

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.000
Were you... jealous of other girls?

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.040
Man, that sort of makes me happy to hear.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.190
Sorry to interrupt your sweet time, you two.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.000
But you've got eyes on you from all around!

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:15.200
Quit staring. This isn't a show!

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.380
Aw, they're holding hands.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.760
Adorable!

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.910
I'm glad things worked out for Daiki.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.450
- Same here.
- Right?

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800
Yu.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.500
Do you still have a crush on Sayuri?

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.590
I doubt you'd find any room
to weasel your way back in though.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.290
It's fine.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.190
I was able to get everything off my chest anyway.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.650
Now I'll finally be able to move on.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.310
I can't say the same for myself.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.180
Long time no see, Ren.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.500
Long time no see.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.440
Sorry this was on short notice.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.000
It's fine. I had some books I wanted to return to you anyway.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.400
I lent you books?

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.200
Apparently. I found them while I was packing up to move.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.410
You're moving?

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.520
Yeah. I decided to move out to the city on my own.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.120
I'll be closer to my university,
and it'll be more convenient for modeling work, too.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.410
I see.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.080
Mayuka. I have things I haven't told you yet.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:31.060
I wasn't able to keep my promise to you.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:37.300
I told you some things wouldn't ever change.
That I'd stay by your side, forever.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.700
I'm sorry.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:54.610
I know you were trying to be faithful to me, Ren.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.460
Besides, you aren't the only one who changed.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.200
Sometimes relationships fizzle out,
even though there's no bad blood between us.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.000
Mayuka.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.050
Thank you.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.460
Good bye.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.820
Good bye.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.400
Kinoshita.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.280
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.540
Thanks for lending me your hoodie the other day.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.420
Sure thing.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.130
You're such a nice guy, Ren.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:14.660
I didn't think you'd lend a hoodie to anyone
before I knew you.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.140
People often say I look like a cold person.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.370
They should really get to know you better.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.570
Then everyone would realize you're just misunderstood.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:30.520
I don't need everyone to understand,
so long as one person out there gets me.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:37.690
- Then I'll -
- I already think you're one of those people, Kinoshita.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.620
Well, you're correct.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.000
Thanks.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.500
I know you tend to smile a lot around your friends, too.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.360
Yeah. I smile when I want to smile.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:15:00.940
Does that mean I make him want to smile?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.760
That song.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:19.020
I was just thinking of the chorus as well.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.320
Really?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.110
It's like we're in sync.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.460
Yeah. I think so, too.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.360
I have a gut feeling.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.440
That someday, in the near future...

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.030
I won't be able to hold back these feelings of mine.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:53.850
Even if that means destroying our comfortable distance.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.330
Looks like Yu's love story has come to an end.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.170
Stop that.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.760
Takumi, don't you have a crush on anyone?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.510
I do.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.570
But they won't even give me a chance.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.560
What? Someone even you can't charm?

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.720
Who's the lucky individual?

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.500
If you knew, you'd be put in a pickle.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.000
Don't tell me... I'm your special someone?

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:57.600
What?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.690
- Morning.
- Ninako, help.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.900
She keeps making fun of me.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.240
- Poke, poke.
- Morning.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.720
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.240
- So you walked here together with Ninako?
- Yeah.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.270
Ando.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.440
We need to talk.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:39.560
What? I don't exactly feel excited
being invited out back by a guy.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.420
Ren?

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.470
Ando.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.410
I like Kinoshita.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:12.220
Huh? Don't call me out here
to tell me something I already know.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:17.020
You deserve to hear it from me directly.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.880
You, of all people.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.800
I won't try to pretend I feel one way anymore.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.040
That's all.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.800
How long have you been there?

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.800
I only just walked by.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.220
Really now.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.730
I have something I want to give you.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.450
What now?

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.420
Isn't that...

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.990
I picked it up off the floor.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.060
It's something Ichinose gave Ninako, or so I heard.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.370
Toss it away if you want.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.920
Or return it to Ninako.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.170
She might appreciate that.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.840
[WELCOME! Today's recommendations]

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.010
- Thank you.
- Thank you, come again.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.540
Phew, I'm stuffed.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.960
That's nice.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.780
What is?

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.660
Those two held hands together,

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.930
as if it were second nature to them.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.270
What is it I want to happen?

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.320
Pichan.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.020
Good night.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:23.040
What sort of person will Ren fall for next?

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.220
Who will Ren eventually have a crush on?

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.980
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.900
What're you listening to?

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.160
Here.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.240
I wanted to listen to the full song.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.550
This really is a catchy song.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.840
Yeah, I got super into it again. It's my current favorite.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.980
I like it, too.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.980
It's a great song.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.020
- See you in class.
- Yeah.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:14.030
If I don't tell him how I feel,
I can continue to be at his side like this.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.470
- But...
- Morning, Ren.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.850
- Morning.
- Good morning Hirataka, Urakawa.

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.050
The girls in our class have started talking more with Ren.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.020
Seems like it.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.620
I'm surprised by the change.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:33.150
I can't just sit here,
and watch Ren fall in love with someone else.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.150
Absolutely not.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.310
I think I'm at my limit.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.090
Ninako?

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.280
I don't want to destroy our relationship now.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.410
But more importantly...

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.700
I don't want to be just friends.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.530
I want to be Ren's...

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.660
Girlfriend.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.800
I know that sounds ridiculous,
since I've been rejected already.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.100
No, I like the honesty!

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.980
Besides, this is how you actually feel, right?

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.750
I'll do my best, you two.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.230
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.430
You got this!

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.220
Thanks, you two.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:46.910
Toss it away if you want.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.530
Or return it to Ninako. She might appreciate that.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.480
My type?

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.070
I'll overcome your preferences.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.570
I'll join the cheer team!

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:10.860
Yeah!

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.690
I want to be there for you, Kinoshita.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:18.610
- Do you like Ichinose?
- Not anymore.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.130
[Epilogue]

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.210
I'm here to take my break.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.010
- Great work out there.
- Thank you.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.840
Ritsuko!

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.160
Here.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.810
What's this?

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.030
A present, from me to you.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.180
Ouch.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.650
I'll also give you this.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.410
It's a keychain I got from Kamakura.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.960
There.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.880
Why would you do all this for me?

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.540
Because I like you.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.790
Eat that all up, okay?

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.610
Want a bite?

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.780
Is it your birthday today?
[LOVE Ritsuko]

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.400
No.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.680
Thanks for the cake.
[Love Ritsuko]

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.170
Yes!

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.510
Did you eat that cake for her?

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:44.310
I ate a bite, but Ritsuko ate the rest.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.390
Was it good?

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.050
It was fine.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.940
You have cream on your cheek.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.210
Just kidding.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.010
Stop that.
