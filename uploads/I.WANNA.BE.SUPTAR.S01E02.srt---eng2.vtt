WEBVTT

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.640
Are you the armpit stand-in?

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.840
- Yes, I am.
- Whoa.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.160
Win Pawee?

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.680
Win Pawee?

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.960
When did you get back to Thailand?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.640
How is it, Win? Like the house?

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.800
Why did you move in so fast?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.000
So Win Pawee is the one who bought this house?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.240
Does this house have some kind of history?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.600
I feel like something’s off.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.800
Win, why do you look like
you haven’t slept at all?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.440
Yeah, I didn’t sleep all night.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.240
This house has a ghost.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.800
Tom, why did you invite a monk?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.000
You were the one who said
this house has a ghost.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.640
This is a straight-to-the-point solution.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.840
Okay, that’s funny.
Inviting monk...

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.440
Amen, Luang Por.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.440
You don’t have to bless me that much.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.320
Inside the house is fine.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.840
Luang Por.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.720
The kitchen would be better.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.000
The scene of the incident.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.080
Luang Por.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.440
Right here is good.
Where it happened.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.280
Please bless everywhere.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.320
Since we’re at it anyway,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.720
could you do that room too?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.440
This room too.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.320
That room over there as well, Luang Por.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.400
Don’t forget under the bed too, Luang Por.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.320
Ghosts like hiding under beds.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.000
Tom, don’t talk like that.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.920
I’m serious. Haven’t you watched movies?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.440
Then please really focus, Luang Por.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.640
A…men. This way, please.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.720
A…men.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.920
Singing competition today.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.400
Feeling lucky.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.320
Might get through without even trying.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.520
- Hey there.
- I’m ready.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.720
Great. Go ahead.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.520
Hello, my name is Miss Wanneung.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.120
- Rojana…
- You can start singing.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.320
Okay.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.320
Okay, that’s enough.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.000
I’ve only sung a few words.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200
Thank you. Come back again next year.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.280
I came last year too.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.800
And you said the exact same thing.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.640
Please, just a little more.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.840
That’s enough. Please leave.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.920
How am I supposed to get into the house?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.520
Why aren’t you going to bed yet?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720
I’m already so sleepy.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640
You.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800
You.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.280
Give me your hand.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.720
Give me your hand.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.920
Hold my hand.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.240
Help!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.360
- You’re okay now.
- Help! Help!

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.400
Hey.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.640
Hey.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.040
Please help me.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.600
Easy, okay?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.240
You’re safe now.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.400
Calm down.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.440
You’re safe.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.920
Win Pawee.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.680
Win Pawee.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.000
Can I take a selfie with you?

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.920
I really like you...

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.920
You again?

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.920
You followed me all the way home?

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.040
- Well…
- You’re a sasaeng, right?

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.480
How did you get into my house?
What do you want?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.640
Photos? Or digging up my secrets?

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120
Well...

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.840
- I…
- If you don’t tell me, I’ll call the police.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.440
Hey you, what would you report me for?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.640
Breaking into someone’s house without permission.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.200
I’m not a sasaeng.
I’m nothing like that.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.400
This is my house.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.640
Your house?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.880
Don’t lie and make things up.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.880
You own a house with a pool,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.120
but you can’t even swim?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.680
When I was a kid, I fell into the water.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.080
Right here. In this pool.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.600
So I ended up with a fear of swimming.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.800
Isn’t it true

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.120
that you’ve been following me
since the mall the other day?

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.120
Do you know this is illegal?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.280
I’m calling…

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.000
It’s not like that.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.440
This really is my house.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.520
- I don’t care anymore.
- Win Pawee.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.600
Do you know how much
this house means to me?

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.440
I was born here.
I grew up here.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.400
Look at this wall.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.440
It’s my very first abstract piece ever.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.440
Look at that.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.280
When I was a kid, I kicked a ball
and it bounced into it.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.080
Look at my progress.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.480
From when I was this short,

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.920
to this tall now.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.800
That’s how much this house means to me.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.840
You really…

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.640
were short since you were a kid, huh?

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.520
I’m not short.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240
Hey.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.840
Don’t let go of me.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.480
If you don’t want me to call the police,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.280
then get out of my house right now.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.920
I’m not leaving. I’ll stay.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
One.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.880
I love this place.
This is my home.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.920
Two.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.400
If you want me gone,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.000
then kill me instead.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.720
- Three.
- Hey.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.240
Please let me stay here.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.520
Get out. Now.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.720
- Hey… so I can stay, right?
- Are you serious?

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.960
- Get out.
- No.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.040
No.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720
Hey.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.080
Wait. Just listen to me first.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.000
I really am the owner of this house.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040
Hey.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.240
Hey.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720
Hey.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520
Win.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.640
It’s May.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.120
Sorry for calling so late.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.320
Where did you get my number?

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.920
I asked your mom for it.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.840
Why did you bother my mom?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.640
If you have something to say, say it fast.
It’s late. I’m going to bed.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.040
I just miss you.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.920
I wanted to talk to you.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.240
And…

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.240
I wanted to tell you that

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.600
right now, I’m all alone.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.640
No one can stop our love anymore, Win.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.840
Let’s get back…

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.040
May?

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.720
What’s wrong, May?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.080
Hello?

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.320
May, answer me. May?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.920
Should I sneak into the house again?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.480
But if he actually calls the police,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.840
what am I supposed to do?

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.640
That could totally end my career
in entertainment.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.920
Could you be a little gentler?

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.120
Sorry, it needs to be wrapped pretty tight.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.920
All set.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.000
Next time, you really need
to be more careful.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.520
Don’t just stand on the roadside
talking on the phone like that.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.280
You could get hit by a motorbike.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.040
You’re lucky it’s just your ankle.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.280
You wrapped it this tight,

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.800
will it leave marks on my leg?

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.880
I need my legs for work tomorrow.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.440
What kind of work?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.720
What work?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.440
You know what I do for a living.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.400
How would I know?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.320
This is literally our first day meeting.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.120
Look at my face carefully.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.040
Avoid putting weight on your foot.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.280
No high heels.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.200
Otherwise your ankle could get worse.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.720
You could even end up with vein problems.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.920
- I…
- If there’s nothing else,

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.200
I’ll excuse myself now.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.240
Doctor, tomorrow I…

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720
May.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040
Win.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.040
I knew you’d come, Win.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.120
How are you?

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.440
The doctor said it’s just a mild ankle sprain.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.240
I’m glad you came, Win.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.840
Could you take me home?

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.040
There’s something I want to talk to you about.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.320
- Well…
- Please, Win.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.120
With my ankle like this,
I can’t drive myself home.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.720
Thanks for bringing me home, Win.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.240
Do you want to come in for a drink?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.720
I’d rather not.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.720
Hey.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.720
Why aren’t you going home?

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.920
And… is that your bag?

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.040
I have nowhere to go.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.520
Tonight,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.320
can I sleep in front of your house?

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.240
You’re not going to call the police on me, right?

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.520
Okay.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.440
I’ll let you sleep inside the house tonight.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.440
But only for one night.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.040
Thank you.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.840
You’re burning up.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.520
Go change first.
I’ll get you some medicine.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400
Hey.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720
Hey.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.840
Take your medicine first.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.520
Don’t fall asleep yet.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.520
Wake up and take the medicine first.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Hey.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.320
I don’t mean to pry or anything.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.920
I just want to know if you’re a scammer
or a sasaeng.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.040
Rojanphanphong.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.240
Same last name as the real owner.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.320
This is already past the flight date.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.440
Or are you really the owner?

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.720
What’s wrong?

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.040
Did you do something to me last night?

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.840
My bra…

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.240
where did it go?

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.640
I’m not even wearing my underwear.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.240
Listen.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.800
I was just scared someone might get sick
and die in my house.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.640
So I changed your clothes for you.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.200
From what I saw,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.440
you look like a twelve-year-old.
There’s nothing there.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.880
Hey, Win.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.120
Who said I don’t have any?

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.920
I… do.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.520
Fine, you do.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.320
Hey…

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.000
Do I really have to lose
my visual innocence to you?

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.720
If my mom finds out, I’m so getting scolded.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.240
I’m definitely getting yelled at.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.240
Can you stop freaking out for a second?

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.800
You’re talking this much,

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.040
so clearly you’re not sick anymore.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.960
You’re fine now, right?

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520
Good.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.640
Then you can leave my house now.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.520
Please.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.040
Okay, okay, okay!

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.920
Rice porridge.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.160
Mmm… smells good.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.000
Wait, wait!

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.440
Hey, what are you doing?

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.200
My name is Wanneung.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.440
Stop calling me “you.”
It feels weirdly distant.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.800
We’re not close though.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.120
And how can you just eat my food like that?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.600
Well, you made it for me, didn’t you?

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.000
I saw there were two bowls.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.600
See? I helped you eat already.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.400
Come on, come eat with me.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.400
You’re actually pretty good at cooking.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.600
You could open a restaurant.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.320
And the fish is super… fresh.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.920
Hey, aren’t you eating?

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.320
Then… I’ll take the fish.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.120
Just a little, okay?

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.720
Win.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.880
Have you seen the photos?

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.840
There are leaked photos of you on X.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.880
Hey.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.200
If you’re done eating,
clean up and then leave my house.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.720
Win Pawee cooked me breakfast.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.520
No one would believe that if I said it.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.120
Hope today’s a good day for you, Wanneung.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.720
Turn down all the reporters, Tom.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.840
I’m not doing interviews with anyone.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.720
Tom.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.320
Do whatever it takes
to get people off my back.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.040
I just want some peace.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.440
And don’t tell May either

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.920
that I’m staying here.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.240
That’s all. Thanks so much.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120
Hey.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.600
Thanks for the food and the place to stay.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.720
I’m heading out now.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.240
Wait.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.440
What about your bag?

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.680
I’ll leave it here for now.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.800
I’ll come back for it tonight. Bye-bye.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.440
- Wait…
- I’ll be back tonight.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.800
Take it with you first.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.920
Hey.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.440
Move a little.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.320
Tilt the sign a bit.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.200
So pretty.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.720
- Freshie, look this way.
- Freshie, over here.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.320
- Freshie!
- Take photos, take photos.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.600
- So pretty.
- So pretty.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.240
She’s booked already.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.440
Alright, that’s pretty much
the full stage lineup for today.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040
Sound okay?

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.000
You’re new, right?

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.520
My name is Wanneung.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.080
Okay, I’ll have you take care of May,

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.680
and don’t forget to check her schedule too.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720
Got it.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.520
We’ll recheck the interview again later.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.480
Beautiful.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.800
- Hello…
- Khun Waanwaan.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.800
- How are you?
- I’m good.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.440
- You look so handsome today.
- That’s P’ Waanwaan.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.400
- Thank you, Khun Waanwaan.
- There.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.800
The number one celebrity manager in Thailand.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.840
My chance to become a superstar is here.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.920
Hey!

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.800
Where are you going?

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.200
Didn’t I tell you to take care of May?

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.920
Go get May. The event starts in five minutes.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.800
Okay.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.120
And don’t forget to tell May about the reporters.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.240
- Got it.
- Go.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.040
Smile nicely, sweetheart. Smile.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.480
What old flame are you talking about?

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.040
May and Win are just friends.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.800
Miss May…

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.680
And those photos all over the internet…

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.640
what do they mean?

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.720
Hey.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.320
What are you doing lurking around there?

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.080
I just came to tell May that

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.000
the event starts in five minutes.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.000
And there will be reporters waiting
to interview her after the event.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.440
Are you okay, May?

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.440
I’m fine.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.440
The stage is ready.
Are you ready, May?

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.720
May, is your leg okay?

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.400
It’s okay now.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.400
I stopped by the doctor this morning
for a painkiller shot.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.120
I can walk much better now.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.680
So beautiful.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.000
- Perfect.
- So good.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.880
- So pretty.
- The aura is unreal.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.880
- You’re glowing, sweetheart.
- Your aura is shining. So beautiful.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.200
- May, look at this camera.
- You look amazing on camera.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.320
- Such strong aura. Beautiful.
- Totally glowing. So beautiful.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.880
Flawless head to toe.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.200
- Beautiful.
- So beautiful.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.040
Miss May, are you ready?

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.440
- I’m ready.
- Okay, let’s start.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.600
- I want to ask…
- Wait, wait.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.880
Is the person behind her staff?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.600
Please step aside,
you’re in the frame.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.400
- Let me do the interview first.
- Move a bit, dear.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.480
- She’s being interviewed.
- Please, dear…

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.440
- Ready.
- Thank you.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.880
About the leaked photos last night,
what happened?

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.080
So does this mean May
has broken up with her husband…

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.200
Because May is getting back together
with Win Pawee…

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.720
is that true?

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.200
What do you mean…

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.880
- What do you mean?
- Is it true?

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.880
How about we talk about today’s event first?

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.400
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.480
First of all, I really want to thank
the executives

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.080
for giving me the opportunity
to be a presenter, and

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.160
I hope everyone will support

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.920
this great product from the brand as well.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.120
- She’s so good at selling.
- So cute, such a pro.

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.640
- Customers will love her.
- Sales are going to be huge.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.480
As for Win…

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.600
- So how is it?
- Go on, dear.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.600
I want to confirm that

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.040
right now, we’re just friends.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.280
- Really just friends?
- Friends?

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.320
Just friends.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.920
But about Win coming back to Thailand…

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.800
I think Win might

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.120
have some good news coming up.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.800
- What? Good news?
- Hold on, wait…

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.800
What kind of good news?
Is he getting married?

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.280
Or are you two getting back together?

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.880
Which is it?

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.400
I meant work-related news.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.040
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.200
As in work…

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.880
Win might be working on
a really big project.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.840
Like an international co-production film.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.120
- Did May just spoil something?
- What is she even saying?

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.440
- Not at all.
- Not at all.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.240
What was May talking about?

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.440
Is Win coming back for a co-production film?

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.040
That’s crazy. No way.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.280
Is it the same project
P’ Waanwaan said Gam might get?

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.520
That’s the one.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.280
Excuse me.
Sorry…may I have May for a moment?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.720
May, please come this way.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.600
Can we get a quick interview?
How did you two meet in that leaked photo?

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.480
- Just a quick one, please.
- P’ Waanwaan…

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.200
- They’re definitely dating.
- Exactly.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.720
Sorry.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.520
Sorry, sorry.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.400
Sorry.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.400
Sorry.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.120
P’ Waanwaan.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.320
Are you heading out already?

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.480
- Waanwaan…
- About what just happened…

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.200
I wasn’t trying to listen or anything,

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.000
I just happened to hear May say it.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.600
I’m not sure if May

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.720
said it to stir up some buzz or not,

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.960
because right now,

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.120
there’s only one co-production film,
isn’t there?

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.680
And Waanwaan has had the chance

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.520
to talk with the investor group.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.680
- Who?
- The project where Gam

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.040
would be taking the lead role.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.960
- Let’s take photos of Gam.
- Photos, please.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.800
This is Gam,
Waanwaan’s newest girl.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.720
Why don’t we have Gam introduce herself
to everyone, okay?

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.480
- Hello, everyone.
- So cute.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.000
My name is Gam.
I’m new to the industry.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.400
- Please take good care of me.
- Of course.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.280
- So cute, you’re going to be huge.
- Such a sweet smile. Adorable.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.480
P’ Waanwaan, P’ Waanwaan.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.520
So does that mean you’ll be returning
as Win Pawee’s personal manager?

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.520
Yeah, that’s the question.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.480
A question like that…

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.720
did you already plan it out?

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.400
Well, we haven’t talked about that yet.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.800
Ever since Win got back from overseas,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.480
she’s probably still very busy.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.680
But once we talk and have an update…

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.840
Please let us know as soon as you can.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.320
Let’s bring them out together.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.440
Sure.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.480
Go, go, go.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.280
- How is it? Nervous?
- A little.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.480
- Don’t be scared. Smile and be confident.
- Hello, P’ Waanwaan.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.400
- My name is Wanneung.
- You can start the interview.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.520
- The flash always catches us, you know?
- P’ Waanwaan.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.920
Yes?

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.400
My name is Wanneung, P’ Waanwaan.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.440
- P’ Waanwaan, I’m going to the restroom for a bit.
- Okay.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.040
- P’ Waanwaan.
- I’ll go with you.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.920
P’ Waanwaan.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.120
Wanneung.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.720
Are you done already?

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.840
It’s not done yet. Hurry up and help clear things first.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.240
Are you trying to kick me out?

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.000
I’m not leaving.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.480
You…don’t let go of me.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.400
Please help me.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.680
You broke into someone else’s house.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.080
Why should I help you?

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120
You…

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.600
- Please…
- Get out of my house.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.840
No.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
You…

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.000
I’m not leaving.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.040
Go.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.240
Go.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.600
Please let me stay here.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.480
Please have mercy on me.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.680
Please, feel sorry for me.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.320
Don’t kick me out.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.000
Hey, that was my first kiss.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.800
What are you doing, Win Pawee?

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.080
You have to take responsibility.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.920
You…hey…

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.920
You’re the one who kissed me.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.200
It was an accident.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.000
But still, you have to take responsibility.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.320
Because yesterday you already saw me…

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.880
naked once.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.640
And today you’re still going to steal…

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.600
my first kiss too.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.080
Even if I’m crazy about celebrities,

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.840
you stealing my kiss like this…

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.000
that’s not right.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.320
I’m someone’s daughter too, you know.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.880
And if my parents find out…

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.920
- They’ll worry about me.
- That doesn’t even count as a kiss.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.040
If you’re gonna kiss…

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.240
Hey! Hey!

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.280
You! You!

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.800
- What are you doing to me?
- Kissing.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.600
Stop it! Stop!

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.640
Stop!

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.040
Or I’ll…

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.000
- You’ll what?
- I’ll…

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.640
What exactly?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.320
I’ll…

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.800
I’ll tell the press.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.840
I’ll expose everything.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.320
And most importantly…

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.800
I’ll tell May too.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.320
That you’re here.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.240
Maybe I should call the press now.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.120
Who should I call...

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.880
One Day Entertainment News?

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.480
What’s the number again...

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.520
Wait.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.040
So, have you decided?

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.200
Why don’t you tell me your story?

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.800
In detail.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.920
Convince me you’re not
a scammer or a sasaeng.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.400
In detail, right?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.440
Yeah.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.600
I was born on May sixth, okay?

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.200
- That’s too detailed.
- Then what do you want from me?

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.400
Start with why your mom sold the house.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.960
Why you ditched the ticket
and didn’t go to England.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.920
Well…

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.320
It’s just that…

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.280
I have a dream.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.000
I want to be a superstar, just like you.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.400
So…

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.800
Ever since I was a kid,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.400
I’ve been going to auditions,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.600
and performing in stage plays.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.800
Right now,

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.280
I’m an extra,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.200
and part of the backstage crew,

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.320
because I’ll do anything

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.440
to stay in the entertainment industry.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.480
That’s my life.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.000
Detailed enough for you?

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.240
Anything else you want to hear?

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.400
Hey…you.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.720
Did you just fall asleep on me?

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.840
Hey, were you even listening?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.680
I talked for so long.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.080
I told you everything in detail.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.520
You did listen, right?

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.640
Are you done?

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.480
So…

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.600
That means…

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.720
you’ll let me stay here now?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.800
I’m not a sasaeng.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.320
And I’m not a scammer either.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.400
I really am the owner of this house.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.800
You must’ve seen the photo…

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.000
me standing in front of this house with my parents.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.840
I really lived here. I…

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.640
Fine. You can stay.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.120
Really?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.400
Thank you so much.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.680
You’re seriously the nicest.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.640
You’re so pretty and…

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.520
But…

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.040
There’s a condition.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.520
A… condition?

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.840
What are you doing, Win?

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.720
You can stay here,

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.440
but we need to agree on the rules first.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.400
Sure, no problem.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.320
Go ahead, what is it?

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.800
Rule number one: no crossing boundaries.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.400
You stay in your space…

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.120
I stay in my zone. You stay in yours.
No crossing lines.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.000
That includes my stuff.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.200
- You’re not allowed to use it.
- Stingy.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.640
And I know you’ve been sneaking food
from my fridge.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.480
Don’t let it happen again.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.000
So heartless.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.000
Rule number two: no mess.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.600
Anything you use in this house,

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.000
put it back where it belongs.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.080
And don’t make things dirty.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.440
Relax, I’m a clean person.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.480
Rule number three:

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.880
No loud noises.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.720
At all. I hate noise.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.440
Rule number four:

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.280
I wake up at six to work out.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.680
You have only two hours to use the kitchen
before I come back for breakfast.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.280
From ten to two,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.120
I need full focus for work.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.600
From six to eight,

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.200
I watch the news.

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.800
You shouldn’t touch the TV.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.080
Better yet, don’t even be
in the living room.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.680
I go to bed before ten.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.600
After that, do whatever you want.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.200
But whatever you do,
do NOT wake me up.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.320
Got it?

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.600
I can’t remember all that.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640
That’s fine.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.840
If you say you can’t remember,

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.840
I’ll print it out for you.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.840
Wait, weren’t there only four rules?

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.040
Yeah.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.000
Read them all and memorize them.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.040
Especially the last one.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.640
The fact that you’re living
in the same house as me…

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.000
you’re not allowed to tell anyone.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.520
Keep it a secret.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.800
Like I’d ever want to talk about you.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.600
That’s all, right?

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.040
Just survive this first.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.000
How hard could it be?

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.640
Rule number one: no crossing lines.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.680
Rule number three:

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.520
No loud noises. At all.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.840
You’re stepping on the line.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.120
If I don’t cross it,
how am I supposed to get to my room?

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.440
You’ve got five seconds.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.720
Five…

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720
Four…

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.800
Three…

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.920
Two…

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.040
Why are you so mean?

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.400
Hello, Tom. What’s up?

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.120
Remember what May said in that interview?

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.640
About…

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.640
you coming back to work in the industry?

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.880
Yeah.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.040
Why?

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.520
But that’s not true.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.640
I never planned on coming back.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.520
May had the team send you a script,

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.040
and wants you to meet the director.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.720
Tom, I’m not interested.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.440
But I read the script.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.040
It’s really good.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.200
You should at least take a look.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.120
And if you blow up again,

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.080
it’ll help clear that clip scandal.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.920
That’s enough, Tom. I’m sleepy.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.000
I ran out of mine.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.480
So I borrowed yours to eat first.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.240
But I’ll buy some and pay you back.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.240
Sorry. I really will replace it, I promise.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.640
What are you doing?

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.640
Can you help me take a look?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.840
No…don’t. Don’t come closer.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.200
Don’t…don’t mess with me.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.640
Or I’ll…

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.520
Don’t touch me.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.840
So, Win Pawee?

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.480
Shocked, right?

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.040
Because my acting is that good, huh?

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.520
I’m going to an ad casting today.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.920
After seeing that performance,

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.640
you think I’ll totally get the job, right?

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.120
If you do,

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.120
I’ll make you grilled pork.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.480
You’re so nice.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.400
Then I want lots of pork belly.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.720
Bacon too…shrimp, shellfish, crab, fish. All of it.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.440
Deal.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.840
But if you don’t get it, no food.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.240
And you pay this month’s electricity bill.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.440
Okay?

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:21.840
Okay.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.320
Deal.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.200
Grilled pork! Grilled pork!

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.320
Grilled pork! Grilled pork!

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.480
Grilled pork! Grilled pork!

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.280
Grilled pork! Grilled pork!

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.280
Grilled pork…wow, grilled pork!

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.720
I really want grilled pork right now!

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.120
Hey, you’re back already?

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:10.840
How was it? Did you get the job?

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.520
So we can have grilled pork together?

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.720
I’m not hungry.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.320
It’s burning nicely.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.240
Crispy bacon, spicy dipping sauce.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.320
Win…

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.600
There’s a small bowl in the cabinet.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.840
Grill some pork, drizzle sauce on it,
and put it by the stairs for me.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.840
Third step, okay?

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.440
Why?

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.240
Well, earlier someone came…

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.720
Should I say this nicely?

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.200
Listen…earlier the kid told me they were hungry,

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.120
wanted some too,
but you didn’t share any grilled pork.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.440
Kid! What kid?

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.480
I never told you?

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.720
I kind of keep a kid in this house…

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.400
but they’re a child ghost.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.800
Not scary though.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.680
Now that you know, remember to
share food and snacks with them too.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.320
I’m heading out. Thanks, okay?

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.600
You.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.920
You again.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.320
Wanneung.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.040
Wanneung.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.440
Wanneung.

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.040
Wanneung.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.640
Wanneung.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.440
Wanneung.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.240
Win, what do you want?

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.520
The power’s out. I can’t sleep.
Let me sleep here.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520
You.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.920
What’s your problem?

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.440
I’m about to become a star.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.560
Someone wants me to sign
with their agency.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.080
I’m excited. Don’t you get it?

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.560
Growing up all by yourself,

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.960
do you know what that’s like?

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.560
Do you even really want
to be a star?

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.960
Why? My acting…

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.560
what’s so bad about it?

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.480
Everything. It’s terrible.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.040
Oh yeah? And you’re so great?

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.360
Good acting

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.640
isn’t just memorizing lines
or copying someone else.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.880
You have to act from the inside.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.800
Grilled pork! Grilled pork!
(Grilled pork)

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.680
Grilled pork.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.400
(Tiny dolphin splash)

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.480
(Non-stop take care)

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.880
Go.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
(Shy already)

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.200
(A discreet kiss?)

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.480
Cut.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.560
Camera resolution.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.400
(Taking advantage of the chaos)
