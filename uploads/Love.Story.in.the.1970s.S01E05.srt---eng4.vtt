=Love Story in the 1970s=

=Episode 5=

00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:49.110
Have you made up your mind?

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.290
If you tell me the truth now,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.530
we can still

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.140
resolve this issue internally.

00:01:55.537 --> 00:01:57.604
But if you keep
on deceiving the organization

00:01:57.604 --> 00:01:58.420
and me,

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.780
that'll be a different story.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.370
Ms. Xu,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.300
he...

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.180
He...

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300
Indeed. He hasn't recovered completely.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.130
But he's starting to recall something.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.537
I'm sure he'll recall everything

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.180
before long.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.250
Fei Ni,

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.990
are you confessing

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.940
that you had colluded with Fang Muyang

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.090
to deceive Ms. Xu

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.300
and the organization?

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.740
No.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.900
Ms. Xu, that's not true.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.910
This has nothing to do with Fang Muyang.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.410
I was the one who sought his help...

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.300
Such nonsense!

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.990
This is ridiculous!

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.690
You've deeply disappointed me.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.970
I would've still been kept in the dark,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.940
had Feng Lin not found out!

00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:53.180
I understand your feelings.

00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:56.000
I know you want to attend college
and improve yourself.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.410
But you used the wrong method.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.650
If news of this gets out,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.020
not only will it affect your reputation,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.020
but it'll also affect
Fang Muyang's image

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.880
as a hero, you know?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.870
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.950
I know my fault now.

00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:17.970
Hurry and write a reflection report.

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:21.360
You'd better reflect upon
your actions deeply.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.330
I'll surely do so.

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:27.060
As for the selection of

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.820
advanced individuals

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.530
for college admission,

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:32.226
we'll put it aside for now.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.650
(Ms. Xu wouldn't just let you off)

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.500
(by telling you
to write a reflection report,)

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.350
(had she not wanted)

00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:11.250
(to maintain
Fang Muyang's image as a hero.)

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.460
You should be grateful for that.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.000
Why do you keep picking on me?

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.610
It's because I corrected your typo, right?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.800
Yeah.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.590
I just hate you.

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:32.310
You think that you're more
well-educated than me.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.360
You always embarrass me in public.

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:43.293
But exposing your actions
has nothing to do with this matter.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.850
If you're unable to attend college,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.150
my boyfriend won't be able
to attend college as well.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.640
I'll tell you this upfront.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.340
Ms. Xu told me this just now.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.210
Your actions

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.550
have given her a reminder.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.210
We mustn't tolerate
this corrupt practice

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.390
of cheating and taking shortcuts.

00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:06.048
So she'll discuss this
with the factory's higher-ups.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.750
In the future, no matter
if it's advanced individuals

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.190
or a model hero,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.550
when it comes to college admission,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.100
everyone will be treated as equal.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.850
That means,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.010
even if Fang Muyang does
recover fully in the future,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.210
and you become the city's
model of excellence,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.740
your name will never appear on
the college recommendation list of

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.260
Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.090
Fang Muyang,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.360
you're indeed very aware.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.350
The hospital
is running out of resources.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.710
As for you,
you've almost fully recovered.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.550
The director said that we should reserve
this ward for those who are in need.

00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:55.648
So I have no choice
but to change your ward.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.240
You're just doing your job.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.610
Who's this girl?

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.270
I don't remember.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.520
All done.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.040
I don't know what to do now.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.330
All these years,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.250
attending college
has always been my only way out.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.810
Now, my only way out
has been sealed off.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.600
No one can seal off

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.740
one's true path of life.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.230
What do you think about the movie?

00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:34.860
You don't like it, huh?

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.150
I see.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:38.780
Lin Mei, that's fine.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.780
We'll catch other movies next time.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.360
Lin Mei?

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.700
Fei Ni?

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.570
Chen Yunguo?

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:49.640
So,

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.380
you guys can go ahead.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.382
I'll make a move first.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.870
Do you know him?

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.500
What are you two doing together?

00:08:57.648 --> 00:08:59.982
He's the blind date partner
my mother introduced to me.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.320
Did my brother make you angry again?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.290
Tell me.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.560
I'll tell him off.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.960
It's pointless no matter
who tells him off this time.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:10.930
Your brother and I

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.570
have fallen out
with each other entirely.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.410
But why?

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.330
I thought you two were
doing great before this.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.309
It's been over a year
since I returned to the city.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.093
Whenever I urged him
to come back to the city,

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:20.515
he always had all kinds of excuses.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.289
Out of spite, I told him

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.620
that I would find another boyfriend
if he didn't come back.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.540
Guess what he said?

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.000
He said...

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.490
He said he wanted to break up with me.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.940
How could Fei Ting
say something like that?

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.800
I'll talk to him.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.537
I'll tell him to apologize to you.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.048
Actually, my parents

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:48.820
wanted to arrange blind dates for me
six months ago.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.360
I tried my best to delay it.

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:52.670
But judging from Fei Ting's attitude,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.160
I don't think
our relationship will bear fruit.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.960
Fei Ni,

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.370
I'm already 27 years old.

00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:01.537
I can't afford
to wait for him any longer.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.730
I've already made up my mind.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.590
If he still doesn't come back,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.950
I'll get myself another boyfriend.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.940
I'll send him a telegram tomorrow.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.850
I'll tell him
to come back immediately, okay?

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.020
Don't cry.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.790
It doesn't matter who speaks to him,

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.660
especially you.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.120
But why?

00:10:22.182 --> 00:10:23.160
He refused to come back

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.950
because he was afraid you might
have no place to stay after his return.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.650
Fei Ni,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.660
that's not what I mean.

00:10:43.804 --> 00:10:44.590
Don't overthink it.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.250
I...

00:10:45.537 --> 00:10:46.590
You see, for this matter...

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.560
It's all my fault.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.090
My parents kept telling me

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.640
to find a partner who owns a house.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.560
Anyway, you guys own a house.

00:10:56.893 --> 00:10:58.200
So I think it's okay.

00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:00.490
I only realized it
when Fei Ting said so.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.680
It's all my fault.
That was plain nonsense.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.810
- No.
- Don't take it to heart.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.000
- Don't overthink it.
- How could it be your fault?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.200
The expectations of your parents
are already low enough.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.040
I'm just mad at Fei Ting.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.120
No matter how tough he has it,

00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:20.530
he should come back first.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.660
We can figure out
a solution after that, right?

00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:24.360
How could he do something like this?

00:11:24.604 --> 00:11:25.780
He kept delaying his return,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.620
and saying
that he wanted to break up with me.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.210
Fei Ni,

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.630
I truly don't know what to do now.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.210
Don't cry.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360
(He refused to come back)

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.271
(because he was afraid you might
have no place to stay after his return.)

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.030
(Slow down. It's hot.)

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:15.760
(Ting.)

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.360
(Young Fei Ni)
Let's take half each.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.071
(Young Fei Ting)

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:19.000
I don't want it.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.650
Milk isn't as nice as milk crumble.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.520
Is that so?

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.520
Let's swap, then.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.120
I'll have the milk crumbles.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.850
That won't do. Dad and Mom aren't home.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.680
I'm your elder brother.
I make the call here.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.093
You have to finish the milk.
I'll finish the milk crumble.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.270
Ni, I finished wrapping your book.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.610
So nice.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:19.840
Ting,

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.530
why is your pencil case in my bag?

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.380
It's so new.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.130
It's a waste

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.080
if I use it.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.760
From tomorrow on,
you'll be in primary school.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.600
Do your best, and get into college.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.380
Once you become a college student,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.400
I'll send you to college.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:35.470
This won't do.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.300
Dad and Mom bought this for you
as your birthday gift.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.210
Even so, that won't do.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.226
I'm your elder brother.
I make the call here.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.260
But Ting,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.540
what about you?

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.040
Look. I made a new one for myself.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.910
Aren't I amazing?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:53.760
You are.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.290
Dad.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.610
Mom.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.090
Why did you guys stop me from going?

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.004
I'm a recent graduate.

00:14:08.004 --> 00:14:10.480
According to the government policy,
I should be the one going.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.730
You still have an elder brother at home.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.648
It's not your turn to be
sent to Great Northern Wilderness.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.671
I've discussed this
with the Educated Youth Office.

00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:18.140
I'll head there on your behalf.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.340
But I thought
we already had a consensus.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.330
Once Mom retires,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.048
you'll take over her position
at Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.830
I'm a man, you know?

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.240
Why should I work
at Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory?

00:14:28.248 --> 00:14:30.226
I would rather head
to Great Northern Wilderness.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.690
Besides,

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.010
according to the newspaper,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.010
the world is full of
great opportunities.

00:14:37.315 --> 00:14:38.140
(Just listen to me.)

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.470
(I'll head to Great Northern Wilderness)

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.290
(while you head to
Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory. Done.)

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.420
(In the future,
I'll leave our parents in your care.)

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:58.960
Ting.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.350
(I was too selfish.)

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.240
(You've devoted yourself to me
all this while.)

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.260
(This time,)

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.730
(you have to heed my will.)

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.810
Fei Ni.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.520
Lin Mei.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.740
I thought you would
never talk to me again.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.610
How could that be?

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:56.160
Where else can I get myself
an excellent sister-in-law like you?

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.450
Lin Mei.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:04.800
I never expected myself

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.670
to be the obstacle between you and Ting.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.610
Hey, don't say that.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.560
Let me finish.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.130
Ting

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.790
doted on me since I was a child.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.300
And, you're my best friend.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.920
You guys are my closest kin,

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.860
yet I wasn't aware of
the difficulties you two were facing.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.840
How could this be your fault?

00:16:29.337 --> 00:16:30.810
Fei Ni, I'll be honest with you.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.370
Initially, I thought

00:16:32.404 --> 00:16:34.293
that if you attended
college successfully,

00:16:34.293 --> 00:16:36.160
you'd definitely move
to the college's dorm.

00:16:36.226 --> 00:16:37.780
If so, the issue between Fei Ting and I

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.900
would be resolved.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.200
But I didn't expect your enrollment

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.810
to still be hanging in the air.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.730
It's not confirmed yet.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.090
Lin Mei,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.990
I came here today

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.270
to tell you this.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.570
Since we were good friends

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.810
for so many years,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.010
can you give him...

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.350
No, I mean,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.450
can you give our family
a little more time?

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.320
Just three months.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:14.010
I promise.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.190
I'll make him come back
and marry you in three months.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.520
Okay?

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.293
Are you sure you can
convince him to come back?

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.100
I promise.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.900
Actually, I didn't intend

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.500
to go on real blind dates either.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.570
I did it to shut my parents up.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.240
I know.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.520
You'll become
my sister-in-law sooner or later.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.440
There's no escape.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.620
Dad, Mom.

00:17:52.937 --> 00:17:55.204
- I'm back.
- I thought you went to the hospital.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.340
I didn't go to the hospital today.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:04.530
Mom,

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380
before this,

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.940
did someone arrange

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.250
blind dates for me?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.180
Yeah.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.580
But I canceled them.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.940
You were bent on attending college.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.490
I've already figured it out.

00:18:19.582 --> 00:18:21.490
I've discussed this
with your father as well.

00:18:21.582 --> 00:18:24.280
It's good for youngsters like you all
to have dreams and ambitions.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.760
We won't rush things

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.530
as long as you're happy.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:28.400
But I'm in a rush now.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.200
I've already decided.

00:18:33.382 --> 00:18:34.848
I'm going to go on blind dates.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.910
But there are two conditions.

00:18:38.048 --> 00:18:39.071
First condition,

00:18:39.293 --> 00:18:41.950
he needs to own a house
or be eligible for a housing allocation.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.271
Second condition,

00:18:44.293 --> 00:18:46.026
he must be less than 30 years old,

00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:48.004
and look like a decent person.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.050
Are my standards

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.450
too high?

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.960
Not at all.
You're more than good enough.

00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:00.210
I'm sure you can find
all kinds of ideal partners.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.170
I'll arrange the blind dates
for you tomorrow.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.780
Ni, what's with
the sudden change of mind?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.780
Mom already said it, right?

00:19:13.115 --> 00:19:14.671
Since I have to get married eventually,

00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:16.400
it's better for me to get married early.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.140
That's the spirit.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.540
I'm glad that you've figured it out.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.010
I was so anxious the past two months.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.450
I was worried
that you would look after that hero

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.860
in order to attend college,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.180
ruining your marriage in the process.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.550
Dad,

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.910
Mom,

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.290
I've made you guys worried.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.120
I won't do it again.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.320
Ni,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.300
you were obedient and intelligent
since you were a child.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.620
Your mother and I

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.315
will support your every decision.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.290
Okay.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.140
Ms. Liu.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.350
Hi, Fei Ni.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.750
Hi.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.471
Come quickly.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.480
You look gorgeous today.

00:20:13.404 --> 00:20:16.320
You see, when your mother told me
that you were looking for a husband,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.093
I was reminded of
a candidate immediately.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.400
That guy has got it all.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.580
Most importantly,

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.330
he has been inquiring about you
from me before this.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:26.660
Does he know me?

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.270
Perhaps you know him.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:31.990
He's here.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.480
Ye Feng, you're here.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.210
Due to your urgent need,

00:20:45.426 --> 00:20:47.550
I haven't had the time
to report your blind date

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.000
with Fei Ni to Ms. Xu yet.

00:20:50.026 --> 00:20:52.115
- I'll report to her later...
- Ms. Liu, don't worry.

00:20:52.137 --> 00:20:53.530
My mom has to listen to me.

00:20:53.582 --> 00:20:54.900
I'll tell her about it later.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.010
Alright.

00:21:04.071 --> 00:21:05.515
I'll introduce you two to each other.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.540
This is Fei Ni.

00:21:06.915 --> 00:21:07.660
This is Ye Feng.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.970
Ye Feng is on
the factory's basketball team.

00:21:10.426 --> 00:21:12.360
I'm sure you saw him
playing basketball before.

00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:17.693
Nice to meet you.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.120
Nice to meet you.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:21.020
Alright.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.970
You guys can go ahead.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.604
I have something else to do. I'll leave.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:47.820
Fang Muyang,

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.315
remember to finish your milk today.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.280
Thanks.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.310
Who exactly is this girl?

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.220
Why do you keep drawing her?

00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.750
I don't know.

00:22:00.448 --> 00:22:02.130
I've been dreaming
of her all this while.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.530
If so, she must be important to you.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.970
Nurse Zhou,

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:09.190
why isn't Fei Ni here to visit me?

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.190
Fei Ni needs to work too.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.830
Besides, she's not related to you.

00:22:16.026 --> 00:22:18.093
- She didn't need to visit you daily.
- Nurse Zhou.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.660
Can you do me a favor?

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.820
This is my first blind date.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.730
Me too.

00:22:40.671 --> 00:22:41.404
So you...

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.880
What do you usually

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.680
do?

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.280
Have there been any tournaments lately?

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.820
Nope.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.770
We had a friendly match
at Jiangcheng College last time.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.180
It was just a spar.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.399
We train when there
aren't any tournaments.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.026
Because in the second half of the year,

00:22:58.026 --> 00:23:00.710
there's a city-wide basketball
tournament for the textile industry.

00:23:00.715 --> 00:23:01.770
We have to win it.

00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:03.680
So everyone is training
with great enthusiasm.

00:23:03.848 --> 00:23:05.693
You must come and spectate us by then.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.680
Alright.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.290
What about you?

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.340
What do you like to do usually?

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.340
I like

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.250
to read.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.150
You like to read?

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.250
I like to read, too.

00:23:20.004 --> 00:23:21.450
What kinds of books do you like?

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.340
I like to read

00:23:23.582 --> 00:23:25.140
"The Taking of Tiger Mountain",

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.950
"The Battle of Wits",

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.860
and the books about
Chen Sheng, Wu Guang, or Huang Jiguang.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.860
I like them the most.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.690
Let's catch a movie later.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.860
I heard that a new Romanian movie

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.180
has been aired lately.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.271
And, people liked it.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.450
Okay.

00:23:40.626 --> 00:23:41.210
Let's go.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.260
(Workers' Club)

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.220
(Why are you shouting? I'm not deaf.)

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:49.980
(Look.)

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.740
(Did the boat that departed
yesterday make it across?)

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.140
(You must defuse the mines.)

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.982
("Waves of the Danube", Romania)
(I thought we had a bomb squad.)

00:23:55.982 --> 00:23:56.820
(What are they doing?)

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.093
(Let's drop the anchor, then.)

00:23:58.093 --> 00:23:59.500
(Do as you see fit.)

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.300
(That's an order from the Germans.)

00:24:02.404 --> 00:24:03.980
(Don't you intend to send her back?)

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.380
(No.)

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.380
(I'm the helmsman.
I cannot leave the ship.)

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.620
(I have four children.)

00:24:11.626 --> 00:24:12.760
(I should die in my home,)
Ye Feng.

00:24:12.804 --> 00:24:13.740
(not on the sea.)

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.115
(Stop your nagging and just go.)

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.390
Did I fall asleep?

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.500
(The master will hear us, you know?)

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.460
(He won't.)

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.540
(He's busy fighting a war.)

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.700
(Just go.)

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.780
(Check the waterway.)

00:24:33.382 --> 00:24:34.500
(Are there any sea mines?)

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.737
(I heard that there are some.)

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.940
(Fool, put your back into it.)

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.380
(Put your back into it!)

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.500
(Pull the rope!)

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.300
(Go away.)

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:05.530
Sorry about that.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.840
The training has been quite tiring.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:12.010
The main thing is
that the movie is too boring.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.550
I started to yawn while watching it.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:15.340
It's fine.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.730
I didn't watch the whole film either.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:18.810
Yeah, right?

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.870
You think the movie
is boring too, right?

00:25:21.226 --> 00:25:21.970
What about this?

00:25:22.048 --> 00:25:23.370
After this, I'll get two tickets

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.800
to "Walter Defends Sarajevo".

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.140
The movie scenes are very exhilarating.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.290
I'm home.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.940
This is our factory's
staff housing, right?

00:25:35.182 --> 00:25:36.782
I think I've never been here before.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.450
I'll head back first.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:40.940
Fei Ni,

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.200
are you free after work tomorrow?

00:25:48.626 --> 00:25:50.080
If so, let's catch another movie.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.530
The one I said just now.

00:25:51.804 --> 00:25:53.182
The one with exhilarating scenes.

00:25:53.337 --> 00:25:53.770
Alright.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.970
I'll wait for you
by the entrance tomorrow.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:00.100
Fei Ni.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.450
Mom.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.090
Mrs. Fei.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.560
I'm Ye Feng.

00:26:05.582 --> 00:26:06.620
Ms. Liu of Jiangcheng
No. 1 Textile Factory

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.626
introduced me to her
as her blind date partner.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.970
I know.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.930
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Fei.

00:26:12.182 --> 00:26:13.937
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.690
So, why are you guys standing here?

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.210
Come and have a seat.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.770
Mom, he has basketball training today.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.260
Not today.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.230
It's not like I train every day.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.290
Yeah, right?

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:27.690
Yeah.

00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:28.970
- Come to my house.
- Mrs. Liu.

00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:30.440
Let me carry the groceries for you.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.380
Please go ahead.

00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:32.450
What a sensible boy.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.840
- Look at him.
- Please go ahead.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.320
Is basketball training exhausting?

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.137
It's not that bad.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.100
You're so tall.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:39.900
I'm 1.85 m tall.

00:26:40.471 --> 00:26:41.140
That's great.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.026
I'll make some delicious dishes
for you tonight.

00:26:43.026 --> 00:26:45.140
Isn't that Ms. Xu's son?

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.420
Did he get together with Fei Ni?

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.850
Baoying, you're back.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.140
Who is that?

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.100
It's Ni's colleague.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.690
Over here.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.290
Alright.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:57.490
What colleague?

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.120
That's Ms. Xu's son.

00:26:59.226 --> 00:27:01.448
I suppose Fei Ni is
perching on a high branch now.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.140
Fei, what are you doing?

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.970
This is our mosquito net.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:06.880
I've washed it, and I...

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.940
Just put it aside for now.
We have a guest.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.620
Hurry and come.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.580
Let me introduce him.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.760
This is the blind date partner
Ms. Liu introduced to Ni.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.315
He's Ye Feng.

00:27:15.337 --> 00:27:16.140
This is Ni's father.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:17.010
Hello, Mr. Fei.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:17.848
My name is Ye Feng.

00:27:17.848 --> 00:27:19.100
Nice to meet you.

00:27:20.293 --> 00:27:21.620
I have something to tell you.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.360
What is it?

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.120
Mr. Fei, I already fixed the door.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.940
It won't make a noise anymore.

00:27:30.337 --> 00:27:31.804
That's the thing I want to tell you.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.420
Fei Ni,

00:27:34.026 --> 00:27:35.730
I've been waiting for you for two hours.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.550
I'm hungry now.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.160
If so, you should stay
and have dinner with us.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:41.860
Okay.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.620
Drink up.

00:27:58.426 --> 00:27:59.420
This is Biluochun tea.

00:28:00.226 --> 00:28:01.620
It's my mother's favorite tea.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:02.930
Me too.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.360
Ms. Xu has the real deal.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.190
Mine are just crumbs.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.140
It's not that good.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:17.380
It's good.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.180
How has Ms. Xu been doing lately?

00:28:36.004 --> 00:28:37.137
She's been doing well.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.560
How have you been doing
in the hospital lately?

00:28:47.604 --> 00:28:48.737
I've been doing well.

00:28:50.626 --> 00:28:52.182
I suppose everyone is doing well.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.680
Let me check if dinner is ready.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.050
I heard from my mother

00:29:10.093 --> 00:29:11.426
that your head was damaged.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.250
You cannot remember the past.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.940
I heard from Mr. Fei

00:29:21.204 --> 00:29:23.300
that Fei Ni didn't come
to visit me at the hospital

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.510
because she was watching
a movie with you.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.410
It's all my fault.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.250
I wouldn't have kept Fang here

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.360
had I known Ye was coming.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.280
Why did you come here?

00:30:04.515 --> 00:30:06.937
What if Fang said something
that he wasn't supposed to?

00:30:07.026 --> 00:30:07.840
Hurry and go back.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.960
I don't know what to chat about
even if I go back.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.380
It's so awkward.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.400
Why don't we send Ni to them?

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.580
Have you lost your mind?

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.240
It'll be even more awkward
if Ni is there.

00:30:22.026 --> 00:30:23.810
- Fei Ni, as for dinner...
- Come with me.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.940
Where are you going?

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.160
I...

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.610
This...

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.970
Is our daughter

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.200
two-timing them?

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.290
Shut up if you don't know what to say.

00:30:40.337 --> 00:30:41.271
Head to Li's house.

00:30:41.271 --> 00:30:42.610
They bought braised beef yesterday.

00:30:42.626 --> 00:30:43.970
I'm sure they have some leftovers.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.140
Go and borrow some from them.

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:47.240
Why are we borrowing
braised beef from them?

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.050
We have guests here today,
but we don't even have meat dishes.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.250
How could that be appropriate?

00:30:51.271 --> 00:30:54.080
Besides, it's embarrassing for Ni to
show other people how poor we are.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.140
Just go.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:55.690
Okay.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:56.250
Go now.

00:31:12.515 --> 00:31:14.048
How did you manage to locate my house?

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.830
I asked Nurse Zhou.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.890
She told me your house address.

00:31:17.915 --> 00:31:19.529
She even taught me how to take a cab.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:21.440
It's been a few days since
you last visited me.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.582
That's why I thought of visiting you.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:29.450
What happened?

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.426
Didn't I already teach you
how to wash your clothes?

00:31:31.448 --> 00:31:33.190
Why didn't you wash it? It's so dirty.

00:31:34.537 --> 00:31:36.690
You didn't even sew back
the button that had dropped.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.100
If other people see this,

00:31:38.137 --> 00:31:39.560
they might treat you as a thug.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.800
I did, but I was terrible at it.

00:31:42.048 --> 00:31:42.960
I pricked my finger.

00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:01.710
Don't you know how to tie back
your untied shoelaces?

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.010
It's dangerous, you know?

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.270
Are you free tomorrow?

00:32:09.648 --> 00:32:11.093
I'll treat you to some ice cream.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:13.990
I'm not free.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.660
Did you watch a movie
with Ye Feng today?

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.080
Was it nice?

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.020
It's okay.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.360
Did you not visit me
because you went out

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.180
to watch a movie with him?

00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:29.530
So what if that's the case?

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.200
If you want to watch a movie,

00:32:32.093 --> 00:32:33.320
I can keep you company too.

00:32:34.537 --> 00:32:36.293
I can be your
blind date partner as well.

00:32:40.648 --> 00:32:42.260
It's getting late. You should go now.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.110
Do you know the way back?

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:45.510
I'm not dumb.

00:32:46.204 --> 00:32:47.010
I know the way back.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.430
I won't keep you around for dinner.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.782
You should go now.

00:32:53.248 --> 00:32:54.360
You should head back first.

00:32:55.137 --> 00:32:56.715
I'll stay here until you enter the door.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.710
I didn't expect your parents
to be this passionate.

00:33:22.937 --> 00:33:26.004
To think that I met your parents
right after our first encounter.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:28.600
Fei Ni,

00:33:29.026 --> 00:33:30.940
why don't I pick you up
for work tomorrow?

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.550
We can have breakfast together.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:35.660
Ye Feng,

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.280
what does Ms. Xu

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.870
think about our relationship?

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.440
My mom?

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.010
I haven't had
the chance to tell her yet.

00:33:46.048 --> 00:33:48.648
When I heard that Ms. Liu was
trying to find you a husband,

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.730
I sought her help immediately

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.626
so that I could go on
a blind date with you.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.010
But don't worry.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.660
My mom always listens to me.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.650
She won't say no
as long as I'm happy with it.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.179
I never expected the blind date partner
Ms. Liu had recommended to be you.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.270
I... What's wrong with me?

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.293
You're a good person.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.280
You're too good for me.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.530
You know this, too.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:10.560
Compared to your family background,

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:11.780
my family is...

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.650
I don't think that's an issue.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.340
Fei Ni.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:15.970
Let me finish.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:21.060
I have an elder brother called Fei Ting.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.760
He spent his entire youth
in the countryside.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.300
He'll return to the city soon.

00:34:25.493 --> 00:34:27.404
If the district office
cannot find a job for him

00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.950
when he's back,

00:34:30.093 --> 00:34:31.337
I...

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.160
might offer my position to him.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.900
Did your parents instruct you to do so?

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.410
No.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.600
It's my own call.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.050
Actually, he was supposed
to take over my job.

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.670
I was the one who was supposed
to be sent to the countryside.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.640
He doted on me.

00:34:47.671 --> 00:34:48.750
He didn't want me to suffer.

00:34:48.893 --> 00:34:50.550
Therefore, he let me take over his job.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.930
No matter what,

00:34:52.293 --> 00:34:53.782
I should return the job to him.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.470
What will you do, then?

00:34:56.471 --> 00:34:58.740
I know how to make clothes.
I can make a living myself.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.850
How could that be the same?

00:34:59.937 --> 00:35:02.700
Having a job in Jiangcheng No. 1
Textile Factory means a stable life.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.271
If you make and sell your own clothes,

00:35:04.315 --> 00:35:05.826
it's the same as being jobless.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.500
If so, how could my mother let you...

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:11.780
Fei Ni, that's not what I mean...

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.490
I understand.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.400
That's why
I'm telling you this in advance.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.130
If both you and Ms. Xu

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.440
cannot accept this fact,

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.170
I understand.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:27.080
Ye Feng, it's fine.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.850
You should head back and think about it.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.610
Alright. I'll think about it.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.300
I'll be going now.

00:35:35.448 --> 00:35:37.471
It's getting late.
You should hurry and head back.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.130
See you.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.120
Jiangcheng No. 1
Textile Factory Basketball Team

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.750
(Study Hard and Work Tirelessly)
Achieved Outstanding Results Again.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.780
(Physically and Mentally Strong)
This team has a strong mentality,

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.090
strong physical capabilities,

00:36:06.337 --> 00:36:07.840
and strong technical capabilities.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.610
Among the members,
their captain, Ye Feng,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.610
deserved great credit.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.220
Ling Yi?

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.620
This reporter has great taste.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.500
This name is great as well.

00:36:23.315 --> 00:36:25.537
I can tell
that this reporter is well-educated.

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.180
You're back.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:29.780
I'm back.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.600
Hurry.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:32.350
Take a look.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.970
You're in the newspaper.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.070
This reporter, named Ling Yi,

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.740
knew you?

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:43.570
You got high praise.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.860
Not only were you good at basketball,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.137
but you also had a high
revolutionary consciousness.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.560
This is not a praise but a fact.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.350
The name sounds feminine.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.120
Try to inquire about her
and buy her a meal.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.260
What's wrong?

00:37:03.515 --> 00:37:06.093
What's with the long face?
Did you lose your basketball match?

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:10.450
Mom,

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.220
say,

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.650
if I get married,

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.920
but my wife is jobless,

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.000
can you accept that?

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.400
No way.

00:37:23.315 --> 00:37:24.700
Did you get yourself a girlfriend?

00:37:26.115 --> 00:37:27.680
Not yet, but...

00:37:28.315 --> 00:37:30.093
We're getting to know each other.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:31.740
Who is it?

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.570
She's jobless, huh?

00:37:34.426 --> 00:37:35.804
Is she a returning educated youth?

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.360
No.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.340
She has a job now.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.190
But she said she would
offer her job to her elder brother

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.170
after his return.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.280
Who exactly is it?

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.480
Do I know her?

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.360
You do know her.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.230
It's Fei Ni from our factory.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.600
Are you dating Fei Ni?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.290
Not yet.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.740
That's why I'm asking
for your opinion first.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.210
Of course not.

00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:07.480
With your background, you can find
all kinds of excellent partners.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.450
Why must you find a factory worker?

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.140
Mom, look at what you're saying.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.182
It's like you're belittling
the working class!

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.820
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:38:18.937 --> 00:38:20.860
Since when did I belittle
the working class?

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.170
You said it just now.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.260
Don't spout such nonsense!

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:23.960
You said it here.

00:38:23.982 --> 00:38:24.626
Lower your volume!

00:38:24.648 --> 00:38:25.130
Make me!

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.970
Hush!

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.570
Hey, I'm the factory manager!

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:29.820
What's with the feather duster?

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.137
You think I can't handle you?

00:38:31.137 --> 00:38:32.090
I'll teach you a lesson!

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:33.820
How dare you spout such nonsense?

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.582
You ungrateful son!

00:38:34.604 --> 00:38:36.890
I'm going to date
an ordinary factory worker!

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.480
If you object to it,
I'll tell everyone in the factory

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.050
that you belittle the working class!

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:41.970
Mom, please stop!

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:42.480
It hurts!

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.940
It hurts!

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.570
Fine.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.050
You want to date Fei Ni?

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.530
I won't object to it.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.440
But only on one condition.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.490
What condition,

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.980
Mom?

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.040
I won't object to it

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.100
as long as Fei Ni

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:12.580
doesn't attend college.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.010
Son, you have no idea.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.080
She's been trying to enroll in
college for the past few years.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:21.940
Think about it.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.130
If you two do get married,

00:39:24.226 --> 00:39:25.530
and she does enroll in college,

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.740
she'll be away for a few years.

00:39:27.826 --> 00:39:29.848
That's the same
as you being a bachelor, you know?

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:35.420
Alright.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.450
I'll agree on her behalf.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:40.380
You'll agree on her behalf?

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:42.780
Mom,

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.600
just think about it.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.380
Why would anyone enroll in college

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.260
when they could get married to me?

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:47.970
Don't you agree?

00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:53.826
You must be exhausted
from all the beating just now.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.640
Here.

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.130
Have some tea

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:56.970
and calm down.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.570
Just leave this

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.940
to me.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:03.830
Alright.

00:40:04.582 --> 00:40:05.450
I'll be leaving now.

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:07.515
That beating you gave me

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.020
was quite harsh.

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:28.990
Fei Ni.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.230
Let's watch another movie tonight.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.640
This time,
I promise I won't fall asleep.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.780
As for what you said to me yesterday,

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.937
I've given it some thought.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.700
I don't think it's an issue for me.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.700
You're not even sure

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:52.870
when your brother will return.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.240
Besides, even if he did come back,

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.048
he might not take over
your job necessarily.

00:40:56.071 --> 00:40:57.715
Let's say, for the sake of argument,

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.610
you did lose your job,

00:40:59.671 --> 00:41:01.515
I'm sure my mother
will do something about it.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.240
Ye Feng,

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.030
did you misunderstand something?

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.619
I didn't mean to let you help me
resolve the job issue

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.940
that my brother and I would face.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:10.800
It's fine.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.350
Once we get married,

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.530
we'll be a family.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.137
Everything will be negotiable by then.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.010
Fei Ni.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.150
You...

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.600
What are you doing here?

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.780
I have a button now,

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.448
but I don't know how to sew it back.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.450
Please teach me.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.480
Fang Muyang,

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.340
for a simple task
such as sewing a button on,

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.780
you can ask the doctors and
the nurses to teach you.

00:41:34.915 --> 00:41:37.150
If they don't know, you can ask
your fellow patients.

00:41:37.226 --> 00:41:39.010
Fei Ni and I are going to watch a movie.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.320
Fei Ni,

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.180
let's go.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.740
Really?

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.804
Can I join? I've never
watched a movie before.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.610
I don't think it's appropriate.

00:41:48.671 --> 00:41:51.560
I'll head to the hospital and teach you
in a few more days, okay?

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:53.560
Okay.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:01.130
Fei Ni,

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.600
how do I get back to the hospital?

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.050
I forgot how I got here.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.030
Didn't you come from that direction?

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.360
Forget it, then.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.960
You guys should watch the movie.

00:42:17.004 --> 00:42:17.737
Just ignore me.

00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:19.700
I can...
I think this is the right direction.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.260
Fang Muyang,

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:21.730
where are you going?

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:24.204
I suppose it's that direction.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.520
Why don't we send him back first?

00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:31.050
We can watch a movie after that.

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.170
But we won't make it in time
if we do so.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.180
But...

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.990
Stop staring at her.

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:52.720
Look ahead.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:54.580
Just focus on the road.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.570
Hurry up.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:02.204
This is how fast I'll go.
Stop patting me.

00:43:02.226 --> 00:43:03.820
You're so heavy. How can I go fast?

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.410
Stop hugging me.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.440
Hurry up.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.180
It's so ticklish.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:11.700
Let go.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:13.780
If not, I'll let go of the handles.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:14.900
Go ahead.
