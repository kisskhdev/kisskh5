Come on, next.

Next.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.790
Tang Tang, you're so skinny.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.280
Give me your food.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.790
That's Tang Tang's.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.630
You...

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.660
Thanks.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.640
Run faster next time,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.150
or you won't get any food.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.560
What's that?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.040
A birthmark.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.510
What's a birthmark?

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.590
A mark only I have.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.920
Why don't I have one?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.120
Not everyone does.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.710
Yours is really pretty.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.760
It's like a little flower.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.920
That's really high.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.510
Looks fun.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.950
My parents took me on it before.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.680
From the top, you can see the whole city.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.840
That's nice.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.560
You had parents?

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.240
I've never seen mine.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.470
You'll meet good people someday

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.520
to take you home.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.080
You'll have a home too.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.680
Can we go play?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.560
You need tickets.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.280
I don't have money.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.630
Me neither.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.910
When I grow up,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.400
I'll take you on the Ferris wheel.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.240
Deal?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.960
Deal. I'll remember that.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.360
Always.

What's that?

A birthmark.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.310
What's a birthmark?

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.590
A mark only I have.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.710
Why don't I have one?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.030
Not everyone does.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.030
Yours is really pretty.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.150
It's like a little flower.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.710
Tang Tang,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.080
want to go somewhere fun?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.560
Honestly,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.000
I don't know why,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.360
but I've forgotten

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.030
a lot from childhood.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.500

Ms. Tong?

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.790
Ms. Tong?

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.060
Ms. Tong.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.120
Yimo.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.510
Your door's shut.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.510
Look at me.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.270
It's fine. I have my keys.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.040
I made milk tea with grass jelly.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.910
It's sweet.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:16.800
You'll like it.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.800
Open the door.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800
Let me bring it in.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.800
No need. I'll take it myself.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.240
It's fine. I'll help.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.080
No need.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.310
I mean,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.510
I was cleaning.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.390
It's a mess.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.350
Give it to me.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.320
Okay.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.440
Hey,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.000
didn't we say we'd go shopping?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.090
Didn't get to last time.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.680
You busy today?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.560
Let's go out later.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.470
Sure.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.270
Then go back first.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.000
I'll come get you when I'm done.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.870
Okay, I'll wait.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.560
See you in a bit.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.470
Alright.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.350
Ms. Tong.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.120
This one looks good.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.630
It'd suit you.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.880
Let me see.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.310
It's nice.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.640
Yimo,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.830
no wonder you studied design.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.070
You have great taste.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.310
Let me help you try it on.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.600
No need.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.630
It's fine.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.230
Yimo,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.070
I'll do it myself.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.520
Okay.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.560
Hey,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.480
your dad told me

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.120
about what happened at the station.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.680
He really laid into me.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.000
I know you were saving your friend.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.270
I understand.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.310
But you're his only daughter.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.800
If something happened to you,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.830
what would he do?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560
It was my fault.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.390
I never thought

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.870
things would get that far.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.190
How did you know those people

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.160
at the teahouse?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.800
I didn't know them.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.950
I had no choice.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.390
I didn't dare to tell my dad.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.120
So I asked a classmate.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.750
Turns out he's so unreliable.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.470
Listen.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.680
From now on,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.430
if there's anything you can't tell your dad,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.830
just tell me.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.720
At least you'll have someone to talk to.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.870
Besides,

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.750
your dad's a grown man.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.390
Men think differently

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.510
from us sometimes.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.030
Okay.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.470
Here.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.080
Tang, not just you.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.920
Whenever your friends

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.950
or coworkers come by,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.830
just let me know.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.390
It's on the house.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.840
Thank you.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.630
You and Yimo are close, right?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.880
Not really.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.920
In the dog theft case,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.630
Yimo stepped in to help.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.040
That was the first time we met.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.000
Do detectives handle dog theft too?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.270
Of course.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.600
Big or small,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.960
it's our job.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.680
Well,

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.670
she's my only child.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.390
Here's to you.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.230
Thanks.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.320
You're a good guy.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.550
Hold on, sir.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.480
I can't drink this yet.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.600
I think you misunderstood.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.870
Yimo and I are just friends.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.150
That's it.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.750
You're making me feel

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.030
kind of embarrassed.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.480
I really think

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960
you're a good guy.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.440
What do you think of Yimo?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.000
She's great.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.600
Kind and warm.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.360
Honestly,

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.390
when I first met her,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.870
it feels like

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480
she's familiar.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.200
It's like

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.150
we knew each other as kids.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.790
But she said

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.870
she doesn't remember anything
from back then.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.150
Ms. Tong.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.000
What's that scar from?

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.840
Oh, that?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.750
An old accident

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.750
back home.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.630
Did it scare you?

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.320
There's a dermatologist
at Third City Hospital.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.960
Great with scar removal.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.200
My friend Xiaoqian

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.750
had a scar on her forehead.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.120
She got it removed.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.080
Now you can't even tell.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.600
If you want, I'll go with you.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.440
I'm used to it.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.080
Besides,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.510
it's on my back.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.000
I barely see

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.120
or think about it.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.270
If you ever change your mind,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.200
tell me.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.470
Okay.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.870
Ms. Tong,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.440
where's your hometown?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.870
I'm from Shancheng.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.550
I thought so.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.360
Your accent sounded like it.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.150
Not many people from there here.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.200
It's pretty rare.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.000
Funny thing is,

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.120
everyone I've met from there is really nice.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.630
I've never visited though.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.630
There's nothing to see.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.750
You'd regret it.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:05.750
Sir,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.360
did something happen to Yimo

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.960
when she was little?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.390
I mean, when I mentioned

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.990
the welfare home,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.320
and being adopted,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.480
she said she can't remember a thing.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.910
Yimo is my daughter.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.750
That won't change

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.200
no matter what.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.790
Don't take this wrong, sir.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.030
I just want to look out for her.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.150
Cheers, sir.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200
So Ms. Tong,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.510
how did you meet my dad?

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.510
I asked him,

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.960
but he won't say.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.510
I had a ton of luggage

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.720
when I moved in,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.600
but the movers

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.360
dumped them in the hallway.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.320
Said carrying it inside cost extra.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.790
Can you believe that?

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.600
And then,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.550
your dad came home

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.750
and got blocked.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.960
In the end,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.360
he carried everything in for me,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.480
piece by piece.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.030
Seriously?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.750
He hates chores.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.750
Right?

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.960
He was exhausted.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.390
So I thought,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.000
I couldn't just ignore that.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.600
Since then,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.550
I've been baking

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.870
for him.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.750
Day by day,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.120
we got familiar.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.110
What?

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.480
The way you two met

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.750
was too coincidental.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.480
Even a screenwriter couldn't make it up.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.390
It's been tough for Yimo.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.110
So I just

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.200
don't want her hurt again.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.720
I worry she might feel unhappy.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.910
So I've been checking in on her.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.480
I grew up in a welfare home too.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.910
So I can really relate.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.240
You did?

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.630
Which one was it?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.320
I wasn't there for long.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.030
I was about that tall.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.150
I don't remember much.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.630
My master took me away.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.510
And I just

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.000
grew up healthy, right?

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.790
Want anything else? We can order more.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.750
That's enough.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.510
Your beer.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.630
Yimo, you ordered beer?

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.720
Ms. Tong,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.550
can you drink?

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.960
Not really.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.840
Two glasses and I'm tipsy.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.270
I don't buy that.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.670
You look like you can handle it.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.600
I really can't.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.480
Here. Have some meat.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.200
Come on, Ms. Tong.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.480
My dad's not around.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.630
It's just us.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.550
He never lets me

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.510
drink outside alone.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.720
Says it's not safe.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.790
But you're here,

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.360
so he can't say anything.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.000
Alright. I'll drink with you.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.200
How could you drink this much?

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.000
And it's so late.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.960
Really unsafe.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.440
Don't do this again, okay?

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.390
Yimo,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.630
if anything's wrong,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.670
tell me.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.510
You're a good kid.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.600
Your dad's a good man.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.120
You're all good people.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.360
If we could be one family,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.080
that'd be even better.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.720
Let me pull over.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.990
Ms. Tong.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.390
Just let it out.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.840
Get her a bottle of water.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.110
Ali,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.080
trust me.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.750
I'll treat Yimo well.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.840
Just like you do.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.790
Like my own daughter.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.200
You're really drunk.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.270
Ms. Tong, drink some water.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.460
(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.840
Li Xu's file. Take a look.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:15.870
Can I have a sip?

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.540
(Personal File: Li Xu)

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.750
Master, I found something.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.790
Back at the old teahouse,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.960
I felt something was off.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.670
Li Xu

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.630
is one of the hidden investors there.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.030
And also in the dog shelter.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.600
I've got a hunch

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.510
that he's playing a bigger role

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.030
behind the scenes.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.360
(Personal File: Li Xu)
I think we should

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840
dig into him.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.870
Li Xu needs checking.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.670
But we still need the dog thieves.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.110
Alright.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.200
You've already narrowed that down.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.150
Keep on it.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.150
I'm on it.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.120
However,

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.440
you've shown your face at the teahouse.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.720
The round of checks.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.350
I'll handle it.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.520
Captain Zhao.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.350
I heard from Mr. Qin

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.830
you chased a racer fugitive

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200
for 80km back in the day

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.270
and forced him to stop.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.830
All that old stuff.

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.270
Only Qin still remembers.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.030
With skills like yours,

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.070
why don't you drive yourself?

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.030
You brat.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.720
What captain drives his own car?

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.510
What are you here for?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.040
Me?

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.400
Tea.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.550
Tea?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.750
You want it

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.510
light or strong?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.240
What's the difference?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.240
Big difference.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.030
If you come during the day,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.510
people usually go light.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.070
But in the evening,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.350
they prefer it strong.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.390
I see.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.030
I'll just have whatever.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.510
Hello, what would you like?

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.070
(Old Teahouse)
No prices listed here?

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.550
How much for Maojian?

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.960
Eighty one cup.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.000
Eighty?

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.160
Scan here.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.520
Bai.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.350
You sure

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.110
your plan'll work?

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.040
Li,

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.070
everything's set.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.510
We're about to move.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.790
What are you worried about?

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.640
Not worried.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.550
Just that guy you picked.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.350
I don't know him well.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.350
Haven't worked together.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.790
Sounds like you don't trust me.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.240
That's not it.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.400
I mean,

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.920
if we're running a honey trap

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.920
to lure rich suckers

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.790
and big shots,

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.030
we don't need a real chef.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.030
We got to use the best ingredients.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.590
Li,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.920
we need a proper front.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.000
No good chef,

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.310
no bait.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.400
Fine.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.790
I won't interfere.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.070
But let me be clear upfront,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.750
if your guy

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.400
screws up,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.310
you're fully responsible.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.190
Seven Character.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.350
Dad? You're home?

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.830
Not at the restaurant?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.550
Everything's arranged.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.920
We're closing early tomorrow.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.230
Taking the next two days off, too.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.110
You've never

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.400
closed early

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.070
except for New Year's Eve.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.240
What's so important?

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.310
A banquet.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.270
What kind?

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.920
Client provides the venue.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.790
We send the chef.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.750
How's Li Tong?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.200
She's fine.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.400
Don't worry.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.480
But,

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.720
I realized I made a big mistake.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.960
What's that?

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.750
Not inviting you along.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.270
The three of us have never eaten together.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.640
So,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.310
I had an idea.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.920
A crazy one?

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.270
I'm having dinner with Ms. Tong tonight.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.310
Come with us.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.550
I booked a really nice place.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.680
We can all have dinner

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.520
and chat.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.750
I don't have time.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.110
You always say that.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.790
I already booked it.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.960
No refunds.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.240
You wouldn't waste my money, right?

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.350
Yimo...

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.920
Dad, please.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.590
Ms. Tong and I already agreed.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.460
Please.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.160
Come with us.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.030
I booked

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.440
a really nice place for tonight.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.720
I got my dad to come.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.590
Dress nice, okay?

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.260
(Yimo)

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.340
(Goes as planned)

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.110
Tea lovers,

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.640
I'm at a new spot today.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.960
Check out the place.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.070
Look, a rickshaw.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.030
Nice. Very old-fashioned.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.440
There's even a rooster.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.070
Must be a historic building.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.000
Oh, an old gate.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.560
Great.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.680
Nice vibe,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.030
actually.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.240
Your Maojian. Receipt.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.830
Thanks.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.550
Add more tea.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.310
Extra tea's 20. Want it?

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.200
What are you doing?

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.790
What are you doing?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.960
You call this Maojian?

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.950
It is.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.310
Maojian's green tea.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.480
But you served me red.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.410
Sir,

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.400
you didn't say

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.350
red or green when you ordered.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.070
Why are you mad now?

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.480
Of course I'm mad.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.960
I heard this place was classy.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.160
Good views, good tea.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.720
I came to enjoy myself.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.110
You serve me this?

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.310
Think I can't afford better?

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.590
Well, sir,

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.200
it's not at this hour.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.400
During daytime,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.350
the tea's all like this.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.190
What do you mean?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.440
Did I come at the wrong time?

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.310
Night tea's much better?

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.270
Guaranteed.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.720
But you know,

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.400
it's a bit more pricey.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.920
Price doesn't matter.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.680
My pension's high.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.830
Please have some tea first.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.070
Let me get you a fresh pot.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.300
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.420
(Community Service Center)

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.480
Officer,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.160
here's the rental list.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.480
The info you asked is in here.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.750
Thanks. You carry on.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.670
Sure.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.820

(Zhang Junlong; Wang Hu)

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.900
(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.270
What's up, old man?

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.960
Had a spending spree?

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.480
You ordered an 80-a-cup tea?

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.200
Didn't that hurt when you paid?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.440
Work-related. I'll get reimbursed.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.110
I'm not paying out of pocket.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.240
Well,

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.640
after that cup,

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.640
can you still drink

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.550
a five-yuan pack?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.680
It's fake. Not real Maojian.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.830
You could tell?

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.510
I don't buy it often

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.680
doesn't mean I don't know tea.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.110
Fake tea.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.000
Fake teahouse too.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:40.880
I need

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.830
to dig a little deeper on Li Xu.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.270
I just went

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.960
over the dog thieves' info again.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.350
Turns out they're pretty interesting.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.510
Lately they've been all over the place.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.350
And I think they're not too bright.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.720
Doesn't feel like

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.310
they could plan that many thefts.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.550
And I keep thinking

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.680
they're somehow connected

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.960
to Hongyun Restaurant.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.000
If you suspect it,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.000
find evidence

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.720
to prove it.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.400
So I'm not forcing connections now?

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.960
What's that supposed to mean?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.480
Recognition.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.270
Then say it.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.400
Why do you

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.750
always talk in riddles?

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.480
You stubbornness and little mind games.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.030
Straight talk's boring.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.400
If you won't say it straight,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.110
neither will I.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.590
Anyway,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.750
someone's been acting different lately.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.270
Don't copy my tricks.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.030
What are you hinting at?

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.640
Funny how some grumpy old guy

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.240
was dead-set

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.510
against this case a while ago.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.160
Now his eyes light up

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.590
when he works it.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.680
Master,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.400
can you tell me

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.510
why you didn't

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.030
want this case back then?

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.590
We're at this point now,

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.960
please just tell me.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.270
Is the Nude Banquet Case

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.400
connected to the welfare home

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.160
I grew up in?

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.000
Yes.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.750
Back then, we realized

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.270
the banquet

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.030
happened more than once.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.310
The time it all went wrong,

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.880
those kids

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.960
were from

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.240
the welfare home you lived in.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.670
Captain.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.000
We can't call off the task force.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.680
We can't just shelve this case.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.720
No new leads.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.830
We can't put all our manpower on this.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.480
Other cases are piling up.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.880
Give me more time.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.720
I'll keep digging.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.960
There will be leads.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.400
It's not that I won't give you time.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.310
Zhao Fengcheng, listen.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.590
You're not working just one case.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.110
Cases are piling up.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.790
- Captain.
- If you keep burning yourself on this,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.720
you'll be drained.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.680
You get that?

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.790
No, Cap...

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.460
(Captain)

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.720
The welfare home was shut down.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.880
The kids

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.830
were sent for adoption

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.400
or transferred.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.390
You know,

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.790
Tang Tang was there too.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.880
Tang Zhigang was your buddy.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.310
Would you

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.270
look after his son?

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.110
I...

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.270
I'm not fit to raise a kid.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.960
Zhao Fengcheng,

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.510
don't forget you're a detective.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
You have to adjust

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.400
and move on.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.920
The case is shelved,

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.310
not dead.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.030
I believe that one day,

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.480
we'll crack it.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.270
Even if we can't,

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.440
the younger ones will.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.640
The next generation will.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.150
Come.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.920
Had I not been so lost back then,

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.960
I should've adopted you.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.790
You wouldn't have ended up there.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.350
After the case,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.200
I got scared.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.750
So I took you out.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.040
But now,

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.270
the case's reopened.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.310
It's not I'm against it.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.720
It's just...

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.480
I don't want you dragged into it.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.670
What's wrong with you?

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.200
What's with the low spirit?

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.310
You look like a rookie.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.030
Look at me.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.590
Young,

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.750
brilliant,

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.240
and full of promise.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.070
Who trained me?

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.880
You did.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.550
Where'd you learn that thick skin?

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.030
From you, who else?

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.310
That's better.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.720
Yell at me once in a while.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.680
That makes me feel better.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.400
Master,

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.720
I found Huahua.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.070
My friend at the welfare home

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.750
who went missing.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.550
I found her.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.070
You did?

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.910
Yes.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.480
Not just that.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.310
I also found out

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.310
why she disappeared

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.200
and why she forgot everything at the time.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.720
How did you find her?

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.950
Who is it?

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:06.750
Wang Yimo.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.590
You're sure?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.840
Absolutely.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.160
You know what I felt

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.510
after I knew?

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.800
Regret.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.510
Even though I was a kid,

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.070
why didn't I

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.880
stand up back then?

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.510
If I had,

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.640
maybe things would've been different.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.110
She wouldn't have

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:46.720
gone through that.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.830
She wouldn't have

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.640
forgotten everything.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.550
You were just a kid too.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.480
Nothing you could do.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.400
But now I'm not.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.000
I've got this case now.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.230
I'll see it through.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.110
I'm not that clueless kid anymore.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.630
Though I'm still a bit green.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.880
I'll give it everything I've got.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.230
I'm gonna reel in every last one

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.440
of those scumbags

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.670
from that case.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.600
I'll fulfill

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.150
your long-held wish.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.510
And for the victims,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:46.110
including Huahua,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.360
I'll see justice done.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.070
Boss,

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.070
is there really no other way?

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.670
What are you saying?

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.720
Ali,

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.190
all these years,

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.000
we've been keeping our heads down.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.960
If we take this job,

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.320
we're back in the mud.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.670
I've said all I need to.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.640
Get to work.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.350
Coming.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.320
Let's go.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.350
Stop drinking.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:43.670
We're not late.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.760
Still got time.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.550
Dad,

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.480
we can't go empty-handed.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.230
What do you mean?

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:53.910
Come with me.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.990
Please enjoy.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.840
Thanks.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.440
Dad, hurry up.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.390
What's wrong?

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.400
Let's go inside.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:43.350
Sure.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.600
Ms. Tong.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.120
You're here.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.840
These are from my dad.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.800
Traffic?

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.030
A bit.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.360
Good thing we left early.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.800
I saw someone talking to you.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.990
Who was it?

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.360
Wrong table.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.280
Is this for three?

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.190
Two.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.590
Dinner's already arranged.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.800
Alright.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.630
My job's done.

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.360
I'll leave you two to it.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.400
Have a lovely night.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.320
I'm heading out.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.590
This feels like a TV show.

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.980
(Wang Li was at the restaurant today.
Wang Li had a business dinner.)

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.020
(He stayed home today.)

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.860
(No text for days.
He hasn't been at the restaurant.)

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:19.700
(On a business trip. Back tomorrow.
Didn't find out what for.)

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.540
(Be sharp; His daughter's back.
Got it.)
