WEBVTT

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.240
Dabuyou

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.720
Dabuyou

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.160
Dabuyou Hast

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.920
Towards the main gate

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.480
Kaisi Ouste

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.840
Kaisi Ouste

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.680
Sogdian

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.440
It says there's a ghost

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.320
Someone has died

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.920
Let's go

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.520
Make way, make way.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.200
Guiyi, take my waist token.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.040
Ride fast to the Magistrate's office.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.360
Have the County Magistrate come see me immediately.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.640
Yes, sir.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.080
Who discovered the body?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.880
I did.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.640
Me.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.680
You found a dead body.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.040
Why did you shout that there was a ghost?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.400
The oil lamp.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.080
The oil lamp.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.400
The oil lamp went out.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.280
There's a ghost!

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.800
My Lord.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.320
You may not know this.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.560
Here in Wanling County...

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.600
The lamp must not go out.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.600
Once the lamp goes out...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.760
...the ghost comes.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.920
If you ask me...

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.480
Perhaps he was possessed by a ghost.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.480
Nonsense.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.480
This man's tongue is not protruding.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.040
It is not the sign of death by hanging.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.280
Instead, his windpipe was crushed by great force.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.640
Then he was hung on the door.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.160
This was the work of a human.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.520
I...

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.440
I wouldn't dare speak nonsense.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.680
If My Lord does not believe me...

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.720
Feel free to investigate.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.480
I heard that in Wanling Township...

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.000
...several people have already died.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.400
Make way.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.280
Your subordinate did not know the Acting Vice Minister was coming.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.960
Forgive me for not welcoming you.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.120
In Wanling Township, when the light goes out, the ghost appears.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.600
And several people have died.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.680
Is this true?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.440
It is indeed true.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.960
Have you determined the cause?

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.520
Answering My Lord...

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.320
Not yet.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.800
Not yet?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.400
Several lives have been lost.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.920
As the head of a county, you have the nerve to say "not yet"?

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.960
Wanling Township suddenly encountered ghosts.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.080
Your subordinate has tried his best to investigate the cause.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.440
But...

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.000
My ability is truly limited.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.560
Limited ability, or cowardice?

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.920
Or do you not value the lives of the common people?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.000
Your subordinate accepts the blame.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.960
I will immediately order men to investigate.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.200
Everyone who passed through the Ten Thousand Nations Inn yesterday.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.520
Merchants and commoners alike, register them all.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.080
Also...

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.040
You there.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.880
Close all city gates immediately.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.480
Thoroughly investigate all suspicious persons.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.560
There are no eyewitnesses.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.280
There is no physical evidence.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.240
Even if you check those entering the Inn, what use is it?

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.280
Besides, this isn't the first case.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.240
The culprit has no intention of fleeing.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.920
What is the use of closing the city gates?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560
Then what should your subordinate do?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.200
Please instruct me, My Lord.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.200
Start investigating from him.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.120
Him?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.360
The haunting at the Ten Thousand Nations Inn...

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.320
...is essentially...

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.120
...to rob passing merchants of their goods.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.480
What goods the passing merchants carry...

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.640
...he knows best.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.160
Now, whether he was murdered...

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.040
...or silenced...

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.200
...we must start investigating him first.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.480
Magistrate Sun.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.600
Go and do it.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.760
Regarding this man...

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.760
...no matter how small the detail...

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.760
...investigate everything.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.440
If you do it well...

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.200
...you can make amends for your faults.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.000
Your subordinate understands.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.320
Guiyi.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.880
Go to the county seat immediately.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.920
Check against the registered goods from the Ten Thousand Nations Inn.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.160
Find out if any lost goods have flowed into the market.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.720
If so...

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.400
...flush out the people trading behind the scenes.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.960
Yes.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.960
Shentu.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.040
You and I will go to Wanling Township.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.320
To see who is playing ghost behind the scenes.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.800
Shopkeeper!

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.240
Pawning something?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680
What is the guest pawning?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.240
A celadon-glazed leather flask.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.720
Western Region goods again.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.120
This item of yours...

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.320
To me, it looks like the same batch as before.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.520
Old shopkeeper, what do you mean?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.000
You hold this item, Little Lady,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.240
yet ask me what I mean.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.760
Are you mocking this old man?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.000
I truly do not know.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.760
These days,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.120
people keep bringing in Western Region items.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.080
Gems, crystals, agate, Persian brocade, gold and silver ware.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.080
And some worthless spices.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.080
All to pawn for money.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.320
No.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.400
They don't seek a high price.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.360
They just want me

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.520
to give them ready cash.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.280
If you wish to pawn this, Little Lady,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.080
I must explain the interest clearly.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.960
If selling,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.600
the price

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.080
won't be high.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.000
Please, Shopkeeper,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.800
take these Western Region goods

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.560
and bring them all out

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.360
for me to see.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.960
I run a business here...

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.120
Are you trying to cause trouble...

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.680
My Lord.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.000
Please follow me.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.320
I must also trouble you, Shopkeeper,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520
to send your shop assistants

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.640
to summon all the pawnshop keepers in the county,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.640
and bring the items.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.360
Understood.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.960
My Lord.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.880
Please wait a moment.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.200
Persian brocade.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.680
Received seven days ago.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.160
Who was the seller?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.840
I didn't know him, and he didn't say.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.600
Who received this flask?

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.840
Me.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.480
I received it.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.640
On what day?

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.320
Who was the seller?

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.680
About half a month ago.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.360
I didn't know the seller either.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.200
My Lord,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.560
these people selling Western goods

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.240
might be from Wanling Township.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.200
How do you know?

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.520
My legs aren't very good.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.760
That day when I received this agate,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.080
I was slow in fetching the money,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.360
so they rushed me.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.040
When the two left the shop,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.200
they said if they were late,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.280
they wouldn't make it back to light the lamps.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.200
That must be Wanling Township.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.120
No mistake.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.560
Nowadays in Xianyang City,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.240
who doesn't know Wanling Township is haunted?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.360
I heard their township lights must not go out.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.360
Even during the day,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.000
the oil lamps must be kept burning.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.360
Old man,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880
did you add enough lamp oil?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.280
You rest easy tonight.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.640
I'll keep watch tonight.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.280
Old man.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.960
I heard that last night,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.440
Shen Qinghai died.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.360
Yes.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.080
How did he die?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.760
How else could he die?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.280
The light went out.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.080
Old man.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.720
Counting Shen Qinghai,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.440
five or six have died.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.360
Do you think this is related to what happened back then?

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.840
Don't talk nonsense.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:36.920
Go to sleep.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.400
Oh no.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.080
Old man!

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.600
What is it?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.400
It's okay, it's okay.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.280
It's okay, it's okay. The light is on.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.240
The light is on.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.840
The light is on.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.680
The light is on.
