[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 14]

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.710
[A few hours ago]

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.970
You have good taste.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.000
Excuse me, please.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.229
Have a look!

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.240
Running into the two of us

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.960
means you're out of luck.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.650
Master Bei,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.150
this mechanism of yours

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.810
is really cleverly designed.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.130
Stab me with it again

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.360
and I'll make it malfunction.
Do you believe me?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.770
I-I believe you.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.640
I believe you.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.570
Mr. Bei,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.680
I think you should keep dressing
as a woman.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.000
Your own face...

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.200
What about it?

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.960
It's ugly.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.240
So I get beaten for telling the truth?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.660
Useless!

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.430
[Shou'an Palace]

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.870
All of you are useless!

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.400
The Empress Dowager summoned
many strategists overnight.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.560
Judging by this scene,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.690
she must be furious.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.360
We fought well in this battle.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.520
Using Prince Duan's hand,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.030
we eliminated the experts
around the Empress Dowager

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.840
and dispelled Prince Duan's suspicions
about Mr. Bei.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.240
Two birds with one stone.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.700
Not bad indeed,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.290
but let's not get cocky.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.230
When the fight between them
is nearing its end,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.070
there won't be much time for you
to lie low

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.280
and bide your time.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.210
What is this?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.750
Bai gave it to you.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.060
Let me explain.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.250
No need to explain.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.000
It's rare for him to be so thoughtful.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.730
Just keep it.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.470
That's...

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.950
That's it?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.270
What else should I do?

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.880
Stop pretending to be so generous.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.600
Aren't you usually quite jealous?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.830
So what if you're the emperor?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.270
Can you guarantee she won't be bullied?

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.000
That I can do.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.750
Then can you guarantee

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.360
that among all the women in the world,
she'll be the only one you want?

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.090
That's easy.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.000
You...

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.210
don't have anything else
you want to say to me?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.180
What else should I say?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.900
You tell me.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.290
The Empress Dowager

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.750
will definitely find every excuse

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.450
to make things difficult for Prince Duan.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.800
So let's...

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.070
Let's do what?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.510
Let's...

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.720
No rush.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.840
Let's wait until everything's settled.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.930
I really can't understand.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.040
Why did Concubine Yu do such a thing?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.120
She's already
the most favored in the harem.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.320
Why did she do something so despicable?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.350
That servant

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.370
kept insisting it was his own idea

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.230
and had nothing to do with her.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.040
Concubine Yu really managed
to wash her hands of it completely.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.170
Wash her hands of it?

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.650
Then why did she end up
in the Cold Palace?

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.540
Let me tell you,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.560
she's miserable in the Cold Palace.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.390
Nonsense.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.560
Who's talking nonsense?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.160
Go to the Cold Palace
and see for yourself.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.000
How dare you!

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.470
Why are you cursing at me?

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.470
Mr. Li.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.680
Mr. Li.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.730
Noble Consort Yu

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.430
understands the greater good and
loves the people like her own children.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.680
How could she do something so despicable?

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.340
Don't spread rumors anymore.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.480
Yes.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.810
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.400
I must go ask His Majesty
for clarification.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.870
But harem affairs
are His Majesty's family matters.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.930
How can I, a mere subject, interfere?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.950
The Noble Consort once saved my life.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.360
Now that she's in trouble,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.720
how can I just stand by?

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.620
But as a court official,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.810
what can I really do for Her Highness?

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.800
Li Yunxi, oh Li Yunxi.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.160
So you're such a coward.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.800
She is not only His Majesty's consort

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800
but also his comrade
who fights alongside him.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.950
Are you going to be like those pedantic,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.390
narrow-minded fools

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.120
and abandon her after using her

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.890
just because she is a woman?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.070
Your Majesty!

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.190
I

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.340
am willing to counsel
even at the cost of my life!

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.290
You're here?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.250
Come.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.930
Please rise.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.630
Don't mind me.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.510
You two talk.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.270
Since everyone is here,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.800
let's...

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.630
begin.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.920
The one who killed someone last night
was Li Si.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.470
You're not a wanted criminal.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.000
Why are you being so sneaky?

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.309
That's right.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.720
I've been

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.440
hiding so carefully all this way.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.169
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.870
Why did you use internal force
just to throw a bag?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.400
Alright.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.040
Stop fooling around.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.090
To avoid complications,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.840
I have to hastily arrange for you
to leave the city.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.770
Have you decided

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.500
where to go?

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.840
I'll stay at a farmhouse for a few days

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.270
and wait for my companion
before we leave together.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.000
Companion?

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.960
You rascal.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.120
You're quite something.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.310
It's only been a few days,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.610
and you've already gained
His Majesty's recognition.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.670
What's his secret order

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.200
that you can't even tell me?

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.120
You'll have to ask His Majesty.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:22.990
Forget it.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.240
Now that Dan

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.400
is in a dangerous situation

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.300
and you're still inexperienced,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.240
you must

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.240
be extra careful in everything

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.670
and act only after careful planning.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.390
Don't let him down.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.600
Also,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.800
take good care of yourself.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.290
Don't make your master worry.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.020
Don't worry.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:44.930
Master Bei,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.440
I heard from my master

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.960
that you can write poetry.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.360
At this moment of farewell,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.420
how about one poem?

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.080
Alright.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.200
The road ahead stretches endlessly,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.840
and the autumn wind is lonely.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.530
If one stands in the wind too long,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.510
one will get cold.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.330
It is indeed getting cold.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.410
Master Bei,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.960
you should head back now.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.250
Until we meet again.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.270
Take care.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.550
Mr. Bei,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.740
if you later discover

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.840
that he isn't your old friend's son,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.170
but a lonely soul who came from
another world many years ago,

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.270
you'll definitely be heartbroken.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.280
At that time,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.180
will you still treat him the same way?

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.360
I have calculated the expected yield

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.440
during droughts based on
the crop varieties in each region.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.270
When a drought occurs,

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.390
Your Majesty, you can adjust
disaster relief according to

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.840
the grain reserves of each province.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.360
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Cen.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.840
It is my duty.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.510
Your Majesty,

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.790
since the reduction of taxes and rents

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.200
and the implementation
of the Salt-for-Services Policy,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.080
the people's livelihood
has greatly improved.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.400
-I've visited the villages around...
-Although the Yan people

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.720
live in a remote land,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.480
they have always coveted
the prosperity of Great Xia.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.550
I remember in the original story,
once Xiahou Dan died,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.750
The King of Yan immediately took advantage
of the drought to launch an invasion,

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.810
clashing fiercely with Prince Duan.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.800
If this diplomatic mission fails,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.720
war will be unavoidable.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.210
It seems we must prepare early

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.490
to avoid being defenseless

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.840
by the time.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.480
I have visited
over 10 villages near the capital.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.750
And many fields of Yan millet
have been cultivated within the border.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.000
After a few planting seasons,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.960
even without buying seeds from Yan State,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.240
we should be able to handle droughts
in the future.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.280
As General You said

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.740
-the day before yesterday...
-General You?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.520
Your Majesty.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.480
Although General You
is the commander of the Right Army,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.320
he has none of the bearing
of a true general.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.670
With him stationed at the southern border,

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.000
it will sooner or later become a disaster.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.670
He has good judgment.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.910
This man was a coward
in the original story.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.140
During the Yan-Xia war,
he rushed to surrender.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.910
He truly disgraces his title of general.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.270
I don't expect him
to accomplish anything significant.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.680
But with him in that post,

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.400
I can't command him,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.880
nor can Prince Duan.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.870
That's actually not a bad thing.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.120
-But the southern border...
-Mr. Li.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.720
Stop worrying about others.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.240
Tell me about the Ministry of Revenue.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.640
The Ministry of Revenue?

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.700
Then there's even more

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.790
to report.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.910
What is this?

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.620
What nonsense is this?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.730
Take it back and rewrite it!

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.070
Here, drink more.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.110
Lord Chen.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.270
Lord Chen.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.420
Can't you see I'm busy?

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.550
Take it back and rewrite it.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.150
Lord Chen.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.560
Lord Chen.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.360
This is my corrected version.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.690
Why are you everywhere?

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:57.670
Go away.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.380
In the past 5 years,

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.770
the population and common people
of more than 10 counties

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.440
have neither increased nor decreased.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.480
Thousands of acres of fertile farmland
have been seized by local gentry,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.480
and not a single person
in the Ministry of Revenue noticed.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.200
After this,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.830
I finally understand

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.440
why the records
in each province and county

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.900
are full of errors
without anyone noticing,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.610
and why those officials
have been idle for years

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.510
without anyone
holding them accountable.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.030
It's simply because

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.490
those land-grabbing gentry

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.670
are backed by layers of local officials,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.600
and behind those damn officials

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.270
are all imperial relatives.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.100
Li!

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.630
If we investigate thoroughly,

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.480
in the entire Ministry of Revenue,

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.740
how many would dare claim they're clean?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.480
If we investigate further,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.630
it leads to the Empress Dowager.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.680
Who can investigate? Who dares to?

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.900
If we let them hide their corruption,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.030
when will this land

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.760
ever see fairness and justice?

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.440
With a vicious woman in power

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.040
and no wise ruler to oversee,

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.320
no matter how much effort we put in,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.840
it'll be all in vain.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:09.720
Li.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.910
What you said is true.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.000
But determination alone
cannot change the situation.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
If we want to investigate,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.390
we can always use some connections
in the bureaucracy

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.720
and find flexible ways.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.890
You want me to exploit loopholes?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.750
Since none of us is willing to stand by,

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.080
making some compromises

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.120
is acceptable, isn't it?

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.440
How should we compromise?

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.480
Why don't you demonstrate it yourself,
Lord Er,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.870
and show me?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.850
For example,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.150
we could arrange for some farmers
whose fertile land was seized

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.390
to file a petition to His Majesty,

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.510
then have a palace servant
subtly report it to the Empress Dowager.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.480
As for the Ministry of Revenue...

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.000
Minister,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.650
I heard that after the treasury incident,

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.200
the Empress Dowager has been keeping
a close eye on the Ministry of Revenue.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.360
In my humble opinion,

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.480
a reform order

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.360
will be issued sooner or later.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.320
We might as well

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.270
take the initiative and reform
before she orders it.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.340
At least everyone
can save face in the end.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.410
You can rest assured
and leave this matter to me.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.750
What do you think, My Lord?

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.610
That's just...

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.480
That's the general idea.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.750
Li, you're so eloquent.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.510
Certainly you would put it in a nicer way.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.690
That makes sense.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.470
I believe that

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.670
whether a cat is black or white,

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.000
as long as it catches mice,
it's a good cat.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.800
Even though our path now
is winding and tortuous,

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.440
even the smallest efforts

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.640
will eventually pile up
like grains of sand into a tower.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.670
Since Li has finished his report,

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.150
let me proceed next.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.720
I haven't fini—

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.920
Mr. Er has important matters to report.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.550
Sit down.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:44.600
What are you doing?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.530
That was enough.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.620
[Kunyu Palace]

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.900
Through all these hardships,

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.730
thankfully I've had Yong'er

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.410
by my side supporting me.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.720
I...

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.880
will never let you down.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.510
Xie Yong'er, oh Xie Yong'er.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:29.200
What are you doing?

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200
Do you want to die?

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.960
Your Highness,
why has your period come early?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.240
It's not time yet.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:38.600
I...

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.630
Well...

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.370
It's not the period.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.320
Perhaps...

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:52.440
I bumped...

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.240
into something somewhere.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.400
Are you injured?

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.670
If you're injured, why didn't you tell me?

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.960
I'll go get Physician Xiao.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.490
I'm fine.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.370
How can you be fine?

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.720
If you're injured, you can't attend

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.670
to His Majesty in the bedchamber.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.790
We need to report this
to the Service Room.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.170
I said I'm fine.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.950
I was so careless that night.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.650
After all these nights of service,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.650
His Majesty hasn't even touched me.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.640
If I'm pregnant with Prince Duan's child,

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.920
the consequences would be unimaginable.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.319
I need to think of an idea.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.840
Go prepare
two bright-colored outfits for me.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:30.750
Tonight,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.080
I'll go see His Majesty.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.720
This way,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.950
merchants will compete to transport grain

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.030
in exchange for
Salt Transportation and Sales License.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.510
The profits from salt trade are enormous.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.640
Merchants will naturally flock to it.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.480
In the future,

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.200
the fight to control the monopoly

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.660
will lead to collusion between officials
and merchants, breeding corruption.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.400
But wasn't the Salt-for-Services Policy

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.680
your proposal?

00:17:58.790 --> 00:17:59.590
Your Majesty,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.880
every dynasty's policies have their flaws.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.070
Today, the Salt-for-Services Policy
does benefit the people.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.510
When its drawbacks become apparent,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.770
it should be replaced with new policies.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.680
By then,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.980
Er,

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.840
you will already hold high office,
won't you?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.310
No.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.350
By that time,

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.770
I should no longer be in court.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.680
Those who hold high office

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.200
should be people like you.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.750
The court by then

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.750
will surely allow talents like you

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.830
to achieve great things

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.490
and realize their ambitions.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:40.640
Mr. Li,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.440
I have never forgotten

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.350
what we said that day
on the pleasure boat.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.410
What we seek is not power or scheming,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.140
but the wealth and well-being
of the people.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.240
Otherwise, how are we different

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.550
from Prince Duan's sycophants?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.270
How could we face Du

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.440
and fulfill our promises to him?

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.960
We must carry his sincerity

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.480
and spare no effort to support Great Xia.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.010
We will do everything we can

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.270
to support our wise ruler.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.270
The corrupt officials will pay the price.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.930
We will soon

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.730
restore your reputation.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.310
Mr. Er is right.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.640
Those who accomplish great things
do not get caught up in trivial matters.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.840
His Majesty once said

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.930
we are one team,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.030
each with strengths and weaknesses,

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.490
and should work together.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.590
Chen Danian

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.380
only cares for wine and women.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.640
Mr. Li, you don't like dealing with him.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.680
I'll take on the burden.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.720
Leave it to me.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.270
The Ministry of Works
has many tedious matters.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.640
I am good with calculations.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.070
Mr. Yang, if you need me,

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.240
just ask.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.560
I only know farming.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.690
My health...

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.660
I might not be of much help to you.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:54.520
I'm ashamed.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.820
So ashamed.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.750
Cen,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.240
you like farming.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.750
If your ox gets tired,

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.620
I'm strong.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.160
I can take its place.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.040
Prince Duan has an army of 100,000.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.400
The Empress Dowager has the entire court.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:26.930
And we...

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.160
only have each other.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.640
I'm not particularly talented,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.840
but being able
to meet all of you in this lifetime

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.440
is reason enough for a toast.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.600
I'll use tea in place of wine

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.880
and toast to you all.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.640
Your Highness.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.500
Your Highness.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.770
The world is like a long night.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.810
Who could change it with a single cry?

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.770
But to struggle alongside you,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.080
even if we fall halfway,

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.000
I know I'm not alone.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:22.960
Li Yunxi.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.390
Your Majesty.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.140
Keep organizing the records.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.540
Don't tell anyone.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.640
Give them directly to me.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.600
They'll be useful someday.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:42.880
Rise.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.550
It's because people like them exist

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.770
that it makes me feel
leaving everything behind

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.230
would be despicable.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.310
Then I...

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.900
should properly thank these ministers.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.080
They make me know I'm not alone.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.020
Stop imitating me.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.840
It's getting late. I should head back now.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.530
Why not stay for dinner first?

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.240
Hot pot.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.350
Your Majesty!

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.720
Your Majesty!

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.040
Your Majesty.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.800
Your Majesty,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.430
Consort Xie requests...

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.210
an audience.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.490
I will take my leave now.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.000
Consort Xie?

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.530
Well...

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.000
the hot pot...

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.860
The secret passage is over there.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.570
Solidifying your image
of favoring Consort Xie?

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:52.720
I think

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.880
you're just getting back at me

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.740
for making Xie Yong'er serve you
in the bedchamber.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.900
Just admit it.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.940
Seeing a bunch of women fighting over you,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.010
you're secretly enjoying it, aren't you?

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.270
And now you're turning your head away?
What's that supposed to mean?

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.160
I know men too well.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.140
You say no with your mouth,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.600
but inside you're probably delighted.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.680
However,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.810
we just tricked Prince Duan
at Banyue House.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.110
And Xie Yong'er came at this time...

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.050
Could she be snooping for Prince Duan?

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.530
I can't let her do that.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.690
I'd better stay and keep watch.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200
You're so stupid.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.570
What if Xie Yong'er manipulates you?

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.720
It makes perfect sense.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.120
Completely reasonable.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.920
My dear, you're here.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.880
I have prepared wine for...

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.440
I...

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.880
have prepared the wine.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.830
Your Majesty,
please don't trouble yourself.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.490
I've already had some drinks.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.550
Is she imitating me?

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.120
Wine is the essence of food.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.420
The more you drink, the younger you feel.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.320
Let's play a drinking game.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.750
I don't want to play drinking games.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.050
Then what do you want to do?

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.500
I want you to guess

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.690
what I have...

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.160
in my sleeve.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.720
Flowers.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.810
Xie Yong'er really knows how to flirt.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.750
Can CEO Dan handle this?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:09.820
Flowers...

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.990
Your Majesty.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.070
Your Majesty, would you like to see

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.750
what I have...

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.420
underneath this robe?

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.810
My dear, calm down.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.440
How did it fall down?

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.070
She's much more flirtatious than I am.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.640
You don't like this either?

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.640
Then I guess

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.750
you must want to know

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.960
what's underneath...

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.240
my skirt.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.290
Xie Yong'er, you're quite something!

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.030
My dear, don't come any closer.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.030
You must be drunk.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.260
You can pretend I'm drunk if you want.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.400
Your Majesty!

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.060
-Don't move!
-Your Majesty, what are you doing?

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:03.590
Your Majesty!

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.350
What's happening?

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.010
-It hurts, Your Majesty!
-I can't see anything!

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.400
Your Majesty, be gentle.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.140
It hurts!

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.030
Your Majesty,
do you truly feel nothing for me?

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.510
Yes.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:14.880
An Xian!

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.490
I'm here.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:21.750
Consort Xie is drunk.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.490
Send her back to her palace.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.800
Yes.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:25.860
Guards!

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.550
Carry her away.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.520
What's wrong with that silly girl
Xie Yong'er today?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.960
-Doesn't she only care about Prince Duan?
-Your Majesty!

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.590
-Is it Prince Duan
-Your Majesty!

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.120
who made her put on this act?

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.510
Or did Prince Duan
break Xie Yong'er's heart

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.840
and she switched her target to Xiahou Dan?

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.380
What does she want?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.440
You...

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.030
I...

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.010
What are you doing here?

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.310
I, uh...

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.790
I...

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.010
I got stuck.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.310
You got stuck?

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.580
I've been eating well lately.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.570
I've gained weight.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.030
Yu Wanyin,

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.000
what have you become?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.950
You...

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.030
You were eavesdropping!

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.350
You're like those jealous,

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:50.750
brainless cannon fodder in novels!

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.270
How embarrassing!

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.240
Why don't you come out first?

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:58.900
She's gone.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.830
Forget it.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.640
There are too many people around.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.200
It wouldn't look good
if someone sees me here.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.000
I'd better go.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.440
I won't let anyone in.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.240
Forget it.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.070
Eunuch An just caught us.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.800
I'm leaving.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.180
Xie Yong'er just left,

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.120
and Xiahou Dan came to check the tunnel.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.080
How did he know I hadn't left?

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.920
I didn't make any sound.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.920
Unless...

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.000
Unless he wanted to find me.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.720
He didn't expect

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.170
that I witnessed the whole thing.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.000
And he was embarrassed.

♪ Whose longing lingers day and night? ♪

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.140

love or staying alive?

♪ Piling up stories
and countless thoughts ♪

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:36.720
Staying alive, of course.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.570
That's the most important thing.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.470

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.380

Move these out first.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.440
Here.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.400
Your Highness.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.130
Please rise.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.550
The weather's getting cold.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:38.830
I made some ginger soup for everyone.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.680
Drink it while it's hot.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.550
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.010
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:42.840
Here.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.770
There's no rush with this secret passage.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.480
His Majesty said

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.400
this secret passage is used every day.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.720
We must hurry to widen it.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.350
We can't let Your Highness suffer.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.880
Every...

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.030
every day?

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.240
CEO Dan is embarrassing me.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.400
Why hasn't His Majesty
dismissed the court yet today?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.260
Your Highness,

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.510
I heard they're still arguing over

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.920
whether to let the Yan envoys
enter the city.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.200
His Majesty just left court

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.240
and got trapped in the Imperial Study.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.040
Your Majesty,

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:10.720
the Yan people
claim to be celebrating your birthday,

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.040
but everyone knows

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.200
what they really want to do.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.550
Yes.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.000
If we open the city gates
and welcome them in,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.240
wouldn't that be like
inviting a wolf into the house,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.170
leading to endless consequences?

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.310
Yes.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.110
That's right.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.120
Minister, how do you know

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.640
that the Yan people's visit

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.090
is ill-intentioned

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.460
rather than genuinely seeking peace talks?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:34.920
Peace talks?

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.240
Your Majesty,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.600
we've been fighting for over ten years.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.070
If they wanted to talk,
they would've done it earlier.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.750
Why would they wait until today?

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.280
Exactly.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.550
We have 100,000 troops
bravely fighting them at the border,

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.440
yet the court wants to
welcome them as honored guests.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.240
Your Majesty, if you insist on this,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.880
it'll disappoint our soldiers
at the border.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.310
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.510
This must be a conspiracy
by the Yan people.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.920
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.720
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.450
If we can truly hold peace talks

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.240
and end the war at the border,

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.840
these 100,000 soldiers

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.480
can reunite with their families

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:07.830
and enjoy peace.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.950
Won't that be a blessing?

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.510
Your Majesty, you make it sound simple.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.400
Over the past 10 years,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.480
we've paid such a heavy price.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.790
Now that we have the upper hand,

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.070
we should press the advantage

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.730
and wipe out the Yan people.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.880
Yet now you want to give up halfway.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.760
How are we

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.210
supposed to explain this to the soldiers?

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.590
Yes, Mr. Cao is right.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.480
How can we explain to them?

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.090
Exactly.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.790
Please calm down.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.590
What we're discussing now is

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.160
whether to let them enter the city
to celebrate my birthday.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.830
We're not talking about peace talks yet.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:37.360
Besides,

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.410
I observed the stars last night

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.940
and saw Saturn aligning with Jupiter.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.270
This foretells...

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:46.070
You Imperial Astronomers
always go with the wind.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.240
If solving problems could really be done

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.960
with just a few divinations like you do,

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.510
what would we ministers be for?

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.960
Exactly!

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.590
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty!
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.750
We cannot invite the wolf into the house,
Your Majesty!

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:36.680
-Your Majesty, please reconsider!
-Yes, Your Majesty.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.720
We can't let the Yan people
get into Great Xia!

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.240
Your Majesty, please reconsider!

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.880
-Your Majesty, please reconsider!
-Your Majesty.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.240
We cannot invite the wolf into the house,
Your Majesty!

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.040
Your Majesty!

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.390
Your Majesty!

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.590
-We can't do that!
-Your Majesty, please reconsider!

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.030
Your Majesty, please reconsider!

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:50.830
Your Majesty!

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.830
We can't do that! We can!

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.200
Your Majesty!

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.720
We can't do that!

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.350
Please reconsider, Your Majesty!

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.150
Your Majesty!

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:58.590
Your Majesty!

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.270
Your Majesty!

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.300
Your Majesty!

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.760
This Xiahou Dan.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.760
It's almost dark.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.460
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.659
I've been waiting for so long.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.280
He can't possibly be skipping dinner,
can he?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.080
That won't do.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.760
It's indeed much more spacious now.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.570
This Xiahou Dan.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.920
If you're skipping dinner,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.520
you should at least send someone
to let me know.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.199
Just how busy are you

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.630
that you can't even spare the time
to send a message?

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.630
This Xiahou Dan is driving me crazy!

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.840
Yu Wanyin, what are you doing?

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.480
You're now a demonic consort
who brings disaster to the country.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.000
You used to be
a heartless corporate slave.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.860
Look at you now.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.070
You're not focusing on your career,

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.000
and you're even chasing after him.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:15.960
Go back.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.670
So what?

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.590
If he truly has something urgent,

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.450
isn't it normal

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.110
for me to go ask?

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.440
Besides,

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.440
isn't this secret passage

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.630
meant to be used?

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.050
He's coming.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.130
Wanyin.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:39.840
I was just looking for you.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.500
Dan is sick.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.000
Come.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.240
Zhang San's Diary.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.710
When three people are together,

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:54.570
there's always something
to learn from each other.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.970
I will select

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.510
-their good qualities and follow them,
-The Empress Dowager is gone.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.630
-The Emperor doesn't care about me.
-their bad qualities

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.800
-and avoid them.
-The new Empress is not a good person.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.620
-Her eyes...
-Confucius said,

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.440
while standing by a river...

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.840
Every time our eyes meet,
I get goosebumps.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.390
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:18.070
Mother.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.530
You're studying?

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.630
Your Majesty,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.320
the Crown Prince has been studying
the Analects of Confucius lately.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.390
I thought

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.620
that as a Confucian classic,

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.000
it can teach him how to
cultivate himself and govern the state,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.070
so that in the future

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.930
he can shoulder the responsibilities
of the realm.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.920
The Analects of Confucius

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.230
is profound.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.380
The Crown Prince is still very young.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.660
Might it be too difficult for him?

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.290
I believe

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.550
he should proceed step by step.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.630
What about the Thousand Character Classic?

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.440
It is full of principles
on conduct and behavior,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.030
and would be easier

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.460
for the Crown Prince to learn.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.590
Study the Thousand Character Classic?

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.230
She's afraid I'll learn too much

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.690
and become capable enough

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.070
that she can no longer control me.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.110
Does she want to raise me
into a useless puppet

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.640
she can manipulate at will?

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:17.680
No way.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.320
I can't just sit here waiting for doom.

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.760
Dan,

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.190
what do you think?

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.760
Mother,

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:31.090
the Imperial Study is so quiet and lonely.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.480
I'm here alone every day,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.690
and it's truly lonely and dull.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.090
I beg for your kindness.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.950
Even one companion

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.960
would be nice.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:44.100
Your Highness,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.190
Her Majesty has instructed that

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.850
from now on,

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.440
the Second Prince

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.190
will study with you.

Greetings, Your Highness.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:54.200
Brother,

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.950
no need for formalities.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.540
I was just worried about having no one...

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.700
I will be a good study companion

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.810
and not disappoint your kindness.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.070
He doesn't seem to like me much.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.110
It doesn't matter.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.230
After spending time together,

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:13.890
we'll surely become friends.

[Thousand Character Classic]

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.970
Dark is the sky, yellow the earth.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.080
The universe was vast and crude.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.760
The sun goes down, the moon comes up.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.550
The stars spread as dots.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.100
Winter succeeds summer.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.930
Autumn harvest follows winter storage.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.180
The surplus days make a leap year.

Master,

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.400
I was the one dozing off.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.800
You punished the wrong person.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.800
The Crown Prince has a noble status.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:02.280
Even if he makes mistakes,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.440
the punishment should be taken by

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.800
his study companion.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.610
Master,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.480
how can you do this?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.420
I was the one who made the mistake.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.350
I should be the one being punished.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:16.410
The other one.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.800
How is it that
after getting a study companion,

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.300
your studies

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.250
have become even worse?

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.600
Why is that?

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.650
Mother,

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:43.430
I am foolish

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.520
and always anger the Master.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.110
I even caused trouble for my brother

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.240
that he couldn't focus on his lessons.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:50.900
Perhaps

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.280
the Master

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.010
should tutor me alone instead.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.920
Crown Prince,

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.980
you're the Crown Prince.
How could you be wrong?

The study companion

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:03.630
is here to assist you.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.830
If he's not attentive,

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.590
that's his fault.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.760
I failed
to properly support the Crown Prince

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.190
and disrupted his studies.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.990
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.320
Who gave you permission
to speak in front of me?

Your mother, that lowly maid,

the Crown Prince's birth mother

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.710
and was slapped to death.

Are you planning
to follow in her footsteps?

I was wrong.

I will be careful with my words
and actions from now on

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.880
and serve the Crown Prince
with full devotion.

Don't be afraid, Crown Prince.

There's no need to worry.

Your father has many sons.

If he doesn't perform well,

Why are you punishing them?

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.000
Her Majesty specifically instructed

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.800
that when the Crown Prince's headaches
act up,

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.030
someone beside him
must feel even more pain

to relieve it.

you should take better care
of your precious self.
