[Tree of Life]

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.120
[Episode 5]

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.710
Why so

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.259
few oxygen tanks?

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.780
We

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.710
agreed on ten.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.289
It was ten.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.539
How are we short?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.620
Manager Zhao

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.700
has blue lips and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.870
can barely stand.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.860
The hospital

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.560
read his

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.680
BP as 60/38.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.470
If the deal fails, fine.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.759
but if he gets hurt

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:59.520
here,

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.750
who takes

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.720
the blame?

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.450
We did have

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.870
enough tanks.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.590
Based on the budget.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.560
But they

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.289
started

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.240
using them

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.150
right away.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.800
We only had a few

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.860
left at the site.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.000
You!

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.680
You’re

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.020
so stubborn.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.210
Only follow orders.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.270
If told

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300
ten, it's ten.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.810
Can't you prepare extra?

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.610
Why not be

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.950
more proactive?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.650
It's not me.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.460
An extra

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.120
tank

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.440
costs extra money.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.460
But that's

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.360
the budget.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.200
Hot.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.240
Where's

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.100
the reporter?

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.950
The investors left.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.910
Where's he?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.720
I called the paper;

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.340
he left days ago.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.870
I guess he was delayed

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.760
on the way.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.150
He's new here.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.340
All is

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.440
new to him.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.160
Who knows

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.280
where he is.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.590
So lax.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.050
Unreliable.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.720
Reporter Shao Yunfei from Qinghai West Evening

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.900
Sir.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.560
What's up?

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.180
Hello.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.970
Hello.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.220
How far is Mazhi County

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.020
from here?

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.120
Heading to Mazhi?

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.630
Yes.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.210
Mazhi Economic

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.300
Development Company.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.280
It's

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.180
a ways from the county seat.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.150
You mean

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.310
Duo Jie's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.830
Mountain Patrol?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.670
Yes.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.450
His Mountain Patrol.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.760
We're close.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.510
I

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.630
often supply them.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.170
Really?

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.430
I'll take you.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.310
Get in.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.250
Get in.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.860
Okay.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.510
Thanks.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.080
Thanks.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.770
Thanks.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.300
Sure.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.780
Thanks.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.130
There yet?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.730
Not yet.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.800
Almost.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.600
How much further?

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.200
Sir.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.810
I feel a bit dizzy.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.710
First

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.860
time this high?

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.480
Altitude sickness.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.390
Stay put.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.810
I'll load up.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.700
Be right back.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.360
No rush.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.070
Why not?

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.170
Are you ready?

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.550
Yes.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.200
Waiting for inspection.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.370
Let's work.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.250
These weigh 400 jin?

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.210
Barely 300 jin.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.940
Why would I lie?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.560
They should be 400 jin.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.440
Weigh it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.180
I'm being cautious.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.640
Scale.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.480
Scale.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.120
Scale.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.180
Sir.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.370
What is this?

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.650
Brine shrimp.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.050
Brine shrimp.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.000
What's it

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.450
for?

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.920
It's live feed.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.990
Shrimp farm needs it.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.760
Sells for 300 yuan a jin.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.330
So valuable?

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.850
Good stuff.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.630
Good stuff.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.770
Soft gold.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.690
Plenty here.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.690
Can we just

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.310
catch this casually?

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.460
Fine. I won't film.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.690
You work.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.950
I'll rest.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.000
I'm dizzy.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.340
Bye.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.500
Okay.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.950
What?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.560
Take your laundry and

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.220
wash it

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.130
all.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.100
No need.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.130
I got it.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.580
You

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.990
just dipped them.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.190
That's

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.950
not washing.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.070
See.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.360
You need

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.740
strong soap

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.000
to scrub this grime

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.000
No way. I can't

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.070
let a woman do

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.890
my laundry.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.310
What's the big deal?

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.180
It's not underwear.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.750
I've

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.530
done theirs.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.600
Let me.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.120
Here, Bai Ju.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.250
Rest.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.430
I'll hang.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.930
Here.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.180
Tastes good.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.390
Thank you.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.270
You're

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.450
the only one who's

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.040
embarrassed.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.130
I'll

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.130
scold them.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:07.500
Slackers.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.250
Good.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.100
A bit sweet.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.370
You've been up there.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.320
How was it?

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.480
That counts?

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:21.800
It felt

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.560
like a tour

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.650
outside Bolamula

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.950
with Uncle Lin and

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.380
the investors.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.220
It ended quickly.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.050
We were lucky.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.500
They barely fought back.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.830
Not as thrilling

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.309
as you

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.049
imagined?

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.169
Disappointed?

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.669
Do you think

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.669
I pushed to come

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.180
here for thrills?

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.380
Not really.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.460
You're a police.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.530
Responsible.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.000
Hate injustice.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.020
I

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.370
don't have grand

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.260
dreams like

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.150
those heroes.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.660
I never dreamed of catching

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.550
poachers

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.140
before

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.120
joining

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.530
the Patrol.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.670
Seeing all those

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.720
pelts you

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.030
seized, especially

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.810
the baby

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.960
Tibetan antelope.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.550
Touching their soft wool.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.780
Realizing how

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.670
young they were

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.650
when they were

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.150
killed

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.540
and skinned.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.970
I can't just stand by.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.420
This is my home.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.450
I must stop

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.130
them.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.050
Even if

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.140
I weren't a police,

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.420
I'd still

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.150
do this.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.880
But don't worry.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.640
I won't push to

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.340
go again.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.730
I told the Chief I'm staying

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.980
with the Patrol, even if

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.070
it's just

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.240
laundry, as long as

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.130
you keep me.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.790
Talked to Director Zhang?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.370
My mom said you're capable

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.470
and reliable.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.750
She wants me to follow.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.030
Me? Reliable?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.910
I'm just reckless.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.000
I don't think ahead.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.950
But we're

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.710
alike there.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.650
Missed it.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.130
This time,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.140
we might face

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.100
poachers

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.270
head-on.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.770
Check your

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:53.500
guns before we go.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.810
Take all your ammo.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.130
Captain.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.000
Guo Shun's

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.790
car is here.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.840
Here are his

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.600
clothes.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.380
Okay.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.740
Where to?

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.720
The Chief's

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.320
pushing

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.320
me about He's

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.820
report.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.770
Meeting

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.410
first. Write it later.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:30.940
Okay.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.750
Han. Wear

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.950
Guo

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.320
Shun's clothes and

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.130
be him.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.890
Got it.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.650
In this trip,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.120
we should catch poachers and

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.560
finish the

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.010
mineral exploration.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.500
[The 13th Mountain Patrol]

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.410
We're too fast.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.580
Slow down.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.710
Got it.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.620
That last peak

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.060
was over 4,800.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.360
Are you okay?

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.900
Yeah.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.630
I feel

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:51.860
great.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.070
Easy now.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.140
Pull over there.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.510
Need water?

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:47.480
No.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.440
Who is he honoring?

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.590
Was someone lost?

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.340
Take this.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:45.910
Okay.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.080
Flash lights

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.510
twice if you get sleepy.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.790
We'll watch.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.900
Don't worry.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.180
Be careful.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:15:59.720
Go.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.010
Go.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.520
What is it?

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.170
I have nothing.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.160
I have nothing.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:24.740
Zhacuo.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.720
Our trust.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:26.710
Trust?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.620
It's here.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.620
Test a horse by its step,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.130
a person by their heart.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.450
You are usually upright.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.190
But you get

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.340
shifty drinking.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.250
Listen.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.200
Leave it.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:41.290
I won't

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.200
drink.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.250
I'll save it.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.980
Then why bring it in?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.380
A taste.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:46.960
Just see

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:47.630
it

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.960
is enough.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:52.460
A taste?

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.970
No.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:53.560
A taste.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:53.980
You.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.080
Look then.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.700
Take a good look.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.210
Watch out. Your eyes

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.370
might drain the glass!

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.630
You.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.890
What are you doing?

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:12.609
Eat this.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.569
It has

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.420
vitamins.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:16.550
Why this?

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.630
I'm not a rabbit.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.140
Then give it back.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.130
You're

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.440
all going bad.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.620
Captain, hot water?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.720
Keep low, no

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:48.830
fires.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.060
Why whistle

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.070
going uphill?

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.660
Downhill is a

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.690
blind spot. The whistle

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.940
warns animals not to bolt out

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.160
when startled

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:01.850
by a

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.820
car.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.790
Nice view here.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.190
Let's stop.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:16.800
Tonight,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.660
watch Han.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.330
Two per team.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.770
Two-hour shifts.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.060
Can I team up with

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.750
you?

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.900
Okay.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:25.830
He.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.550
You split the work.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.160
Bai Ju and I go first.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.980
Hurry up.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.830
Eat and sleep

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.650
in the car.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:33.480
Go.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.050
Okay.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.000
Go.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.200
G-e.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:46.850
Manage.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.270
Manage.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.840
Manage.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.070
Manage.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.980
Manage.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.270
Manage.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.250
Manage.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.410
M-a-n-a-g-e.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.150
Manage.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.000
I can’t

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.240
remember words here.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.260
Low

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.570
oxygen makes me fuzzy.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.590
You can ask for

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.680
an exam here.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.720
No one else can beat you.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.870
Zhacuo, you're

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.290
up? Quiz me on

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.540
some words to help

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.720
me remember.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.740
Here.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.810
I want to slap you.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.760
Let me sleep.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.810
Manage.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.590
Sangba.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.210
I'll do.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.700
Sure.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.580
Can you

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.910
translate this first?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.050
Okay, let me see.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.660
Hello, dear Wangmu.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.790
This is.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.130
Dear Wangmu.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:47.530
Well.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:49.640
Tibetan.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.350
Can you translate

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.150
this into

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:52.810
Tibetan?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.550
Tibetan?

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.810
Write it yourself.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:55.480
You're a

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.430
Tibetan.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:57.740
Come on.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.140
I can hear and speak Tibetan,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.860
but writing is hard.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.270
Do me a favor.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:04.110
You can.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.770
Please

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:05.370
help me.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.440
I'll do it.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.560
I'll

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.560
explain first.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.370
No need.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.270
You can read it?

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.400
Done.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.150
I wrote all that, you

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.660
finished it in a few words?

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.960
Wangmu can tell at a glance.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.770
What do you mean?

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.000
Can't read such simple

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.890
Tibetan?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.750
I love you.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.880
I love you.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.830
You made that up.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.740
I never wrote

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.160
I love you.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.650
Did yogurt clog

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.310
your brain?

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.300
For us Tibetans,

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.420
isn't "I love you"

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.330
enough for the

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.160
woman we love?

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.110
All that

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.960
doesn't match one phrase.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.010
Right, Sangba?

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.200
Yeah.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:05.040
Here.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.610
Not just Tibetans

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.320
All men are like that.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.230
I love you.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.500
Why bother?

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:19.900
Here.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:30.170
[I love you]

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:54.880
Are you cold?

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.510
I'm fine.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.960
Go back to the car.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.890
Get Sangba.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.180
I'm okay.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.890
It's not time yet.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.330
Your shift's up.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.030
Go.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.300
Two-hour shifts.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.040
We'll go

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.710
back

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.530
together for

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.250
the next team.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.160
It's raining.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.440
It's cold.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.490
You'll get sick.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:20.570
Go.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.350
That.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:21.880
Shh.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.610
Discrimination.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:28.840
What?

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.690
Discrimination.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.460
I'm caring.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.830
Discrimination.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.610
I want you to

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.660
treat me equally.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.770
Not time to push. Don't

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.970
follow, this

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.390
is

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.350
your last trip.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.150
It's my body.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.420
I know

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.170
my limits.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.550
I'm fine.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:58.610
I can hold on.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.290
Where are you going?

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.850
The contact's

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.370
here. Get her

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.400
in. Sangba,

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.740
stay.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.030
I'm not

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.050
going back.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:16.740
Hurry up.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.350
I can hold on.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.500
Let's go.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.850
I can hold on.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:21.690
Go.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.920
I can hold on.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.740
Let's go.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.250
Shouldn't

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.180
paired with you.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:28.660
Let go.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.550
I can walk.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:30.620
Let go.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.370
When he can't

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.640
argue, he do this.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.820
It's a fact that men and women have

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.140
different strength.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.220
When maxed out,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.630
you need rest.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.210
It's normal.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.940
Not special treatment.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.480
We are a team with

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.070
different roles.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.190
Like your shooting.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.350
No one matches you.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.170
But if you collapse now,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.610
you'll be a

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:14.760
burden for the team.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.250
I just want to

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.360
hold my post to

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.560
prove I'm

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.530
not a burden.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.430
Like my brother says,

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:22.780
I'm close to

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.960
a deserter now.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.430
You don't need a shift

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.790
to prove yourself.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.310
You've

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.090
proven it.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.740
Without you,

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:31.800
we wouldn't

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.610
have the

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.980
lead.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.240
Don't give me

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.140
that talk.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.480
Stand

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.640
guard less today.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.420
No digging duty tomorrow.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.320
More food

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.380
the day after.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.930
You won't get more.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.250
Shut up.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.700
Anyway,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.890
is it fair to

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.770
others if I

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.260
always get more?

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.680
He Qingyuan,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.940
will you listen?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.710
All you care about is

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.370
love.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.440
Nothing else?

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.450
What? Am I wrong?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:02.710
The

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.560
team's pay

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.510
isn't stable.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.910
No animals,

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.460
no land.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.280
How can you

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.380
pursue her?

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.920
How did Captain's

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.210
daughter pass?

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.240
Don't.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.370
No.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.590
She should know.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.740
I heard

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.930
it was an accident.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.480
Accidents come in many ways.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.270
To outsiders,

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.890
it was just an accident.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:42.880
But

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:44.540
for those who lost family,

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:48.680
especially

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.560
when it ties to

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.740
his own choices,

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.800
it's a

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.920
nightmare

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.690
he might never wake up from.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.510
Dolma studied

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.560
geology, right?

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.140
She's been to Bolamula.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.240
She went into Uninhabited Zone with

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.770
her advisor in college.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.780
They discovered

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.530
Bolamula

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.440
has rich mineral resources

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.410
worth developing.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.970
Didn't

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.270
Duojie know the risks?

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:20.650
Why

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.920
let Dolma go?

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.850
Later, Captain

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.530
went there alone.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.770
Everyone thought

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.360
he wouldn't come out.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:38.570
When

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.830
Zhacuo and I found

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.160
him, he was

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.980
sitting on

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.190
the mountain.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.620
His eyes were empty.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.130
He forgot

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.520
how long.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.900
I always wondered

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.230
what he was thinking

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.810
when he went in.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.280
Regret

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.720
for letting Dolma go

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.580
or the pain of loss?

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.290
But one thing

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.240
is certain.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.890
He wanted to be

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.340
buried in the place

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.760
that took his daughter.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.040
He

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.250
brought back a rock,

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.090
kept it on his desk.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.180
You've seen.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.060
Jae Bae dropped out today.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:14.690
Who?

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.010
The one writes the best

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.950
Chinese

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.090
from Gra.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.210
Why?

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.220
His family say too

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.460
few cattle this year. He must

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.120
work with his brother.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.280
We tried to

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.130
persuade.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.100
I'll talk to

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:38.310
the villagers.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.700
Visit his family.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.590
He must

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.940
finish nine

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.960
years of school.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.980
His dad says

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.550
even if we keep him now,

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.090
he won't return

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.650
next time.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.050
He can write

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.520
all family names and read

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.460
the paper. Enough

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.260
for them.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.150
What's this?

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.700
Jae Bae's mom gave this.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.700
I'll get a spoon.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.250
No need.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.210
You're good.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.440
Licking it like a local.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.900
My tongue isn't

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.880
that long.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.620
Aren't you happy?

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.810
Don't go if not.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.140
Told you not to

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.390
file the tax

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.180
form. You

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:39.900
won't listen.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.110
Leadership team

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.260
decided. I have to.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.920
Enough?

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.330
Four pairs.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:45.950
Two for

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.660
each way.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.260
Why must you

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.040
be the

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.930
troublemaker?

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.220
I'm not worried

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.280
about the form.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.030
What is it?

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.480
Remember the

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.250
county investment

00:29:59.270 --> 00:29:59.880
meeting?

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.060
I

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.910
called the

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.010
investors today.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.660
Either no answer

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.720
or hung up.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.470
Only

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.290
Manager Zhao answered.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:08.870
He sent

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.460
us two

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:10.330
coal trucks.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.880
Manager Zhao is in the

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.210
hospital,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.900
yet he'll

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.820
still invest?

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.670
I hung up after

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.690
just a few words.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:23.830
Why?

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.400
He kept telling

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.010
about rising

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.050
coal prices.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.530
I feared he'd

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.740
ask for payment.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.210
Look at you. Coward.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.660
What should I do?

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.220
Poverty leads to cowardice.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.990
Enough worrying.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.870
Once Duojie's

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.660
report is in,

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.700
all will be fine.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.670
I hope so.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.730
We waited here two days.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:12.530
No point

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.390
staying.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.250
Did we get exposed?

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:20.410
Hard to say.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.430
But we can't

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.200
stall here.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.750
Stick to plan.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.850
The mine.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:26.590
Okay.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:28.330
Go.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:29.310
Go.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:30.530
Get in.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.290
Go.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:52.730
Okay, 50 degrees.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.010
Hurry up.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.350
50, 40.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.720
Zhacuo.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.140
Take samples.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:04.810
Okay.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.300
He.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.390
Note this.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.720
10.5-meter layer.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:21.700
Sandy

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.940
slate.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.640
Goethite

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.200
altered. About

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.780
3 to 5 percent

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.010
iron content.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.430
About 3 to 5 percent.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.480
Want learn?

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:53.580
Can I?

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:56.370
The Chief said

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.210
I only supervise.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.530
It's nothing.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.200
Even a shepherd

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.240
like me can.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:03.560
Look.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.550
just tap the rock

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.760
and put it in the bag.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.470
Uninhabited Zone

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.260
has

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.440
more than wildlife.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.640
What's under feet

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.490
matters.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.010
Know more,

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.030
know Bolamula more.

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.400
Zhacuo.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:40.770
Take this.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.960
I'll do.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.400
Done?

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.180
Yeah.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:57.880
He.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.010
Are you done?

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.250
Almost.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.900
Almost.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.830
Pack up. Head down.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.330
Go.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.180
Check nothing left.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.240
Go.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.100
Get water.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:22.210
Okay.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.900
BLP.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:37.310
Not BLB.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.100
Half circle.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.620
You sleep through math class.

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.179
Are you confused now?

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.520
Go.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.360
Here.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.460
Take your time.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.800
Stop!

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.690
Stop!

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:46.670
Check.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.710
Stop.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.480
We're Mountain Patrol.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.650
Stop the car.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.860
Stop!

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.170
Mountain Patrol.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.260
Stop.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:10.130
Out.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.630
Out.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.270
Out.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:11.650
Out.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.530
Out.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.690
What’s wrong, sir?

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.030
Why run?

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:15.460
Easy.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:15.830
Easy.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.820
Didn't hear?

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.730
Sorry, sir.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.170
Down!

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:18.920
Go.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:19.590
Down.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.690
Get up.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.500
Captain, brine shrimp.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.460
You again?

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.530
How many times?

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.260
Brine shrimp isn't protected.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.130
Got evidence?

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.220
We're getting one.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.070
Don't fool me.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.050
Getting one.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.060
Get up.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.140
Same trick every time.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:53.930
You do it

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.840
or I tear?

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.080
Don't hit.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:08.990
Captain,

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.350
Look these pelts.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.450
Sheepskins.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.450
Where from?

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.960
You kill?

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:18.960
No.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.320
No.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:19.700
No.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:20.780
Didn't kill.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:21.920
Just

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.670
delivering.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.320
Someone will pick up.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.150
Right.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.570
Map.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:34.230
Come.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:37.170
Turn.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:39.480
Turn around.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:40.980
More.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.760
Loading spot.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.520
There's more.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.360
Loading spot.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.860
See what?

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.350
Here.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.510
Pack up. To the

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:21.480
loading spot.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.170
Bai Ju.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.080
Can drive truck?

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:49.260
Captain.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.440
What was

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.560
that reporter's

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.460
name?

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.340
I can't remember.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.700
Maybe Shao?

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.540
Where from?

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.010
Why are you back?

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.430
Did brine shrimp sell?

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.360
Very well.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.870
He bought it all.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.690
Your brother?

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:03.930
He left with me.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.980
Yes.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:06.800
Sir,

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:07.190
how many grams?

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.100
I'll buy.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:09.030
Here, smoke.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:09.960
Smoke.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:13.240
Here.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:17.990
Don't move.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.630
Police!

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:26.670
Drop the gun!

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.810
Freeze!

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.630
Freeze!

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.630
Drop!

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:30.800
Drop!

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.130
Up.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.480
Down.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.880
Down.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:32.710
Go.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.800
Everyone here.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:36.690
Down!

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.290
Come.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:37.870
Down.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:38.730
Come.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:42.340
Get up.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:46.780
Come.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:49.590
Shao Yunfei here?

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.370
Anyone named Shao?

00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.650
That's

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:01.260
me.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.260
You?

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:15.850
I'm Shao.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:17.490
Well.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.930
What's your name?

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:19.680
No.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.500
I

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.370
was asking

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.960
who are you?

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.640
Don’t fear.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.070
We save you.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:29.680
Down!

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:33.680
Here.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.600
Thanks.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.350
Mountain Patrol.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.110
Deputy County Mayor Duojie.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.010
Mountain Patrol?

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.860
You're Mountain Patrol.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.630
I'm the reporter County Mayor Lin

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.740
sent for the investment

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:55.370
conference.

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.540
The conference.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.380
It ended days ago.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:41:59.760
Why are

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.630
you here?

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:04.810
I don't want to come.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:07.260
I was heading to

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.180
your county

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.150
when my ride

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.880
broke down on the road.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.230
So I think

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.580
I'll walk for a while.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.020
Then I ran into

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:15.730
someone.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:16.440
Where is he?

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:17.430
He!

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.500
He!

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:19.690
Bad man!

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.370
Turn.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:21.900
So hateful.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.060
I met him halfway.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.270
I trusted him.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.370
He said

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.310
that he knows

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.200
you.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.310
And could

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.460
lead me to you.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:30.130
Then he

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.740
tied me

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.170
up.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.150
He.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.180
He.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.480
He.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.480
He sold you.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.260
Yes.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.380
Yes.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.190
He sold me.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:40.880
Water.

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:42.300
Thanks.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:43.540
Do you

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:44.710
know where you are?

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.980
Bolamula Uninhabited Zone.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.500
Even kids know not to

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.140
get in

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:50.380
a stranger's car.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.590
Yes.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.070
But look how naive he looks.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:55.150
Look at his face.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:56.210
Yes.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:57.370
You look sharp.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:58.130
Okay.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:00.860
Get in with us.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:01.570
Sure.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.190
Thanks, Chief.

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.670
What about my colleagues?
