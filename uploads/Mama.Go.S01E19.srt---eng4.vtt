WEBVTT

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.880
Don't wait up.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.479
The breakfast shop owner can't reply at night.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:37.640
Just relax and rest easy.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:38.479
Leave it to me.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:42.840
You're quite something now.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.799
You can handle things.

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:47.280
Now I am...

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.920
Optimus Prime.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.920
The pillar of the family.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.840
You and...

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200
Between you and this Hai Ming...

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.040
How... how did you get together?

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.359
Tell me a bit about it.

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:07.280
When I meet him later,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.719
I want to do some homework beforehand.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:10.159
The main thing is,

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.920
am I the fruit of love?

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.040
The fruit?

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.359
Love...

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:25.760
You have to be very lucky to have that.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.040
But back then, I really had no choice.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.719
Your grandparents had an accident.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.239
At that time,

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:35.680
I just really wanted a home of my own.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.079
So you didn't love him.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.560
People are complicated.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.519
You can't simply say I didn't love him.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.319
We did have moments of sincerity.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.680
But later on,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.680
both our lives

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.400
changed.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But at least now,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.120
I can say with certainty

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.639
that towards this family,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.680
he completely failed to fulfill his responsibilities.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.199
As long as he loves me.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.039
As long as he loves me.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.599
Then what if he's living miserably now,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.240
and he's unwilling to give his Life Energy

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.159
to me, what then?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.199
You care about him quite a bit.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.800
No.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.280
Look at me now,

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.800
so handsome and dashing.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.319
Will he fight for custody of me?

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.039
I advise you,

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.400
don't have too many fantasies about this man.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.039
And don't hold any expectations of him.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.560
I don't.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.039
Isn't this just...

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.759
simply being a bit curious about him?

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.240
After all, a dad just popped out of nowhere for me.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.840
Don't you think?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.039
Say, if he hadn't gambled back then,

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.120
would we perhaps be doing pretty well now?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.599
You knew he gambled?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.599
"Mom, where is my 4WD car?"

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.360
Gambling debts.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.919
As the man behind you now,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.039
the things I know that you don't know

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.319
are plenty.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.520
Who am I now?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.120
I'm the world's number one filial son.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.439
In life,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.159
there are many other important things.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:47.960
Love, for me,

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.120
is just a very, very small part of it.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.439
What about the very big part?

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.080
You.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.960
You should read fewer books.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.520
You sound so cheesy after reading books.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.479
You can't even talk properly.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.360
Go to sleep, hurry.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.159
I can't listen to you talk.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.759
I'm getting goosebumps.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.520
So melodramatic.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.800
Sentimental.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:10.000
Artificial.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.080
And "love," really.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.759
Go to sleep early.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.479
Sleep, sleep.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.639
Come on, come on, video call's here.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.879
Answer it, answer it.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.240
Young man, is this the person you're looking for?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.240
It's for you.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.720
For me? Who is it?

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:36.839
Boss, one bowl of noodles.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.680
Coming right up.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.560
You hold this for a second.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:41.439
Who are you?

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.439
Hello, hello.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.839
Excuse me, are you Hai Ming?

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:45.759
Who are you?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.519
I'm Kong Xiaocan.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.439
Kong Xiaocan?

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:53.519
Don't know him.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.519
I'm Kong Xiaocan.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.800
Your son.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.199
My son?

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:59.439
You're a scammer, aren't you?

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:00.680
Psycho.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.399
Me, a scammer?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.120
I'm hanging up.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.439
Show him this.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.240
Call him again.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.360
Sorry, thanks for your trouble.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.879
Could you please...

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.000
Give the phone to him, give it to him.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.000
Wait a minute.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.800
It's for you again.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.480
Why is it you again?

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.480
Take a look, do you recognize this child?

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.680
This is me when I was little.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.600
Don't recognize him.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.040
Don't all kids look the same?

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:37.199
Then do you recognize this woman?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120
Isn't that Kong Guifang?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.399
Yeah, that's my mom.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.759
You really are my son?

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:45.560
I really am.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.720
No, wait a minute.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:48.360
Where is Kong Guifang?

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:50.680
I don't know either.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.959
She owes a ton of debt.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.160
She just up and ran off.

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.920
I paid back all the money she owed by myself.

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:55.920
Where is she?

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:58.439
Bullshit.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.800
I... I really don't know.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.480
I really don't know.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.759
Actually, I was looking for you for a reason.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.399
What is it?

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.160
Our house got demolished.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.040
Really?

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:08.560
Your house got demolished? Right.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.079
It did.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.959
How much did you get?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.920
Probably around one or two million.

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.639
Where's the money?

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:13.720
I have the money right here.

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:14.959
Let me tell you something.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.279
You hold onto that money for me.

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.120
Hold it tight.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.800
Do not buy a house for Kong Guifang.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.720
Do you hear me?

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.360
Yes.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.839
Isn't that exactly what I mean?

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:25.959
I wanted to contact you...

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:27.600
...to see how we should spend this money.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.600
That's great.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.720
Let me tell you.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.120
I brag to everyone I meet.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.959
My son is so good to me.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.720
How about this, how about this.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.720
I'll send you a location.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.240
Let's... let's meet up, okay?

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.000
Sure.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.839
Good, good, good.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:41.720
Uh, you know what...

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:42.680
In a bit, uh...

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.639
I'll have the boss...

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.439
Let's add each other on WeChat.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.279
Okay, sure.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.920
You'll understand when we meet.

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.360
I've really missed you.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.399
Okay, good, good.

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:51.560
I'm the one who named you.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.399
Jerk.

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:57.319
Did you hear him? Does he sound human?

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:59.319
What does he mean I owe a ton of debt?

00:06:59.319 --> 00:06:59.839
And that he...

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.439
Did I pay off his debts for nothing all these years?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.600
Mom, don't be angry.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.439
Before taking this call...

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:09.680
I still had some illusions about him.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.759
I wasn't wrong, was I?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.560
I didn't lie to you, right?

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:14.439
I just never expected...

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.399
He'd step on a landmine with every move.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.319
Every move is just like in those TV dramas...

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.399
The kind with extremely stereotypical villains.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.040
I'm speechless.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.920
Mom.

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.360
Before, about exchanging Life Energy...

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.160
I felt a bit guilty.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.160
Now I don't feel guilty at all.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.480
Let's eat quickly. We'll head out once we're done.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.399
Take your time eating.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.040
Finish this bowl of noodles for me.

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:38.040
Actually, for so many years...

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.959
Mom has always felt quite guilty towards you.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.120
For not being able to give you a...

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.279
Complete family.

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:49.360
Mom, Mom, Mom, please don't say that.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.079
Look at what era we're in, right?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:53.279
Besides, right now, both of us...

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:54.959
We both count as young people.

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:56.480
How are young people?

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.120
Don't think you have to do it for me or anyone else.

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:59.560
You are an independent individual.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.680
If it doesn't work, just split.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.160
Why waste your time?

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:03.079
Besides...

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.399
I have to thank you, Mom.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.800
If I had a dad like that...

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.839
I'd really be full of childhood trauma now.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:09.600
Just like in those movies...

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.160
When I grew up...

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.199
I'd have turned into a pervert by now.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.360
Twisted psychology, you know?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.279
Look how sunny and bright I am now, right?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.560
I have to thank my good mom.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:16.800
Coming home from work...

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.160
Working hard all day...

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.240
I only love my Mom.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.360
Alright, hurry up and eat.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.000
We'll leave after eating.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.720
Eat, eat, let's eat.

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:24.439
Cheers, cheers.

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:57.159
Son, are you in the car?

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:58.679
I'm in the car. Look.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:08:59.480
I'm on the way.

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:01.279
Good, good. Be safe on the road.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:01.960
Okay.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.399
Good.

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:03.080
Dad is waiting for you.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.840
Dad is wandering around nearby. Hurry up.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.120
Okay. See you in a bit then.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.240
We'll talk when we meet.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.120
He's so impatient.

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:27.639
Son.

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:30.159
Dad forgot to ask you just now.

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.960
Is the money on you?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.080
Or is it in a card?

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:34.679
The money is in the card.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.279
But the card is on me.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.200
Good, good. Hold onto it tight.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.360
There are lots of people on the road.

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.759
Our lives depend on it for the rest of our days.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:44.759
Don't worry.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.679
For the rest of your life, I... I'll definitely take good care of you.

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:48.720
When the time comes, whatever you want to buy...

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.159
A luxury flat or a big villa, right?

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:51.360
We... we can just pick whatever with our eyes closed.

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:53.080
Good.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.960
I knew my son was filial.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.960
Treats his dad so well.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.360
Then I'll see you in a bit.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:58.519
Waiting for you.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.200
See... see you in a bit, Dad.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.159
Good, good, good.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.679
Son.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:20.759
It's Dad again.

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:24.879
Dad's almost at that Nanhong Noodle Shop.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:25.879
Where are you?

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:26.639
How much longer will you be?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.080
I-I... I should be there soon.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.960
Don't worry.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:31.879
Okay, okay, okay. Be safe on the road.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.600
Dad will wait for you.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.399
Actually, Dad.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.720
I actually have a favor to ask you.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:39.320
There's something I need your help with.

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:40.399
If it weren't absolutely necessary,

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.799
I really wouldn't want to trouble you.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.360
But this has nothing to do with money.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.519
I don't know if it's convenient for you.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.759
What do you mean "ask"?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.039
Your business is my business.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.440
Why make a distinction between us?

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.080
Alright, Dad.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.639
Hearing you say that puts me at ease.

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:56.080
Don't worry. After you help me with this,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.440
not only will we buy a house,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.519
but your son will take good care of you for the rest of your life.

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.720
We'll rely on each other.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.879
We'll create a glorious future together.

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:02.919
I always said,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.519
raise a son to provide for old age.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.840
You're Dad's comfort, his little gold mine.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:10.960
You are my great treasure.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.279
Then Dad will walk around a bit more.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.480
Okay, okay, okay. That's good.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.039
Dad will wait for you.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:22.960
He really is something.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.000
He just doesn't leave a single good impression.

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:28.639
Look on the bright side.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.559
At least there's hope for swapping Life Energy now.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.320
Are we really giving him money?

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:37.320
If he's willing to swap, I'll give it.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.559
I'll give it all.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.600
It's okay, Mom.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.519
Just now...

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.159
we'll buy him a house.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.919
But I didn't say we'd buy a luxury flat.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.679
If we buy one in a ravine, what can he do?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.000
That cleverness of yours...

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.639
really takes after me.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:01.720
Right there. Right there.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.159
Why can't I reach him now?

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.440
He's not at the noodle shop either.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:08.279
Mom, you sit down first.

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:09.279
You wait here.

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:10.080
I'll call again and ask.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.360
Hello?

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.679
Hello. Are you a family member of Hai Ming?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.799
Sort of. Who is this?

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720
This is the City Hospital.

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:27.799
He had a sudden brain infarction.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.039
The situation is critical. Please come quickly.

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.200
Doctor, how is he?

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.440
We couldn't save the patient.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960
He just passed away.

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:53.279
No.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.480
That's impossible.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.039
I... just a few hours ago,

00:12:58.039 --> 00:12:59.399
I was still talking to him on the phone.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.840
The kind stranger who brought him in...

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.440
said he heard some news,

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.360
and kept laughing.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:05.440
He laughed so hard he fainted,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.559
which triggered the attack.

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:09.679
No, Doctor.

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:11.200
That simply isn't logical.

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:13.639
How can a person literally laugh themselves to death?

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:15.759
The patient had too many underlying conditions.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.320
His kidney function was very poor.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.759
He had respiratory issues too.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.919
Years of alcoholism...

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.919
his liver wasn't good either.

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.159
His heart and lungs were near failure.

00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:25.759
Finally, a cerebral infarction took him.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.960
My condolences.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.279
My condolences.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.080
How could he just leave suddenly?

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:36.679
Why did he have to leave right now?

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.559
He still had important things to do.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.840
My condolences.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.039
My condolences.

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:45.759
The patient went without pain.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:48.000
He's not in pain, but I am.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.879
I understand your feelings very well.

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:51.639
My condolences.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.000
My condolences.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.759
Can you say anything else?

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:57.200
Oh, right.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.279
The medical bills were advanced by the kind neighbor.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.200
You should pay him back.

00:14:03.159 --> 00:14:04.320
The patient didn't have any money on him.

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:05.600
And no health insurance.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.399
The costs might be a bit high.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:08.919
My condolences.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.720
My condolences.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.519
Tell me, what is the use of a husband?

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.159
Before marriage, he waits on you hand and foot.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:25.559
Says he'll let you enjoy a life of leisure.

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:26.679
But after marriage?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.440
You wait on him hand and foot.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.399
You let him enjoy life.

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:30.960
He tells you he'll quit gambling,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.120
but turns around and can't control that stinking hand.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.120
Couldn't count on him for anything while he was alive.

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:36.000
Now...

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.600
Now this rotten life finally had a glimmer of hope...

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:38.759
He could have died sooner or later,

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:39.840
but he had to die on this very day.

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:42.039
Okay, Mom, calm down.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.440
He's being cremated tomorrow.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.639
Let him be cremated! Let him burn!

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.159
Let him burn, let him burn hard!

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:47.639
Make sure he can never be human again in the next life!

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:06.360
Mom.

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.080
You...

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.600
Don't be sad.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:14.759
It's not sadness.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.799
I just feel... it's a shame.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.440
When Mom got married,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.639
I also thought about growing old with him.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:33.879
Surrounded by children and grandchildren.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.679
Now, none of that can happen.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.960
Noodles are ready. Take your time.

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:54.519
Thank you.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:57.039
Eat the noodles.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.840
Come on, eat up.

00:15:58.519 --> 00:15:59.679
Do... do you remember these noodles?

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:00.080
From when you were little.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.879
I don't know if they still taste okay.

00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:02.399
Hurry.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:04.799
Smells good.

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:11.039
Mom, these noodles are amazing.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.440
Just like the taste from childhood.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.000
Back home, no one can make them like this.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.840
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.600
This place is great, Mom.

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:18.519
Let's come back often to eat here in the future.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.679
Eat, Mom.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.679
You're a mess.

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:40.960
Okay.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.759
We'll come back often.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.200
My condolences.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.519
I'm fine.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.599
I haven't seen him in years anyway.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160
We weren't that close.

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:20.720
Then about the life exchange...

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.319
Why don't you just accept

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.599
the six months we crowdfunded?

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:26.599
I said no, and I mean it.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.400
I'm in charge of my own life.

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:30.400
If you're really my brother,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:30.920
you should worry about

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.640
whether my mom will kill me first.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.440
People like Hai Ming who only care about money,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.960
there must be more than one.

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.319
I just don't believe

00:17:58.039 --> 00:17:59.319
that betting all the Demolition compensation

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.039
won't tempt a single person.

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:43.720
Time to eat, Mom.

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:44.559
Time to eat.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.000
Let's eat.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:55.519
Tian'er.

00:18:56.119 --> 00:18:56.559
You're just in time.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.400
We're eating, perfect timing to join us.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.640
Quick, come in, come in.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.599
Guifang, what is this...

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.000
You're here.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.440
I came to see you guys.

00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:30.440
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:34.160
But this is already

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.960
the best solution I could think of.

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:47.480
Why isn't the money working?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.960
Is it because I didn't offer enough?

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.839
If it's a matter of money,

00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:58.480
I can still figure something out.

00:19:58.839 --> 00:19:59.799
What can you possibly do?

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.079
You're not suggesting going back to Maizi Ge, are you?

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.440
Being with Maizi Ge

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.559
wasn't that bad.

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:16.839
Wei Mingtian, have you forgotten your dream?

00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:19.640
Have you forgotten what you said before?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.440
Think about your hometown.

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:22.599
Think about your dream.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.240
Do you want to go back now

00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:25.920
and be a puppet at someone's mercy?

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:27.880
You are not a star.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:30.240
You are a future hydraulic engineer.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.880
I'm not as anxious as you think.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.279
I know you're doing this for our own good.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.480
If this path doesn't work,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.720
we'll just think of another way.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720
We can always find another path.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.240
But...

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.519
Xiaocan doesn't have time to wait.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.279
It's okay.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.400
Xiaocan...

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.440
has always had good luck growing up.

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:34.319
Xiaocan.

00:21:35.359 --> 00:21:36.240
Xiaocan, come here quick.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.640
Someone is willing to exchange.

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:38.839
Someone is willing to exchange.

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:41.279
Look.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:41.759
Let me see.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.519
Here.

00:21:47.519 --> 00:21:48.559
Meet them, go meet them.

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:50.359
What? You're meeting them just like that?

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:51.279
Ask a few more questions first.

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:51.839
Mom, don't...

00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:52.519
Hurry up.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.759
No, let's look into it more.

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.039
You're going just because someone said so?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.000
Do you know who it is?

00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:58.960
Tian'er, you... you eat by yourself.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.119
I'm going to check it out.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.440
Are you Zhu Yuchen?

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:21.599
Yes.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.799
Is what you guys said true?

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:34.440
If I give my Life Energy to you,

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:36.240
will you give me the money?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.079
Do we go to the bank?

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:40.200
Or do we do it here?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.119
Kiddo.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.200
Auntie was lying to you.

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:52.480
There's no such thing.

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:53.799
It's getting late.

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:55.799
Hurry home and rest.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.839
I'm serious.

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:04.519
With the money,

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.559
my parents won't have to work,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.720
and they can keep me company.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.759
But have you thought about it?

00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.359
If you leave this world early,

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:17.240
what will your parents do?

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.799
Do you know how sad and heartbroken they'll be?

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.440
You living a good life,

00:23:23.599 --> 00:23:24.960
spending your life happily and safely,

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.960
is what they want to see, you know?

00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:55.279
Little one, I'm sorry.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.119
I didn't mean to lose my temper with you.

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:04.519
If you want your parents to spend time with you,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.200
there are other ways.

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.319
But at no time

00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:10.559
should you do anything to hurt yourself.

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:11.240
Do you understand?

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:21.000
Go on home.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.720
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:30.880
Hang in there.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.519
Bye-bye.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:33.720
Let's go.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.680
This... this kid is actually not bad.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:45.960
Just a bit immature.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.279
You're even more immature.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.920
I'm currently...

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:54.960
Mom, since we're here, let's play a couple rounds.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.519
Forget it.

00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:57.720
You finally remembered to call me?

00:24:58.559 --> 00:24:59.559
Did you finish reading the new contract?

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.200
If you have, come over tomorrow.

00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:02.359
Let's sign the new contract.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.000
Sorry, Mike.

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:07.039
Just pretend I never called you.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.000
No, what do you mean?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.079
You're being unreasonable, aren't you?

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.039
Before, it was a 10-90 split.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.240
Before, I got nine, you got one.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.960
Now, you get nine, I get one.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.599
I'm showing enough sincerity, right?

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:17.599
And do you know, when you quit last time,

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.920
how much penalty you owed?

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:20.119
Look, don't worry.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.200
Come back, and not just this penalty,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.680
I'll earn back ten, twenty times that for you.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.000
Why are you selling potatoes?

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:26.519
I could open a McDonald's for you back home.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.319
Okay?

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:28.759
You were born to be a star.

00:25:28.759 --> 00:25:29.839
You know that clearly deep down.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.759
I am not a star.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.680
I am a future hydraulic engineer.

00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:40.160
What hydraulic engineer?

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.359
Aren't you selling potatoes?

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:41.680
You wat...

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.599
Right, I remember now.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.079
I remember.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.880
You want to be a hydraulic engineer.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.240
Let me tell you,

00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:53.480
that stuff is useless.

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:55.519
Wei Mingtian is an artist at our company.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.799
Not anymore.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.880
It's not up to you to say he isn't.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.039
We have a signed contract in black and white.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.079
Your contract has no legal validity.

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:05.480
You say it has no legal validity,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.400
so it has no legal validity?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.160
You say he isn't, so he isn't? Who are you?

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:08.960
Fine.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.200
Then see you in court.

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:12.640
But today, Wei Mingtian must come with us.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.799
If he leaves, will you pay his penalty?

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.680
Or will he pay it himself?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.480
Wei Mingtian, let me tell you.

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:23.200
If you walk out this door today,

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:23.960
you...

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.319
I was the one who brought you out of the mountains.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.880
I was the one who sent you to college.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.759
I sent you...

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:13.920
Sun Keyan.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.480
Fine, you win.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.920
He wants to be a hydraulic engineer.

00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:23.799
Tell him later,

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.440
I actually paid off that money long ago.

00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:27.400
Just focus on school.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.000
Oh, one more thing.

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:32.559
I have to tell you.

00:27:34.839 --> 00:27:36.279
This kid is from the countryside, his foundation is weak.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.440
If you're going to look after him,

00:27:37.839 --> 00:27:38.799
you have to look after him all the way.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.319
Don't just help halfway and run off.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.039
That's it.

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:43.640
By the way.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.640
One last thing.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.920
Top up 200 yuan for my phone bill.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.240
I'm using someone's Wi-Fi here.

00:27:48.599 --> 00:27:49.200
I'm waiting here.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.480
Alright, brother.

00:27:55.519 --> 00:27:56.200
Are you done now?

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.279
Done, done, done.

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:57.559
Good.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.359
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:44.559
Eat up.

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.799
You can't go without eating. Come on.

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:51.759
Mom.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.720
Some things...

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.839
as long as we tried our best, that's enough.

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:00.119
What I'm most afraid of is...

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:01.440
that you'll go so crazy that...

00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:03.400
you borrow money and get scammed or something.

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.519
We have so much money right now.

00:29:05.519 --> 00:29:06.319
We can buy whatever we want.

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:07.640
It's great. Why isn't that enough?

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.480
Sometimes, this is just fate.

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:14.039
As for spending money...

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.440
let's just give up.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:17.599
Eat.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.359
Yes.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.960
Mom made a mistake.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.000
Or rather...

00:29:28.599 --> 00:29:30.559
Mom thought everyone was like him.

00:29:32.839 --> 00:29:33.559
Obsessed with money.

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:34.640
Willing to do anything for money.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.160
It was Mom's mistake.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.519
Mom, you're not wrong.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.240
Xiaocan, look.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.400
Look.

00:29:53.599 --> 00:29:55.480
These plants and flowers Mom raised.

00:29:57.319 --> 00:29:57.920
Look how well they're growing.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.359
Yeah.

00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:02.799
So well.

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:06.599
For so many years,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.839
they basically...

00:30:09.839 --> 00:30:11.160
haven't had any problems.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.640
Even if there were problems,

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.559
Mom tried her absolute best,

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:19.960
and did everything possible to cure them.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.240
So you're the same.

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.000
Mom will definitely find a way.

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:38.839
I definitely will.

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:42.720
You just...

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:04.680
Xiaocan.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.240
Mom forgot there's an event at the school lab today.

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:11.160
Once you get up, hurry and eat this food.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:11.680
I'm leaving.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.039
It's so early to be summoned by the school.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.880
I guess only doing research

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.279
can make her a bit normal now.

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:38.440
Are you awake?

00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:40.480
Want to go for a morning stroll?

00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:49.359
Xu Rui.

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:50.440
Xu Rui.

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:02.079
Why did you ask me here?

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:05.359
Just wanted to take a walk with you.

00:32:06.079 --> 00:32:08.039
I feel like time slows down here.

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:12.839
You're still thinking about that?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.400
Everyone is so worried about you.

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:18.839
Weren't you pretty scared before?

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:23.559
It's strange to say.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.200
Before,

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.960
even a fish bone pricking my throat

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.799
made me fear infection.

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:31.119
But now that everyone knows,

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:32.680
I feel relieved instead.

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:36.000
So maybe I wasn't afraid of leaving,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.319
but didn't know how to say goodbye.

00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:44.880
Xiaocan.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.319
We'll always be by your side.

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:56.200
I'll try to come back and visit too.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.480
Come back to scare people?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.119
Why is there so much smoke?

00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:10.839
Is there a fire?

00:33:11.599 --> 00:33:12.119
Where is this?

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.599
Looks like the laboratory.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:16.559
Darn it.

00:33:17.119 --> 00:33:17.960
My mom is in the laboratory.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.039
Is anyone still in there?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.559
Is there anyone left inside?

00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:30.759
Are you okay? Is anyone else inside?

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.400
I'm fine.

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:32.720
Guifang seems to be inside.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Guifang is still in there.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.319
Yes.

00:33:34.599 --> 00:33:34.880
This is...

00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:35.799
Guifang, she...

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.200
Something went in.

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:43.680
Guifang!

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.160
Guifang!

00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:47.599
Oh my god, you...

00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:50.720
How many times have I told you?

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:53.480
Run first in this situation! Save yourself!

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.640
Why do you care about this stuff?

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:55.400
Remember this.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.119
If you discover a fire,

00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:58.039
forget about data or papers.

00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:58.799
Is it on fire?

00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.960
If there's a fire, people matter most.

00:34:00.119 --> 00:34:01.079
It's fine, it's fine. It's a drill.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:01.960
Got it?

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.480
A drill?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:03.559
I got it.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.119
Alright. It was so real.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.519
Where is Xiaocan?

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.079
Xiaocan?

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.440
We thought it was a real fire.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.559
He came looking for you.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.719
Someone just went in just now.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.639
That person was Xiaocan?

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.679
Someone went in just now.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.559
It might be him.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.400
It's on fire.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.679
Then I'll go find him. Okay, okay.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.599
You come out quickly.

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:20.159
Be careful.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:20.639
Xiaocan!

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.679
A drill. Does it look like one?

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.360
So real.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.000
Look at us.

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:26.039
Scary, isn't it?

00:34:26.599 --> 00:34:27.039
Mom!

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:28.119
Mom!

00:34:30.559 --> 00:34:30.960
Mom!

00:34:31.519 --> 00:34:31.960
Mom!

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:34.960
Kong Guifang!

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:36.960
Mom!

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:05.480
I...

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.840
Am I...

00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:39.320
going to die?

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.360
I thought I could be like a hero,

00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:46.679
and die in style.

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:50.599
Turns out the last moment of my life

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:52.519
is so humorous too.

00:35:56.559 --> 00:35:59.920
But if I can really die dramatically like this,

00:36:00.719 --> 00:36:03.519
my mom, Xu Rui, and Li Wai...

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.840
won't be so sad, will they?

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.079
Then...

00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:10.639
I won't struggle anymore.

00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:12.800
Goodbye,

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.360
world.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.480
Kong Xiaocan!

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:27.000
Where did he run off to?

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:31.360
Kong Xiaocan, come out!

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:34.719
Kong Xiaocan!

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.440
Xiaocan

00:37:05.639 --> 00:37:06.400
Kong Xiaocan

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.440
Xiaocan, wake up.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.360
Help!

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:15.079
Someone help!

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.960
Someone help!

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:20.960
Xiaocan, don't sleep.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.639
Wake up.

00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:23.920
Quick, help him!

00:37:24.039 --> 00:37:24.400
Hurry!

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:28.639
Xiaocan.

00:37:29.679 --> 00:37:30.440
Xiaocan, don't sleep.

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:32.000
Hurry!

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.400
Xiaocan.

00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:35.480
Xiaocan.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.039
Xiaocan.

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:37.320
Xiaocan, wake up.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:37.760
Xiaocan.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:38.840
Xiaocan.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.679
Xiaocan, can you hear me?

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.639
Xiaocan, wake up, Xiaocan.

00:37:42.639 --> 00:37:43.119
Xiaocan.

00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:45.079
Can you hear me, Xiaocan?

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:47.039
To the infirmary.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.039
To the infirmary.

00:37:48.159 --> 00:37:48.480
Excuse me.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:48.960
Xiaocan.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:49.960
Xiaocan.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.239
Xiaocan.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.840
Come on, make way, make way, make way.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.440
Ma Jianfei! Ma Jianfei!

00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:10.360
Dear, I'm right here.

00:38:10.679 --> 00:38:11.159
What's up?

00:38:12.639 --> 00:38:13.599
Where is this?

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.280
What's wrong?

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.519
What's going on?

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.000
Why hasn't Xiaocan woken up yet?

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.119
He...

00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:21.639
His time isn't up yet.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.960
But he just choked on some smoke.

00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:24.360
Why hasn't he woken up?

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:25.800
According to the rules...

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:27.280
a person's Life Energy

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.880
is definitely enough to support him

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.519
until the end of his life.

00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:31.880
Unless he...

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.000
gave up on himself.

00:38:33.199 --> 00:38:33.880
Ended it himself.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.920
Then naturally he won't reach that time point.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:38.039
Give me a straight answer.

00:38:38.639 --> 00:38:39.679
How many days does he actually have left?

00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:41.639
No, it's not that I won't say.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.559
It's that the rules forbid it. Say...

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.639
Are you going to say it or not?

00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:46.519
I can't say. We aren't allowed to say.

00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:47.760
There's an alien here!

00:38:48.679 --> 00:38:49.639
Kong Xiaocan still hasn't woken up...

00:38:49.639 --> 00:38:50.480
I'll say it! I'll say it!

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.480
...because of this alien!

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.760
I'll say it! I'll say it!

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:53.840
I'll say it, alright?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.320
Speak!

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:02.000
Twenty-one days left.
