[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.960
[Episode 11]

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.180
Where's the money?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.510
Where's the money in the treasury?

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.770
Where's the money of Great Xia's people?

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.490
Your Majesty.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.310
Your Majesty, please let me explain.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.910
This is all problems left by

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.840
the previous Minister of Revenue.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.200
Your Majesty.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.240
I have only

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.670
just been appointed, Your Majesty!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.920
Your Majesty.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.440
Right General You sent

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.400
an urgent report saying...

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.200
Speak louder!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.910
Yes!

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.120
Right...

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.710
Right General You
has sent an urgent report

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.240
saying the military rations
have gone moldy!

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.490
[Your subject submits the following...]

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.000
[State matters rest on rites and war;
yet the frontiers are now in peril.]

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.610
[The enemy watches as our troops starve,
their morale and provisions exhausted.]

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.610
[I fear a coup if this persists;
my heart burns with restless anxiety.]

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.970
They're threatening me.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.310
They say if the rations aren't increased,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.190
they won't be able to defend the borders.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.079
Even my own army dares to threaten me.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.230
The mausoleum needs to be built.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.030
The military rations need to be increased.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.690
But the treasury is empty!

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.620
Empty!

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.390
Empty, empty...

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.350
Tell me, is it time this kingdom
changes its name?

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.680
Your Majesty, I deserve to die!

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.530
I deserve to die!

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.460
I deserve to die!

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.310
I deserve—

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.600
The problem isn't solved
and you're already thinking of dying?

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.560
Then I won't die.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.560
I won't die.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.610
Here's the deal.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.710
If you can replenish the treasury,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.490
I'll leave your body intact.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.510
-If not…
-Your Majesty—

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.529
Your entire family

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.330
will go join your dear brother.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.470
Well...

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.620
No, Your Majesty!

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.450
Spare me, Your Majesty!

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.530
Your Majesty.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.300
Your Majesty.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.100
Your Majesty.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.070
Your Majesty.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.830
What do I do?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.230
Your Highness, this is a brilliant idea.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.500
To have General You

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.390
claim the rations are moldy
at this critical moment.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.810
His Majesty is furious.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.510
Right now, the Ministry of Revenue

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.190
is in complete chaos.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.630
Along with the starving people blocking
the imperial carriage this morning,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.360
the Empress Dowager's faction

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.320
won't have it easy anymore.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.540
Do you think those starving people
blocking the carriage

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.500
was an accident?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.320
It was His Majesty.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.360
His Majesty planned

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.560
to make an example
of the Ministry of Revenue.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.960
He previously used
his madness as an excuse

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.030
to execute the former Minister of Revenue.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.350
Unfortunately,
it didn't shake the ministry's foundation.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.570
But now the situation is different.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.190
Military matters

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.980
and civilian affairs—

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.810
they're all concerning
the fate of the kingdom.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.270
The Ministry of Revenue
can't escape responsibility.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.920
Right now they're

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.250
also in charge of building the mausoleum.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.680
If they can't fill this financial hole,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.390
it's like digging their own graves.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.560
But His Majesty

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.360
chose this exact moment
to strike at the Ministry.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.390
It seems our Emperor

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.920
has made this move

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.610
with careful consideration.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.830
But it's a pity.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.270
What's a pity?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.980
Just handling this current situation
isn't enough.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.070
More importantly,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.330
once Chen Danian
can't handle the pressure,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.750
the position of Minister of Revenue

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.740
will become vacant.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.270
Then people on our side

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.860
can fill that vacancy.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.720
Congratulations, Your Highness.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.310
With both wealth and military power,

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.940
you won't be held back
by anyone anymore.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.590
But...

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.560
if the Empress Dowager

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.210
wants to protect the Ministry of Revenue

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.920
and is willing to use
the funds for the mausoleum

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.430
to supplement the military provisions,

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.000
then...

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.840
If you were the Empress Dowager,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.190
and this puppet
you've controlled for over a decade

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.659
suddenly developed a mind of his own,

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.659
would you compromise,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.350
bide your time,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.760
or confront him directly

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.480
and refuse to back down?

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.270
Please give us your guidance

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.330
on what should be done,
Your Majesty.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.000
I truly have no solutions left.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.530
These past few days I've been so worried

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.360
that I can't sleep or eat properly.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.000
I fear making a mistake

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.600
ruining your important affairs,
Your Majesty.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.670
Lord Chen.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.890
The treasury deficit

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.250
is indeed not sustainable.

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.620
Those military officials

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.570
only know how to fight

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.140
and are simple-minded,
only caring about money in hand.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.340
If their provisions

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.450
are delayed even slightly,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.280
the military camp will be in chaos.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.510
Exactly!

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.480
So our immediate plan

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.540
should be to keep them satisfied.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.700
The military provisions—

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.860
approve it for them.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.910
Your Majesty is wise!

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.400
Your Majesty,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.810
with your approval,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.120
we can finally stabilize the military.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.560
However,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.190
Your Majesty,

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.590
as for the mausoleum—

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.390
could it be postponed for a while?

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.250
-Nonsense!
-I—

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.800
We've already agreed to build it,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.630
and now you want to cancel it?

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.720
If we go back on our word,

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.570
we will become a laughing stock!

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.050
How can the royal family be humiliated?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.050
How can I

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.080
be humiliated?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.059
Well...

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:34.549
I...

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.289
I understand.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:36.760
But...

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.799
But both projects require money,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.960
and I really

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.090
can't cook without rice, Empress Dowager.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.550
Lord Chen.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.530
You are the Minister of Revenue,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.910
in charge of the empire's finances.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.280
That's your responsibility.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.590
Use your brain

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.430
and find a solution.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.080
Learn from your brother.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.960
Your Majesty!

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.770
Your Majesty!

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.620
Your Majesty!

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.690
What do I do?

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.840
I shouldn't have taken over this mess!

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.890
There's no profit to be made,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.770
and I even have to use my own money!

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.970
I wouldn't mind if I could afford it!

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.680
But building a mausoleum
and buying military provisions...

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.520
Even if I sold you,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.030
all of you and myself too,

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.950
all of us,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.960
a thousand times over,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.210
it still wouldn't be enough!

[Scholars]

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.870
Empress Dowager,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.060
is having a hard time thanks to me.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.310
The Minister of Revenue

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.840
also broke down.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.430
What about Prince Duan?

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.960
I heard that officials were summoned
batch after batch

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.750
for a meeting among the elites.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.380
So,

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.440
it's almost time.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.360
It's time for Li Yunxi

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.680
to help us at the critical time.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.660
Such pitiful crying.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.910
What are you waiting for, Li?

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.050
I've prepared the gift box.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.550
Let's go meet the Minister of Revenue now.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.350
Wait a moment.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.120
Is this your idea

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.840
of persuading the Minister?

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.830
What's wrong?

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.200
Using the pretext of offering advice

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.800
while actually bribing him?

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.200
When it comes
to what His Majesty asks for,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.390
as long as we can accomplish it,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.720
the means don't matter.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.550
If we resort to such tactics,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.800
I'd rather not even propose
the Salt-for-Services Policy.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.150
Have you forgotten, Li,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.250
how we obtained our positions?

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.510
The gift box
is just to get our foot in the door.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.200
Do you think His Majesty
would really mind?

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.460
A wise ruler and honest ministers

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.790
are the blessing of a nation.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.120
If the Emperor doesn't care,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.720
that's his failure as a ruler.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.750
If we don't care either, we're shameless

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.650
and unworthy of being officials.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.510
Then how do you plan to present it?

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.240
Show your scholarly integrity

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.900
and give him a harsh scolding?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.820
That's about right.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.150
In this whole world,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.510
there is no one

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.850
more upright and honorable than you.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.060
I'll be the villain

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120
in this scenario.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.540
What do you mean by that?

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.960
The implementation
of the Salt-for-Services Policy is urgent.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.670
If you can set aside your reservations,

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.750
then come with me.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.690
Otherwise,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.240
don't blame me for taking the credit.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.840
Who cares about damn credit?

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.080
If you want me to go with you,
leave the gift box behind.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.440
Fine.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:36.230
[Salt-for-Services Policy]

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.870
[Minister of Revenue's Mansion]

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.200
What do you mean "fine"?

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.450
What—

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.120
Er Lan!

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.250
How inappropriate!

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:44.700
Listen.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.630
No one will open the door for you.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.530
The door is not closed.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.350
How inappropriate!

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.090
Master! Master!

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.510
Master!

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.710
Lord Er from the Ministry of Revenue
requests to see you.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.670
I won't see anyone!

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.360
I don't want to see anyone right now!

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.690
But he says he has a way
to solve Your Lordship's predicament.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.320
Nonsense!

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.790
If I, the Minister of Revenue,
cannot solve it—

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.080
something even the Empress Dowager
and His Majesty cannot solve—

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.440
how can he possibly have a solution?

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.300
I won't see him!

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.310
But he doesn't seem to be joking.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.990
What did you say his name was?

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.150
The court can recruit merchants

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.520
to supply military provisions.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.320
The court will pay merchants
not with money

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.870
but with
Salt Transportation and Sales Licenses.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.000
With these licenses,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.200
merchants...

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.910
Can distribute official salt

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.470
and profit from trade.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.000
The world bustles for profit

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.360
and the world rushes for gain.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.680
With such solid profit prospects,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.840
they will eagerly participate.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.270
In this way,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.970
the court need not drain the treasury.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.710
Through the merchants,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.600
we can solve the provisions problem.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.000
We can support the armies

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.360
and still have resources

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.760
to repair the mausoleum.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.520
This is called

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.800
the Salt-for-Services Policy.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.920
Your Majesty,

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.610
salt reform is of great importance.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.060
One move affects everything.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.870
Salt tax is fundamental to the treasury.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.750
Salt trade involves many factions.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.150
Never before
has there been such a bold measure.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.680
Any misstep could cause chaos.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.550
We must not decide rashly.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.500
My dear minister,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.690
you make a valid point.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.160
The regulations can be gradually refined.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.390
But salt reform will benefit
both the military and agriculture

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.750
tremendously!

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.840
Once the Salt-for-Services Policy
is implemented,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.120
merchants will have profits,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.680
the Empress Dowager's mausoleum
can be repaired,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.630
the frontline will be
sufficiently supplied with provisions,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.000
and the people's corvée and taxes

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.660
will be reduced accordingly.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.410
This is a brilliant plan
that kills multiple birds with one stone.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.320
Your Majesty is wise!

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.230
I believe Your Majesty has the discernment

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.110
to recognize

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.150
the brilliance of this policy!

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.360
The Salt-for-what Policy?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.160
The Salt-for-Services Policy.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:29.390
I...

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.140
approve it.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.860
Your Majesty is wise!

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.390
[Prince Duan's Mansion]

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.190
The Salt-for-Services Policy.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.030
What a brilliant move.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.910
It seems ordinary,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.400
yet it revives

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.030
the Ministry of Revenue's
nearly depleted treasury.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.160
It also wins over a group of merchants.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.150
There must be a smart mastermind
behind this—

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.320
not to be underestimated.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.510
There must be an advisor

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.860
behind that sly fox, Chen Danian.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.750
If we can find out who it is,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.270
we'll have leverage.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.500
In future actions,

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.120
we'll have better odds.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.510
How about

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.130
I conduct a discreet investigation?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:20.800
Forget it.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.550
The Ministry of Revenue is still under
the Empress Dowager's control.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.240
We shouldn't alert them.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.090
Actually,

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.010
the Ministry of Revenue's
revival this time

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.630
will make His Majesty

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.420
the biggest loser.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.490
I saw his face in court—

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.320
it looked terrible.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.790
The Empress Dowager didn't win either.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.960
These Salt Transportation
and Sales Licenses

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.510
generate so much profit every year.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.570
Just handing it all to the merchants,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.750
her heart must be aching.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.550
In that case,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.720
we'll continue to watch them fight.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.360
Your Highness is wise.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.880
The Salt-for-Services Policy.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.110
What a brilliant policy.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520
Chen Danian,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.190
you've finally got it.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.480
Thank you for your praise,
Your Majesty.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.110
I will work even harder

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.070
to live up to your expectations.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.670
CEO Dan!

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:25.870
Look!

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.910
[Yan millet: doesn't rot easily,
making it easier to be stored.]

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.990
We made it.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.720
[Yan millet: doesn't rot easily,
making it easier to be stored.] [Approved]

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.210
We're distributing free Yan millet seeds!

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.700
Everyone can come

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.270
and get them for free!

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.900
The more you plant...

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.720
It's free?

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.960
The more tax you can offset next year!

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.950
We're distributing free Yan millet seeds!

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:11.440
Here.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.680
The Salt-for-Services Policy
went smoothly.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.069
Let's toast to our heroes,

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.599
Wang Zhao

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:16.420
and Er Lan.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.490
I don't deserve it.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.730
Li wrote the script.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.160
I just recited it.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.020
That's right.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.829
The Salt-for-Services Policy
was also Li's idea.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.160
I merely carried it out.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.130
This bowl of wine for Lord Li

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:36.640
is on me.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.600
Come.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.660
Please be seated.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.170
With the treasury in such turmoil,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.310
the Ministry of Revenue

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.970
has become fish
on His Majesty's cutting board.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.280
How could Prince Duan miss

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.920
this chance
to kick them while they're down?

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.510
When the Empress Dowager's faction

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.510
faces pressure
from both Prince Duan and His Majesty,

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.160
then...

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.810
Then bringing the Salt-for-Services Policy
to them

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.350
will be like a lifeline
to the Ministry of Revenue.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.640
They all think they're acting
on their own initiative.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.900
Who would have thought

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.270
that our true purpose
in orchestrating all this

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.530
lies inconspicuously

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:20.630
buried in this list?

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.480
Once the merchants profit from
the Salt-for-Services Policy,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.130
to save on grain transportation costs,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.990
they'll hire people
to cultivate the borderlands.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.320
The northwestern area near
Yan State has harsh conditions.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.940
Only Yan millet can survive there.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.940
Naturally, it becomes the first choice
for planting.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
It's just that...

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.420
they don't know yet.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.110
In the future,

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.890
Great Xia will rely
on this life-saving Yan millet

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.340
to survive the drought.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.850
Why isn't Lord Cen here yet?

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.000
I'll go find him.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.550
giving us hope.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.030
Please remain seated, my dear ministers.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.030
I'll go keep her company for a while.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.830
Speaking of Cen,

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.270
he stays in his experimental fields
every day.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.340
Even His Majesty can't summon him away.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.390
What a fool.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.360
Cen is not a fool.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.720
He's a person of utmost purity and virtue.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.890
Without his cultivation methods,

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.510
even if our performance is excellent

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:52.400
and our strategies brilliant,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.110
it would all be like a castle in the air,

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.400
without foundation.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.010
Er Lan is right.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.330
That's Lord Er to you.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:03.720
I haven't congratulated you yet.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.670
You gained the Minister of Rite's favor
so quickly

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.230
and received an official promotion.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.790
Lord Er,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:08.830
I toast to you.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.020
Li.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:13.300
Li.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.810
I know you're upset, Li.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.240
I had a bad temper that day.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.070
Please don't take offense.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.480
I'll punish myself with a drink.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:19.940
No need.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.220
A toast from Lord Er

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.270
is beyond my station.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:24.880
Right.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.720
If he hadn't stolen your credit that day,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.180
you'd be the one promoted.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.790
The Salt-for-Services Policy
was Li's idea.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.090
I merely conveyed it.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.200
When His Majesty rewards merit,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.010
he won't forget your contribution, Li.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.210
What won't he forget?

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.110
What about me needs to be remembered?

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.030
I've said it before—

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.630
my ambitions lie elsewhere!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.310
Li.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:48.910
Step back!

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.610
Indeed, Li.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.850
So noble and proud,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.000
with such lofty aspirations.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.400
Ready to join court today
and die tomorrow.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.370
-Is that what you think—
-Indeed that's what I think.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:05.700
You...

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.720
Fine!

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.850
I'll live!

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.310
Live well.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.060
How inappropriate!

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.830
It appears Yan millet
is indeed the most drought-resistant

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.890
and grows the best.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.650
Though planted in late autumn

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.590
without sufficient irrigation,

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.790
in just a month or so,

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.230
it's grown this well.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.480
Lord Cen,

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.340
could you, like you did before,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.740
determine what soil Yan millet suits best,

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.030
and how to irrigate and fertilize it?

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.360
I

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.250
will certainly do my best.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.570
Lord Cen,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.660
please take care of yourself.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.110
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.720
I

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.090
will do my best to live a bit longer.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.280
To spend your remaining life like this,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.080
is it worth it?

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.520
I have witnessed with my own eyes

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.260
people starving to death during famine.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.920
I've also seen mothers
with their infants in swaddling clothes

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.680
who never woke again

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.100
while fleeing famine.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.080
Everyone lives in the face of death.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.510
To be able to foresee one's death

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.870
might be a blessing in disguise.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.250
However, at the very least,

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.140
I do not wish to see
the people of this land

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.880
die of starvation again.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.040
When my time comes to depart,

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.730
I only wish that where my bones rest,

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.120
there will be peace throughout the land

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.330
and abundant harvests.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:54.960
Well said.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.680
Excellently put.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.350
Your Majesty.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.260
Your Highness.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.800
Cen,

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.170
it's rare to have everyone gathered today.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.850
Would you be willing to set aside
your agricultural work for a moment

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.070
and join us, your old friends,

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.920
for a drink?

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:18.880
Please.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.260
When I read the novel,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.310
I enjoyed the exciting grand scenes—

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920
power struggles,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.240
epic battles,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.350
watching protagonists
rise from nothing and turn evil,

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.480
and the tearing apart of scoundrels
and scheming women.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.110
When I read "Devil's Favorite Concubine,"

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.510
I skipped all the parts

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:53.920
where Cen Jintian was fervently farming

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.790
completely.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.120
But after coming to this world, I realized

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.260
he was the one

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.690
who truly saved
countless people from disaster.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.550
To have such a life

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.480
is certainly not a waste, is it?

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.590
Don't belittle yourself.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.960
You too are

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.380
saving people from disaster.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:17.640

Even knowing my fate ends in death,

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.730
I still want to accomplish

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.190
more things before I die.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.270
Sure.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.820
Why do you keep saying "sure"?

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.690
Then I'll say

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.370
I'll risk my life to accompany you.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.320
Your Majesty!

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.350
What's wrong?

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.150
Your Majesty,

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.110
we've discovered

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.200
someone lurking suspiciously
in the forest.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.110
Though it's just one person,

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.440
they are highly skilled in martial arts.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.350
Lord Bei Zhou has gone to deal with them.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.880
He ordered us to escort the two of you
back to the palace first.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.410
Only one assassin was sent.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.900
This doesn't seem
like Prince Duan's style.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.610
Keep them alive.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.070
Have Bei Zhou capture them

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.110
for interrogation.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.110
Lord Bei Zhou hasn't beaten him yet.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:46.000
What?

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.510
Was there such a character

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:02.770
in the original novel?

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.610
I don't remember there being one.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.740
Bei Zhou is the strongest fighter
in the original story,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.770
never having met his match.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.600
This person who appeared out of nowhere

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.480
is quite suspicious.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.850
Keep them alive!

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.530
Yes, yes.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.640
Hold your blade!

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.640
I'm not an assassin. Can't you tell?

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.070
If you were really an assassin,

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.870
I would have killed you already.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.310
You wouldn't still be alive.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.040
I surrender.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.610
Isn't that enough?

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.490
Who are you?

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.240
My surname is Bai.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.570
You can call me Bai.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.000
Sir.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.880
Let's talk things through nicely.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.140
Why are you doing this?

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:56.430
Speak.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.740
Where are you from?

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.760
I'll tell you!

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.000
The Nameless.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.730
You know the Nameless, right?

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.590
He's my master.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.110
My master has been observing the stars

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.970
and sent me here

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:10.920
with a message.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.150
It's here.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.870
This is indeed his handwriting.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.160
But I can't understand

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.590
what he wrote.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.130
Of course you can't understand.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.420
It's not for you.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.160
It's for the Emperor.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.070
Let me have a look.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.490
Emperor?

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.010
You are the Emperor?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.240
A living Emperor!

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.450
Master, I saw the living Emperor!

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:58.850
The Imperial Throne finds a new master;

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.920
the Polaris restores the light in the sky.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.850
A dark omen of royal blood and ruin;

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.610
fortune and calamity hang by a thread.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.340
Five stars align,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.010
amidst despair, great fortune rises.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:15.920
The Imperial Throne finds a new master...

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.540
Oh, god.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.000
This person clearly knows your identity.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.200
We've met someone
with true foresight.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.170
Mr. Bei,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.110
do you know the Nameless?

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.410
I've known him for many years.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.520
He's skilled in divination.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.860
All his prophecies come true.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.060
He must be sending this message

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.520
because he must have foreseen
that you, Dan,

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.980
can safeguard the empire.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.110
This kid

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.700
is using techniques taught by him.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.380
He should be trustworthy.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.350
Yes.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.960
Master said you're exceptionally talented.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.400
He told me to learn from you.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.460
You're now serving

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.130
as the Emperor's guard?

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:02.760
Let me join!

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.910
Bei Zhou alone is enough.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.010
Mr. Bei.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.220
Let him go.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.440
He's a godsent elite soldier.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.550
Mr. Bei vouches for him too.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.810
Won't you reconsider?

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.880
Master was being kind

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.710
sending me here to serve you.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.050
I'm so good at fighting.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.550
Even if I'm not to be your guard,

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:21.440
I can at least

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.450
protect this beautiful lady.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.100
Come with us first then.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:32.920
Sure!

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:34.440
Untie me.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.660
Mr. Bei.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.570
Did you make this?

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:37.230
-Yes.
-Bro.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.000
-For fun.
-Give me a hand.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.200
-Awesome.
-Untie me.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.090
Hey!

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.940
Come on, untie me!

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.280
Don't leave!

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.830
Didn't you get the message
from the secret guards?

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.480
I did.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.130
You didn't want me to come.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.750
But Master kept urging me
to come every day,

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.350
saying there'll be endless trouble
if you don't rid of the demonic consort.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.640
I'm caught in the middle.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.770
Can't listen to you,

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.520
and can't listen to him either.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.270
Life is tough.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.810
Everywhere I go,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.850
I search around.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:21.880
These

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.740
are all folk remedies for headaches.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.250
Maybe it's time to give up.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:28.160
No way.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.920
This is one of the tasks
Master assigned me.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.030
Since he predicted
I could help you find the cure,

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.030
I definitely can.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.830
Fine.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.340
Here.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.770
Don't you dislike sweets?

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.810
Why are there so many snacks in your room?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.490
Specially prepared for me?

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.700
[The Imperial Throne finds a new master;
the Polaris restores the light in the sky.
A dark omen of royal blood and ruin;]

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:12.880
[fortune and calamity hang by a thread.
Five stars align,
amidst despair, great fortune rises.]

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.810
I never expected

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.950
to see Master's little note again.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.010
Good thing you kept it.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.100
Otherwise,

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.640
I really couldn't find a reason
to come back.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.350
You've learned to steal from me now.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.790
How can you call it stealing?

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:25.960
I just borrowed it.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.440
It's returned now,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.900
isn't it?

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.400
I went through all this trouble

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.750
to help you fool

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.730
that beautiful lady of yours.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:41.990
Show some respect.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.330
She's a Noble Consort.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.930
From now on, in front of her,

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.600
pretend you just met me.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.490
Don't give anything away.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.370
Okay.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:53.000
Got it.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.720
So

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.640
is she the one you've been waiting for?

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.640
No.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.639
It was someone else.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.590
I was waiting for the wrong person.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.250
But she came at the right time.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.360
If she hadn't come,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.469
I would have been dead already.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:31.480
Am I too stupid,

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.330
or are you being vague?

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.659
You're just too stupid.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.560
You like her, don't you?

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.659
Zhang San's Diary.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.620
Move that flower a bit more to the left.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.000
-A little more to the left.
-Okay.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.150
[The late Empress Dowager]

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.750
Too much. Move it right a bit.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.220
Lift that grass up a little.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.100
Yes, a bit more to the right.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.550
Crown Prince.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:18.800
I pay my respects to you, Grandmother.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.450
May the Your Majesty be blessed.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.850
Why are you here

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.370
instead of studying in the library?

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.770
Grandmother,

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.460
His Majesty canceled the Flower Festival
a few days ago.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.450
But I saw these hydrangeas blooming
so beautifully,

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.700
and it would be a shame
to leave them unattended,

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.820
so I thought I'd arrange them a bit.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.920
By the time of your birthday, Grandmother,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.700
they will be in full bloom.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.740
They can be a birthday gift for you.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.330
How thoughtful of you.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.250
However,

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.590
I notice the arrangement of these flowers

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.560
seems to have some special meaning.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.720
Take all these things away.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.200
You may leave for now.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.020
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:17.650
You have a discerning eye, Grandmother.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.230
Look.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.370
This depicts two dragons
playing with a pearl,

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:22.900
symbolizing good fortune.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:23.660
Absurd!

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.810
Great Xia can only have one true dragon.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.770
Your mother died early,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.660
and the Emperor
has already found a new love.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.860
Soon he will appoint a new Empress.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:38.960
In the future,

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.160
there may well be more Crown Princes.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.490
In this vast palace,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.530
with all its intrigues,

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.110
only I truly care for you.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.040
Do you understand?

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.560
You've misunderstood, Grandmother.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.020
The two dragons I planted—

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.970
one represents you, Grandmother,

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.230
and the other is me.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.600
You are the mother figure of the empire,

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.130
presiding over the palace,

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.330
supremely noble—

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.040
the auspicious dragon protecting
the imperial family.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.550
I, with all my heart,

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:13.770
only wish

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.970
to be filial by your side

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.800
and serve the empire,

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.940
as the little dragon
under your protection.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.040
Come, get up.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.330
You truly are my good grandson.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.370
Rest assured,

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.210
as long as I am around in this palace,

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.410
those sordid affairs

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.140
will not interfere with your future.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.290
You, my little dragon,

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.410
are the only true dragon in this palace.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:58.830
Do you understand?

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.480
Thank you, Grandmother.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:21.080
[SOS]

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.600
If you are like me,

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.870
leave me a message.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.420
I want to meet you.
