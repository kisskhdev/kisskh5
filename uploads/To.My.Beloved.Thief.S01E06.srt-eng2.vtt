00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.332
{\an8}How long have you been here?

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.251
{\an8}For about an hour.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:08.631
{\an8}But shouldn't you be asking

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:11.634
{\an8}why I came here in the first place?

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:18.474
{\an8}You knew, didn't you?

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:22.353
{\an8}Ever since that day.

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:26.983
Why am I…

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:36.409
What on earth is happening?

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:45.376
I must go to the palace.

00:01:58.264 --> 00:01:59.265
Is that… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.684
a Baekjeong mask?

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:05.605
Black clothes.

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:12.487
Physician's robe.

00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:16.407
Actually, Eun-jo must have seen him
better than me.

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:18.117
Physician Hong was there too?

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:20.203
How did you know
I was at the constabulary?

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:21.746
Well…

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.164
In any case,

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:25.291
I'm so glad that you solved this case.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.418
How fortunate.

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.352
It was you.

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.188
Gil-dong.

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:49.607
Where's Gil-dong?

00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:50.775
He's not here.

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:51.901
Let's go that way.

00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.492
He might have gone this way.

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:02.912
Come on.
Gil-dong would've gotten away just fine.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:04.163
That would be a relief.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:09.961
- Is that Eun-jo?
- What?

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:12.672
Hello, my body…

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:14.966
- Eun-jo!
- Eun-jo!

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.384
- Oh, dear!
- Eun-jo!

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:18.261
- Eun-jo! Oh, dear.
- Eun-jo!

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:23.474
Why didn't you ask me sooner?

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.311
Because you would've tried to hide it.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:30.773
That night,

00:03:31.482 --> 00:03:34.068
I heard from the soldiers
why they were chasing Gil-dong.

00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:37.322
Gil-dong's name was written in blood,

00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:39.782
but you couldn't have murdered
the Chief Censor

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:42.035
during your own wedding.

00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:43.119
And

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:44.412
even if it was you,

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:46.789
you would've hidden it anyway.

00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:50.835
But seeing that you're here,

00:03:51.252 --> 00:03:52.378
it couldn't have been you.

00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:55.840
It seems like
we're here for the same reason.

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.719
We're both here to see
if someone would come collect

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:01.012
the fake Gil-dong's body.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.848
I'm sorry

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.767
I've been lying to you.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.518
No need to apologize.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.813
For a woman to step forward
and offer help to those people,

00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:12.982
that's something that deserves praise.

00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:20.656
So don't make a face like that.
It's my face.

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:57.902
He's buried over there.

00:04:59.237 --> 00:05:01.489
I just want to pay my last respects.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:05.201
Who's there?

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:06.244
What's going on?

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:07.870
What's happening?

00:05:08.663 --> 00:05:09.914
It is a wild animal?

00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:11.999
Lady Dong-ju, don't worry!

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:13.626
You're the one acting wild.

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.336
Are you trying your luck with me?

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:33.521
Do you know why he stopped there?

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:36.357
Wild animals, like tigers, roam that path.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:38.651
That person framed you for murder.

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.027
I must know who this person is.

00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:42.280
Let's stop chasing. It's too dangerous.

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:43.197
I don't care.

00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:44.448
I care.

00:05:44.782 --> 00:05:46.951
I don't want you to get hurt
because of this.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.747
In case you forgot,

00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:53.166
you're in my body.

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:55.293
What if you go
and get mauled by an animal?

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:56.419
It's my body.

00:05:57.503 --> 00:05:58.337
Right.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.173
I forgot.

00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:06.345
Do you have anyone in mind

00:06:07.013 --> 00:06:08.598
who might have killed the Chief Censor?

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:14.520
That man was hated by half the capital.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:19.859
That means half the capital
would have wished him dead.

00:06:20.693 --> 00:06:23.362
It might be difficult
to catch the culprit now.

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:25.948
After tonight, they will stay in hiding.

00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:28.743
Why did they show up
at the constabulary as Gil-dong?

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:30.745
They wanted to stage Gil-dong's death

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:32.580
and bring the case to an end.

00:06:32.663 --> 00:06:35.124
They needed a suspect
the people would believe,

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:36.709
and that was Gil-dong.

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:41.505
People would think
Gil-dong was really dead.

00:06:44.842 --> 00:06:46.510
For a mere petty thief,

00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:50.264
he gained far too much fame
and stirred up too many rumors.

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.934
I don't mean to dishonor the dead,

00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:55.978
but perhaps it's best
that Gil-dong is forgotten like this.

00:06:57.855 --> 00:06:58.773
Wait.

00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:08.783
Are you saying

00:07:09.325 --> 00:07:11.285
you will keep stealing?

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:16.165
Your silence says yes.

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:20.127
I just can't say

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:22.046
that I won't.

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.217
The reason I pretended
not to know you were Gil-dong

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.720
was because you wouldn't be able to steal
while our bodies were switched.

00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:32.682
And I won't, so don't worry.

00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:34.559
Do you think I'm worried about myself?

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:38.604
As I said, for a woman to step forward

00:07:38.688 --> 00:07:40.231
and help those in need is admirable.

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:42.984
But I can only say that
because it already happened.

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:44.277
Things are different now.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.737
That woman is you.

00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:50.324
The theft, the fall,
being framed for murder,

00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:52.743
all that dishonor falls upon you now.

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:56.914
Do you know how I felt on my way
to see the fake Gil-dong's body?

00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:58.874
I blamed myself, and hated myself

00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.460
for hiding you and not stopping you,

00:08:01.544 --> 00:08:03.212
thinking I had brought you to that end.

00:08:03.296 --> 00:08:04.964
You don't need to think that way.

00:08:05.047 --> 00:08:06.215
I was never caught and--

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:07.758
You were already caught,

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:09.176
by me.

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:16.767
I'm warning you,

00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:19.228
it doesn't matter whose body you're in.

00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:21.105
If you ever steal again,

00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:23.065
you will get caught again.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.151
And just like last time,

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:26.319
it'll be by me.

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:38.247
Once again, he caught me.

00:08:50.885 --> 00:08:51.844
I'll get going.

00:08:52.303 --> 00:08:53.346
Halt.

00:08:54.388 --> 00:08:56.432
What's that woman doing here at this hour?

00:08:58.392 --> 00:08:59.352
A man?

00:09:00.353 --> 00:09:01.812
Unbelievable.

00:09:06.692 --> 00:09:09.779
{\an8}INSTRUCTIONS FOR WOMEN

00:09:14.158 --> 00:09:15.159
My lady!

00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:16.869
The lord is arriving soon.

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:17.787
Hurry!

00:09:18.496 --> 00:09:19.330
Oh, on my way.

00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:22.208
My lady.

00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.793
You have returned, Brother.

00:09:27.338 --> 00:09:30.132
I told you to see to your appearance,
even for a brief outing.

00:09:30.216 --> 00:09:31.676
- Pardon?
- My lady.

00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:33.135
Your shoes.

00:09:36.055 --> 00:09:37.890
I was so excited to see you.

00:09:39.058 --> 00:09:40.059
Don't put this on me.

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:44.230
Here.

00:09:44.313 --> 00:09:46.023
Take this to your fiancé.

00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:49.068
The funeral must have worn him out.

00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:52.780
About my marriage--

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:55.491
Your wedding will be postponed.

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:58.994
Holding two major family affairs
in the same year would be

00:09:59.745 --> 00:10:01.122
too great a burden for his family.

00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:02.665
You don't look like him.

00:10:02.748 --> 00:10:03.791
You're beautiful.

00:10:05.626 --> 00:10:06.627
My lady.

00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:12.758
Did you laugh?

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:15.344
No, it's because I don't look like you…

00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:19.014
No.

00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:21.225
I mean…

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:22.560
What I meant was…

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:25.062
My lady!

00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:32.445
You don't look like him.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.196
You're beautiful.

00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:37.825
Why did it come to mind at that moment?

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:41.662
Am I really that beautiful?

00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:44.373
Or was it an exclamation?

00:10:44.874 --> 00:10:46.417
Just like saying mountains are high

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.086
and flowers are pretty?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.259
How long have you been standing there?

00:10:56.427 --> 00:10:58.012
Since you started talking to yourself.

00:10:58.095 --> 00:10:59.847
So you heard everything.

00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:04.143
Here.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.187
It's from my older brother.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.522
He still thinks you're my fiancé.

00:11:14.153 --> 00:11:17.364
I will bring up
our broken engagement today.

00:11:17.823 --> 00:11:18.657
As you please.

00:11:21.202 --> 00:11:23.579
You still seem to be in low spirits.

00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:28.125
The fight for survival
that you mentioned on the rainy day

00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:30.503
must still be ongoing.

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.424
Most definitely not.

00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:36.634
If you'll excuse me.

00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:43.557
That can't be true.

00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:47.186
Oh, my.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:50.940
Dressed like that, you really
do look like a lady of the annex.

00:11:51.357 --> 00:11:54.151
How do I tie this?

00:11:56.195 --> 00:11:58.447
I'm in no mood to see anyone.
Who is looking for me?

00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:05.871
The Chief Secretary's eldest son?

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:10.543
Why did you want to meet me,

00:12:11.293 --> 00:12:12.127
Young Master?

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:15.130
Were you with a man last night?

00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:16.048
A man?

00:12:16.715 --> 00:12:18.884
Did he see her with me last night?

00:12:20.177 --> 00:12:22.263
I don't understand
what you're talking about,

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:23.222
Young Master.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.560
Look at that shameless face of yours,
just like your father's.

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:32.606
What is all this noise about?

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:36.694
Father,

00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:39.947
I saw this woman with a man last night.

00:12:42.241 --> 00:12:43.367
Is that true?

00:12:44.577 --> 00:12:45.911
Even the Chief Secretary…

00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:48.205
Wait.

00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:51.375
The Chief Secretary's eldest son
comes to the palace every day.

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:53.586
There is no way he didn't recognize me.

00:12:56.922 --> 00:12:59.967
Must I even answer such a vulgar question?

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.093
What did you just say?

00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:02.261
A truly virtuous man

00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:04.305
asks for the full circumstances first,

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:06.974
even if he has his doubts.

00:13:08.726 --> 00:13:12.021
The man I met yesterday
was the young master of my natal family.

00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:14.106
Who did you think he was?

00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:17.359
Did you not see his face?

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:20.070
I didn't get a look at it.

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:23.574
But the mere fact that a girl was out
at such a late hour…

00:13:23.657 --> 00:13:24.867
A girl?

00:13:25.743 --> 00:13:28.537
I may not be of a high status,
but I'm your senior by family order.

00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:31.582
Choose your words carefully.

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:36.003
Above all, to dishonor me

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:38.881
is to dishonor your late grandfather,

00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:41.759
which is something
a scholar-official must know.

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:46.513
Even when the royal family

00:13:46.597 --> 00:13:48.932
takes in a concubine of low status,

00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:51.977
she's granted a rank befitting
her position and treated with due respect.

00:13:53.187 --> 00:13:54.438
And look at your attitude.

00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:55.981
What? Have you forgotten your place?

00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:57.900
Watch your words.

00:13:59.234 --> 00:14:00.069
Father.

00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:08.744
He's not wrong.

00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:10.829
Observe proper decorum.

00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:16.835
The devotion you should have shown
in serving my father

00:14:17.503 --> 00:14:20.714
shall now be devoted
to honoring him for the rest of your life.

00:14:22.049 --> 00:14:24.551
Seung-jae, follow me
once you're ready to go to the palace.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.136
Yes, Father.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.683
I'll see you later.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:33.602
If I must.

00:14:35.938 --> 00:14:37.815
Lay a finger on this body,

00:14:38.232 --> 00:14:40.442
and you'll be beheaded at once.

00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:06.343
What is it?

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:10.139
I thought I would have a word
with my grandchild.

00:15:11.223 --> 00:15:13.976
The men of this family
seem to have never learned

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:17.521
how to treat their elders,
so I was teaching them.

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:19.481
Mark my words,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.318
from now on,
you'd better not say things like,

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:24.737
"a mere lowly girl,"

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.196
"a mere concubine,"

00:15:27.364 --> 00:15:29.575
or anything about ruining or killing me.

00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:32.453
If you say any of those things,

00:15:32.536 --> 00:15:33.704
you'll be in serious trouble.

00:15:35.164 --> 00:15:36.999
I was going to ruin you completely,

00:15:38.083 --> 00:15:39.585
but it no longer seems worth it.

00:15:41.253 --> 00:15:42.171
What?

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:43.964
I get it.

00:15:44.048 --> 00:15:46.925
This is why you lied
about who you were marrying.

00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:48.677
You must've been counting days.

00:15:48.761 --> 00:15:49.845
Be honest with me.

00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:52.222
You just wanted a higher status.

00:15:52.848 --> 00:15:54.349
Yes, apparently.

00:15:54.808 --> 00:15:55.934
It turns out that

00:15:56.018 --> 00:15:58.353
you were not a filial daughter
who cared for her family,

00:15:59.188 --> 00:16:01.065
but someone who only wanted

00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:03.525
the title, wealth and higher status

00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:05.736
that came
with the Chief Secretary's family.

00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:08.405
It's so typical.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:09.907
It's boring.

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:11.867
Look, Grandchild,

00:16:12.618 --> 00:16:14.411
I wasn't speaking of status,

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.914
but of basic respect for human beings.

00:16:18.207 --> 00:16:20.250
Was it too hard for you to understand?

00:16:22.586 --> 00:16:23.420
Well,

00:16:23.504 --> 00:16:27.257
I'm not interested
in your worldly way of thinking,

00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:29.635
much less in lecturing you.

00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:32.679
So let's just stick to basic courtesy.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.978
You are no different from others.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.690
Why don't you show that man
this side of yourself?

00:16:44.191 --> 00:16:46.527
It would make a much stronger impression.

00:16:48.987 --> 00:16:49.988
"That man"?

00:16:54.243 --> 00:16:55.244
What?

00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:57.496
There's another man?

00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:08.298
Deliver this to Her Majesty.

00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:10.050
And convey my regards.

00:17:10.134 --> 00:17:11.718
Her Majesty has ordered that

00:17:11.802 --> 00:17:13.720
Your Highness pay his respects
in person today.

00:17:25.107 --> 00:17:28.152
You should eat jujubes,
instead of sweet snacks like yakgwa.

00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:31.446
Your Majesty has a cold constitution,
so it's good for your body.

00:17:32.156 --> 00:17:33.282
Open wide.

00:17:44.168 --> 00:17:47.713
I hear you go to the Royal Pharmacy
every morning to have the tonic prepared.

00:17:48.547 --> 00:17:49.381
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.636
What wicked scheme are you plotting?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.264
I want to clear up that misunderstanding.

00:17:57.806 --> 00:17:58.932
Misunderstanding?

00:17:59.016 --> 00:18:00.017
Your son…

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.977
I mean, me.

00:18:02.394 --> 00:18:05.022
I am not the scoundrel
or idler you think I am.

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:07.774
I mean, I know I'm mischievous,

00:18:07.858 --> 00:18:09.693
arrogant at times, stubborn,

00:18:09.776 --> 00:18:12.279
occasionally act entitled, and…

00:18:14.448 --> 00:18:16.325
Well, I'm a prince,
so I guess I am privileged.

00:18:17.242 --> 00:18:18.285
Anyway,

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:21.038
I know how to give to those in need,

00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:23.707
and at times show great generosity.

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:28.462
I can accept rejection with grace,

00:18:29.421 --> 00:18:33.008
and even wish them happiness.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:37.429
I can hide others' weaknesses and--

00:18:37.512 --> 00:18:40.557
You have a knack for praising yourself.

00:18:42.851 --> 00:18:45.479
Praising myself is, after all,
praising Your Majesty.

00:18:46.897 --> 00:18:47.898
And this is

00:18:47.981 --> 00:18:50.692
all thanks to Your Majesty's
gracious guidance.

00:18:52.486 --> 00:18:54.112
It took you long enough.

00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:56.031
How silly of you.

00:18:56.865 --> 00:19:00.035
Her Majesty is just like any mother.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.163
You're relieved of your confinement.

00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:07.501
So I can come pay my morning respects
from now on?

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.302
Court Lady Kim.

00:19:18.178 --> 00:19:20.722
Tell Officer Seo to bring that girl.

00:19:21.139 --> 00:19:22.599
Which girl, Your Majesty?

00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:24.518
Court Lady

00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:26.144
Hong-si.

00:19:34.611 --> 00:19:36.238
How about we tell her she was cast out?

00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:38.323
What if she asks
the female officials to find her?

00:19:38.407 --> 00:19:39.700
It will complicate things.

00:19:39.783 --> 00:19:41.868
I'll go and take her to the palace.

00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:42.953
No.

00:19:43.036 --> 00:19:44.955
This is urgent, so I'll come with you.

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:50.043
Your Highness.

00:19:51.336 --> 00:19:52.754
It seems she's not in the annex.

00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:55.048
Where did she go?

00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:58.051
Dae-chu, could you go
and check at the Hyeminseo?

00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:58.969
Yes, Your Highness.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.896
The Young Master won't be home until 8:00.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.274
Are you sure
you can stay here till that late?

00:20:12.816 --> 00:20:15.027
It's all right. Everyone's out.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.195
I have something to talk about
with the Young Master.

00:20:18.739 --> 00:20:19.614
Hello?

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:21.992
This voice…

00:20:29.082 --> 00:20:30.208
What are you doing here?

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:32.002
May I ask who you are?

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:33.086
Right.

00:20:35.047 --> 00:20:36.631
I'm Dae-il's friend from the academy.

00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:38.550
I see.

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:41.470
The Young Master is out at the moment.

00:20:43.555 --> 00:20:44.389
Well…

00:20:44.473 --> 00:20:45.849
I think he's here to see me.

00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:48.477
Why did you come here?

00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:49.895
Eun-jo.

00:20:49.978 --> 00:20:51.855
He's the Young Master's friend.
Mind your tone.

00:20:51.938 --> 00:20:54.900
It's fine.
We're past formalities, in every sense.

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:56.193
What?

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.362
You're startling her.

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:01.406
I have some business at the Hyeminseo,

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.866
so we talk sometimes.

00:21:03.533 --> 00:21:04.368
I see.

00:21:05.452 --> 00:21:06.912
So? What is it?

00:21:08.121 --> 00:21:09.122
Sir?

00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:10.832
Someone's looking for Hong-si.

00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:12.709
Who's Hong-si?

00:21:14.252 --> 00:21:15.504
Court Lady Hong-si?

00:21:16.171 --> 00:21:17.964
Yes, that's why I came all the way here.

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:20.092
That should tell you
who's looking for you.

00:21:24.137 --> 00:21:26.056
I'm afraid I must go.

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:28.350
All right.
I'll cook the broody hen another time.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.061
Wait.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.521
Eun-jo, wait here.

00:21:32.604 --> 00:21:33.647
You should take these.

00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:40.987
Why is Mother looking for me?

00:21:41.071 --> 00:21:42.781
How would I know?

00:21:42.864 --> 00:21:45.700
And why are you making my mother
cook the broody hen?

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.538
Mother insisted.
What was I supposed to do?

00:21:49.621 --> 00:21:52.082
Could you please not call her "Mother"
like that?

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:56.545
Why did you leave these beautiful things
in your drawer?

00:21:56.628 --> 00:21:58.171
They were stored carefully.

00:22:00.632 --> 00:22:01.591
No.

00:22:03.093 --> 00:22:04.010
Wait.

00:22:04.428 --> 00:22:05.387
Is this…

00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:10.434
All right.

00:22:11.309 --> 00:22:13.812
I did that? I kept them carefully?

00:22:13.895 --> 00:22:14.938
Mother…

00:22:15.021 --> 00:22:15.856
I mean…

00:22:16.857 --> 00:22:18.650
Your daughter must've left them
for a reason.

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:20.110
You didn't need to bring them out.

00:22:20.193 --> 00:22:21.361
Pardon?

00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:22.529
I'm glad you did.

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:24.281
Give them to me. I'll put them on.

00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:27.993
My! Whoever picked out these shoes

00:22:28.076 --> 00:22:29.786
has excellent taste.

00:22:30.412 --> 00:22:31.621
What about this lotus leaf?

00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:33.039
It was next to them.

00:22:37.544 --> 00:22:40.672
You even dried this and kept it?

00:22:40.755 --> 00:22:43.049
I could tell they were precious to you,
so I kept them.

00:22:48.054 --> 00:22:49.264
You can tell, right?

00:22:49.347 --> 00:22:50.348
They look

00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:52.767
quite precious, even to you, Mother.

00:22:52.851 --> 00:22:53.685
No, they're not.

00:22:54.186 --> 00:22:55.687
It just came with the silk shoes.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.647
Why are you yelling like that?

00:22:57.731 --> 00:22:59.274
Look, you startled my mother.

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:00.400
Apologize now.

00:23:01.109 --> 00:23:02.027
I apologize.

00:23:02.611 --> 00:23:03.987
It's all right.

00:23:04.446 --> 00:23:05.530
What's wrong with you?

00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:08.617
I'll leave the lotus leaf here.

00:23:09.284 --> 00:23:11.369
It seems too precious.

00:23:13.038 --> 00:23:14.539
Why don't you go on ahead?

00:23:14.623 --> 00:23:15.624
Mother,

00:23:15.707 --> 00:23:17.250
can we have a moment?

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:21.171
Did you want to say something to me?

00:23:22.964 --> 00:23:24.299
I know we just met

00:23:24.758 --> 00:23:26.384
and this could sound baffling,

00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:31.056
but I think you should keep some distance
from your daughter for now.

00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:35.435
Because she's married now?

00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:36.603
What?

00:23:37.437 --> 00:23:39.147
Yes, exactly.

00:23:40.315 --> 00:23:41.733
Her husband's family won't be happy

00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:43.860
to see her visiting you so often.

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:46.321
You're right.

00:23:46.947 --> 00:23:48.698
I was being selfish.

00:23:50.742 --> 00:23:53.119
I didn't realize it when she was here,

00:23:53.203 --> 00:23:56.206
but now that she's gone,
I miss her so badly.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.043
Same here.

00:24:01.127 --> 00:24:02.003
Pardon?

00:24:02.462 --> 00:24:04.714
I mean, that's what
your daughter would think.

00:24:07.467 --> 00:24:08.510
Anyway,

00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:10.387
I will follow your advice

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.014
and try to keep some distance.

00:24:18.812 --> 00:24:19.729
It won't be too long.

00:24:20.438 --> 00:24:21.273
Just for a bit.

00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:25.443
I apologize.

00:24:25.902 --> 00:24:27.237
I was reminded of my mother.

00:24:28.113 --> 00:24:29.698
I see.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.492
And don't cook the precious broody hen

00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:34.286
for your daughter.

00:24:43.712 --> 00:24:45.213
Give them back. They're mine.

00:24:45.547 --> 00:24:48.174
What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

00:24:48.258 --> 00:24:49.384
It's you and me.

00:24:50.302 --> 00:24:51.261
Look here,

00:24:51.344 --> 00:24:52.345
what does that mean?

00:24:52.429 --> 00:24:54.222
That's just how it is now.

00:24:54.306 --> 00:24:55.640
What's mine is yours,

00:24:55.724 --> 00:24:57.183
and what's yours is mine.

00:24:59.436 --> 00:25:01.271
Ever since our bodies were switched,

00:25:01.354 --> 00:25:03.064
I feel like I'm on a scavenger hunt.

00:25:03.148 --> 00:25:04.566
One by one, I'm uncovering

00:25:04.649 --> 00:25:07.193
the things this body's owner hid.

00:25:09.446 --> 00:25:11.031
What's next?

00:25:11.114 --> 00:25:12.699
Nothing.

00:25:12.782 --> 00:25:13.992
About the silk shoes…

00:25:14.075 --> 00:25:15.869
I just didn't want to waste them.

00:25:17.078 --> 00:25:18.455
I can totally believe that.

00:25:20.081 --> 00:25:22.000
I'm heading to my quarters now.

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:24.044
You can go to the courtyard by yourself.

00:25:33.553 --> 00:25:34.512
Lower your head.

00:25:35.096 --> 00:25:36.181
- Blast.
- Your Highness.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.852
Chief Secretary Im. It's been a while.

00:25:42.145 --> 00:25:43.438
Have you been in good health?

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.483
I heard about your father's passing.

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:50.195
I sincerely hope that his body,

00:25:50.278 --> 00:25:52.906
long wearied by illness,
has now found rest.

00:25:55.283 --> 00:25:57.911
Have you ever met my father,
Your Highness?

00:26:01.748 --> 00:26:04.042
I heard that he had been gravely ill.

00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:06.961
I appreciate
Your Highness' gracious words.

00:26:09.089 --> 00:26:11.716
I heard that you visited
His Majesty's bedchamber last night

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.427
and cautioned him against
the overuse of medicine, Your Highness.

00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:16.012
Yes, I did.

00:26:16.096 --> 00:26:18.056
As the Vice Superintendent
of the Royal Pharmacy,

00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:20.058
- I'll question the royal physicians--
- Don't.

00:26:20.141 --> 00:26:21.309
It's not that serious.

00:26:21.684 --> 00:26:24.104
Why press them
when we could just exchange opinions?

00:26:26.356 --> 00:26:27.774
As you command, Your Highness.

00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:29.317
Good.

00:26:30.568 --> 00:26:31.694
I must get going.

00:26:38.827 --> 00:26:40.870
You there, Grand Prince's court lady.
Halt.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.436
His Highness dropped this. Take it.

00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:07.939
Give it to me.

00:27:08.022 --> 00:27:09.649
How dare she…

00:27:09.732 --> 00:27:10.817
You there,

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.318
did you not hear us?

00:27:26.541 --> 00:27:28.251
Court Lady Kim, go to Her Majesty at once.

00:27:28.334 --> 00:27:29.377
She sent for you urgently.

00:27:29.961 --> 00:27:30.920
Yes, sir.

00:27:35.383 --> 00:27:36.551
Let's go to your residence.

00:27:36.634 --> 00:27:38.011
Yes.

00:27:51.232 --> 00:27:53.902
The Grand Prince doesn't seem
to know much about the incense.

00:27:55.445 --> 00:27:56.321
Chief Secretary Im.

00:28:02.368 --> 00:28:05.163
Can you tell me the name
of that herb from the Ming?

00:28:06.706 --> 00:28:09.000
May I ask the reason
for Your Highness's inquiry?

00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:11.961
It would be useful to know,
for my studies.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.547
I might want to use it later too.

00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:17.634
It is the seed of a flower called Gokdu,

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:20.094
a medicinal herb found only in the Ming.

00:28:20.553 --> 00:28:21.471
Gokdu?

00:28:23.473 --> 00:28:24.390
Thank you.

00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:40.698
I heard that Your Majesty had sent for me.

00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:44.244
Because I wanted to commend you
for your recent service as well.

00:28:44.327 --> 00:28:45.954
That you added "as well"

00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:49.499
probably means
there's something more important.

00:28:49.582 --> 00:28:50.583
I'm impressed.

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:54.045
You're not only agile,
but also quick-witted.

00:28:54.921 --> 00:28:55.880
From now on,

00:28:56.422 --> 00:28:57.966
observe the Grand Prince closely.

00:28:59.968 --> 00:29:00.885
Observe?

00:29:04.514 --> 00:29:06.599
I am indeed the most suitable person

00:29:06.683 --> 00:29:08.184
for that task.

00:29:09.143 --> 00:29:12.647
And look more discreetly
into matters concerning women.

00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:16.025
His Majesty's women.

00:29:16.109 --> 00:29:18.611
I will look into that matter closely,
as Your majesty commands.

00:29:19.487 --> 00:29:22.240
This recent incident worries me.

00:29:23.116 --> 00:29:24.617
I worry he may be roaming the market,

00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:27.912
associating with some girl
of no name or standing.

00:29:31.958 --> 00:29:33.042
Your Majesty,

00:29:33.626 --> 00:29:35.336
regarding you said just now…

00:29:36.337 --> 00:29:37.964
such worries should never be voiced

00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:39.799
in His Highness' presence.

00:29:40.967 --> 00:29:41.968
What?

00:29:46.681 --> 00:29:47.557
You're right.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.560
He always tends to do
the opposite of what I say.

00:29:50.643 --> 00:29:53.021
If I tell him not to do something,
he'll do it even more.

00:29:56.065 --> 00:29:58.735
You sure know the Grand Prince well.

00:30:00.028 --> 00:30:01.279
There's one more thing.

00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:04.657
Find out which woman
was holding his hand in the yard.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.495
If I told Brother about this,

00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:11.706
he would fault me for my rashness.

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:15.752
I beg Your Majesty's help.

00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:21.799
I dreaded the idea that we would be
tied to the Chief Secretary's family,

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:23.968
so this is for the best.

00:30:24.469 --> 00:30:26.387
I will speak to him of it in due time.

00:30:26.763 --> 00:30:27.931
I appreciate it.

00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:32.101
Hae-rim, are you certain
about this decision?

00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:34.771
Rumors of a broken engagement
are harsh on women.

00:30:34.854 --> 00:30:36.814
They will cling to you for a while.

00:30:39.692 --> 00:30:42.570
I will bear it.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.121
What's taking him so long?

00:30:53.915 --> 00:30:56.542
Your Highness, Hong-si is here.

00:30:56.918 --> 00:30:57.961
Let her in now.

00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:10.098
What did Her Majesty say?

00:31:12.141 --> 00:31:13.685
Later. I'm tired.

00:31:13.768 --> 00:31:15.395
You didn't make any mistake, did you?

00:31:16.104 --> 00:31:17.230
You have no idea

00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:19.816
how tiring it is to get around

00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:21.192
in this small body.

00:31:21.275 --> 00:31:23.319
It's my body. I know that very well.

00:31:24.862 --> 00:31:26.656
Stop being a crybaby and get up.

00:31:35.623 --> 00:31:37.000
Did he fall asleep?

00:31:40.878 --> 00:31:42.255
He must've been really tired.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.897
Let me

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:02.191
keep this.

00:33:17.058 --> 00:33:17.975
Stay there.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.937
I didn't know I had such a handsome face.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.188
I'm appreciating it.

00:33:33.699 --> 00:33:35.118
At this moment at least,

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.995
it doesn't seem all that bad
our souls were switched.

00:33:42.917 --> 00:33:44.043
About last night…

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:46.379
I didn't mean it

00:33:48.214 --> 00:33:49.757
when I said I would catch you.

00:33:52.885 --> 00:33:53.719
No.

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:56.180
I actually wish you meant it.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.768
I did what I did

00:34:01.769 --> 00:34:02.687
because

00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:05.565
I followed my heart.

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:11.070
I just couldn't stand by and watch
patients who were so malnourished

00:34:12.864 --> 00:34:15.074
that even medicine no longer worked.

00:34:16.784 --> 00:34:18.161
I know it's hard to understand

00:34:18.995 --> 00:34:20.288
why I'm doing this.

00:34:20.621 --> 00:34:22.123
Even I don't understand it myself.

00:34:23.332 --> 00:34:26.210
"What's wrong with me?
Why am I like this?"

00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:29.380
I kept thinking about it,

00:34:29.881 --> 00:34:31.507
but I couldn't find the answer.

00:34:32.717 --> 00:34:33.718
So I concluded

00:34:34.677 --> 00:34:36.637
that this nosiness
is something I was born with.

00:34:37.054 --> 00:34:38.472
I concluded that must be it.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.225
Once I no longer needed a reason,

00:34:42.268 --> 00:34:43.728
I felt at ease.

00:34:44.395 --> 00:34:46.230
It wasn't for anyone else,

00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:48.816
but for my own peace of mind.

00:34:49.734 --> 00:34:50.985
Selfish, right?

00:34:52.778 --> 00:34:53.738
Perhaps,

00:34:54.947 --> 00:34:56.407
it's my vanity.

00:34:57.325 --> 00:34:58.618
It's your heart.

00:35:00.953 --> 00:35:02.121
And your sincerity.

00:35:07.585 --> 00:35:09.378
About what you promised the other day…

00:35:10.171 --> 00:35:11.130
From now on,

00:35:12.715 --> 00:35:14.133
stay within my expectations.

00:35:14.842 --> 00:35:16.260
Just stay within

00:35:16.844 --> 00:35:18.012
what I can handle.

00:35:18.304 --> 00:35:20.473
"But if you go beyond my forbearance

00:35:20.848 --> 00:35:22.975
and threaten the foundations of Joseon,

00:35:23.726 --> 00:35:25.019
I will arrest you."

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.483
That day should never come.

00:35:32.735 --> 00:35:33.903
No way.

00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:36.489
A petty thief stealing trifles,

00:35:36.572 --> 00:35:39.075
could never threaten
the very foundations of Joseon.

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:44.789
Let me promise one thing too.

00:35:46.165 --> 00:35:48.251
If I were ever to be caught,

00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:51.671
it would be by you.

00:36:04.892 --> 00:36:07.436
Your Highness, Officer Seo is here.

00:36:08.271 --> 00:36:09.272
Let him in.

00:36:10.815 --> 00:36:11.691
The seats.

00:36:22.702 --> 00:36:26.372
Should I have read the room
and waited before entering?

00:36:26.455 --> 00:36:29.041
Yes. From now on,
count to ten before you enter.

00:36:33.629 --> 00:36:35.298
What did Chief Secretary Im mean earlier?

00:36:35.381 --> 00:36:37.049
Did you go to His Majesty's bedchamber?

00:36:37.133 --> 00:36:37.967
Right.

00:36:38.801 --> 00:36:40.136
I forgot to tell you about it

00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:42.138
when I met you a couple of days ago.

00:36:48.936 --> 00:36:51.605
Do you think the Grand Prince
was sounding you out, Father?

00:36:51.689 --> 00:36:53.357
To me, it didn't seem like that.

00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:55.359
It didn't to me either.

00:36:55.443 --> 00:36:57.570
Then what is bothering you?

00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:00.531
Grand Prince Dowol…

00:37:03.075 --> 00:37:04.910
That name bothers me.

00:37:05.453 --> 00:37:06.912
You made him stop the medicine?

00:37:08.622 --> 00:37:11.375
So that's why
the Chief Secretary and Lady Jang

00:37:11.459 --> 00:37:13.419
mentioned my name the other day.

00:37:13.502 --> 00:37:15.671
His Majesty wasn't upset about it,

00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:17.298
so I thought it ended well.

00:37:17.381 --> 00:37:18.799
That's my life.

00:37:18.883 --> 00:37:22.011
People will find meaning in even
the most meaningless things you say.

00:37:23.804 --> 00:37:26.390
Living as a Grand Prince
isn't easy after all.

00:37:26.724 --> 00:37:29.143
Simply folding the bedding
can cause an uproar,

00:37:29.226 --> 00:37:30.644
and asking for the name of an herb

00:37:30.728 --> 00:37:32.730
can lead to the royal physicians
being questioned.

00:37:33.397 --> 00:37:36.567
The Grand Prince
can't speak or act freely.

00:37:39.236 --> 00:37:40.196
Right.

00:37:41.322 --> 00:37:43.824
I forgot that you were now
living as a young widow.

00:37:44.825 --> 00:37:45.743
Well,

00:37:46.285 --> 00:37:49.205
your in-laws are actually nicer
than I thought.

00:37:49.705 --> 00:37:50.539
Really?

00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:52.666
That's strange.

00:37:53.751 --> 00:37:56.420
I'm living a decent life
as the lady of the annex.

00:37:56.796 --> 00:37:58.047
Don't worry about me.

00:38:00.383 --> 00:38:01.550
By the way,

00:38:02.176 --> 00:38:04.261
His Majesty must've been baffled

00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:07.264
to see his brother show such concern.

00:38:09.975 --> 00:38:12.353
What's the name
of that medicinal herb again?

00:38:12.436 --> 00:38:13.813
They said it's Gokdu.

00:38:17.274 --> 00:38:19.360
Is His Majesty getting old?

00:38:20.528 --> 00:38:22.321
It seems like his illness
is getting serious.

00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:32.623
Are you feeling unwell?

00:38:34.792 --> 00:38:37.169
My body has been feeling heavy lately.

00:38:37.253 --> 00:38:39.213
I wonder why.

00:38:39.296 --> 00:38:41.799
There's been nothing
out of the ordinary lately.

00:38:43.467 --> 00:38:46.804
Except that you haven't burned the incense
these past few days.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:50.891
The incense…

00:38:52.435 --> 00:38:53.269
bring it.

00:38:56.105 --> 00:38:58.566
His Majesty is showing
strong symptoms of addiction.

00:38:58.983 --> 00:39:00.901
If the Grand Prince visited him,

00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:02.653
he would not stand by and do nothing.

00:39:02.736 --> 00:39:05.865
Ever since the ledger
was handed to His Majesty,

00:39:05.948 --> 00:39:08.576
the Grand Prince keeps getting in the way.

00:39:08.659 --> 00:39:10.286
Should I have him quietly removed?

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:16.125
If things go wrong…

00:39:18.085 --> 00:39:21.964
If things go awry, we will be wiped out.

00:39:26.218 --> 00:39:27.219
Pretext.

00:39:27.928 --> 00:39:29.638
We need a pretext.

00:39:31.932 --> 00:39:34.477
We must scour
the Grand Prince's every move.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.729
Everything, down to the smallest rumors.

00:39:37.354 --> 00:39:38.230
Yes, Father.

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:40.316
That was not an order given to you.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.111
This will pressure the Grand Prince.
Keep out of harm's way.

00:39:44.195 --> 00:39:45.946
Then, who will do it?

00:40:03.297 --> 00:40:06.383
I was posted to State Tribunal
instead of Office of Inspector General.

00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:09.637
I heard the Chief Secretary
pulled some strings.

00:40:10.763 --> 00:40:11.889
Office of Inspector General?

00:40:12.932 --> 00:40:16.060
Was it to scrutinize the corruption
of high officials there?

00:40:16.143 --> 00:40:17.102
Or did you wish

00:40:17.603 --> 00:40:19.522
to seize the nobles of this country

00:40:19.605 --> 00:40:22.316
and stand above them?

00:40:24.026 --> 00:40:25.611
Perhaps that's what I should have done.

00:40:25.694 --> 00:40:27.696
You do not have the right

00:40:28.364 --> 00:40:29.532
to do that.

00:40:32.243 --> 00:40:34.453
Because I have never given it to you.

00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:38.207
Do not waste words on an animal.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.959
State its use.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.675
What do you think it is?

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.343
State Tribunal.

00:40:54.807 --> 00:40:55.808
The royal court?

00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:57.601
Is that it?

00:41:11.865 --> 00:41:13.409
Take everything to the State Tribunal.

00:41:13.492 --> 00:41:14.410
Yes, sir!

00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:17.913
What are you doing?

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.002
Tell me what this investigation is about.

00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:25.254
Then, I will submit the report
accordingly.

00:41:25.337 --> 00:41:26.547
You don't need to know.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:27.840
It's confidential.

00:41:31.552 --> 00:41:32.595
Wrap it up by 4:00.

00:41:32.678 --> 00:41:33.679
Yes, sir.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:50.613
Gil-dong?

00:41:53.699 --> 00:41:54.783
Interesting.

00:41:59.496 --> 00:42:00.956
What's that procession over there?

00:42:01.707 --> 00:42:03.667
Gil-dong has died.

00:42:03.751 --> 00:42:05.753
People have been coming
to offer their condolences

00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:07.713
for over ten days now.

00:42:13.886 --> 00:42:15.054
Place it there.

00:42:17.222 --> 00:42:20.559
This is real money.
The beggars will take it.

00:42:20.643 --> 00:42:21.769
Let them.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.816
Gil-dong would've shared
what he'd received with the starving.

00:42:28.734 --> 00:42:29.693
A memorial?

00:42:29.777 --> 00:42:32.613
It's taking place in the market.
Shouldn't you go?

00:42:33.947 --> 00:42:35.115
A memorial?

00:42:35.908 --> 00:42:39.328
Gil-dong does not deserve
something like that.

00:42:54.218 --> 00:42:56.011
I mean no disrespect to the dead,

00:42:56.345 --> 00:42:58.347
but I hope his great name and the rumors

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.807
will be buried with him.

00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:25.874
{\an8}DEAD

00:44:00.492 --> 00:44:03.537
CATCH GIL-DONG

00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:09.501
We both serve the State Tribunal,

00:44:09.585 --> 00:44:12.379
but you're a secretary,
and I'm an inspector.

00:44:12.463 --> 00:44:14.631
It's because your father
is the current Chief Secretary

00:44:14.715 --> 00:44:17.134
and mine's the former Director
of the Office of Royal Decree.

00:44:17.217 --> 00:44:18.510
That's not what it is.

00:44:18.969 --> 00:44:20.637
I placed first in the exam,

00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:23.056
and you got that position
through family connection.

00:44:25.058 --> 00:44:26.894
Why do we keep going in circles here?

00:44:27.478 --> 00:44:30.647
I want to see what the Grand Prince
of this country looks like

00:44:30.731 --> 00:44:31.815
before I go and fetch him.

00:44:32.441 --> 00:44:34.276
But he's been in his bedchamber for days.

00:44:34.359 --> 00:44:35.444
Now I want to see him more.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.279
Go and see him.

00:44:38.447 --> 00:44:39.823
You can just do it.

00:44:39.907 --> 00:44:42.451
Apparently, a secretary
of the State Tribunal is not permitted

00:44:42.534 --> 00:44:44.453
a free audience with the Grand Prince.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.876
He hasn't been going to the constabulary
these last few days?

00:44:51.543 --> 00:44:54.630
His Highness started reading
Four Books and Five Classics again.

00:44:54.713 --> 00:44:55.589
Four…

00:44:57.382 --> 00:44:59.718
He has not opened a single book
since he was ten.

00:44:59.801 --> 00:45:01.637
Could he be ill?

00:45:02.471 --> 00:45:04.890
It's not that he didn't read books,
he just pretended…

00:45:06.099 --> 00:45:08.894
I wonder if he only pretended

00:45:08.977 --> 00:45:10.604
that he didn't read, which is absurd.

00:45:12.523 --> 00:45:14.066
I shall look into his condition.

00:45:28.413 --> 00:45:29.540
Does she look like her?

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.228
What are you doing here?

00:46:36.356 --> 00:46:39.109
Her Majesty the Queen Consort
is expected to arrive by noon.

00:46:39.192 --> 00:46:43.155
Until then, please remain here
and converse among yourselves.

00:46:43.238 --> 00:46:44.489
Yes, ma'am.

00:46:50.787 --> 00:46:52.914
It's been so long since we last met.

00:46:52.998 --> 00:46:54.583
It's lovely to see you all.

00:46:54.666 --> 00:46:55.792
Yes.

00:46:56.793 --> 00:46:57.753
Right.

00:46:58.337 --> 00:47:00.339
Let us offer comfort to Lady Shin.

00:47:00.422 --> 00:47:02.549
Her engagement is soon to be broken off.

00:47:03.634 --> 00:47:05.927
I told you it was a secret.

00:47:06.011 --> 00:47:09.473
In times of misfortune,
we must comfort one another.

00:47:09.556 --> 00:47:10.974
Oh, dear.

00:47:11.058 --> 00:47:11.892
What happened?

00:47:11.975 --> 00:47:13.477
You must be deeply upset.

00:47:15.312 --> 00:47:17.981
I'm fine.

00:47:18.065 --> 00:47:19.608
So, tell us.

00:47:20.233 --> 00:47:21.568
Why was it broken off?

00:47:21.902 --> 00:47:22.736
That's…

00:47:22.819 --> 00:47:25.197
If you can't explain yourself
in a situation like this,

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.074
all the blame will fall on you.

00:47:27.157 --> 00:47:29.242
People will say that you had another man,

00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:31.161
that you're unattractive

00:47:31.244 --> 00:47:33.955
or that your skin was flawed.

00:47:34.039 --> 00:47:34.956
Am I right?

00:47:39.211 --> 00:47:42.798
His Highness, Grand Prince Dowol, arrives!

00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:50.806
He's the Grand Prince?

00:47:51.348 --> 00:47:53.892
An engagement is a promise,

00:47:53.975 --> 00:47:55.686
not a vow that must never be broken.

00:47:56.311 --> 00:47:58.271
Just because a promise is broken

00:47:58.355 --> 00:48:00.065
does not mean there is wrongdoing.

00:48:01.817 --> 00:48:03.735
Pardon me
for interrupting your conversation.

00:48:04.277 --> 00:48:06.738
It was too irritating to simply pass by.

00:48:09.116 --> 00:48:11.493
It has been a while, Your Highness.

00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:13.120
Do you know me?

00:48:13.704 --> 00:48:16.748
We met the other day
at Her Majesty's residence.

00:48:16.832 --> 00:48:17.749
Well…

00:48:18.125 --> 00:48:19.584
I don't remember.

00:48:20.752 --> 00:48:21.962
I apologize.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:23.964
Not at all.

00:48:26.425 --> 00:48:29.010
Lady Hae-rim of the Shin family?

00:48:29.094 --> 00:48:30.929
Yes, Your Highness?

00:48:31.012 --> 00:48:32.264
If it would not trouble you,

00:48:32.347 --> 00:48:34.349
may I ask for a moment of your time?

00:48:35.684 --> 00:48:37.394
Were you addressing me?

00:48:47.654 --> 00:48:49.322
That was a classic folk-tale moment.

00:48:49.406 --> 00:48:52.492
Prince Charming coming to the rescue
when the heroine is in danger.

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:54.369
Pardon?

00:48:55.245 --> 00:48:56.788
So this is how it feels.

00:48:56.872 --> 00:48:57.956
I think I'm a natural.

00:48:59.082 --> 00:49:00.625
Maybe I should rescue more people.

00:49:02.294 --> 00:49:03.170
Pardon.

00:49:03.628 --> 00:49:05.213
I guess you don't read folk tales much.

00:49:05.756 --> 00:49:07.758
No, I love them.

00:49:08.425 --> 00:49:10.051
The Tale of Seodong,
Princess Pyeonggang,

00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:13.013
The Pheasant, The Tale of Sukhyang,
Yi Chunpung, Kim Sangseo…

00:49:13.096 --> 00:49:14.306
The Tale of Kim Sangseo?

00:49:14.389 --> 00:49:16.224
That's a really rare book.

00:49:16.308 --> 00:49:19.352
When Seolbing parted ways
with the man she was pledged to for life,

00:49:19.436 --> 00:49:20.896
I cried my eyes out.

00:49:22.189 --> 00:49:25.358
When Seolbing was reborn
and returned to his house,

00:49:25.734 --> 00:49:27.402
I screamed in joy.

00:49:27.486 --> 00:49:29.321
But the true charm of this book is that…

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:32.199
Seolbing leads a war to victory
disguised as a man!

00:49:32.741 --> 00:49:33.658
You're an avid reader.

00:49:33.742 --> 00:49:35.577
- You really enjoyed the book.
- Yes.

00:49:40.248 --> 00:49:42.125
Are you really the Grand Prince?

00:49:50.175 --> 00:49:51.635
Apparently, with this face.

00:49:51.718 --> 00:49:52.677
Surprising, isn't it?

00:49:56.848 --> 00:50:00.018
I didn't know Your Highness
was the Grand Prince.

00:50:00.519 --> 00:50:01.853
I apologize.

00:50:01.937 --> 00:50:02.896
Don't worry.

00:50:02.979 --> 00:50:04.815
I was just passing by.

00:50:05.398 --> 00:50:08.109
You seemed to be in trouble,
so I wanted to help you.

00:50:08.193 --> 00:50:09.736
Did I overstep?

00:50:10.487 --> 00:50:11.321
No.

00:50:12.614 --> 00:50:13.907
Your Highness stepped in

00:50:14.366 --> 00:50:16.743
at the right moment, to the right degree.

00:50:20.956 --> 00:50:23.625
Actually, I wanted to apologize to you.

00:50:24.876 --> 00:50:27.921
I stained your name,
though I did not mean to.

00:50:30.924 --> 00:50:32.717
Will you not ask what it was?

00:50:33.885 --> 00:50:35.178
I'm sure you will tell me

00:50:35.846 --> 00:50:37.597
when the right time comes.

00:50:39.975 --> 00:50:41.601
I appreciate your understanding.

00:50:41.685 --> 00:50:44.062
I will tell you everything in due time.

00:50:45.522 --> 00:50:46.606
Let go of me.

00:50:47.315 --> 00:50:48.942
I said, let go!

00:50:55.824 --> 00:50:56.867
Look who's here.

00:50:57.367 --> 00:50:58.535
Blast.

00:50:58.618 --> 00:51:00.287
We meet again.

00:51:01.872 --> 00:51:04.457
Are you acquainted
with Master Jae-i as well, Your Highness?

00:51:05.292 --> 00:51:06.251
Well…

00:51:06.334 --> 00:51:07.335
I…

00:51:09.212 --> 00:51:10.213
Your Highness?

00:51:14.676 --> 00:51:17.095
Now I get why you're here
dressed like that.

00:51:18.847 --> 00:51:19.973
It's a misunderstanding.

00:51:20.056 --> 00:51:21.975
You're a secretary of junior fourth rank.

00:51:22.058 --> 00:51:23.852
How dare you stand before the Grand Prince

00:51:23.935 --> 00:51:26.146
and not pay your respects?

00:51:26.229 --> 00:51:27.480
Shut your mouth.

00:51:27.564 --> 00:51:30.609
If I weren't wearing this face,
you'd be dead now.

00:51:33.945 --> 00:51:35.864
What is…

00:51:40.493 --> 00:51:42.996
I am Jae-i of the Im family,
a secretary of the State Tribunal.

00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:44.664
I pay my respects, Your Highness.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.463
Soon,

00:51:52.464 --> 00:51:54.174
we shall meet again.

00:52:00.305 --> 00:52:02.599
I must be on my way.

00:52:02.682 --> 00:52:04.142
I must keep my family under control.

00:52:05.226 --> 00:52:06.269
You, follow me.

00:52:13.151 --> 00:52:14.027
Stay here.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:15.570
Don't make it worse.

00:52:25.372 --> 00:52:26.247
Your Highness,

00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:27.832
is that man next to Hong-si…

00:52:49.062 --> 00:52:51.648
You proved yourself useful.

00:53:03.451 --> 00:53:04.369
Your Highness,

00:53:05.328 --> 00:53:08.331
Hong-si must have arrived
at the Chief Secretary's residence by now.

00:53:08.915 --> 00:53:10.208
Things will get more complicated

00:53:10.792 --> 00:53:11.710
if I intervene.

00:53:13.003 --> 00:53:14.379
It's better that I stay out of it.

00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:17.048
Stay out of it?

00:53:18.174 --> 00:53:21.553
I'm sure Hong-si will understand,
but it'll hurt her feelings.

00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:24.097
It will.

00:53:25.473 --> 00:53:27.225
She will certainly be beaten.

00:53:27.726 --> 00:53:30.770
Given that temper of his,
he could do something even worse.

00:53:31.604 --> 00:53:35.108
They will break all her limbs,
perhaps more.

00:53:40.155 --> 00:53:42.490
It seems your feelings have changed.

00:53:43.033 --> 00:53:44.075
Are you the same man

00:53:44.534 --> 00:53:47.245
who chased Hong-si's carriage
on her wedding day?

00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:51.875
I did?

00:53:52.584 --> 00:53:54.002
Did you forget?

00:54:00.508 --> 00:54:01.926
Because of the rain,

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.179
in case Hong-si's carriage tipped over,

00:54:04.888 --> 00:54:07.515
at every turn of the road
the bridal carriage would pass,

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:12.187
you had dry sand, straw
and gravel laid out.

00:54:12.687 --> 00:54:15.148
That's no different
from chasing the carriage.

00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:18.693
You were deeply concerned

00:54:18.777 --> 00:54:21.821
about how upset she would be
if her silk shoes got wet.

00:54:23.156 --> 00:54:24.699
Seriously, what is wrong

00:54:25.283 --> 00:54:26.534
with your lord?

00:54:26.618 --> 00:54:28.411
You were so worried

00:54:28.495 --> 00:54:32.123
that the bridal carriage
might sway or tip over.

00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:35.794
Give me a break.

00:54:37.587 --> 00:54:39.172
What am I to do now?

00:54:51.226 --> 00:54:52.435
Are you going to Hong-si?

00:54:52.977 --> 00:54:53.895
Dae-chu,

00:54:53.978 --> 00:54:55.688
bring a horse from the Royal Stables.

00:55:00.068 --> 00:55:01.778
From here, go in on your own.

00:55:03.029 --> 00:55:05.198
I've been wondering something
the whole way.

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.201
Why are you so angry, Grandchild?

00:55:08.743 --> 00:55:09.577
What?

00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:11.746
I hate to say this again,

00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:15.125
but you're acting
like this woman's husband.

00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:17.001
Did you forget? It's to keep my family--

00:55:17.085 --> 00:55:18.169
I know.

00:55:19.671 --> 00:55:21.214
But it sounds like an excuse to me.

00:55:32.892 --> 00:55:34.727
When you look at me,

00:55:34.811 --> 00:55:36.396
I see turmoil in your eyes.

00:55:41.401 --> 00:55:42.735
What are you trying to do?

00:55:43.236 --> 00:55:45.446
I'm trying to say nothing should be done.

00:55:47.699 --> 00:55:48.783
This is a warning.

00:55:51.035 --> 00:55:52.162
Sir.

00:55:53.872 --> 00:55:56.082
The Chief Secretary
orders you to come at once.

00:55:57.625 --> 00:55:58.710
Go.

00:55:58.793 --> 00:56:00.795
It seems like your father
needs you urgently.

00:56:13.725 --> 00:56:16.436
That wretch's gaze towards me
is thick with desire.

00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:20.481
Has he been harboring those feelings
all this time?

00:56:21.649 --> 00:56:22.859
Whatever it is,

00:56:22.942 --> 00:56:25.320
he'd better not try anything with me.

00:56:27.614 --> 00:56:28.531
Eun-jo.

00:56:29.032 --> 00:56:29.949
Eun-jo.

00:56:31.034 --> 00:56:33.703
Your Young Master was waiting for you
for quite some time.

00:56:35.205 --> 00:56:36.080
Is that so?

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:01.814
What is this?

00:57:01.898 --> 00:57:03.816
They seem like soldiers
from the State Tribunal.

00:57:04.525 --> 00:57:06.194
What's this about? Make way.

00:57:16.538 --> 00:57:17.664
We meet again,

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:19.624
Your Highness.

00:57:24.587 --> 00:57:26.839
He could have waited a little longer.

00:57:26.923 --> 00:57:28.508
He didn't even have a little patience.

00:57:30.718 --> 00:57:32.512
I'm so tired.

00:57:40.937 --> 00:57:42.021
Who are you?

00:57:45.275 --> 00:57:46.609
Are you Gil-dong?

00:57:49.445 --> 00:57:50.613
As of this moment,

00:57:50.697 --> 00:57:54.617
Your Highness is under arrest
for freeing the murderer Gil-dong.

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.023
What's happening?

00:58:39.996 --> 00:58:40.997
I'm back.

00:58:44.417 --> 00:58:45.752
I'm finally back…

00:58:50.131 --> 00:58:51.341
Does this mean

00:58:51.841 --> 00:58:53.259
Hong Eun-jo is now…

00:58:57.555 --> 00:58:58.640
Who are you…

00:58:59.432 --> 00:59:00.725
Dae-chu, the sword.

00:59:07.065 --> 00:59:08.066
Your Highness!

00:59:58.324 --> 01:00:00.535
{\an8}There has never been such a thing

01:00:00.618 --> 01:00:04.330
{\an8}as a royal siding with thieves!

01:00:04.414 --> 01:00:05.998
{\an8}You look like you're about to confess.

01:00:06.082 --> 01:00:08.876
{\an8}I should've unmasked him
and checked his face first.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.130
{\an8}Then, I would've been able to protect you
without all this trouble.

01:00:12.213 --> 01:00:13.881
{\an8}Why are you so twisted?

01:00:13.965 --> 01:00:15.383
{\an8}I was just worried…

01:00:15.466 --> 01:00:17.301
{\an8}Don't make me care

01:00:17.385 --> 01:00:19.137
{\an8}about this damned family.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.681
{\an8}Hong Eun-jo is a married woman.

01:00:21.764 --> 01:00:23.808
{\an8}It seems you don't quite understand
the situation.

01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:26.561
{\an8}So it must be turned back.

01:00:26.644 --> 01:00:28.646
