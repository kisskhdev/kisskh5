[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.229
[Episode 20]

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.500
You just

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.900
criticized our County Finance Department

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:47.789
for irregularities

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:48.870
in fund usage.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.310
I accept that.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.500
But the root cause

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.039
is not

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.590
our cadres acting rashly

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.780
or selfishly.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.960
It is out of necessity.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.120
I believe

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.560
our comrades in the county

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.090
are dedicated to the public

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.670
and can withstand any investigation.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.680
Director Zhang.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.730
What do you say?

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.870
Okay.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.410
The Municipal Economic Commission

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.740
will use this survey's findings

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.380
to draft support policies
as soon as possible.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.260
The Municipal Planning Commission

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.460
will also quickly review

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.410
relevant

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.010
approval matters

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.870
and offer full support.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.870
Thank you all

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.560
for your concern and support.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.680
It is a fact that the local level

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.820
faces many difficulties.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.260
But we can't just

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.690
because of difficulties

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.590
violate discipline.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.829
Comrade Chen Cheng

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.290
and Comrade Lin Peisheng,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.840
regarding the issues mentioned above,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.090
you must submit a profound self-criticism

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.810
to the city government soon.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.000
I think this survey

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.820
has been very significant.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.130
I also hope

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.440
that Mazhi County's future work

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300
will be more efficient

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.760
and compliant.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.620
Good.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.710
Vice Mayor Zhao.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.180
There is one more thing

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.440
I need to report to you.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.740
Okay.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.940
Go ahead.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.079
We...

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.200
Let me say it.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.220
I'll say it.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.960
I've been handling

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.280
this matter,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.170
so I can explain it more clearly.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.190
Last winter,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.750
Mazhi County

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.090
experienced

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.410
5 heavy snowfalls.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.040
Accumulated precipitation

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.300
was 19.4 millimeters,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.640
causing a moderate snow disaster.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.990
The snow-covered area

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.030
in the county reached

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.560
12,000 square kilometers.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.350
Two animal husbandry townships

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.010
were severely affected.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:56.990
Therefore,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.730
the County People's Congress

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.260
proposed
an animal husbandry tax exemption.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.190
We hope

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.940
that the higher tax authorities

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.990
can grant

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.480
a three-year exemption.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.580
This would

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.980
give the herdsmen

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.910
time to recover.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.670
We also earnestly request

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.560
the higher-level finance department

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.760
to provide our county

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.700
additional targeted financial subsidies.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.870
We also know

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.330
that if

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.430
a long-term exemption

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.740
is difficult,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.040
then a short-term exemption,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.659
like for 6 months first and then a year,

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:35.520
will also work.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.580
Chief Song.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.010
You need to take

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.140
this tax reduction matter seriously.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.740
Regarding the animal husbandry tax issue

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.270
raised by County Mayor Lin,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.180
the County Local Taxation Bureau

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.840
has already reported it to us.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.590
We are also actively communicating

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.670
with the provincial bureau.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.370
Chief Song.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.010
I know

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.280
this is difficult.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.680
But the animal husbandry tax

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.280
affects two ends of the line.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.480
One end is the herdsmen's burden,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.220
and the other

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.860
is the operation
of the County Finance Department.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.430
But in the 2 animal husbandry townships

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.190
hit hardest by the disaster,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.870
the herdsmen have lost

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.400
over half their livestock.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.400
Some households
have barely any livestock left—

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.000
less than one in ten remains.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.390
Following that,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.390
medical care,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.750
schooling,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.980
and other safeguards

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.870
will fall apart.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.350
In our county's

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.060
primary and middle schools,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.110
12 students have already

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.360
dropped out to work.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.650
Teachers went to the herdsmen's homes

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.980
to persuade the children.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.530
They wanted to bring them back.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.990
The children want to come back
to school too.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.080
But their families are in dire straits.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.210
Please understand, leaders.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.410
It's not just that the county

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.180
wants to reduce the tax burden.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.940
Mainly, after this snow disaster,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.010
although herdsmen have received subsidies,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.070
it still takes time

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.430
to replenish the cattle and sheep.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.660
So,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.860
here,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.250
I implore the Vice Mayor

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.840
and all department leaders

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.240
to look into this quickly

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.080
and handle it as a special case.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.560
Regarding the animal husbandry tax,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.290
the fiscal and tax departments

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.550
must appeal to the higher authorities

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.530
and report to
the Provincial Local Taxation Bureau

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.100
and the Department of Finance again

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.700
to strive for
the maximum possible reduction.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.210
Yes.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.010
In addition,

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.460
our government departments

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.480
must mobilize

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.950
to raise funds

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.340
and urgently allocate some livestock

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.200
to the animal husbandry counties

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.010
for the affected herdsmen.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.720
We must quickly

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.890
restore the livestock numbers.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.570
That is the way

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.010
to cure both the symptoms
and the root cause.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.010
What do you think?

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.520
Right.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.870
Right.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.370
Yes.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.110
Thank you.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.820
Thank you, Vice Mayor.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.070
On behalf of Mazhi County's

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.570
26,000 cadres and people,

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.870
I thank you, Vice Mayor,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.260
and all the leaders for your support.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.860
Thank you.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.730
Secretary Chen.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.130
Vice Mayor Zhao, goodbye.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:50.690
Goodbye.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.909
County Mayor Lin.

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:53.570
Vice Mayor,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.710
have a safe journey.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.780
You've got guts.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.470
Come on.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:07.860
Good work.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.390
Goodbye.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.130
Lin.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.620
You're starting to look like
your old self.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.230
The County Mayor on horseback.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.789
Cairen,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.570
how are you?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.250
County Mayor Lin, you're here.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.039
You're busy.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.110
I'll go pour some tea.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.770
Rest a bit.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.870
Thank you.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.320
Cairen.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.920
Not at all.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:00.630
Here.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.330
Have some tea.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.790
County Mayor Lin.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.830
You really have guts.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.680
Are you mocking me?

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.030
Don't pull

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.270
such a long face.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:18.730
Here.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.410
The leader was praising you.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.410
It's a good thing.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.200
I hope so.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.980
If you were so scared,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.360
why did you fight to speak at the meeting?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.170
You could have just let me do the talking.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.030
Wouldn't that have been better?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.840
Let you speak?

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.640
I was afraid you

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.900
would screw things up.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.580
With your big mouth,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.200
right from the start,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.720
you would take shots at the Vice Mayor.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.450
You even said

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.510
that all comrades
in the County Party Committee

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.270
can withstand any investigation.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.030
Aren't you afraid
the Discipline Inspection Commission

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.290
will actually send someone?

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.150
I'm not afraid.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.390
Why?

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.890
Can't you withstand an investigation?

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.290
You're the one who can't.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.500
I'm just afraid of the trouble.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.570
One trouble like you in the county

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.170
is enough.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.620
Lin.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:01.720
When the municipal funding

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.080
comes through,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.600
you have to leave some for us.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.580
The Mountain Patrol
is self-funded and self-supporting.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.810
The County Party Committee decided this.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.470
You can't back out on this now.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.050
Then that 100,000
from the Department of Forestry,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.310
you have to give it back to us.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.750
That should have been ours long ago.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.630
90,000.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:19.700
Fine.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:20.890
90,000.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.700
By the way,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.150
tell Danzhou

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.000
to stop going out for mineral exploration
these days.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.060
It's too dangerous in the mountains.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.800
There you go again.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.510
I'm serious.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.670
Last time we went into the mountains,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.130
we ran into

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.790
a fairly large criminal gang.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.150
They were different from those poachers

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.530
and fossickers.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.420
Duo, I've been thinking a lot lately.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.110
What year

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.330
did we meet?

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.170
1979?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.000
1978.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.310
The year of the Third Plenary Session
of the 11th Central Committee.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.310
You had just graduated

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.570
and were assigned here

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.670
to reconstruct the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.500
At that time,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.100
I was the deputy director
of the Quduo Commune.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:14.870
I sent you guys

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:15.910
over a dozen yaks.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.880
Right, right.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.500
1978.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.950
For the first time in human history,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.150
in a high-altitude permafrost region,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.430
asphalt pavement was laid.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.130
How high did we need to build

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.170
the roadbed

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.100
to protect the permafrost

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.740
from the ground heat?

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.830
What kind of

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.720
drainage facilities were needed

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.520
to prevent surface water

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.980
from eroding the roadbed?

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.770
There was no international experience

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.550
to refer to.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.750
Every day,

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.080
I followed my mentor,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.130
doing surveys,

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.210
conducting experiments,

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.430
and supervising construction.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.480
We were up to our ears in work.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.680
Back then,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.890
during breaks,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.010
I went to a nearby temple

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.010
to ask for some tea

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.370
and chat with the old Lama there.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:10.670
I said,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200
"I'm sorry

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.460
about all the clanging and banging
every day,

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.460
really sorry for the disturbance."

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:19.860
The old Lama

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.050
gave me a Thangka.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.010
It was painted by his disciple,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.940
Gyatso.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.720
Gyatso froze to death

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.250
on his pilgrimage to Lhasa.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.910
The old Lama held my hand and said,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.120
"Young man,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.880
what you are building is not a road.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.750
It's Gyatso's prayer wheel,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.530
Lhamo's medicine chest,

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.890
and the textbooks in Dondrup's schoolbag

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.930
that won't be ruined

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.060
by snow water."

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.750
In 1985,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.800
the Qinghai-Tibet Highway's

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.060
blacktop pavement was fully completed.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.380
I chose to stay here.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.340
And I've stayed for over 10 years.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.740
That Thangka

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.210
is still

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.300
hanging in my home,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.860
reminding me constantly

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.100
that this is the meaning of development.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.500
Duo, I've been here for over 10 years.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.100
The average life expectancy
in pastoral areas

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.360
has risen from under 55

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.140
to over 60.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.320
The youth illiteracy rate

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.660
has dropped from over 60%

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.190
to 20%.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:29.480
This is the change

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.140
development has brought
to the pastoral areas.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.560
I know.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.190
You came up to the plateau

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.790
and did so many good things.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.240
Then why are you standing in our way

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.930
and forbidding us

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.060
from doing all this?

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.980
Do you want to go back
to pre-liberation times,

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.580
back to a primitive society?

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.000
I came to see you today

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.360
because there are some things

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.020
I couldn't say at the meeting.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.010
Do you think

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.750
I'm setting up
the Economic Development Zone

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.840
just to build my record

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.840
and get promoted?

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.380
Others might think that of you.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.980
But I don't.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.000
I know

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.220
your feelings for the Tibetan people

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:09.940
are real.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.750
Thank you.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.270
But after all,

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.470
you are not from here.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.940
Sooner or later,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.720
you will be transferred

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.920
and leave this place.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.510
But my home is here.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.670
I won't leave.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.550
Duo, do you think

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.340
I have no affection

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.200
for this land?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.530
Yes.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.690
I wasn't born here.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:39.720
But I have lived here

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.130
for over 10 years.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.460
This place is actually

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.520
the same as my home.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.070
It's not the same.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.920
This isn't just the home of the herders

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.220
and the Mazhi people,

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.570
but also the home of the Tibetan antelope

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.070
and all wild animals.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.670
They can't speak.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.660
They won't file reports to you.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.900
If we do it your way

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.980
and develop

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.900
everywhere

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.100
in Mazhi,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.900
in 100 years,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.530
we will be gone,

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.950
and the Tibetan antelope and wild animals

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:17.880
will be gone too.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.890
Qinghai's sacred mountains and holy lakes

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:20.750
will be gone.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.720
Whose home will this be then?

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.980
The construction of the development zone

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.100
must proceed.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.490
I won't give up halfway.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.610
I still insist on the idea

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.870
of building a reserve.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.800
County Mayor Lin,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.260
won't you stay for dinner?

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.550
Hello, Ms. Kang.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.990
Director Zhang.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.370
Okay.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.390
Mom, you're back.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.080
Cooking?

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.370
Almost done.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.670
Why are you home?

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:58.910
Didn't you go check out

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.820
the storefront today?

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.870
How did it go?

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.670
Why the silence?

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.720
Why the long face?

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:14.040
Bai Chun.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.609
The work assignment came through?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.119
Yes. Victory Saltworks.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.349
Victory Saltworks?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.680
Is there such a place in our county?

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.740
I think I've heard of it.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.400
Mom,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.380
don't you remember?

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.220
When I was in middle school,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.180
a classmate's dad came for treatment.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.430
He didn't pay with money or meat,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.690
but gave 2 bags of salt.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.440
After that, our hospital

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.900
didn't buy salt for a year.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.170
Right, right.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.550
He was

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.050
from the Victory Saltworks.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:41.960
I remember now.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.680
That's really far.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.140
Almost 300 kilometers.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.800
It takes 10 hours to get there.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.750
When do you leave?

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.500
They said in about 2 weeks.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.330
A car will come to pick me up then.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.180
Bai Ji.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.910
Serve the noodles.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.510
Mom.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:10.900
Taste it.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.330
I used my own rendered lard.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:21.240
Here.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:24.740
Chun.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.920
You're such an excellent soldier.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.320
How could you be assigned

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:29.920
to a place like that?

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.250
I think there must be a mistake.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:32.850
Mom,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.890
why don't you

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.580
go ask Uncle Lin?

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.860
Ask what?

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.570
For us demobilized soldiers,

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.420
this

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.900
is the placement policy this year.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:42.950
Anyway,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.540
it's a state-run factory.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.070
It's a formal job.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.850
If you ask Mom to ask Uncle Lin,

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.070
what can he do?

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.570
Find me a unit separately?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.280
What would others think?

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.030
But you've earned merits

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.550
and are a Party Member.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.480
The leaders said

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.050
it is to improve

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.530
the quality of the saltworks staff

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.420
that they decided on

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.190
this plan.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.790
If you ask me,

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.570
you shouldn't go.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:12.920
Just run the restaurant here with me.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.620
It's much better than some saltworks.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.120
It's a market economy now.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.700
Look at my sister and brother-in-law.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.210
They

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.350
would rather sleep on the floor

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.610
to be their own bosses.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.350
You were in the army

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.460
training for so many years.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.800
If you go to the saltworks,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.130
what skills can you use?

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.450
Besides,

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.880
you haven't been home for years.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.730
You should stay and keep Mom company.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:34.390
Look at you.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.220
You'll be sent

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.770
300 kilometers away again.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.930
Who knows how long it'll be

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.930
before you visit?

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:40.910
Bai Ji.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.770
The army is the army.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.290
Civilian life is different.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.220
No matter how well your brother did
in the army,

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.650
that page has turned.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.060
The saltworks job is stable.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.000
You can go there.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.930
Your brother wants to open a shop.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.200
If you want to help him

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.570
and become a partner,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.970
I'll support you as well.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.250
In the end,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.080
how you take this step

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.760
is up to you.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:14.950
The Chief said

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.030
the Public Security Brigade
wants to transfer you back.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.790
I haven't finished investigating

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.600
my current case.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.860
I can't transfer back.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.530
Young lady,

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.910
you must have a goal.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:25.640
Your goal is not

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.220
to stay with the Mountain Patrol

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.080
forever, is it?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.820
My goal

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.230
is to clear up the case

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.160
at hand.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:41.540
I can't eat anymore.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.560
Eat more.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.030
I'm afraid I'll end up like you.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.090
I won't eat either.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.010
You said it.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.470
Don't ask to borrow meal tickets at noon.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.250
You're acting like a stranger.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.180
Like a stranger.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.250
[I don't know him.]

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.380
[Guo Shun from the town's repair shop
fixed their driver's car once.]

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.660
[I know Guo Shun. I heard about it
from him when we were talking.]

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:24.630
[Where did you get
your gold mining tools?] [From Guo Shun.]

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:34.480
Oh, Guo Shun.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:35.610
You're like a big pot

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.570
trying to cram everything

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.500
into your mouth.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.840
Guo Shun,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.610
do you think no one in Mazhi County

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:41.570
knows you?

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.480
[Guo Shun]

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.840
Mr. Luo.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:55.950
Can I see

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.180
Guo Shun's case file?

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.190
Guo Shun's case file?

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.400
That case was closed

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.420
a long time ago.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.510
The shop was closed too.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.800
I want to take another look.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.260
It's related to the case
I'm investigating.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.020
That's not right.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.730
This case involves

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:18.990
your brother.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.340
You're a related party.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.590
You can't see it under regulations.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.320
You need to report to the Chief.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.480
I'll just take a peek.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.040
You can watch me.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.400
It'll be quick.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.600
Don't tell the Chief.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.840
Well, well.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.780
Mr. Luo.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.110
This chocolate is delicious.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.310
It's sweet but not too rich.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.940
Taste it.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.170
Have one.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.010
It's pitch black.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.140
I can tell it's no good just by looking.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.870
This shop bought a lot of

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.500
sheepskins from poachers.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.720
He likely had

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.110
connections

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.530
to a major poaching gang.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.240
Yeah.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.030
Didn't your brother

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.190
go in with them?

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.800
You're way off topic.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.480
I'm saying what's strange is,

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.270
at his shop, not only sheepskins,

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.360
explosives, and bullets—

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.750
the usual evidence in such cases—

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.030
were found,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.610
but his ledgers

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.740
also showed

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.520
he resold mercury.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.720
What is this for?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.510
Not sure.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.530
It's illegal anyway.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.780
The copper factory

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.510
that illegally bought the mercury

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.570
was also shut down.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.520
What did this factory

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.630
use mercury for?

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.180
To make silver-plated crafts.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.120
150 kilograms.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.160
The numbers don't add up.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.810
Look.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.590
The copper factory claimed

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.770
they bought 150 kilograms of mercury.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.880
It was shut down in less than a week.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.460
Given this fact,

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.350
we only found

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.310
50 kilograms.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:17.970
That factory couldn't use

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.720
100 kilograms in a week.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.250
So where did the rest go?

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.570
They said it was lost.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:23.250
I guess they were not

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.310
telling the truth.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.990
Can a book tell you

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.410
where that mercury went?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.730
I think mercury can be used
to refine gold.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.770
Stop wiping.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.250
Ju.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.370
It's clean, right?

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.200
If you keep wiping it like this every day,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.750
my car paint

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.990
is going to rub off.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.950
Then tomorrow,

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.450
I'll clean the inside.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.920
Ju.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.740
How's the case going?

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.020
Are you my leader?

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.480
Do you want me

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.880
to write a report for you?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.960
No, no need.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.000
Get in!

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.010
Okay!

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.610
That mountain ahead,

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.470
when was that big pit blasted out?

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.160
While you were away these past few years.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.210
I didn't notice.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.660
It's a quarry now.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.510
The mountain from our childhood

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.370
looked better.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:40.830
I could also say

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.660
the firecrackers from our childhood

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.390
were louder.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:43.930
My childhood friends

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.940
all envied me

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.620
for having a brother like you.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.770
What's there to envy?

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:50.250
Back then,

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.140
among us kids,

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.140
you were the tallest,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:52.940
the fastest,

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.000
and the best fighter.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.460
How could they not envy me?

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.310
Too bad none of that matters.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:25:59.220
When you grow up,

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.620
nobody cares about that.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:06.770
Chun.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.870
Let's run a restaurant together.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.830
You gave me all your money.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.610
This restaurant

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.410
should rightfully be yours too.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.250
Besides,

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.910
if you're there,

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.780
I'll feel much more at ease.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.890
Then in the future,
I want not only a salary

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:27.890
but also a bonus.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.180
That goes without saying!

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.980
Of course!

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.720
You promised.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.180
No going back on your word.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.380
But with Mom,

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.090
I feel like

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:37.940
she still hopes

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.510
I can have a stable job.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.570
I'm afraid she...

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.520
Wrong.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.380
Mom is much more open-minded than you.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.010
I guarantee

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.330
she'll definitely support you.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.110
Besides,

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.650
if you go to the saltworks,

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:48.470
and if you can't find a girlfriend,

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.830
Mom will be even more upset about it.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.290
I didn't think about that.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.740
Stop pretending.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:53.890
It's settled then.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:54.570
You stay here.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.030
Tomorrow, the two of us

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.950
will go check out shop locations together

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.750
and try to lock down a spot first.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:00.770
Okay.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.220
Rest, Chun.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:02.940
I'll do it.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.940
Is anyone there?

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.200
Open the door!

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.010
Is anyone there?

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.100
Open the door!

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.760
[Mazhi County Xinhua Copper Factory]

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.500
Ju.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.670
Watch me.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.690
Is anyone there?

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.240
Open the door!

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.120
Who is it?

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:30.680
Police!

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:31.770
Open the door!

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.570
Officer Bai.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:40.880
I really don't know anything

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.480
about this mercury business

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.030
you mentioned.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.620
Have some water.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.410
Aren't you the factory director?

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:49.670
How could you not know?

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:50.760
That was all

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.070
done by the previous director.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.670
He was caught and sentenced.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.400
Please sit.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:55.500
Back then,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.890
because there was a market
for silver-gilt copper Buddhas,

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.430
incense burners, and such,

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.190
the factory

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.660
thought about making some too

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.860
to make a bit of money.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.590
But

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:04.660
they didn't have the license
to buy mercury.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.180
So,

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.600
they went through some other channels...

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.200
This was

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.090
a huge mistake

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.490
and illegal, after all.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.110
In the end,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.530
a large fine was paid.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:15.650
The mercury

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:16.660
was also confiscated

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.730
by the police.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:18.860
The people responsible

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.990
were all sentenced.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.200
But I see

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.200
the number of seized mercury

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.330
doesn't add up.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:25.160
You brought in

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.140
150 kilograms.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.180
It was in a week's time.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.660
How much could you have used?

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.740
But we only found

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.680
50 kilograms.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.070
Where is the rest?

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.390
I really don't know.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.440
Anyway,

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.660
the fines were paid,

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.120
and the sentences served.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.830
Everything

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.490
was done according to the law.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.440
What is your factory

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.240
doing now?

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.030
We operate

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.660
legally now.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.400
No crooked business at all.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.700
Do you use mercury?

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.640
No, no, not at all.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.700
You must be joking.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.210
We wouldn't dare.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:55.680
Okay.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.460
Can I take a look

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.420
at your warehouse?

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.290
No problem.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.400
Look all you want.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.390
Watch your step.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.240
That's the situation

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.940
with the factory

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.140
now.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.720
Alright.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:09.750
Officer Bai,

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.330
I won't see you out.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.500
Thank you.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.220
Okay.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.590
Ju.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.330
Is there actually something wrong

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.460
with this factory?

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.500
There's nothing in the warehouse.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.260
It feels like this factory

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.390
is about to go under.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:31.570
The manager agreed so readily.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.390
I knew

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.220
we wouldn't find anything.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.390
What is mercury used for anyway?

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.870
It has many uses.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:38.790
Anyway,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.440
it's used for refining gold.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.140
What's wrong?

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.270
Do you know that man?

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.770
He looks familiar.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.050
But I can't remember.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:06.770
Ju.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.450
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.910
I see some in the glove box.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.600
Just eat.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:16.780
I remember Shao Yunfei's

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.060
package

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.530
had a share for you.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.420
You're being greedy.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.180
I haven't touched my share yet.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.780
Then why are you eating mine?

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.250
I've never had

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.500
this before.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.190
It's my first time even seeing it.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.840
You make it sound like I've had it before.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.240
My brother hasn't had it either.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:52.380
If you keep holding it,

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.440
it's going to melt.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.250
Eat it.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.760
I have more if that's not enough.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.580
Thanks, Ju.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.770
Delicious.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.760
Ju, you're actually pretty nice.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.270
You just realized?

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.790
You just have a sharp tongue.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:14.350
Spit the chocolate out

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.950
right now.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.830
Look, look.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.740
Just like that.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:20.010
Ju.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.700
Once I find my brother,

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.010
I'll do

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.030
whatever you ask.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.570
Come on.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.730
I just have one request.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.940
Don't go to the Uninhabited Zone anymore.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.590
I won't.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.020
I want to take my brother

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.110
to a big city.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.550
I want to work

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.280
to support his studies.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.890
My sister is in Guangzhou.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.240
If you want to work later,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.480
I'll ask my sister for you.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.240
Really, Ju?

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.400
But if you don't behave,

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.660
I'll have her beat you.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:02.550
What's wrong, Ju?

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.700
What's wrong?

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.610
Hold on!

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.640
Sit tight!

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.830
Stop the car! Stop now!

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:11.550
Stop!

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.480
Stop!

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.310
Ju!

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:03.680
Ju!

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:05.110
Ju!

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.630
Is anyone there?

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:11.830
Help!

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.880
Ju!

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.090
Ju!

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.790
Ju, wake up!

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:36.700
Ju!

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.090
Ju!

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.310
Help!

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.400
Is anyone there?

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:57.740
Is anyone there?

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.440
Is anyone there?

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.300
Help!

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.610
Stop the car!

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.920
Stop the car! Stop the car!

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.250
Stop the car! Help!

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.110
Help!

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:20.510
Captain.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.040
Captain.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.000
County Mayor Duo.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.730
How are they?

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.470
Bai Ju is out of danger.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.300
Zhang Yang is still in critical condition.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.170
What exactly happened?

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.360
County Mayor Duo,

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.170
based on the preliminary investigation

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:32.470
of the accident scene,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:33.330
this

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.510
is a hit-and-run case.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.250
This is definitely not
just a traffic accident!

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.300
How can there be 2 traffic accidents

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.300
happening one after another?

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.150
Retaliation!

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.520
This is retaliation!

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.900
Zhacuo!

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.380
Officer,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.650
we can't just let this go!

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.310
Calm down!

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.260
Listen to me!

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.670
I understand

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:46.670
how you feel now.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.010
But the scene
is currently under investigation.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.960
There is no evidence to prove

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.230
whether it is intentional

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.920
or a hit-and-run.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:54.730
We just can't classify it yet.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.510
County Mayor Duo,

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:01.580
I hope you can

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.530
understand.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.050
How is Zhang Yang?

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.190
He has something to tell you.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.200
Go in and take a look.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:32.910
You're awake?

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.500
How do you feel now?

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.060
Are you dizzy?

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.730
You...

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.860
Me?

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.760
It's Shao Yunfei. I'm back.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.310
You're not dreaming.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.390
No, no, no.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.570
You can't. You can't.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.430
You can't move.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:04.730
Auntie said

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:05.480
you have a concussion

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.760
and need to rest well.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.420
My mom?

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.150
Auntie said

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.710
it's just superficial wounds.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.640
No broken bones.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.450
Where is Zhang Yang?

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.630
How is Zhang Yang?

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.730
You rest first.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.290
Rest up first, then I'll...

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:42.340
I came back this time

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.480
to do the follow-up series

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.210
of reports.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.090
Next, I might...

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:45.940
Shao Yunfei.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.860
I don't care

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.920
why you came back.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.590
Tell me,

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.650
how is Zhang Yang?

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.720
I think

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:08.670
Zhang Yang was a brave child.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:13.730
He wasn't brave at all.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:16.820
He just wanted to find

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.020
his younger brother.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.860
Last time we went into the mountains,

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.260
he told me

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.620
he was scared of those people.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.280
But he still went.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.420
Dad,

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.580
you must catch the murderer.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:38.780
I will.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:44.980
Why did those people

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.190
do that to him?

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.170
How could they be so cruel?

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.460
Sometimes, the kinder you are,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.460
the crueler people are to you.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.110
Is this why you need to carry guns

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.770
when entering the mountains?

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.240
I made a promise with Zhang Yang

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.070
to study hard

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.890
and go to college together.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.830
But I don't want to anymore.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.470
I want to join the Mountain Patrol

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.610
and go on patrol with you guys

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:26.170
to drive all those poachers

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:26.960
out.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.450
Actually, Zhang Yang...

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.080
His wish wasn't just

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.840
for you two to get into college.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.370
He wanted even more to go out there

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.070
with his brother

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.940
to see the outside world

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.970
and the people out there.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.760
Just like the promise

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.010
made by your mom and me

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.410
in front of your grandma.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.200
I have to do

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.530
my duty now.

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:16.400
And you,

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.300
you need to focus on
your studies right now.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.280
Get into college one day.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:24.760
Find something you love.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.160
And do more

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.310
meaningful things.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.000
Captain.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:50.420
Zhang Yang...

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.030
Did Zhang Yang

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:55.840
leave any last words?

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:01.510
In

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.460
the Uninhabited Zone,

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.280
the one who caught me

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.340
was him.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.480
Who?

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.340
It was...

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.360
was...

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.080
Who was it?

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:17.830
Zhang Yang.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.690
It was him.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.030
Who?

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.670
He didn't finish speaking

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:48.770
before he was gone.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.190
The person who caught him
in the Uninhabited Zone...

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.090
It must...

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.770
must have been someone from the gold mine.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:02.580
Did you encounter

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.580
anyone suspicious that day?
