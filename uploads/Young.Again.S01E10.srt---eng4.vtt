00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.079
Ms. Liu, slow down, Ms. Liu.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.799
Slow down, slow down.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.719
Slow down, Ms. Liu.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.840
What's wrong?

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.599
Boss Li.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.959
Ms. Liu is here.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.640
Ms. Liu is here.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.680
Where are you feeling unwell?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.159
Where am I feeling unwell?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.799
We're asking you.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.539
My whole body...

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.219
Whole body...

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:12.259
Whole body...

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.819
My head hurts.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.960
You have heads all over your body?

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.939
No, you mean a headache, right?

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.340
Here, let me take a look.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.580
Do you have a fever?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.460
Let's check the temperature.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.139
That feels much better.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.539
That feels much better.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.099
Ms. Liu, you have magic hands.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.900
No, his temperature isn't high.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.500
It's just...

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.219
Why is there so much cold sweat?

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.419
Exactly.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.699
Perhaps...

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.699
I was infected by Professor Fan.

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.900
I've been taking care of the patient non-stop these days.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.080
Maybe it triggered my...

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.659
old chronic insomnia...

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.259
and flared it up.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.300
Illness really comes like a landslide.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.500
Ms. Liu.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.780
I'm sorry about this.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.699
It's okay.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.740
This time...

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.500
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you again.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:07.500
It's fine.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:11.819
You really treat Ms. Liu like a professional caregiver.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.659
She took care of me because...

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.659
Right?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.740
As for you...

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:17.780
I think we should call...

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.580
Zhu Zhu and Yusheng to come take care of you.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.379
Or just have Dr. Chang send a male caregiver.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.259
Come back.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.539
Why is it that when you were sick,

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.580
you had Ms. Liu to take care of you?

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:28.979
But when I'm sick,

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.900
I get a male caregiver?

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.860
It's the same illness.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.860
I demand the same treatment.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.500
Old Li.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.900
It hasn't been confirmed it's the same illness yet.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:40.180
How about...

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.500
I go get Royal Physician Sun to take a look.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.819
No.

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.300
Such a minor illness...

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.939
shouldn't disturb Royal Physician Sun.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.659
I think...

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.900
Ms. Liu will do.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:58.740
Alright, then...

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.500
Open your mouth.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.020
Ahh.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.340
I can't make sense of this either.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.180
We should get a professional. Let...

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.259
Let Royal Physician Sun come...

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:10.900
and prescribe you some medicine or something.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.979
I said no need, so no need.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.339
Just take Professor Fan's...

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.139
leftover medicine...

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.980
give me two pills to try, that'll be enough.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.579
It'd be a pity to throw the leftovers away.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.100
I think...

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.660
I should just drink more water.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.800
Ms. Liu, could you...

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.019
get me some hot water?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.379
You want hot water, right?

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.980
I'll go pour it for you.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.339
No.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.860
Sister Cai.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.899
You just go about your business.

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:47.220
You've been working hard these days too.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:50.540
Managing a myriad of affairs is very exhausting.

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:53.779
We can't have you wearing yourself out.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.699
Then I'll pour it for you.

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:56.139
That's even less necessary.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.019
You just recovered.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.220
I might infect you again.

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:05.060
If we keep cross-infecting each other like this,

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.300
it'll be even worse.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:08.300
Then...

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.360
I'll go pour it for you.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.379
That's the way.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.100
Ms. Liu.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.220
Sorry to trouble you.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.259
You're welcome.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.819
Boss Li, you're something else.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.740
I just got over my illness and now you're sick.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.939
What's so strange about that?

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.100
If you can be sick, why can't I?

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.180
Ms. Liu already diagnosed me.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.740
A forehead full of cold sweat.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.379
Does Ms. Liu count?

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.540
For a diagnosis,

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.019
you need a professional, right?

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.420
That's right.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.579
What do you mean?

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.060
You don't trust Ms. Liu?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.660
Right.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.420
I don't trust myself either.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.540
Better get a professional.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.459
Summon Royal Physician Sun.

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:51.339
Yes, sir.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.779
Yusheng, Zhu Zhu, summon the Royal Physician!

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.259
Say no more. Come.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.579
Drink... drink some water.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.540
There's nothing wrong.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.339
Check a bit more carefully.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.060
Don't be careless.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:11.699
There isn't anything.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.459
No murmurs.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.980
No rales.

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:24.620
No abdominal bowel sounds.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.759
Lungs,

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.180
bronchi...

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:32.339
How can there be nothing wrong?

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:34.379
Listen to this.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.860
Sorry, Doctor.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.740
I'm sorry.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.220
What are you doing?

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:41.740
Alright.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:43.180
Nothing major wrong.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:44.620
No, wait.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.459
You can't be so hasty.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.060
You didn't even check my pulse.

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:48.980
No need.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.420
What's the point of checking the pulse?

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.100
Just making trouble.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.100
No...

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.699
Won't you leave some medical advice, Royal Physician?

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:59.139
Keep the diet light.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.339
Drink plenty of hot water.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.819
What kind of advice is that?

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:04.860
Who doesn't know to drink hot water?

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:08.540
This patient really does need to drink plenty of hot water.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.819
Because the human body

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:11.819
needs to flush out a lot of harmful substances.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:12.459
Right.

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:14.939
But do you really count as a patient?

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.339
Did you hear that?

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.420
I need to flush out harmful substances.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.699
Lots of them.

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:23.300
Hurry up and pour the water.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.860
Ms. Liu,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.339
please have a seat.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.939
Alright.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.259
Okay, I'll sit.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.740
Good.

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:38.060
Take it easy.

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:40.860
Slow down, it's hot.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.420
Slow down.

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:46.259
Want some more?

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:48.459
Tastes good.

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:51.740
It'd be sweeter with some sugar.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.139
Grandpa Li.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.420
You don't look like you have a cold to me.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:57.339
Looks more like you drank too much hot water.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.939
Exactly.

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:00.019
It's such a hot day.

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:01.220
You're chugging all this hot water.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.459
And wrapped in such a thick quilt.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.579
How could you not sweat?

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:04.259
Don't talk nonsense.

00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:05.180
What do you know?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.620
Ms. Liu even said...

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:08.540
But Boss Li...

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.819
You really don't look like you have a cold.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.939
Right. How about this...

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.420
Stand up and take two steps.

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:14.899
Right.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:16.100
You take two steps.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.540
Take two steps.

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:24.339
Take two steps.

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:25.180
Take two steps. Walk around.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.860
Can you?

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.019
Try it.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:27.620
Well...

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:28.660
Take two steps.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.620
Right, you take two steps.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.579
Here, take it slow.

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:31.819
Take it slow.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.460
Here, take it slow.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.740
I'll hold you. Come on.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.820
Look.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:42.580
Look, once you stand up...

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.059
You look perfectly fine.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.580
No, I mean, you clearly...

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.580
...are much better.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.700
If you ask me...

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:49.500
There's absolutely nothing wrong with him.

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:50.740
You said it.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.100
I think Grandpa Li should rest and cool off.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.100
He'll be skipping to the cafeteria in no time.

00:08:57.419 --> 00:08:58.620
I stood up!

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:00.379
That's amazing!

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.179
Ms. Liu.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.139
You've cured my illness!

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.860
You have a pair of magical hands!

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.580
No...

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.340
I...

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.100
I'm not that capable.

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:11.980
Really, you look fine now.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.340
Well then, you rest.

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:14.580
I'll be going back now.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.019
Wait...

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:16.720
I'm heading back to the dorm too.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.559
Bye, Grandpa Li.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.299
Ms. Liu, about my flowers...

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.740
I got them. Thank you.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:21.799
Flowers?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.159
What flowers?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.960
Old Li.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.960
Why are you standing there?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.120
You scared me.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.600
In the middle of the night, out of nowhere...

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.960
...you let out a yelp.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.399
You're the one who scared me.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200
What's so scary about me?

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.720
How are you not scary?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.200
It's pitch black here.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.120
You're standing there like a big stone monument.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.879
Who wouldn't be scared seeing that at night?

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:18.639
What stone monument?

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.879
A stone sculpture.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.080
Look at me.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.559
Don't I look like a...

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.600
...statue standing tall...

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:25.519
...against the wind?

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.120
Oh, give it a rest.

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:29.000
Old Li, in the middle of the night...

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:30.200
...why are you standing there?

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:33.600
You're reflecting on your behavior...

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.240
...from this afternoon, right?

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:37.120
Not bad.

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.440
I did reflect for a while.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:42.000
But after reflecting...

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:44.320
...I got insomnia.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.480
Insomnia?

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.480
You can try counting sheep.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.440
They say it works well.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:50.960
I did.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.840
I counted I don't know how many sheep.

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:54.480
The more I counted, the hungrier I got.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.519
I started craving hot pot mutton.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.360
Lamb skewers would work too.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.720
You want a midnight snack?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.120
Then don't think about sheep.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.200
Think about something else.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:02.700
I did.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.519
Playing ping pong...

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:04.559
...swimming and stuff.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.960
I thought about those too.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.639
Just now, while you were grinding your teeth, snoring...

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:10.440
...and smacking your lips...

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:13.320
...I went through the breaststroke...

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:15.080
...I learned in the army...

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.679
...freestyle...

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.399
...even the doggy paddle...

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.240
...I went through them all.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.519
It was no use.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.600
You're talking nonsense.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.519
Complete nonsense.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.879
I don't snore.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.320
How do you know you don't snore?

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:30.919
You've never shared a bed with anyone.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.279
How would you know you don't snore?

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.080
Anyway, I don't.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.279
You snore quite a lot.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.440
And it comes in waves.

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:38.200
You snore and snore...

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.759
...then you stop breathing.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.879
I even have to check...

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:43.159
...to see if you're breathing.

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:44.440
Scared you might die.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.120
That's sleep apnea syndrome.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.360
What is it?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.399
It's sleep apnea syndrome.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.559
You have this condition.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.879
It seems when people get old...

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:58.919
...having someone nearby is really important.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.200
Thank you, Old Li.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:01.519
What's there to thank?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.440
Just my luck to share a room with you.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720
Just have to put up with it.

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:22.159
Hello, Ms. Liu.

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:23.100
Morning, Ms. Liu.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.019
You're up so early.

00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:25.419
What early?

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:27.059
We didn't sleep at all.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:29.820
Why?

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:30.460
It's all because...

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.539
...Little Fan had insomnia last night.

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:33.820
I took care of him all night.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:36.299
What? Aren't you twisting the truth?

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:37.700
Clearly you had insomnia.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.259
I chatted with you all night, okay?

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.580
Clearly you had insomnia.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.340
I took care of him all night.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.379
Alright.

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:44.659
Is this worth arguing about?

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:47.899
You don't understand nursing; you might make it worse.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.779
Nursing is a job for us women.

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:50.460
In a bit...

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.820
...I'll go over and check on you guys.

00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:52.899
By the way...

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:55.700
...who was the one with insomnia?

00:12:56.299 --> 00:12:58.379
I... I had insomnia.

00:12:58.379 --> 00:12:59.340
You?

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.019
You fight me for food at meals

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:08.500
You fight me for water in the shower

00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:12.019
You fight me for the remote when watching TV

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.100
Now it's even better

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.580
You're even competing with me to be sick

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:20.019
You get jealous of everything you see

00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:21.500
What is wrong with you?

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.340
Who's competing with you?

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.059
Yesterday you copied me having a fever

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.899
Chugging hot water like crazy

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:27.539
Who was that?

00:13:28.299 --> 00:13:29.179
Enough

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.860
Didn't we agree?

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.059
We wouldn't expose each other's faults anymore

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:34.740
The one drinking hot water yesterday...

00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:37.980
That was just an isolated incident

00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:42.740
Don't you... with a sick person like me...

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.860
...keep pestering me unreasonably, okay?

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.100
I didn't sleep a wink all last night

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:50.019
Can't you cut me some slack?

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:50.820
Fine

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.019
I'll let you have your way

00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:54.580
But who's going to cut me some slack?

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.700
I also didn't sleep a wink all night

00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:58.220
Professor Fan

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.899
I know

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.220
To keep me company...

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:04.860
You also didn't sleep a wink all night

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:08.580
This fully shows how learned you are...

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.620
And highly respected

00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:13.340
Dedicating your heart and talent...

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.779
...to us, the older generation

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:20.220
You are the one I admire and respect most...

00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:21.860
The most lovable person

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:23.500
What I like is...

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.059
Stop right there

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:27.700
It's the exact same words...

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.740
But when you say them...

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:31.539
Why does it sound so awkward?

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.100
What's awkward about it?

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.460
So...

00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:37.379
I hope you keep up this style

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.899
And go to sleep like a good boy

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:41.820
So that Ms. Liu...

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:45.379
Can treat me with peace of mind

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.860
I knew you were up to no good when you praised me

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:49.980
I'm telling you, this time I'm just...

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.860
Not giving in

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.139
How can you be like this?

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:54.379
Why can't I?

00:14:54.379 --> 00:14:55.480
The business of insomnia...

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.019
Do you have a monopoly on it?

00:14:57.139 --> 00:14:58.740
So only you are allowed...

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.100
To play at having insomnia?

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:01.820
And I can't be unable to sleep?

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.580
People fight over titles and honors...

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:05.779
But fighting to get sick?

00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:07.320
Why should this doctor...

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.700
Be hogged by you alone?

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:09.580
You...

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:10.500
No...

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:11.879
How can you...

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:13.299
Be so unreasonable?

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.620
With you making such a fuss...

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.860
My head hurts even more

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.059
Although I have a history of insomnia...

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:19.899
It's not like I can have insomnia on command

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.700
This once-in-a-lifetime chance for me...

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.940
And you're fighting me for it?

00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:25.539
How about this...

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.179
Ms. Liu is one person

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.379
And there are two of us

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.980
Which patient she takes care of...

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:31.419
Depends on who is sicker

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:34.299
From now on, I declare...

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:35.620
I officially have insomnia

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.580
Who's afraid of whom?

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:37.980
From now on...

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:39.379
Officially insomnia

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.620
Wait, that's not right

00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:43.100
I started having insomnia yesterday

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.100
Boss Li, Professor Fan

00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:47.740
Which one of you actually has insomnia?

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.139
Me

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:49.419
I have insomnia

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.019
I can't sleep night after night.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.620
I can't close my eyes all night long.

00:15:58.299 --> 00:15:58.740
You...

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.580
Look.

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.419
Whenever I scroll through TikTok,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.379
I just...

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.899
get incredibly excited.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.899
I toss and turn in bed like a pancake.

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:09.379
Once I lie down, if I get up to use the bathroom,

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.940
I just want to grab a book

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:12.779
and sit on the toilet all night.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.440
I can't sleep at night.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.960
I have no energy during the day.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:19.399
I've lost my sleep.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.519
I treat the night like the day.

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.519
And the day like the night... and like the day too.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.460
Ms. Liu,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.379
look at my eyes.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.320
I look exactly like a panda.

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:31.440
These two big dark circles.

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:32.360
Ms. Liu,

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:34.879
look at my eyes.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.840
Whatever a goldfish looks like,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.000
that's what I look like.

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:38.200
Staring blankly,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.120
without blinking.

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:42.159
It seems you two old brothers

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.419
are quite ill.

00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:44.419
Who's brothers with him?

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.740
We have our own separate illnesses.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:46.620
But I...

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.139
I'm just one person.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.100
I can't take care of both of you.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.100
Oh my goodness.

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:53.500
Boss Li, Professor Fan.

00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:54.580
When I woke up this morning,

00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:56.139
I heard you two were sick.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.700
Oh, I was so worried.

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:01.299
I rolled over and fell right back asleep.

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:02.899
Look how that delayed things.

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:04.140
Ms. Liu,

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:06.220
if you need any help, just give a cough.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.819
You're just in time.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.660
What's wrong?

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.299
Ms. Liu,

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.420
this minor ailment of mine

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.779
is causing you so much trouble.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.099
I'm really embarrassed.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:23.940
Boss Li,

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:25.700
don't say that.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.819
You hold a high position,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.500
dominating the business world,

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.940
commanding thousands of troops,

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:34.099
creating immense wealth.

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:36.799
For the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.599
you've made such a huge contribution.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.839
I've always admired you the most,

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:46.400
such an influential figure.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.759
Really.

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:50.079
Ms. Liu, do you really

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.039
have such an opinion of me?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.559
I actually never felt it before.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.359
I was too careless.

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:04.359
Too confused.

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:06.599
Too slow-witted.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.839
But it doesn't matter.

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:12.960
We can start from now.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.440
Time's up.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.920
We agreed,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.960
switch every ten minutes.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:17.680
Time is up.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.680
Time to switch.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.359
Why should I?

00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:20.119
On what grounds?

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:21.640
It's barely been five minutes.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.799
Why switch now?

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:24.279
If you want to switch,

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:26.200
you have to wait for me to finish the story. Listen.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.079
Right at this critical moment,

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.240
one could hear from inside the coffin...

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:38.920
Someone is crying.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.799
Look at that coffin lid again.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.720
Alright.

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:48.920
Time's up. Switch.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.319
Old Fan.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.759
I think you should just hurry up and sleep.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.039
Sister Cai is telling such a wonderful story.

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:59.119
Isn't it just to coax you to sleep?

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:00.599
Once you fall asleep,

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.720
Sister Cai will naturally stop telling it.

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.039
I can't sleep.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.400
If I sleep,

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.039
she...

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:07.200
...they...

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.880
won't they all leave?

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:11.559
You just can't bear for me to leave, right?

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.799
I knew it.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.720
My story is so good.

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:18.640
Suspense, horror, mystery.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.119
This story of mine,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.079
"Red Braised Pork in the Morgue" is just captivating.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:23.680
Right?

00:19:23.759 --> 00:19:25.279
Listen to one part, you want two.

00:19:25.279 --> 00:19:27.200
The more scared you are, the more you want to listen.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.640
You don't want to sleep now, do you?

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.000
I'll continue telling you.

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:32.079
This coffin...

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.400
Okay.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.200
I beg you.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.519
I beg you, Sister.

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:36.160
Sister.

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:37.839
Even if I...

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:38.880
fall asleep,

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:40.400
I'd have fainted from your scare.

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:42.759
I'd have nightmares even in a coma.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.279
Tell it to Old Li.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.640
Tell it to Old Li.

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:46.799
That works too.

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:50.279
To know what happens next,

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:52.640
please listen to the afternoon chapter.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.000
Ms. Liu.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:54.920
Switch.

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:55.880
Okay.

00:20:01.599 --> 00:20:02.559
Professor Fan.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.200
Do you feel any better?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.359
As soon as you came over,

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:09.079
I felt much better.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:10.799
Boss Li.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.960
You've heard those old stories eight hundred times.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.160
You don't care to listen anymore, right?

00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:17.000
Let's try something original.

00:20:17.079 --> 00:20:19.279
I'll tell you one I just finished reading.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.000
Magical,

00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:22.240
horror,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.680
mystery novel.

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:26.440
"The Green Right Hand".

00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:28.720
Green...

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.920
and a right hand?

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.319
If you want a left hand, I have that too.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.599
No need.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.200
Boss Li, don't be polite with me.

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.880
Ms. Liu told me,

00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:41.400
you really love listening to stories.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.319
And not only do you listen,

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:44.640
you also love telling them.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.000
This is how you tell it:

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:47.960
Once upon a time there was a mountain.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.880
In the mountain there was a temple.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.039
In the temple there was a little ghost.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.359
It went into a coffin.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.480
*Creak creak*

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.440
Did I mix up the stories?

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:01.559
What did I do to deserve this?

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:02.279
Boss Li.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.000
I advise you to hurry up and sleep.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.759
Sister Cai is telling you such a wonderful story.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.559
Isn't it just

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.039
to make you sleep?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400
As long as you fall asleep,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.559
Sister Cai will stop.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:13.799
Sister Cai stops,

00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:15.480
and Ms. Liu stays with you permanently?

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.640
Dream on.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.839
Even if I'm sleepy,

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:20.039
I won't sleep.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.119
You...

00:21:21.359 --> 00:21:21.759
No...

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:22.319
You...

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.119
Ms. Liu.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.880
Is it that I don't tell stories well?

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:33.680
Just...

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.039
Boss Li and Professor Fan,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.759
the way they are now...

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.759
it's all because we didn't take good care of them.

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:43.759
And Sister Cai,

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:46.720
is being very enthusiastic helping out here.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.079
But she told a story...

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:57.160
Don't ask.

00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.240
As for me,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.119
I'm even worse off than her.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.400
It's okay, Auntie Liu.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.000
Regarding this issue,

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:14.839
it should have been our responsibility anyway.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.039
Please rest assured.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.039
I have

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.000
already contacted Yongfeng Nursing School.

00:22:19.519 --> 00:22:21.640
I asked them to send two

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.200
very professional,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.240
professionally trained nurses.

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:26.759
Don't worry.

00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:28.519
Boss Li and Professor Fan's illness

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:29.920
is now in professional hands.

00:22:30.519 --> 00:22:31.559
That's wonderful.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.839
From a professional nursing school?

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:38.240
Do they have nursing experience?

00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:39.240
Yes.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.839
Let me put it this way.

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:43.799
Washing feet,

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:44.460
scratching backs,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720
telling stories,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.559
singing lullabies...

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.920
they're experts at everything.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.599
Trust me.

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:50.799
The condition of the two elders

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:51.839
will improve very soon,

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:52.500
and they'll recover.

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:55.019
These nurses even

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.200
tell stories,

00:22:56.579 --> 00:22:58.079
sing lullabies.

00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:00.259
Tell.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.140
Sing.

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:06.359
The wind is quiet,

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:08.920
the moon is bright,

00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:15.140
leaves cover the window lattice.

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:21.660
Little baby, in your dreams,

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.420
smiling so sweetly.

00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:28.740
The two of them,

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:30.299
hand in hand,

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:31.980
just floating like this...

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.140
Floating...

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.180
floating right into the white clouds.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.500
Old Fan,

00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:46.819
are you sleepy?

00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:51.259
I wouldn't dare not be sleepy.

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:52.460
Otherwise I'll...

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.539
Don't talk.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.779
The wind is quiet, the moon is bright,

00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:05.299
leaves cover the window lattice.

00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:15.339
Got a bite.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.740
Here we go.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.980
Back to real life again.

00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:25.740
Life is so good.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.740
Health is the capital of the revolution.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.460
I've got a bite too.

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:33.220
I've got...

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:34.619
Up you go!

00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:37.259
What are you laughing at?

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.460
I think as long as we watch our health,

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.019
we can definitely still

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.220
live a happy life for another twenty years.

00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:46.380
Right.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.059
Money can't buy old-age...

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:50.339
suffering.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.220
Don't go looking for sickness when you're fine.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.980
Like chugging hot water to fake a cold.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.380
Alright.

00:24:57.579 --> 00:24:59.180
There you go again.

00:24:59.779 --> 00:25:02.099
Always harping on little things.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.220
Nagging on and on.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.420
Just like my late mother-in-law.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.059
Up you go!

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.660
Did she always care about your health too?

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.380
Care about my health? Yeah right.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.579
She was always exposing my faults.

00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:17.019
She...

00:25:17.339 --> 00:25:19.500
was resentful that I stole her youngest daughter away.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.460
She couldn't get over it.

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:22.099
Pretty much like your mindset right now.

00:25:22.779 --> 00:25:24.140
What mindset do I have?

00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:26.940
Aren't you watching me and Ms. Liu...

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.619
you know...

00:25:28.019 --> 00:25:28.500
Right?

00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:31.180
This time let's see where you

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.339
run.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:32.980
Up you go!

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.500
What on earth is this?

00:25:37.539 --> 00:25:38.339
Professor Fan,

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:40.140
help me out.

00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:41.299
What is this?

00:25:44.099 --> 00:25:45.500
Is this an antique?

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:47.779
Take a look.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.460
Is it Western Zhou or Eastern Zhou?

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.259
It's from last week.

00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:54.259
Last week, Gou'er Ye

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:55.700
threw away this chamber pot.

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:00.900
Why throw a chamber pot in here? Honestly.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.619
Old Fan,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.900
Ms. Liu

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.140
to me...

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.019
confessed her feelings.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.859
She revealed her true emotions.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.259
Said I

00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:16.740
am a business titan,

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:18.619
who commanded thousands of troops.

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:20.099
She also said

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.059
I contributed to the great rejuvenation

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:23.140
of the Chinese nation.

00:26:23.539 --> 00:26:24.220
You know,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.180
she said

00:26:25.539 --> 00:26:27.099
she admires people like me the most.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.460
Here we go.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.220
How did you catch another one?

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:36.619
Are you using base bait or texture bait?

00:26:36.859 --> 00:26:38.859
I'm afraid telling you would provoke you.

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:41.700
This is my own special mix.

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:43.700
Ms. Liu helped me mix it.

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:44.579
What?

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.259
No way.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.660
Absolutely impossible.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.779
I don't believe it.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.779
If you don't believe it, why are you nervous?

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:51.819
Who's nervous?

00:26:52.259 --> 00:26:53.779
What is there to be nervous about? Honestly.

00:26:55.019 --> 00:26:55.819
I've got another one.

00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:57.460
Up you go!

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.019
Gou'er Ye

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:20.019
You are the one I admire the most

00:27:24.019 --> 00:27:25.859
With no children

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.099
An old welfare recipient

00:27:28.779 --> 00:27:30.099
What's there to admire?

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:33.059
There is! So much!

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.019
Look at your life

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.019
Face to the earth, back to the sky

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.539
Sowing and tilling

00:27:39.059 --> 00:27:41.259
Without the hard work of you farmers

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:42.940
Where would our food come from?

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.740
It's you who fed our generation

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.619
So

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.859
You are the one I admire most

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.099
The most lovable person

00:27:57.579 --> 00:27:58.660
The most lovable

00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.900
Lovable

00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:03.099
My girl

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.980
I love hearing that

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.140
This medicine

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:09.900
I'll take it

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.380
Alright

00:28:12.099 --> 00:28:13.099
Open wide

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.579
Ah

00:28:15.259 --> 00:28:16.779
Grandpa Li, Professor Fan, hello

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.380
What are you two doing here?

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.420
Eavesdropping at your age?

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.259
Naughty

00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:25.019
Don't talk nonsense, we weren't eavesdropping

00:28:25.839 --> 00:28:26.799
Gou'er Ye wouldn't take his medicine

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.200
Right

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.380
What are you doing here?

00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:30.779
Ms. Liu

00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:32.660
Can I ask you a question?

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.420
Why do you admire everyone you meet?

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.339
It's human nature

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.500
It's psychological counseling

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.259
With patients

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.220
You have to sweet-talk them

00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:44.259
Where are you guys going?

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.380
My old chronic headache and insomnia

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.259
Still haven't gone away

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:48.799
I'm having chills

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:49.819
This tendency to get fevers

00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:50.779
Has really set in

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.940
See you later

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:52.980
See you

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:55.859
What's wrong?

00:28:56.819 --> 00:28:57.740
Why are they...

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.059
Sick again?
