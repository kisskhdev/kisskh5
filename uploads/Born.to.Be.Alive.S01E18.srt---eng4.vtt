[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.220
[Episode 18]

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.940
Where are you taking this?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.200
Do you want me to drive?

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.110
We're going to the county town

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.770
and haul some stuff on the way.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.380
You go on with your business.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.870
Forget...

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.160
forget these two bags.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.700
It's too much.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.870
This is way too little.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.610
It's not worth much.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.840
Let's leave it at that for now.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.700
Take them back.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.700
Han.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.570
Don't go.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.850
Captain asked me to go.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.910
Captain isn't here.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.540
The fewer people involved in this,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.200
the better.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.150
Don't, Han.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.210
Han.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.400
Move.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.040
What's there to fight over?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.600
What's there to fight over?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.660
It's not like we're going on a picnic.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.270
When did you get back?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.290
I didn't even hear that.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.780
Just now.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.240
You're treating me like a child.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.620
Well, you are.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.710
How much can those yaks

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.900
of ours sell for now?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.520
It's not the season yet.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.070
Who sells them at a time like this?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.780
We won't get

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.930
a good price at all.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.340
Some official you are.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.080
You've forgotten everything

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.340
about the grasslands.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.140
What's wrong?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.300
Nothing.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.740
Is the Mountain Patrol

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.120
facing some kind of

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.020
trouble again?

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.150
Do you know what the look in your eyes

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.480
reminded me of just now?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.240
What?

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.800
It's the eyes of

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.020
a yak lying on the ice.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.010
Exactly the same.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.700
Tashi is back.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.600
Hello, sir.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.220
Hello.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.740
Mom, I'm back.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.390
Tashi, tie up the horse

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.620
and do your homework.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.130
I have something to do.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.800
Okay.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.140
Here.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.520
What do you think of this?

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.330
This is too old.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.990
It's not worth much.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.170
I have a few copper pots.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.400
Let me show you.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.220
Ms. Cairen.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.080
If you sell the pots,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.930
what will your family use?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.460
When Deputy County Mayor Duo comes back,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.120
he can only eat tsampa crumbs.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.750
I still have

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.500
the furniture from my wedding.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.970
It's all made of good wood.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.400
But it's at the winter pasture.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.710
Let's go take a look.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.870
Ms. Cairen,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.440
don't make this hard for me.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.360
Furniture is the hardest to move.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.570
And it's at the winter pasture.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.010
Today,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.550
even if I bring the horse cart,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.640
I probably can't move it all in one trip.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.170
Gotta go.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.300
Wait.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.110
Mom, what are you doing?

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.040
Stay out of this.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.090
Look.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.570
This is a pure

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.560
four-eye Dzi bead, an Earth-Gate type.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.240
Among Dzi beads,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.600
it's considered a treasure.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.300
Take a look.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.000
Mom, don't sell the Dzi bead.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.260
Grandma left it to you.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.680
Your father is in trouble now.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.700
We have no choice.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.380
Ms. Cairen.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.380
This...

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:46.800
We're not selling it.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.890
Give it to me.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.440
No.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.700
What are you doing?

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.270
-Miss.
-Give it to me.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.060
What are you doing?

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.450
Alright, don't hit the child!

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.810
The horse.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.330
Give it to me!

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.260
The horse... Is the horse for sale?

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.730
The horse.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.610
Nice horse.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.470
Have you decided

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.730
how much to sell it for?

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.920
This price. You can take it.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.480
1,000. Deal.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.690
It's 10,000.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.840
Ms. Cairen.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.910
Tashi really is a businessman.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.540
He's got some nerve,
naming a price like that.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.600
10,000?

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.880
How is it worth 10,000?

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.750
Jiongxi is the best horse.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.790
It can take first place

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.780
in the race.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.800
Has it ever taken first place?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.620
Not yet.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.110
But it's faster than the winner.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.110
Okay.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.250
We're not selling Jiongxi.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.200
Fine, fine. Don't sell anything.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.310
Today

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.350
is a wasted trip.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.060
Gotta go.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.770
Don't go.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.580
I dare you to race me.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.860
Come on, Jiongxi.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.330
You must win today.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.250
Don't embarrass me.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.320
Hyah!

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.490
Hyah!

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:34.530
Tashi!

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.880
Come on, Tashi!

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.650
Hyah!

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.720
Come on, Tashi!

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.000
Come on!

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.440
Hyah!

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.010
Hyah!

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.320
Tashi, come on!

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.960
Tashi!

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.870
Tashi, you won!

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.320
You won!

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.840
Tashi, you won!

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.540
Jiongxi!

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.390
Jiongxi!

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.900
Jiongxi!

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.490
Sister!

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:56.900
Sister.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.900
How have you been?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.460
Did you cause any trouble lately?

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.290
Even if you don't say it,

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.810
I know you did.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.840
I haven't been fighting,

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.860
and I don't bring a knife
to school anymore.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.500
I even helped Mom

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.620
keep the Dzi bead.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.770
What about Jiongxi?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.760
Jiongxi helped you win the race.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.310
But it didn't know

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.870
that you wanted to sell it.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.130
You lied to Jiongxi.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.620
Sister!

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.720
Sister!

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.130
Jiongxi!

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.860
Sister!

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.030
Jiongxi!

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.890
Mom.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.000
Mom.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.720
Mom!

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.440
Jiongxi!

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.110
Jiongxi, you're back.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.440
Mom, am I dreaming?

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.530
What dream?

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.840
I just had a nightmare,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.670
and now I'm having a sweet dream.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.960
You silly child,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.290
you must be half asleep.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.240
Mom, why did you

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.370
bring Jiongxi back?

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.840
Because

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.820
it was homesick

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.290
and missed you.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.030
Mom, where is your Dzi bead?

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.750
Let me see it.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.950
It's here. It's here.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.140
The Dzi bead is here.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.440
It's here.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.780
It's here.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.780
It's here.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.160
It's here.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.580
Mom.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.290
Don't cry.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.100
The Dzi bead isn't important.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.560
It's okay.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.050
Take it.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.560
If you don't take it,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.440
I sold the Dzi bead for nothing.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.060
When we have money,

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.250
I'll buy you a better Dzi bead.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.960
Tashi said the same thing.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.940
Duojie, do you still want to be with me?

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.150
Of course.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.240
Tomorrow,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.700
go and redeem the Dzi bead.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.030
I didn't marry you

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.110
because you're an official.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:04.490
All these years,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.040
I never transferred
my household registration.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.940
Do you know why?

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.170
You like the yak
and sheep on the grassland.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.620
You like riding horses.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.050
And you hate living
in a single-story house.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.400
Yes.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.440
Wait until the Mountain Patrol...

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.590
Stop saying "wait."

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.060
I didn't marry you

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.270
just to wait

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.550
for a better life.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.620
If you hadn't become Deputy County Mayor

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.060
and went back to being a herder,

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.590
I might be happier.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.440
I don't know why.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.360
Ever since you

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.160
became the Deputy County Mayor,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.480
our family's just getting
poorer and poorer

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.220
If this goes on,

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.940
one day,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.470
it will collapse.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.050
Do you want me to give up
the mountain patrol?

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.710
Or

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.070
this is it for us.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.310
Let's split up.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.370
Tashi stays with me.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.000
You don't need to worry.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.310
Otherwise,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.860
from today on,

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.470
I make the decisions

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.150
in this family,

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.960
and I handle the money.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.310
Hurry up!

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.030
Captain, do you have the gun?

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:40.680
Yes.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.220
Let me do it.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.510
When did they

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.140
run away?

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.050
In the middle of the night.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:51.500
We don't know

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.660
exactly when, either.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.180
Why didn't you

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:53.920
watch Zhang Yang?

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.440
Why didn't you watch your son?

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.460
Tashi ran away at midnight,

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.400
and you didn't even know.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.160
How can you blame us?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.830
You shouldn't have

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.660
taught Zhang Yang to drive!

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.590
You agreed to it!

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.720
Why didn't you say something back then?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.520
Get in the car!

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.030
Where did you get the car?

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.760
I borrowed it
from the animal husbandry station.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.780
Ms. Cairen.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.640
What are you doing?

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.610
I'm going to find Tashi.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.070
Stop making things worse!

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.850
I promise you

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.640
I will bring Tashi back.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.080
If you can't bring our son back,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.750
don't bother coming back either.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.640
Captain.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.420
Let's go.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.410
Get in.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.720
[The 19th Patrol of the Mountain Patrol]

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.240
Have you checked the supplies?

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240
What's missing?

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.190
A lot of buns and pickles are gone.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.500
They also took a quilt,

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.830
a barrel of gasoline,

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.260
and even the blowtorch.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.330
A barrel of gas

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.570
is enough for two days.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:20.430
More than that.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.080
They went to dig Cordyceps a few days ago

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.470
and herd sheep,

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.940
so they made some money.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.810
They probably

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.380
used it all to buy gas.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.790
By the looks of it,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.050
they're not out for a joyride.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.710
They couldn't wait any longer

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.810
and went in to find him themselves.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.630
If that's the case,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.030
they won't stay on the outskirts.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.090
They'll go deeper.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.720
Eagles don't follow yak trails.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.430
Even the snow mountains
have meltwater routes.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.340
They brought plenty of food.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.660
And Zhang Yang has experience.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.590
In the past, he always went into

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.090
the Uninhabited Zone

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.660
with others leading the way.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.210
When he go there alone,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.680
he almost died in there.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.230
Captain.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.160
Should we take the south route
or the north route?

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.090
The south route.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.240
That looks

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.160
like our tent.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.510
Drive over there.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.200
Sit tight.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.170
We are the Mountain Patrol!

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.840
People in the tent...

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.670
Hands in the air!

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.290
Come out!

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.640
It's me. It's me.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.500
It's me.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.900
Everyone inside, come out!

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.500
Kids, come out.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:00.920
Hurry up!

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.450
Quickly.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.210
Don't move.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.930
Hands in the air.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.010
No... no guns.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.800
No guns.

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:08.450
Don't move.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:15.450
You again.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.400
Have you seen two kids

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.210
driving a pickup truck?

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.180
No.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.050
Really?

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.180
Really.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.840
What about them?

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.850
You kidnapped two kids this time?

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:27.500
Sir,

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:29.270
they're my relatives.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.260
What are you doing here this time?

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.520
I didn't do anything.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.610
We just got here.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:34.410
Just got here?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.000
You just got here,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.200
and their face is already frostbitten?

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.090
Captain,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.690
look.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.550
Brine shrimp.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.240
Our land is sandified.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.080
We can't herd sheep anymore.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.270
So I took the kids out

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.530
to catch brine shrimp.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.880
Where's your harvesting permit?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.280
Still processing again?

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.090
Who is he to you?

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.150
Uncle... Uncle.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.700
Uncle.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.270
Right.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.290
What are you doing?

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.020
Turn around.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.200
Turn around.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.730
We are the Mountain Patrol.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.670
Don't be afraid.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.620
How long have you been here?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.900
Three days.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.900
Have you seen

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.770
two kids?

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.160
They're about your age.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.740
One is this tall

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.760
with short hair.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.330
The other one

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.310
is your height.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.810
His hair is a bit longer than yours.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.920
Think carefully.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:24.980
They are driving

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.110
a blue pickup truck.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.200
How many times have I told you?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.630
Catching without a permit is illegal.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.620
Since the kids are here,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.940
I won't arrest you.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.260
Don't let me

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.720
see you in Bolamula again.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.220
Get in the car!

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.880
Let's go.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.810
Fine. Come here.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:54.840
You guys,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.940
confiscate his gas cans.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.470
Yes, sir.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.400
At a time like this? Still fining?

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:58.930
Let's go.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:00.650
Let's go. Let's go.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.340
Hurry up!

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.240
We should've at least seized the gas.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.940
If they still have gas,

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.110
they'll just go deeper.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.440
It makes no difference.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.900
If you seize his gas,

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.770
he'll just hit

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.480
the supply point
off the Qinghai-Tibet Highway,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.310
buy more gas,

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.900
and come right back at it.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.250
A tiger is hard to fight,

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.110
but flies are even harder to swat.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.460
Where did they go?

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:28.240
We've come all this way

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.040
and haven't seen a single track.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.370
What's wrong?

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.640
Just drive.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.020
Bolamula

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.830
is not

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.780
what I pictured.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.200
How is it different?

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.880
It's bigger

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.350
and even more beautiful

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.310
than I imagined.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.770
The more beautiful a place is,
the more dangerous it becomes.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:55.740
Do you know

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.770
what's most dangerous in Bolamula?

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.270
Of course I do.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.110
Wild yaks.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.510
Those beasts weigh over a thousand pounds,

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.180
way more dangerous than bears,

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.740
wolves,

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.830
or snow leopards.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.460
Even with your arms spread out,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.120
you're not as wide as its head.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.830
When they charge,

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.140
the ground shakes.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.940
One hit from them,

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.370
and it's like getting slammed by a truck.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.360
Did your dad tell you that?

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.360
I don't need him to tell me.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.510
I've seen them

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.790
in the pastoral areas.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.330
Do you think

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.090
we'll run into a wild yak?

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.350
If I'd known,

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.830
I would've brought a gun.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.770
A gun?

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.240
Let me tell you.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.410
For sneaking out,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.720
your dad would just beat you up.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.360
But if you steal a gun,

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.820
you'll end up
in the Public Security Bureau.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:46.960
Right.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.730
There's a police officer

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.060
in the Mountain Patrol.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.160
Truth is, wild yaks

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.490
aren't that dangerous.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.290
As long as you

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.810
don't provoke them,

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.330
they definitely won't charge at you.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:00.780
Then tell me,

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.310
what is the most dangerous?

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.070
Poachers?

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.790
Come on, tell me.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.160
The weather.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:14.880
The weather?

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.850
Just because it's sunny
doesn't mean it's safe.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.960
The weather in Bolamula

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.220
can change in seconds.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.420
One heavy snowfall

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.020
can turn this place

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.760
into a swamp.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.530
People can get trapped out there for days,

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:26.860
unable to get out at all.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.070
There's something even more dangerous

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.400
that I haven't told you.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.000
What?

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.180
The thunderstorms.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.830
Did you forget your meds?

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:55.530
No need.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.110
Zhacuo.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:00.880
Check here.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.670
Where did you put your meds?

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.760
I said I don't need it.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.830
Just drive.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.900
He Qingyuan.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.780
Search his bag.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.510
Stop looking.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.820
I left in a hurry and forgot them.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.200
Look again.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.660
Maybe there's some left.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.460
Check inside.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.240
It's a white bottle, right?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.640
Right.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.570
Check inside the bag.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:27.220
Nothing?

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.920
No. I can't find it.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.010
Check his pockets.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:32.470
The pockets...

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.940
Stop looking!

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.200
Just drive the car!

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:50.810
What are you doing?

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.820
What's going on?

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.000
Everyone out.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.890
Set up camp here and start a fire.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.380
Who told you to camp?

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.250
Get in.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.680
You need to eat something hot right now.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.640
If you collapse,

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.000
you'll just cause
more trouble for everyone.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.830
I'm fine.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.070
Get in. Let's go!

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.740
I said I'm fine.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.220
We must find them before dark.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.050
We can't leave them

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.000
out here overnight.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.460
What if we don't find them?

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.700
You said it yourself—

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.880
In the Uninhabited Zone,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.080
you have to take care of yourself first.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.590
I also made it clear

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.580
that in the Uninhabited Zone,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.110
all actions follow orders!

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.110
It's my own body.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.880
I know my own condition.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.940
If you really knew,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.760
that time last winter,

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.340
you wouldn't have

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.540
collapsed like that,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.990
and we wouldn't have gotten separated.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.070
You go drive!

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:43.910
Let's go.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:44.440
Captain.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.390
Just rest for a bit.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.980
Are you not listening to me either?

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.260
Move!

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.170
Stop yelling!

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.070
You're the Captain!

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:54.770
If you collapse,

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:55.640
what am I supposed to do?

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.240
What are they supposed to do?

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:58.930
Now you're worried?

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.720
So what were you doing back then?

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.980
If you had kept a closer eye on Tashi,

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.910
he wouldn't have caused this mess.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:06.110
Why are you glaring at me? Am I wrong?

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:08.050
If Dolma

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.250
saw you like this,

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.460
she'd scold you. too.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:12.540
You...

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.490
Don't "you" me.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:14.880
Listen to me.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.100
Set up camp!

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:21.340
Captain.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.330
Bai.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:58.950
Talk properly.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.230
Thanks.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.880
It's hot.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.990
Get some sleep.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:21.310
When the rain stops,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.240
I'll wake you up.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.580
Back in 1979, during the snow disaster
in Namu Township,

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:32.970
I was in my twenties.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.510
Even with ice on my arms,

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.410
watching steam rise off our skin,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.250
I still felt

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.560
hot all over.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.330
I'm not what I used to be.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:49.770
It's summer,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.520
but just one rain shower

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.980
makes me freeze like this.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.520
Since Dolma left,

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.450
there's been no one

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:11.980
to talk back to me like this.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.520
Tashi just gives me the cold shoulder

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.690
or runs off.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.850
Maybe that's the difference

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.640
between a daughter and a son.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.420
Tashi doesn't say much,

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.730
but he's sensitive at heart.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:36.650
Really.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.030
Adopted children

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.140
often grow up faster

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.070
than other kids.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.570
Is that so?

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:45.990
You seem like a late bloomer to me.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:47.550
That's because

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.790
my mom raised me well.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:50.940
We just need parents'

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.400
positive encouragement.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.010
In this regard,

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.180
you should learn from

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.250
Dr. Zhang.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.070
Okay.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.230
I'll humble myself and learn.

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.380
How did you know

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.160
Tashi was adopted?

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.750
Of course, I know everything.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.900
You two are really alike.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.180
Me? Like him?

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:24.810
I wouldn't be like him,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.210
rushing into the mountains so recklessly.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.080
I was talking about Dolma.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.020
When she was little,

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.180
I often took her riding

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.790
on the grasslands

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.260
and told her stories
about the snow mountains.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.380
Before she was five,

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.160
she could remember

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.890
the names of all the mountains.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.520
She was amazing.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.710
In the blink of an eye,

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.830
little Dolma grew up

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:03.530
and got into university.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.700
That was the proudest

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.340
and happiest thing

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.770
of Cairen and me.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.230
She majored in geology.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:24.680
She said, "Our hometown

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.610
is so beautiful.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.500
I want to understand it better."

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.310
Once she ran back from school,

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.740
shouting at me

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.680
excitedly.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.700
She said, "Dad,

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:38.740
do you know?

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.240
Here in Mazhi,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:41.480
there is a treasure land—

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.330
Bolamula.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.510
There's gold underground.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.380
So much of it,

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.140
you wouldn't dare imagine it
even in your dreams.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:47.740
And there are many

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.200
other mineral resources.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.420
I'm going with my classmates

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.550
into the mountains

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:53.680
to do exploration."

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:57.380
Back then,

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.110
Cairen was dead set against it.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.250
She said the Uninhabited Zone

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.310
was too dangerous.

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.250
But seeing her

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.640
that excited,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.940
I couldn't bear to dampen her spirits.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.520
So I agreed behind Cairen's back.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.639
But I never expected...

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.340
my daughter went into the mountains

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.909
and never came out.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.330
What did she run into?

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.130
A blizzard.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.320
Don't go over there yet.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.760
So that's why you and Mom

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.670
were so dead set against

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.270
me going into the mountains.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.410
Dolma is gone.

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.130
According to Tibetan tradition,

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.880
she will be reincarnated,

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.560
and we will definitely meet again.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.240
I use this to comfort myself.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.310
But the pain in my heart

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.280
is always there.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.390
I don't know

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.680
when I'll find relief.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.810
That night, you were knocked out

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.580
and unconscious for a long time.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.400
Everyone thought

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.530
you'd never wake up.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.040
Did you ever regret it?

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.960
No.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.750
Then it's the same for Dolma.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.800
We are all working hard

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.630
for the things

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:10.400
we want to do.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.840
I believe

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.190
Dolma wouldn't blame you, either.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.930
You know what?

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.760
In each and every one of you,

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:38.540
I can see traces of Dolma.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.340
I want to take good care of you,

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:46.730
and I don't want you face danger

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.130
in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.360
So if anyone wants to leave,

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.710
I won't stop them.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.890
But whenever you come back,

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.380
although I don't say it,

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.630
in my heart, I feel like

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.190
my Dolma has returned.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:22.700
I'll always be here.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.360
I won't leave.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.030
After we get back,

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.270
I need to have a good talk

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.930
with this Shi Long.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.630
Bai Ju is hard to deal with.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.570
Are you crying?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.870
Are you crying?

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.110
Yeah.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.280
Because of you.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:04.780
Alright.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:06.720
Get some sleep.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.670
I'm afraid to sleep.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.530
As soon as I close my eyes,

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.860
I see Tashi.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.920
Although I know

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.050
Cairen was just speaking out of anger,

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.790
I was really a terrible dad.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:24.980
You shouldn't

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.380
underestimate the kids.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.850
I taught Zhang Yang how to drive.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:29.400
He drives

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.590
just as well as I do.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.380
He's sharp,

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.290
reacts fast,

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.100
has experience going into the mountains,

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.030
and is definitely well-prepared.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.150
Putting everything else aside,

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.230
just the fact that
they went out to dig cordyceps,

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:42.150
and herded sheep for others,

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.350
to earn money for gas—

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.380
that alone tells us

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:44.970
this was

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.330
planned for a long time.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.820
Don't worry too much.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.650
Did you check Dolma's place?

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.220
They didn't go to Dolma's.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.350
We took the south route this time—

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.210
Zhuoyuan Lake.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.480
Moon Goddess Lake.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:56.670
Pala Slope.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.550
When I find them,

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.650
I'll teach them a lesson.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.780
Something's wrong.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.920
What's wrong?

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.190
We should take the north route.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.350
This is already the third river.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.960
We've driven so long today

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.450
and haven't seen

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.460
a single person.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:23.820
To find fossickers,

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.420
you must stay near the river.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.310
We don't have any other clues.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.150
We can only use this clumsy method

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.170
and try our luck.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:30.980
It's

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.250
the only option left.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:38.230
Look.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.780
Tomorrow,

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.630
we'll keep going in this direction.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.430
There are two more rivers ahead.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.550
Where did this come from?

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.320
Is it Captain Duojie's

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.360
or Bai's?

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:49.800
It's my sister's.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.150
She studied geology at university.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.590
People with a college education

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:57.850
really are something.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.550
I also want to send my brother

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.410
to university.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.180
After we find your brother,

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.030
why don't the three of us

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.230
all go to university?

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.880
I thought you didn't like school.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.580
But I also want

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.840
to be someone capable.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.140
You miss your sister?

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.280
No.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.400
At her funeral,

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.940
I didn't shed a single tear.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.630
Back then, she said

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.650
she was going to the Uninhabited Zone.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.460
Dad was the only one in the family

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.520
who supported her.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.030
Here, let me mark two locations for you.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.890
Don't touch it!

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.200
I'll mark them myself.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.830
You're quite like Captain Duojie—

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.900
Tough mouth, soft heart.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.830
What do you mean?

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.690
I don't want to end up like him.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.030
Why?

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.560
I quite like him.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.660
Even though he always looks stern

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.190
and loves to scold people,

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.420
everything he does

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.740
is for our good.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.770
If he were your dad,

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.880
you wouldn't like him.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.640
There you go again.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.760
I'm sorry.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.380
I shouldn't have said that.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:45.860
But every time,

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.590
you're the one who brings it up.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.800
Every time you bring it up,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.980
you get sad.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.030
I'm not sad.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.630
I was just thinking,

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.560
back then, if I ever came home late,

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.840
my dad would get so worried he'd beat me.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.670
I know that.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.400
You went to the neighboring village
to watch an opera.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.130
You've told me that many times.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.820
Captain Duojie must be worried sick.

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.270
This isn't the neighboring village.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.630
This is Bolamula.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:14.680
I've brought his only son

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.460
in here.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.780
You keep talking about my dad.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.640
It must be them. They've found us.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.210
Come on. Get in!

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.300
Hurry up. Run!

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:40.760
Let's go back.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.400
Your parents must be worried sick.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:42.980
Why?

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.980
Aren't we looking
for your brother anymore?

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.380
We can look for him later.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.570
I don't want Captain Duojie

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:47.500
and Bai to worry.

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:48.170
Let's go. Hurry.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.920
I'm not going. No way.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.340
We haven't found him.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:49.760
Come with me.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.900
I'm older than you.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.670
You have to listen to me on this.
Let's go!

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.500
You have the nerve to say you're older?

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.300
You're giving up halfway. Coward!

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.030
I'm not going.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.110
My dad will beat the hell out of me.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.170
If he hits you, I'll stop—
