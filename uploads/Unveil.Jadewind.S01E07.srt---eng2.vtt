{\an8}‪ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
‪ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:49.625
I pick you.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:55.985
Judging by the wounds, she was whipped.

00:01:56.505 --> 00:01:57.385
No…

00:01:58.065 --> 00:02:00.105
No!

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:05.705
All this crying is ruining the mood.
Let me keep you company, sir.

00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:13.745
You're new here, right?

00:02:15.225 --> 00:02:16.505
Aren't you scared?

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:19.305
What good would fear do?

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.105
Survival comes first.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:25.465
Instead of making a scene,
I might as well find someone dependable.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.505
Interesting.

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:33.785
Are you up for a little game?

00:02:33.865 --> 00:02:37.825
Only if you play by my rules first.

00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:02.945
What game would you like to play, sir?

00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.505
Your toy is certainly special.

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:20.785
Not as special as you, pretty lady.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:23.825
My turn.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:29.785
Sure.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.425
Do you remember Hanxiao?

00:03:35.145 --> 00:03:36.225
No.

00:03:36.985 --> 00:03:38.385
Is that your name?

00:03:40.425 --> 00:03:41.465
Wrong answer.

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:42.745
You get a punishment.

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:44.985
No!

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:46.545
Go away!

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:48.625
Come on.

00:03:49.905 --> 00:03:50.785
Get back here!

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:05.785
Where are you going?

00:04:13.025 --> 00:04:14.385
Lu Zhenglian?

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:15.785
LU ZHENGLIAN, LEFT GRAND REMONSTRATOR

00:04:18.345 --> 00:04:20.465
Don't be petty, sir.

00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:27.225
You're quite something.

00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:32.105
There she is.

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:33.625
Get her!

00:04:56.025 --> 00:05:00.705
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:04.265
Something's wrong.

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:07.025
With this qilin badge
bestowed by His Majesty,

00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:08.745
I act on his authority. Let us through.

00:05:09.585 --> 00:05:10.425
I've never heard of it.

00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:11.465
You've got some nerve.

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:23.785
Get her!

00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:39.825
Go ahead. Run.

00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:41.905
Why aren't you running now?

00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:45.185
Does it hurt?

00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:46.625
Does it hurt?

00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:50.185
Take my eye if you want,

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:52.865
but your life is mine to take.

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:05.305
You're an Inner Guard.

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:07.345
What are you doing here?

00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:10.665
Can't figure it out?

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:12.865
Come with me
to the Palace Investigation Bureau

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:14.105
and think it over.

00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:21.225
Tie her up with a rock and sink her.

00:06:24.385 --> 00:06:26.025
No one's ever seen this woman.

00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:30.225
But she's from the palace. Are you sure?

00:06:32.705 --> 00:06:34.225
If she lives,

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:37.185
we'll all die.

00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:39.065
Do it right.

00:06:56.145 --> 00:06:58.025
- Who's causing trouble here?
- Sir.

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:03.025
Sir, they're trespassing.

00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:05.745
We're from
the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:06.745
Oh my.

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:08.345
My apologies.

00:07:08.425 --> 00:07:09.465
The Wannian County offices

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:10.865
will fully cooperate
with the Inner Guards.

00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:12.265
May I see your warrant first?

00:07:12.345 --> 00:07:15.025
We tracked them all the way here.
There was no time for a warrant.

00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:20.705
Without a warrant, our hands are tied.

00:07:20.785 --> 00:07:23.425
- This is a private residence after all.
- We have no warrant,

00:07:23.505 --> 00:07:24.545
only this qilin badge.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.185
Who knows if that's even real?

00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:29.065
- You clueless fool!
- I…

00:07:29.145 --> 00:07:31.465
We ask for His Majesty's forgiveness!

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:36.665
- Let's split up.
- All right.

00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:47.585
Didn't Jiang Tingwei tell you?

00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:49.185
I'm not just an Inner Guard.

00:07:49.265 --> 00:07:53.305
I'm also His Majesty's niece,
Princess of Fuchang County, Li Peiyi.

00:07:57.225 --> 00:07:59.345
Things went wrong. Get everyone out.

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:05.625
Come out.

00:08:06.865 --> 00:08:08.545
There's been a situation.

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:10.585
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
we must call it a night.

00:08:10.665 --> 00:08:12.225
- Hurry, sir.
- Be quick.

00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:14.025
- Come with me.
- You can play next time.

00:08:15.785 --> 00:08:18.185
Why not pick someone to push me in?

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:19.665
That way, when His Majesty investigates,

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:22.785
only one of you
will die with your whole clan.

00:08:26.665 --> 00:08:28.305
You. Do it.

00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:30.385
Me?

00:08:30.465 --> 00:08:31.905
But she's a county princess.

00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:36.745
If you won't do it, we'll kill you too!

00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:41.585
Relax.

00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:44.225
Just give me a gentle push.

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:50.465
Hurry up. Be quick.

00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:52.385
Get all the girls out. Hurry!

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.425
- Come out here! Over there!
- Come out!

00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:55.625
Hurry up. Stop dawdling!

00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:56.745
Hurry up!

00:08:56.825 --> 00:08:58.025
- Move it!
- Hurry.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:00.425
- Take everyone and come with me!
- Come on!

00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:11.825
Your Ladyship! Your Ladyship!

00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:25.545
Relax.

00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:27.585
Just give me a gentle push.

00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:31.545
The rest of you, come a little closer,

00:09:32.065 --> 00:09:34.065
so I can remember all your faces.

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:40.465
If I die here,

00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.425
at Xiuhong House,

00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:44.545
you'll be the scapegoat they chose.

00:09:45.505 --> 00:09:46.665
But if you save me,

00:09:46.745 --> 00:09:48.265
I'll be in your debt,

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:50.785
and I'll repay your kindness.

00:10:24.545 --> 00:10:26.225
- Any sign of her?
- No.

00:10:27.265 --> 00:10:28.105
The back courtyard!

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:30.265
Officers, what are you looking for?

00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:32.425
Official investigation. Step aside!

00:10:32.945 --> 00:10:33.785
How dare you!

00:10:33.865 --> 00:10:36.105
How weak do you think
the Palace Investigation Bureau is?

00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:37.385
Arrest them!

00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:43.585
- Where's that crazy girl?
- The back courtyard.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:25.025
Boss.

00:11:45.185 --> 00:11:46.025
Who did it?

00:11:47.145 --> 00:11:49.185
It was him. He pushed Her Ladyship.

00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:51.625
- We didn't do anything.
- Let him go.

00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:54.145
Bring the rest
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:55.385
I'll question them myself.

00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:59.065
Thank you, Your Ladyship!

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:01.625
Check for hidden passages
and secret doors.

00:12:01.705 --> 00:12:02.625
No one gets out.

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:03.745
Understood.

00:12:10.825 --> 00:12:12.585
- To the storeroom.
- Yes.

00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:17.385
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:20.705
- Prosecutor Gu.
- Left Street Inspector,

00:12:20.785 --> 00:12:22.465
- why are you here?
- There's been an incident.

00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:27.665
Your Ladyship!

00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:29.905
Taozhi's in the secret room
behind the south wall

00:12:29.985 --> 00:12:31.305
of the easternmost room
on the second floor.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:44.105
Your Ladyship,

00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:45.865
what are we looking for?

00:12:47.185 --> 00:12:48.225
It's become an embroidery room?

00:13:23.145 --> 00:13:24.665
Taozhi!

00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:45.665
Taozhi!

00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:51.665
This belongs to Taozhi.

00:13:51.745 --> 00:13:53.945
Less than two ke has passed.

00:13:54.025 --> 00:13:54.985
Where could they have gone?

00:13:56.625 --> 00:13:57.625
LONGXIANG NOODLES

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:03.865
The carriage.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:06.305
The ward gates are closed now.
They can't have left Daozheng Ward.

00:14:06.385 --> 00:14:08.225
Those men aren't ordinary people.

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:09.825
With all the residences
and taverns in the ward,

00:14:09.905 --> 00:14:10.865
they won't be easy to find.

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:13.305
Mr. Gu, where did you see
the carriage? Show me.

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:14.465
Come with me.

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:20.585
Your Ladyship, we've only caught
a few workers and guards.

00:14:20.665 --> 00:14:21.505
No sign of the others.

00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:26.105
Tell Zhang Boyan
to search with Prosecutor Gu.

00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:28.945
Look for a man with an injured left eye
and a few young girls.

00:14:29.025 --> 00:14:31.705
They should be easy to spot,
unless someone is helping them.

00:14:31.785 --> 00:14:33.345
But come dawn when the ward gates
open, they can be gone.

00:14:33.425 --> 00:14:34.985
- Hurry.
- Understood.

00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:48.705
"Birds die for food and people for money."

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:54.025
Is this bit of money really worth
your life?

00:14:56.545 --> 00:14:57.665
Take the money.

00:14:57.745 --> 00:14:59.545
Just pretend you never saw me, all right?

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.945
What kind of business do you run?

00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:07.465
It must've been quite profitable.

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:13.905
Please, have mercy and let me go.

00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:15.425
All right.

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:19.225
I'll let you go.

00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:21.705
Thank you, sir.

00:15:25.785 --> 00:15:27.065
Sorry,

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:30.145
I forgot I had an assistant with me.

00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:34.385
Is there anything else
valuable in that bundle?

00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:36.785
I already gave you all my money.

00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:39.585
Sorry, but you'll need to come with me.

00:15:42.185 --> 00:15:43.025
Move.

00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:51.585
- Hand it over.
- What?

00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:54.345
Evidence.

00:15:55.305 --> 00:15:56.145
Wait.

00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:01.145
LONGXIANG NOODLES

00:16:01.225 --> 00:16:03.345
This is where I saw that carriage.

00:16:04.265 --> 00:16:06.425
It took everyone away?

00:16:06.505 --> 00:16:08.105
It was a large carriage
drawn by two horses,

00:16:08.185 --> 00:16:09.545
wider than most by at least two chi.

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:11.505
They were in a hurry.

00:16:11.585 --> 00:16:12.505
They must've squeezed everyone in.

00:16:13.945 --> 00:16:15.025
Makes sense.

00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:27.665
Come on.

00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:30.945
Where are they?

00:16:31.465 --> 00:16:32.905
I'm new here.

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:34.905
I just do odd jobs.

00:16:34.985 --> 00:16:37.145
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:16:39.545 --> 00:16:41.185
Didn't Your Ladyship come by before?

00:16:41.265 --> 00:16:43.705
No orders were placed these last two days.

00:16:43.785 --> 00:16:45.265
Who exactly are you looking for?

00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:47.785
Think carefully.

00:16:48.305 --> 00:16:52.545
They tried to drown me.
I can have you executed at any time.

00:16:54.225 --> 00:16:56.305
The workers didn't know who you were.

00:16:56.385 --> 00:16:58.185
They thought you were a thief breaking in.

00:16:58.825 --> 00:17:00.985
But they do deserve
punishment for lynching.

00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:04.224
I failed in my supervision.
I'll accept any punishment.

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.625
You're quite the stewardess,

00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:13.424
eloquent and quick-witted.

00:17:13.505 --> 00:17:14.464
With just a few words,

00:17:14.545 --> 00:17:16.545
you've made all your faults
sound like mere poor supervision.

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:17.464
No matter.

00:17:18.105 --> 00:17:20.305
I've seen your tricks.

00:17:20.385 --> 00:17:22.065
You'll see mine

00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:24.065
when you get
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:17:25.065 --> 00:17:27.305
I truly don't know
what Your Ladyship is talking about.

00:17:27.385 --> 00:17:29.105
Where is Jiang Tingwei?

00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:31.025
He's Mr. Sun's bodyguard.

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:33.745
You should ask Mr. Sun.

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:36.745
Fine.

00:17:36.825 --> 00:17:39.305
FENG'S GROCERY

00:17:44.265 --> 00:17:46.585
From here,
the carriage tracks are shallower.

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:47.665
Someone got off.

00:17:47.745 --> 00:17:49.705
There should be eight women
under their control.

00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:52.385
No way they'd let them
be seen out on the street.

00:17:53.025 --> 00:17:54.025
The ones who got off here

00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:55.705
must be the men Her Ladyship saw.

00:17:55.785 --> 00:17:58.545
Where would they take my sister?

00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:01.265
Mr. Gu, don't let worry
cloud your judgment.

00:18:01.345 --> 00:18:02.625
The ward gates are closed.

00:18:02.705 --> 00:18:03.705
They must be hiding

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:05.545
somewhere in the ward
that draws no attention.

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:08.785
On the west side of Daozheng Ward
are mostly taverns and brothels.

00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:10.065
Residences are mostly on the east.

00:18:10.585 --> 00:18:13.545
Judging by the tracks, they went south.

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.065
What if they're just circling around?

00:18:16.145 --> 00:18:17.905
That man's got an injured eye.

00:18:17.985 --> 00:18:21.105
I doubt he's in the mood
for tricks. Go ahead.

00:18:22.225 --> 00:18:23.065
Let's go.

00:18:31.305 --> 00:18:33.825
XIUHONG HOUSE

00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:40.145
Care for some wine to warm yourself up?

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.785
I can't hold my liquor.
I'd better not drink.

00:18:44.065 --> 00:18:46.425
Reliable as ever.

00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:49.905
I'm not familiar with officials
from the old dynasty.

00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:51.225
What should we do next?

00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:55.025
I've been told the female musician
Remonstrator Lu favors

00:18:55.105 --> 00:18:56.465
is at Swallow House.

00:18:58.025 --> 00:18:59.385
Mr. Xiao, let's pay it a visit.

00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:00.905
All right.

00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:07.305
These old bones need rest.
I'm heading back.

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.705
I'll take those people back to the bureau.

00:19:14.265 --> 00:19:15.105
Let's go.

00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:18.905
Mr. Xiao, did we ever meet before?

00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:24.025
Has Your Ladyship forgotten?

00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:26.705
As an Astronomical Bureau official,
I rarely enter the palace.

00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:31.305
So, did you ever

00:19:32.785 --> 00:19:33.705
meet me before?

00:19:39.665 --> 00:19:40.625
I don't remember.

00:19:55.665 --> 00:19:59.385
SWALLOW HOUSE

00:19:59.985 --> 00:20:00.825
You…

00:20:04.345 --> 00:20:05.185
Easy…

00:20:07.585 --> 00:20:11.025
This is Master Lu's private room.
Have you come to the wrong place, sir?

00:20:11.105 --> 00:20:12.825
The night is lovely.

00:20:12.905 --> 00:20:16.305
Remonstrator Lu, you seem
to be enjoying it to the fullest.

00:20:16.825 --> 00:20:17.785
Who are you?

00:20:17.865 --> 00:20:18.945
Someone wishes to see you.

00:20:24.305 --> 00:20:26.545
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:20:28.785 --> 00:20:31.585
Who came up with this alibi
for you, Remonstrator Lu?

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.705
I'm afraid I don't follow, Your Ladyship.

00:20:35.585 --> 00:20:37.945
I went to Swallow House
at half past the You hour

00:20:38.025 --> 00:20:39.385
and stayed in my private room
the whole night.

00:20:39.465 --> 00:20:40.825
That's odd.

00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:44.745
At half past the You hour,
I saw you at Xiuhong House.

00:20:44.825 --> 00:20:46.345
Impossible.

00:20:48.505 --> 00:20:50.425
I was at Swallow House the entire time,

00:20:50.505 --> 00:20:52.705
listening to music and admiring
the moon with Liu Ying'er.

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:54.465
If I'm not mistaken,

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.265
you entered through the back door.

00:20:56.345 --> 00:20:57.785
Only Liu Ying'er saw you, right?

00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:00.505
So what?

00:21:01.585 --> 00:21:05.345
That means, apart from her,
no one else can vouch for your story.

00:21:05.425 --> 00:21:06.945
Quite the opposite.

00:21:07.465 --> 00:21:10.385
Everyone at Swallow House
can vouch for me.

00:21:11.025 --> 00:21:13.145
Liu Ying'er played a lovely piece,

00:21:13.225 --> 00:21:17.425
but I thought the ending was a bit trite

00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:18.945
and made some harsh comments.

00:21:19.025 --> 00:21:21.425
She got upset, stood up, and walked away.

00:21:21.505 --> 00:21:22.945
When I chased after her, I lost my footing

00:21:23.025 --> 00:21:24.785
and tumbled down the stairs.

00:21:24.865 --> 00:21:27.145
It caused a commotion.

00:21:27.225 --> 00:21:29.345
A lot of people at Swallow House saw it.

00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:31.305
When did you fall?

00:21:31.825 --> 00:21:33.505
If it was after
the fifth ke into the Xu hour,

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:36.385
even if the whole Western Capital
saw you at Swallow House,

00:21:36.465 --> 00:21:37.305
it means nothing.

00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:40.145
Feel free to check, Your Ladyship.

00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:43.225
I'm getting old. I can't remember clearly.

00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:57.785
Your Ladyship, Consort Shu has arrived.

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:00.945
I didn't tell her anything.

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:13.705
Why is Your Highness
here so late at night?

00:22:14.465 --> 00:22:15.945
Still risking your life
for an investigation, I see.

00:22:16.705 --> 00:22:19.665
Eat this chicken soup before it gets cold.

00:22:19.745 --> 00:22:20.985
You need to warm up.

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:28.905
This time, His Majesty
must reward Mr. Xiao properly.

00:22:28.985 --> 00:22:31.025
It's the second time he's saved you.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:37.065
Remember when you first entered the palace
and accidentally fell into the water?

00:22:37.705 --> 00:22:39.225
He was the one who saved you.

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.985
Xiao Wenyuan brought him to the palace
for an audience with His Majesty.

00:22:42.585 --> 00:22:44.785
His first time in the palace,
he got curious

00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:47.105
and wandered to the Moonlit Pond,

00:22:47.705 --> 00:22:49.265
where he happened to see you fall in.

00:22:49.345 --> 00:22:50.345
He saved you.

00:23:28.665 --> 00:23:29.745
He saved me?

00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:32.065
Why has no one ever mentioned it?

00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:35.105
His Majesty wanted
to grant him a great reward,

00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:38.145
but Grand Tutor Xiao said

00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:40.625
that with Huaijin about to join
the Astronomical Bureau,

00:23:40.705 --> 00:23:41.745
being away from court affairs,

00:23:41.825 --> 00:23:44.585
a great reward
would only invite suspicion.

00:23:44.665 --> 00:23:46.945
He begged His Majesty to keep it quiet.

00:24:48.785 --> 00:24:51.465
Your Ladyship, I can't draw
with you staring at me like this.

00:24:52.145 --> 00:24:53.425
I just heard

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.305
that when you were a boy,

00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:58.385
you saved someone from the Moonlit Pond.

00:25:02.225 --> 00:25:04.985
Now that you mention it, I suppose I did.

00:25:05.745 --> 00:25:07.345
You never spoke of it.

00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:10.665
It's nothing to brag about.

00:25:10.745 --> 00:25:12.105
Yes, I saved someone,

00:25:12.185 --> 00:25:13.065
but I also got caught

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:14.625
sneaking into a palace courtyard
without permission.

00:25:15.145 --> 00:25:17.265
I got a severe scolding and was grounded.

00:25:20.345 --> 00:25:22.745
Don't you want to know who you saved?

00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:29.585
The person I saved
wasn't Your Ladyship, was it?

00:25:31.065 --> 00:25:31.905
That's right.

00:25:31.985 --> 00:25:33.825
You saved my life, Mr. Xiao.

00:25:35.105 --> 00:25:35.945
Really?

00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:40.545
You rescued me
right after I fell into the water.

00:25:40.625 --> 00:25:42.825
Did you see anyone else
nearby at the time?

00:25:46.185 --> 00:25:47.385
Wasn't it an accident that you fell in?

00:25:48.825 --> 00:25:51.265
I'm just curious as to where
my maids were when I fell.

00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:53.905
There couldn't have been
anyone else around,

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:55.425
or I wouldn't have needed to rescue you.

00:26:04.945 --> 00:26:06.385
Why are you leaning
so close, Your Ladyship?

00:26:07.785 --> 00:26:09.185
I'm thinking about
how to repay your kindness.

00:26:12.265 --> 00:26:13.105
No need for that.

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:21.385
Your Ladyship,

00:26:21.905 --> 00:26:24.345
Remonstrator Lu flat-out denies
going to Xiuhong House yesterday.

00:26:24.425 --> 00:26:26.505
Zhenniang and the workers
aren't talking either.

00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:29.265
I see. You may go.

00:26:30.105 --> 00:26:30.945
Yes.

00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:36.585
In less than two ke,

00:26:37.105 --> 00:26:39.065
they turned the storeroom
back to the way it was

00:26:39.145 --> 00:26:41.465
and got everyone out of Xiuhong House.

00:26:42.065 --> 00:26:43.305
They really are well-trained.

00:26:44.305 --> 00:26:45.145
It's actually not that hard.

00:26:46.145 --> 00:26:48.425
There were lamp grooves
built into all four walls,

00:26:48.505 --> 00:26:50.465
but only three walls had grooves
blackened from use.

00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:54.225
The innermost grooves
showed no signs of ever being used.

00:26:54.305 --> 00:26:55.585
They never lit the lamps on that wall.

00:26:56.105 --> 00:26:57.985
And while the floor was spotless,

00:26:58.065 --> 00:26:59.865
there was a patch of dust
about four cun square

00:26:59.945 --> 00:27:00.865
at the very back.

00:27:00.945 --> 00:27:04.145
They must've stacked the looms
and sundries against that wall,

00:27:04.225 --> 00:27:05.345
used a screen to hide them,

00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:07.465
and rearranged the rest
of the room as needed.

00:27:07.545 --> 00:27:08.865
If something unexpected happened…

00:27:12.185 --> 00:27:14.625
There seemed to be plenty of items,
but they were all light.

00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:17.425
Even the banquet tables and stools
could be mixed in.

00:27:17.505 --> 00:27:19.185
Just a few people could reset
the room very quickly.

00:27:19.265 --> 00:27:21.465
Xiuhong House is well-located
and has plenty of side doors.

00:27:21.545 --> 00:27:24.745
The people likely slipped away
while we were arguing with the guards.

00:27:24.825 --> 00:27:25.665
Strange.

00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:27.665
Lu Zhenglian really
did fall down the stairs

00:27:27.745 --> 00:27:28.825
at the second ke of the Xu hour.

00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:30.425
Many at Swallow House saw it.

00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:33.865
But he was whipping me
at Xiuhong House at that same time.

00:27:33.945 --> 00:27:35.065
Does he have a double or something?

00:27:35.825 --> 00:27:37.865
The staff at Swallow House
might have covered for him,

00:27:37.945 --> 00:27:39.945
but I questioned
all the guests individually.

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:40.865
They couldn't all be lying.

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:44.785
Is there anything special

00:27:45.305 --> 00:27:48.025
- about the second ke of the Xu hour?
- No.

00:27:48.105 --> 00:27:50.425
Then why do they all
remember that exact time?

00:27:51.185 --> 00:27:52.025
I'll go ask again.

00:27:52.625 --> 00:27:53.465
Wait.

00:27:54.585 --> 00:27:56.465
The ward gates are open now. Post this up.

00:27:56.545 --> 00:27:58.385
It'll help Mr. Gu find them faster.

00:28:04.665 --> 00:28:06.505
- What's this?
- A sketch of Jiang Tingwei.

00:28:11.305 --> 00:28:14.225
I'll get an artist to make more copies,

00:28:14.305 --> 00:28:16.265
so we can post them around Daozheng Ward.

00:28:16.905 --> 00:28:18.545
How many do you need? I can draw them.

00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:22.785
I need you to come with me
to Swallow House.

00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:26.185
Leave the sketches to the artist.

00:28:38.345 --> 00:28:40.225
MAP OF DAOZHENG WARD

00:28:41.985 --> 00:28:45.705
Prosecutor Gu, I found Zhenniang
at a villa in Daozheng Ward.

00:28:45.785 --> 00:28:46.585
Let's go.

00:29:00.985 --> 00:29:01.825
It's still warm.

00:29:02.905 --> 00:29:03.865
They can't have gone far.

00:29:04.945 --> 00:29:06.145
After them!

00:29:08.265 --> 00:29:10.305
Your Ladyship, you should hurry
to the front hall. Something's happened.

00:29:10.385 --> 00:29:12.705
Let the old man deal with it.
I'm heading to Swallow House.

00:29:12.785 --> 00:29:14.225
Inspector Du can't handle it alone.

00:29:14.745 --> 00:29:15.785
He came for you.

00:29:25.225 --> 00:29:27.585
- Sir.
- Any sign of suspicious people?

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:29.225
Other than earlier this morning,

00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:30.865
not many people came or went today.

00:29:30.945 --> 00:29:32.825
We checked everyone,
but no one matched the sketch.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:43.145
Sir.

00:29:43.225 --> 00:29:44.145
Where did this come from?

00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:46.905
An hour ago, a wedding carriage went out.

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:48.745
Their maid gave these to us.

00:29:52.025 --> 00:29:53.425
Who else was in that group?

00:29:54.545 --> 00:29:57.145
There was one coachman,
four or five maids,

00:29:57.225 --> 00:29:58.545
and two or three dowry attendants.

00:29:58.625 --> 00:30:00.425
The bride was in the carriage.

00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:03.145
That's right. One of the ladies
gave us the pastries.

00:30:05.505 --> 00:30:07.105
We're escorting a bride.

00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:13.505
Escorting a bride?

00:30:36.225 --> 00:30:37.065
Go ahead.

00:30:40.065 --> 00:30:42.825
Set up checkpoints at all city gates.
Spread the sketch around.

00:30:42.905 --> 00:30:43.745
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:58.745
What brings you here, Eunuch Guo?

00:31:00.185 --> 00:31:01.145
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:31:01.225 --> 00:31:03.625
Forgive my bluntness.

00:31:03.705 --> 00:31:06.105
Is Left Grand Remonstrator
Lu Zhenglian being held

00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:07.665
at the Palace Investigation Bureau?

00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:13.145
Lu Zhenglian must really carry weight

00:31:13.225 --> 00:31:15.265
for you to come all this way in person
just to get him out.

00:31:16.385 --> 00:31:18.305
I didn't come of my own accord,
Your Ladyship.

00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:19.545
His Majesty sent me.

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:22.945
This morning, His Majesty
summoned Remonstrator Lu to court,

00:31:23.025 --> 00:31:24.865
but he never showed up.

00:31:24.945 --> 00:31:26.625
His Majesty was furious.

00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:28.385
Only later did he learn

00:31:28.905 --> 00:31:30.385
Remonstrator Lu was being detained
by Your Ladyship

00:31:30.465 --> 00:31:32.145
with no charges filed.

00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:34.425
His Majesty wants him released,

00:31:34.505 --> 00:31:36.345
but the Palace Investigation Bureau
won't let him go.

00:31:36.425 --> 00:31:38.905
So I had no choice but to come ask
for an explanation.

00:31:39.745 --> 00:31:41.665
Xiuhong House was running
a brothel in secret,

00:31:41.745 --> 00:31:43.625
imprisoning former palace maids
and forcing them to serve guests.

00:31:43.705 --> 00:31:45.225
Remonstrator Lu was there last night.

00:31:45.305 --> 00:31:47.545
I can't release him.

00:31:48.785 --> 00:31:50.145
But has he been convicted?

00:31:51.945 --> 00:31:53.985
Are you here to supervise
my investigation, Eunuch Guo?

00:31:54.065 --> 00:31:55.865
No, I wouldn't dare.

00:31:55.945 --> 00:31:57.425
It's just…

00:31:57.505 --> 00:32:00.025
If someone wants to bring this matter
before His Majesty,

00:32:00.105 --> 00:32:01.225
then I'll make a trip with you.

00:32:13.425 --> 00:32:14.665
Greetings from Li Peiyi to Your Majesty.

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:33.105
Your Majesty, please hear me out.

00:32:36.305 --> 00:32:37.665
Last night at Xiuhong House,

00:32:37.745 --> 00:32:40.145
I saw with my own eyes a secret brothel

00:32:40.225 --> 00:32:41.665
where former palace maids
were forced into prostitution.

00:32:41.745 --> 00:32:43.665
Hanxiao, the victim
of the "Flower on the Wall" case,

00:32:43.745 --> 00:32:45.625
was likely imprisoned there as well.

00:32:45.705 --> 00:32:48.305
I saw and heard it clearly.

00:32:48.385 --> 00:32:49.985
Remonstrator Lu was present.

00:32:50.065 --> 00:32:51.985
But I just can't find evidence
to convict him.

00:32:52.065 --> 00:32:54.545
Your Majesty, this is truly unfair!

00:32:54.625 --> 00:32:56.065
How dare you even say that?

00:32:56.145 --> 00:32:58.425
You disguised yourself as a courtesan
and went to such a filthy place.

00:32:58.505 --> 00:33:00.785
Do you care nothing
for your own reputation

00:33:00.865 --> 00:33:03.105
or for the royal family's dignity?

00:33:03.185 --> 00:33:07.105
So, Your Majesty believes
I haven't wronged Lu Zhenglian?

00:33:09.145 --> 00:33:10.745
If Xiuhong House
has truly imprisoned palace maids

00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:13.265
and run a secret brothel

00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:15.545
serving the powerful,
they will be severely punished.

00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:19.505
But you can't detain
a fourth-rank minister on your word alone.

00:33:19.585 --> 00:33:21.905
- I'm searching for evidence.
- Then he isn't guilty for now.

00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:23.985
Is Your Majesty shielding him?

00:33:26.825 --> 00:33:28.025
What is
the Palace Investigation Bureau for, then?

00:33:28.105 --> 00:33:29.585
What use are laws and regulations?

00:33:29.665 --> 00:33:32.545
Your Majesty's attitude
is what truly damages royal dignity.

00:33:33.705 --> 00:33:36.585
How bold you are! And you tried to dodge?

00:33:41.385 --> 00:33:43.905
See for yourself.
After the commotion you caused last night,

00:33:43.985 --> 00:33:47.265
how many memorials
have landed on my desk this morning?

00:33:58.505 --> 00:34:00.105
I'm investigating
in accordance with the law.

00:34:00.185 --> 00:34:01.025
I'm not afraid of their petitions.

00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:02.945
The petitions aren't about you.

00:34:03.025 --> 00:34:04.545
They're about Lu Zhenglian,

00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:08.225
accusing him of neglecting his duties.

00:34:10.264 --> 00:34:13.744
They want Your Majesty to intervene,
to let you know

00:34:13.824 --> 00:34:15.425
I'm holding Lu Zhenglian
at the Palace Investigation Bureau?

00:34:15.505 --> 00:34:16.585
Do you know why they dared

00:34:16.665 --> 00:34:18.945
to join forces and submit
all these memorials?

00:34:19.545 --> 00:34:21.744
Don't you think they know I favor you?

00:34:21.824 --> 00:34:24.344
Don't you think they expected
you'd come here to tell me all this?

00:34:25.025 --> 00:34:26.185
They dare threaten even Your Majesty?

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:27.344
This isn't a threat.

00:34:27.425 --> 00:34:29.465
If there had been evidence, it would be.

00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:32.025
But without evidence,
they're simply making a plea,

00:34:32.105 --> 00:34:33.145
asking for justice
for a fourth-rank minister

00:34:33.225 --> 00:34:34.625
they believe
has been wrongfully imprisoned.

00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:39.344
They really are cunning.

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:41.665
I was too careless.

00:34:41.744 --> 00:34:45.344
For now, Lu Zhenglian's only wrongdoing
is drinking and staying at Swallow House

00:34:45.425 --> 00:34:46.705
on a workday.

00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:47.625
I'll release him right away.

00:34:47.705 --> 00:34:48.705
You're still going to investigate?

00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:50.465
Of course.

00:34:50.985 --> 00:34:53.185
Only by finding evidence
and convicting Lu Zhenglian

00:34:53.264 --> 00:34:54.425
can I make things right for Your Majesty.

00:34:54.505 --> 00:34:56.465
What do you mean,
"make things right" for me?

00:34:56.545 --> 00:34:57.385
I misspoke.

00:34:57.985 --> 00:34:59.785
Only then can I bring justice
for the palace maids

00:34:59.865 --> 00:35:01.105
and restore the royal family's honor.

00:35:02.545 --> 00:35:03.745
Enough. Get out!

00:35:12.985 --> 00:35:14.025
How did it go?

00:35:15.425 --> 00:35:16.585
Release Lu Zhenglian.

00:35:19.625 --> 00:35:22.785
I'm afraid someone's
already come to collect him.

00:35:23.785 --> 00:35:25.785
It's getting late. We need
to head to Swallow House now.

00:35:25.865 --> 00:35:28.025
Your Ladyship, your arm needs tending,

00:35:28.105 --> 00:35:29.385
or the wound could get infected
and leave a scar.

00:35:29.465 --> 00:35:31.065
That's what I want.

00:35:34.505 --> 00:35:37.305
Does this remind you of Hanxiao's scars?

00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:40.185
Was Hanxiao abused
by Lu Zhenglian before she died?

00:35:41.265 --> 00:35:43.185
We'll know once it scars.

00:35:43.265 --> 00:35:45.825
They want evidence,
so I'll find it for them.

00:35:50.825 --> 00:35:53.985
Mr. Xiao, you were right.

00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:57.465
She's a lot like me, only crazier.

00:35:58.345 --> 00:36:01.705
She doesn't care about her own well-being

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:03.545
or life.

00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:06.505
She'll risk anything to solve a case.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:10.465
I've been watching over her
all these years.

00:36:11.105 --> 00:36:12.545
She's gotten into plenty of minor trouble,

00:36:13.225 --> 00:36:14.345
but at least

00:36:14.425 --> 00:36:17.545
she's made it this far in one piece.

00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:19.905
Mr. Xiao,

00:36:23.705 --> 00:36:24.905
I'm getting old.

00:36:25.425 --> 00:36:26.585
It's time I retired.

00:36:26.665 --> 00:36:29.065
I've put in my request.

00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:32.785
Once it's approved,
I'll be leaving the palace.

00:36:34.105 --> 00:36:37.345
I used to worry about her

00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:40.385
getting into trouble without me around.

00:36:40.465 --> 00:36:41.985
But now,

00:36:42.745 --> 00:36:44.185
I think she'll be fine.

00:36:45.465 --> 00:36:48.385
- Thank you for everything.
- Inspector Du,

00:36:48.985 --> 00:36:50.585
I don't quite follow.

00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:52.385
No need to say more.

00:36:52.985 --> 00:36:54.105
You're a smart man.

00:36:54.185 --> 00:36:57.425
If I go on, it'll sound
like a deathbed entrustment.

00:36:57.505 --> 00:37:00.225
I don't want to jinx myself.

00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:01.225
Deathbed entrustment?

00:37:04.265 --> 00:37:06.185
Shouldn't you go after her?

00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:08.025
She's nearly out of the palace now.

00:37:14.945 --> 00:37:18.065
SWALLOW HOUSE

00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:24.345
ROUGE AND LAUGHTER - SILK AND SONG

00:37:25.585 --> 00:37:26.785
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:37:29.745 --> 00:37:31.585
Here's your tea.

00:37:31.665 --> 00:37:33.985
There was quite
a commotion here last night.

00:37:34.865 --> 00:37:36.185
First time for us, too.

00:37:36.265 --> 00:37:38.585
The boss was furious.

00:37:38.665 --> 00:37:41.385
The worker involved was fired before dawn.

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:43.825
Remonstrator Lu fell down the stairs.

00:37:43.905 --> 00:37:45.025
Why fire a worker?

00:37:46.265 --> 00:37:48.025
Enjoy your tea.

00:37:48.105 --> 00:37:48.985
Wait.

00:37:51.665 --> 00:37:53.585
- What is this?
- Money for your story.

00:37:53.665 --> 00:37:54.505
Will you tell me?

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:03.665
Here we have a prize called
"Hundred Birds Return to Nest."

00:38:03.745 --> 00:38:05.465
It's the most expensive in the house,

00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:07.065
worth 50 liang of gold.

00:38:07.745 --> 00:38:09.065
That much?

00:38:13.025 --> 00:38:15.545
On the third day of the fifth month,
at the second ke of the Xu hour,

00:38:15.625 --> 00:38:19.465
Mr. Lu presents Miss Miao
with Swallow House's top prize,

00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:21.785
"Hundred Birds Return to Nest"!

00:38:21.865 --> 00:38:22.865
- Nice!
- Wonderful!

00:38:23.465 --> 00:38:24.145
Announce it to the whole house.

00:38:24.225 --> 00:38:25.065
- Yes.
- Hurry, go.

00:38:26.585 --> 00:38:28.385
- The boss had us
- On the third day of the fifth month,

00:38:28.465 --> 00:38:29.985
- go around the whole house, calling out,
- at the second ke of the Xu hour…

00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:32.145
"On the third day of the fifth month,
at the second ke of the Xu hour,

00:38:32.225 --> 00:38:35.385
Mr. Lu presents Miss Miao
with Swallow House's top prize,

00:38:35.465 --> 00:38:36.585
'Hundred Birds Return to Nest!'"

00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:39.665
Please welcome Mr. Lu!

00:38:42.105 --> 00:38:43.305
Where is he?

00:38:43.385 --> 00:38:44.585
Where is Mr. Lu?

00:38:44.665 --> 00:38:47.345
But Mr. Lu never showed up.

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:48.705
Instead, Remonstrator Lu did.

00:38:49.825 --> 00:38:51.345
Ying'er! Ying'er!

00:38:51.425 --> 00:38:53.025
Let me explain. Slow down!

00:38:53.105 --> 00:38:54.145
Ying'er,

00:38:54.225 --> 00:38:55.305
slow down.

00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:57.225
Move aside! Ying'er!

00:38:57.305 --> 00:38:58.705
Let me explain, Ying'er.

00:38:59.465 --> 00:39:01.145
- Ying'er, hear me out.
- Leave me alone!

00:39:06.545 --> 00:39:09.585
- Master Lu!
- Remonstrator Lu's tumble

00:39:09.665 --> 00:39:10.825
made quite a scene,

00:39:10.905 --> 00:39:12.785
and everyone soon forgot about Mr. Lu.

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:14.625
Master Lu,

00:39:15.345 --> 00:39:16.585
are you all right?

00:39:17.265 --> 00:39:18.745
Mr. Lu spent a fortune,

00:39:18.825 --> 00:39:20.425
but Remonstrator Lu stole the spotlight,

00:39:20.505 --> 00:39:24.145
showing up at Swallow House on a workday.

00:39:24.225 --> 00:39:25.945
What was meant to be a joyful event

00:39:26.025 --> 00:39:27.585
ended up as a laughingstock
across Daozheng Ward.

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:30.105
So our boss told us
never to mention it again.

00:39:30.185 --> 00:39:33.345
Is Mr. Lu a regular here?

00:39:33.425 --> 00:39:35.185
No, he was new.

00:39:35.265 --> 00:39:37.545
It was his first time here,
and he spent lavishly.

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:40.345
But I doubt he'll ever be back.

00:39:42.585 --> 00:39:44.585
He won't be coming back.

00:39:44.665 --> 00:39:46.385
In fact, I doubt this Mr. Lu even exists.

00:39:48.025 --> 00:39:49.305
Do you keep a water clock here?

00:39:50.145 --> 00:39:52.665
Ordinary businesses
can't afford a water clock.

00:39:52.745 --> 00:39:56.025
Then how did your boss know
the time so precisely?

00:39:56.105 --> 00:39:58.505
One of the staff
probably asked the night watchman

00:39:58.585 --> 00:40:00.545
and reported it to the boss.

00:40:00.625 --> 00:40:02.265
Enjoy your tea.

00:40:06.905 --> 00:40:08.065
SWALLOW HOUSE

00:40:08.145 --> 00:40:09.385
I've told you everything.

00:40:09.465 --> 00:40:12.945
Remonstrator Lu stayed in his private room
until he was taken away.

00:40:13.025 --> 00:40:14.425
That's the truth.

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.265
Even before His Majesty,

00:40:16.865 --> 00:40:18.345
I'd say the same thing.

00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:21.985
That's not what we're here to ask.

00:40:22.065 --> 00:40:23.985
Last night, you and Remonstrator Lu

00:40:24.065 --> 00:40:26.785
played music, admired the moon,
and composed poems.

00:40:26.865 --> 00:40:28.265
The moonlight must have been beautiful.

00:40:29.465 --> 00:40:30.305
It was.

00:40:31.105 --> 00:40:33.345
The crescent moon
hung above the willow branches.

00:40:34.065 --> 00:40:36.225
Master Lu even wrote lyrics for a piece,

00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:38.665
"Mist shrouds a silver boat.

00:40:38.745 --> 00:40:40.025
The moonlight crowns the flowers.

00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:41.585
The heart is drawn

00:40:43.225 --> 00:40:44.105
to the beauty."

00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:48.865
Did he write these lyrics before he fell?

00:40:49.665 --> 00:40:50.545
Yes.

00:40:51.065 --> 00:40:54.025
After his fall,
he stayed on the couch to rest

00:40:54.105 --> 00:40:57.505
until you arrived.

00:40:58.585 --> 00:40:59.705
Have you noticed something?

00:41:00.305 --> 00:41:02.225
I need to return
to the Astronomical Bureau to confirm it.

00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:16.665
Who's there?

00:41:18.305 --> 00:41:21.065
Remonstrator Lu, I've found
the evidence as you demanded.

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.705
Come with me once more.
