=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 23=

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.527
Victim Liu Min,

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:18.006
female, 47 years old,

00:01:18.247 --> 00:01:18.807
from Yushan,

00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:20.607
with theft and fraud convictions

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.807
and wanted by police for multiple counts
of child trafficking.

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:26.406
She used a lost ID card.

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:30.126
Liu Jianyuan's DNA
was found under her fingernails.

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:32.047
Suspected to be from a struggle.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.206
Liu Jianyuan,

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.807
male, 46 years old,

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:37.167
also from Yushan.

00:01:38.206 --> 00:01:39.766
He served time for robbery and assault.

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.406
Like Liu Min, he's also a suspect

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:44.687
of child trafficking.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:47.607
So they were both traffickers.

00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:50.006
So it was criminals
turning on each other.

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.047
Total infighting.

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:52.607
Wait.

00:01:52.607 --> 00:01:54.687
We're not sure
it was definitely Liu Jianyuan.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:55.807
Well...

00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:00.447
Surveillance footage captured
Liu Jianyuan entering the hotel.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.167
At 6 PM two days ago,

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.366
Liu Jianyuan entered
through the hotel's main entrance.

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:06.967
He passed the front desk,
took the elevator to the sixth floor,

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:09.086
and went to Room 601.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:10.407
Liu Min opened the door for him.

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:14.447
Later, Liu Min went downstairs
to get food and returned to the room.

00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:18.447
The next time Liu Jianyuan was caught
on camera was at 2:10 AM yesterday

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:20.407
when he left the room.

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:21.887
He didn't take the elevator.

00:02:22.047 --> 00:02:25.407
Instead, he took
the unmonitored fire escape stairs down

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:27.526
and left
through the back-door parking lot.

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:31.727
Surveillance shows

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:33.287
that Rose Garden Hotel's Room 601

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:36.206
had no one else enter
besides Liu Min and Liu Jianyuan.

00:02:36.607 --> 00:02:37.567
During the crime's

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:38.926
estimated time,

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:42.287
the front desk called Room 601
due to a noise complaint.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.447
A man answered.

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:46.686
Has Liu Min's phone been found?

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:47.727
Not yet.

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:51.766
These two traffickers came to Yunxi
surely not to commit crimes again?

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:55.086
I've hit another dead end.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:56.926
The train station is right next door.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.686
If they bought tickets
and boarded a train,

00:02:58.847 --> 00:03:00.366
they probably used fake IDs too.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.366
Where do we go from here?

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:07.007
The train station
is literally steps away.

00:03:07.127 --> 00:03:09.407
Most motorcycle taxis
wouldn't take such a short fare.

00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:11.727
Especially for a place you can walk to.

00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:13.966
From Liu Jianyuan's perspective,

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:16.086
whether for cost or safety,

00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:18.486
taking a motorcycle taxi
shouldn't have been necessary.

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:23.646
Captain Leng, I think we should
first find that motorcycle taxi driver

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:26.447
and figure out Liu Jianyuan's
whereabouts ASAP.

00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:30.047
We must check Liu Min's ticket purchases
using Mai Qianqian's ID.

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.246
They both stayed near the train station.

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:33.766
They might have arrived by train

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:34.806
or be leaving by train.

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:38.447
If tickets were bought online, we should
be able to find Liu Min's phone number.

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:40.607
Not bad, Wang Tong.

00:03:40.926 --> 00:03:42.486
Your analysis is spot on.

00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:43.327
Get moving.

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:57.206
(Yunxi)

00:03:57.206 --> 00:03:58.526
This is way too blurry.

00:03:58.526 --> 00:04:00.167
I can't make out the face at all.

00:04:01.447 --> 00:04:03.287
The bike's common
without a license plate.

00:04:03.447 --> 00:04:04.607
Our bikes all look the same.

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:06.206
There's no way to tell who's who.

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:07.047
Exactly.

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.447
So many guys
work the train station area alone.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:11.007
Can't help you, officer.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.806
Everyone, listen up.
No need to be nervous.

00:04:15.127 --> 00:04:17.287
We're looking for this driver

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:19.047
to gather passenger info.

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:20.167
Nothing else.

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:26.847
Let me share a bit more.

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:30.087
The man we're looking for
is a human trafficker.

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:31.607
A human trafficker?

00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:35.207
You cops have to tell the truth.

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:37.207
Don't worry, I guarantee it.

00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:42.006
The driver you're looking for
is from my hometown.

00:04:42.527 --> 00:04:44.006
I'll text him to come over.

00:04:51.926 --> 00:04:53.167
I remember that guy.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.207
That early morning,

00:04:56.207 --> 00:04:57.686
he got on at Rose Garden's back door.

00:04:58.607 --> 00:05:02.207
I'd just dropped off someone
rushing for a train

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:05.287
and was thinking of resting
inside the station

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:06.686
and grabbing a bite.

00:05:08.486 --> 00:05:10.407
So, do you remember where you took him?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.632
Tech University Staff Community.

00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:14.287
Not exactly close.

00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:16.486
But he paid well,

00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:17.647
so I took the fare.

00:05:18.607 --> 00:05:20.246
Remember anything more specific?

00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:21.647
Building? Apartment?

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.407
That community
doesn't let outside vehicles in.

00:05:26.607 --> 00:05:28.967
About which building, I...

00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:31.767
I just remember him making a call

00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:33.967
and telling me to stop
at the north gate.

00:05:34.527 --> 00:05:36.407
Was it Building 11

00:05:36.407 --> 00:05:38.566
or Building 17?

00:05:39.686 --> 00:05:41.006
That guy's accent was too thick.

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:42.407
I didn't catch it clearly.

00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:43.806
Thank you.

00:05:56.767 --> 00:05:59.647
Property management said
Building 17 is near the north gate.

00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:01.566
Residents of Building 11 usually

00:06:01.566 --> 00:06:03.087
don't use the farther north gate.

00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:06.246
Building 17 has four entrances.

00:06:06.486 --> 00:06:08.207
Five floors make it
20 households in total.

00:06:08.607 --> 00:06:09.607
If we do a full sweep...

00:06:09.607 --> 00:06:11.207
A full sweep isn't practical.

00:06:11.686 --> 00:06:15.607
We might alert Liu Jianyuan
if he's here.

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.207
Let's go check it out.

00:06:30.806 --> 00:06:31.967
I called the police.

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:33.207
I didn't do it.

00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:33.847
City CID.

00:06:33.847 --> 00:06:35.446
I came up to have dinner with my friend.

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:37.496
Opening the door,
I found him on the floor.

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:38.847
Blood was on the floor and walls.

00:06:38.847 --> 00:06:41.047
I... I really don't know what happened.

00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:42.647
City CID.

00:06:42.647 --> 00:06:43.407
What happened?

00:06:44.287 --> 00:06:45.246
We received a report.

00:06:45.246 --> 00:06:46.767
It's said someone died upstairs.

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:47.686
He reported it.

00:06:48.647 --> 00:06:50.607
My friend was killed up there.

00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:51.407
It's all over...

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:52.647
Your friend's name?

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:53.967
Liu Jianyuan.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.926
You should go up and see.

00:06:58.926 --> 00:07:00.167
It's too horrible.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:01.287
It's Room 502.

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:01.967
I'll take you up.

00:07:02.446 --> 00:07:03.486
We'll take it from here.

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:05.006
Okay.

00:07:06.087 --> 00:07:08.446
Did you know
Liu Jianyuan was a fugitive?

00:07:09.287 --> 00:07:10.366
I truly didn't know.

00:07:10.686 --> 00:07:13.126
I'd have reported him immediately
if I knew.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:15.847
What did he do this time?

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:19.246
When did he contact you?

00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:20.006
And why?

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:20.806
Officers,

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:23.407
he called me before dawn
the day before yesterday.

00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:25.446
Said he came to Yunxi
for urgent business

00:07:25.967 --> 00:07:28.326
and needed a place
to stay after arriving.

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:31.486
My old place's tenant just moved out.

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:33.047
So I brought him here.

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:36.446
You two are close, huh?

00:07:37.047 --> 00:07:38.767
N-not really, not really.

00:07:39.407 --> 00:07:41.847
He just looked out for me in prison.

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:43.167
We got along okay.

00:07:43.686 --> 00:07:44.886
How did you find him dead?

00:07:45.126 --> 00:07:45.847
Officers,

00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:50.006
I planned to treat him to dinner.

00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:52.647
I called him multiple times.
But he didn't answer.

00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:54.246
I thought he was sleeping in.

00:07:54.246 --> 00:07:55.446
But then a whole day passed.

00:07:55.727 --> 00:07:57.287
I got worried and came to check.

00:07:57.486 --> 00:07:58.926
He didn't answer when I knocked.

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.207
So I used the spare key.

00:08:01.366 --> 00:08:03.047
Right when I entered,

00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:05.607
I saw him lying there... dead.

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:39.726
Get in.

00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:40.086
Yes.

00:08:44.726 --> 00:08:45.367
Captain Leng.

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:48.446
Fifth floor.

00:08:52.127 --> 00:08:52.606
Ye.

00:09:29.887 --> 00:09:32.086
Tell us about your meeting
with Liu Jianyuan.

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:33.487
Officers.

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:38.047
He called me around 2 AM the night
before last, saying he was coming over.

00:09:38.206 --> 00:09:39.367
I live nearby,

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:40.527
so I waited downstairs.

00:09:41.007 --> 00:09:42.806
I brought him up and chatted a bit.

00:09:43.287 --> 00:09:44.446
Then I went home.

00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:46.966
What was his condition then?

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:48.206
Condition?

00:09:49.007 --> 00:09:50.007
Hard to say.

00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:52.007
Seemed nervous.

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:54.007
Can't really put it into words.

00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:56.664
What did you do the last two days?

00:09:57.007 --> 00:09:58.086
Any alibis?

00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:59.047
Y-yes.

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:01.167
My wife, kids,
and mother-in-law were home.

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:02.926
My wife was upset

00:10:02.926 --> 00:10:04.806
that I lent the place to a friend.

00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:06.407
We argued about it several times.

00:10:07.086 --> 00:10:09.047
We even called
the local police yesterday.

00:10:10.287 --> 00:10:12.287
For reformed people like me,

00:10:12.287 --> 00:10:13.407
trying to restart our lives,

00:10:13.966 --> 00:10:15.167
the government keeps watch...

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:16.007
No.

00:10:16.007 --> 00:10:18.686
I mean, the government cares about us.

00:10:19.566 --> 00:10:21.287
Knowing they care about you,

00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:23.206
shouldn't you cooperate fully?

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:23.647
Yes.

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:24.247
Right?

00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:24.887
Right.

00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:28.287
So you were on good terms, yes?

00:10:28.487 --> 00:10:29.167
No.

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:30.167
No.

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:31.606
Long time no contact.

00:10:31.606 --> 00:10:32.487
What? What's going on?

00:10:33.527 --> 00:10:34.446
Not telling the truth?

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:35.767
It's truth.

00:10:35.926 --> 00:10:36.887
In 2012,

00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:39.206
Liu Jianyuan got out, right?

00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:39.846
Right.

00:10:40.127 --> 00:10:41.326
He still had your number.

00:10:41.887 --> 00:10:43.966
He called you at midnight, and you went.

00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:46.407
You argued with your wife,
and despite that,

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.167
you still lent your place to him.

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:50.606
And you weren't on good terms?

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:52.566
What?

00:10:53.007 --> 00:10:53.887
Want more jail time?

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.966
No. I'll talk. I'll talk.

00:10:56.566 --> 00:10:57.887
We rarely contacted each other.

00:10:58.047 --> 00:10:59.887
Just exchanged greetings during holidays

00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:01.686
and chatted occasionally.

00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:05.367
Well, he did help me out
back in the day.

00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:07.367
A man should repay kindness, right?

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:08.446
As the saying goes,

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:09.846
more friends, more paths.

00:11:10.287 --> 00:11:13.686
I... I... I...

00:11:13.686 --> 00:11:14.487
Anything else?

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:16.726
I hadn't seen him in years.

00:11:19.247 --> 00:11:20.487
When he first came in,

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:22.407
there seemed to be something
on his sleeve.

00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:25.167
Looked... looked like blood.

00:11:25.527 --> 00:11:26.326
Go on.

00:11:26.407 --> 00:11:27.926
I asked him about it.

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:31.326
He said he got into a fight
on the way over.

00:11:31.767 --> 00:11:33.726
I didn't dare ask any more.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:35.367
And?

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:36.527
That's all?

00:11:37.367 --> 00:11:38.167
That's all.

00:11:38.487 --> 00:11:40.367
Really, nothing else.

00:11:44.206 --> 00:11:47.287
Liu Jianyuan's time of death
was between 4 AM and 5 AM yesterday.

00:11:48.527 --> 00:11:52.206
The COD was brain injury
caused by blunt head trauma.

00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:55.367
The murder weapon
was the vase found at the scene.

00:11:55.926 --> 00:11:59.767
Also, we found traces of Liu Min's blood
on Liu Jianyuan's coat.

00:12:04.647 --> 00:12:05.487
About the vase,

00:12:05.487 --> 00:12:06.647
we confirmed with the owner.

00:12:06.647 --> 00:12:08.367
It belonged to the place.

00:12:08.606 --> 00:12:09.287
No signs

00:12:09.287 --> 00:12:11.326
of forced entry were found at the scene.

00:12:11.326 --> 00:12:13.487
The place was always rented out.

00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:14.926
People came and went frequently.

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:16.726
Fingerprints inside were quite messy.

00:12:16.726 --> 00:12:18.926
No valuable leads have been found yet.

00:12:19.326 --> 00:12:21.127
So, either the killer had a key

00:12:21.726 --> 00:12:23.527
or Liu Jianyuan opened the door himself.

00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:24.527
Hard to say.

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.326
Liu Jianyuan wasn't local.

00:12:30.407 --> 00:12:31.367
He was a wanted man.

00:12:31.926 --> 00:12:34.606
Not many people knew he came to Yunxi.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:36.407
Could it be

00:12:36.566 --> 00:12:38.086
that Li Feng did it?

00:12:38.487 --> 00:12:39.446
We checked that.

00:12:39.647 --> 00:12:43.287
Li Feng hasn't had much contact
with Liu Jianyuan in recent years.

00:12:43.407 --> 00:12:44.686
He also lacks a motive.

00:12:46.487 --> 00:12:47.127
Captain Leng,

00:12:47.846 --> 00:12:50.407
Tech University Staff Community is old,

00:12:50.407 --> 00:12:53.726
but the surveillance
is better than we thought.

00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:55.966
The east, south, and north gates,

00:12:55.966 --> 00:12:58.806
and every building entrance,
have cameras.

00:13:00.767 --> 00:13:03.726
This is Liu Jianyuan
entering the community.

00:13:06.726 --> 00:13:12.367
This is the owner, Li Feng,
and Liu Jianyuan entering Building 17.

00:13:14.247 --> 00:13:16.647
Liu Jianyuan
entered the community at 3:10 AM.

00:13:17.487 --> 00:13:21.326
After Li Feng
went upstairs with Liu Jianyuan,

00:13:21.887 --> 00:13:23.167
he didn't stay long.

00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:25.086
It was about 15 minutes total.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:29.806
So Li Feng didn't have time
to commit the crime.

00:13:31.566 --> 00:13:35.287
Someone like Liu Jianyuan
must have pissed off plenty of people.

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.926
Maybe there are others
we don't know about watching him.

00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:40.206
Jiao,

00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:43.726
did the entry or exit surveillance
catch anyone suspicious?

00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:51.407
From when Li Feng left at 3:30 AM
until 6:00 AM the next morning,

00:13:51.527 --> 00:13:53.086
when the first exerciser appeared,

00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:55.206
no one entered or exited
during that time.

00:13:57.127 --> 00:14:00.326
Then, from 6:00 AM,
when the exerciser came out,

00:14:00.326 --> 00:14:02.446
until Li Feng came here to report it

00:14:02.446 --> 00:14:03.407
and you arrived,

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:06.686
apart from delivery
and takeout couriers,

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:09.806
only residents of that building
came and went.

00:14:11.686 --> 00:14:13.686
Get the local police to assist

00:14:14.446 --> 00:14:16.566
in screening the residents
of Building 17

00:14:17.407 --> 00:14:20.407
and rechecking all the delivery
and takeout personnel

00:14:20.407 --> 00:14:21.527
who entered and exited.

00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:23.007
Okay.

00:14:27.606 --> 00:14:29.326
Liu Jianyuan killed Liu Min

00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:30.926
and then got killed by someone else.

00:14:31.127 --> 00:14:32.566
The timing is incredibly tight.

00:14:33.007 --> 00:14:35.566
But we still don't know
why Liu Jianyuan killed Liu Min.

00:14:35.966 --> 00:14:37.686
Neither phone was found at the scene.

00:14:38.127 --> 00:14:39.647
Could the killer have taken them?

00:14:40.726 --> 00:14:42.726
Liu Jianyuan
might not have killed Liu Min.

00:14:43.367 --> 00:14:44.167
Why?

00:14:44.806 --> 00:14:47.926
Current evidence shows only
that Liu Jianyuan and Liu Min fought.

00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:50.326
But there was a secondary blow,

00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:54.606
and Liu Jianyuan's coat showed no traces
of brain tissue or cerebrospinal fluid.

00:14:55.287 --> 00:14:56.326
From the surveillance,

00:14:56.326 --> 00:14:58.527
Liu Min packed fried leek-stuffed pastry
as takeout.

00:14:58.527 --> 00:14:59.846
But the autopsy results show

00:14:59.846 --> 00:15:02.407
no leeks in Liu Jianyuan
or Liu Min's stomach contents.

00:15:04.887 --> 00:15:05.887
Are you suggesting

00:15:05.887 --> 00:15:08.167
there was another person at the scene?

00:15:08.966 --> 00:15:09.726
And this person

00:15:09.726 --> 00:15:12.726
killed Liu Min after Liu Jianyuan fled

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:16.407
and also ate fried leek-stuffed pastry?

00:15:16.647 --> 00:15:19.606
But the surveillance shows
no one else entered that room

00:15:19.606 --> 00:15:21.446
besides Liu Jianyuan and Liu Min.

00:15:21.726 --> 00:15:22.407
Exactly.

00:15:22.566 --> 00:15:24.487
So if this person really exists,

00:15:24.647 --> 00:15:26.127
did he scale walls

00:15:26.127 --> 00:15:27.206
or walk on clouds?

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.367
Is this Journey to the West?
Think he's Sun Wukong?

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:30.686
Maybe Spider-Man?

00:15:30.846 --> 00:15:33.167
Enough joking. Be serious.

00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:38.206
Could the hotel's surveillance footage
be faulty?

00:15:38.446 --> 00:15:39.127
Master,

00:15:39.887 --> 00:15:41.784
in a case in the neighboring province
last year,

00:15:41.926 --> 00:15:45.127
the suspect entered through
the drainpipes to commit the crime.

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:49.287
What if the suspect in this case
entered the hotel the same way?

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:07.726
Is it sturdy enough?

00:16:07.726 --> 00:16:08.767
Can it hold?

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.047
I don't want to get killed.

00:16:11.007 --> 00:16:11.606
Hurry up.

00:16:12.767 --> 00:16:13.566
Get moving.

00:16:15.487 --> 00:16:16.527
It's so high up.

00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:19.686
I barely got this borrowed. Hurry.

00:16:29.247 --> 00:16:30.086
Come on.

00:16:41.446 --> 00:16:42.247
Anything?

00:16:43.846 --> 00:16:44.446
No.

00:16:44.846 --> 00:16:45.487
Check higher up.

00:17:03.527 --> 00:17:04.166
Anything?

00:17:18.727 --> 00:17:19.886
- Anything here?
- Stop.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:34.767
Will it work?

00:17:35.326 --> 00:17:36.126
No problem.

00:17:36.767 --> 00:17:38.767
Modern drainpipes
are made of PVC material.

00:17:38.846 --> 00:17:39.646
Very slippery.

00:17:39.806 --> 00:17:40.927
Couldn't climb with gloves.

00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:42.126
So there must be fingerprints.

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:48.166
Are the pipes at the Tech University
Staff Community also made of PVC?

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:56.007
Yes.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.606
So we have to climb again?

00:18:02.086 --> 00:18:02.886
Master,

00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:07.126
at both crime scenes,

00:18:07.727 --> 00:18:11.166
climbing traces were found
on the external drainpipes.

00:18:11.527 --> 00:18:12.846
We've compared the fingerprints.

00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:13.927
They have the same owner.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.406
Currently known to be male,

00:18:15.406 --> 00:18:17.086
not tall, and slightly thin.

00:18:17.086 --> 00:18:18.566
Very likely a teenager.

00:18:18.687 --> 00:18:19.566
A teenager?

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:21.527
Yes.

00:18:21.727 --> 00:18:23.967
Analysis of the fingerprint
ridge spacing indicates

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:27.247
this person's fingerprints
are still in the developmental stage.

00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:28.687
He should be around 18 years old.

00:18:30.886 --> 00:18:34.566
Are you saying the suspect
for both cases is the same person?

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:36.406
And a teenager?

00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:41.166
We can't yet confirm
the suspect is a teenager,

00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:42.646
but he was at both scenes.

00:18:42.886 --> 00:18:46.566
Fingerprints were found inside
and outside the entry window frames.

00:18:47.687 --> 00:18:49.927
I'll go cross-check

00:18:50.007 --> 00:18:53.527
the fingerprints found now
against all previously found ones.

00:18:53.527 --> 00:18:55.687
See if any matches come up.

00:18:55.687 --> 00:18:57.007
Let me catch my breath first.

00:18:57.007 --> 00:18:57.606
Also,

00:18:58.406 --> 00:19:04.126
here's the investigation into taxis
near Rose Garden Hotel post-incident.

00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:05.927
This taxi

00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:10.846
picked up a passenger around 2 AM
on the night of the crime.

00:19:11.126 --> 00:19:13.287
The driver said the passenger
seemed like a student.

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:14.727
He was not tall, slightly thin,

00:19:14.846 --> 00:19:16.846
wearing sportswear,
and carrying a backpack.

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:18.687
Also headed to
Tech University Staff Community.

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:25.886
This is the surveillance footage

00:19:25.886 --> 00:19:28.606
from the community's east gate
during that time frame.

00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:35.366
This person
should match your description.

00:19:36.326 --> 00:19:37.487
Can we see his face clearly?

00:19:38.007 --> 00:19:39.447
No, this is the maximum zoom.

00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:43.366
Liu Jianyuan seeking refuge
with Li Feng was a sudden development.

00:19:43.487 --> 00:19:45.967
So how did this kid know
to come to this community?

00:19:47.007 --> 00:19:48.166
If he tailed Liu Jianyuan,

00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.287
timing-wise, it's unlikely.

00:19:49.527 --> 00:19:51.247
The taxi driver
didn't mention that either.

00:19:51.687 --> 00:19:54.126
So he must have gotten it from Liu Min.

00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:55.527
You're saying

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:56.646
he interrogated Liu Min

00:19:56.646 --> 00:19:57.646
and killed her

00:19:57.646 --> 00:19:59.166
and then rushed to this community

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:00.326
and killed Liu Jianyuan?

00:20:00.487 --> 00:20:02.687
Look at him. Does he even look 18?

00:20:03.007 --> 00:20:04.326
Could he pull that off?

00:20:04.447 --> 00:20:06.886
And what kind of deep hatred
would drive this?

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:08.047
Jiao,

00:20:08.806 --> 00:20:10.447
find a way to enhance this image.

00:20:10.767 --> 00:20:14.007
Cross-reference it with the cases
Liu Jianyuan and Liu Min were in.

00:20:14.366 --> 00:20:15.687
Wait, you mean

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:16.846
this kid...

00:20:17.366 --> 00:20:19.767
Unfortunately, we couldn't extract DNA
from the fingerprints.

00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:27.447
Hello?

00:20:28.846 --> 00:20:29.606
Son.

00:20:31.326 --> 00:20:32.287
You'll come tomorrow?

00:20:33.086 --> 00:20:34.126
Did your mother agree?

00:20:35.366 --> 00:20:36.646
Alright, okay.

00:20:36.646 --> 00:20:37.447
See you tomorrow.

00:20:43.886 --> 00:20:45.967
A package was found
at the city police entrance.

00:20:45.967 --> 00:20:48.047
It's addressed to the chief.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.086
We checked. Nothing dangerous.

00:20:50.086 --> 00:20:53.287
But it's related to your case.

00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:55.007
Two cell phones.

00:21:16.007 --> 00:21:16.846
Sweetie.

00:21:17.967 --> 00:21:19.007
Why are you here?

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:21.487
Are you hungry?

00:21:23.287 --> 00:21:23.927
Let me see.

00:21:25.047 --> 00:21:25.846
What's wrong?

00:21:27.606 --> 00:21:28.806
Hungry? Come on.

00:21:29.207 --> 00:21:30.646
I'll feed you something.

00:21:31.406 --> 00:21:32.687
I've got tasty treats here.

00:21:33.606 --> 00:21:34.166
Come.

00:21:35.326 --> 00:21:36.086
Don't rush.

00:21:36.727 --> 00:21:37.366
Just a moment.

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:38.447
Come here.

00:21:38.447 --> 00:21:39.846
Eat here. Come on.

00:21:41.447 --> 00:21:42.366
You look starved.

00:21:44.566 --> 00:21:46.447
Come to me anytime you're hungry.

00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:48.366
I'm never short on food.

00:21:48.366 --> 00:21:49.247
I've got everything.

00:22:03.846 --> 00:22:04.566
Captain Leng,

00:22:04.806 --> 00:22:06.727
Lei says the phone number
that sent the video

00:22:06.727 --> 00:22:08.207
should yield results tomorrow.

00:22:08.406 --> 00:22:09.007
Good.

00:22:10.527 --> 00:22:13.527
I heard Xiaoyu is coming tomorrow.

00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:15.846
Yeah, he's coming tomorrow.

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:17.406
No one's watching him.

00:22:17.886 --> 00:22:18.806
I figured

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:23.126
he could hang out
with you all at the station.

00:22:23.126 --> 00:22:24.527
Sure, we'll help watch him.

00:22:24.527 --> 00:22:25.086
Okay.

00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:28.927
When I pick up Xiaoyu tomorrow,

00:22:29.727 --> 00:22:31.126
if I'm not back,

00:22:31.487 --> 00:22:33.086
start the meeting once everyone's here.

00:22:36.366 --> 00:22:39.927
Child trafficking cases
have been spiking lately.

00:22:40.126 --> 00:22:42.207
Have you considered
bringing Xiaoyu to live with you?

00:22:42.207 --> 00:22:43.447
Wouldn't that be safer?

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:46.606
Xiaoyu might be better off
with his mother.

00:22:46.606 --> 00:22:47.606
As you can see,

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:50.007
I'm overwhelmed.

00:22:50.007 --> 00:22:51.447
I need to look after my dad too.

00:22:55.527 --> 00:22:56.406
I'll let you work.

00:23:03.704 --> 00:23:05.846
(West Exit)

00:23:05.846 --> 00:23:06.646
Today,

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:09.166
we're walking to the station.

00:23:10.366 --> 00:23:11.767
To get some exercise.

00:23:11.767 --> 00:23:12.967
You need to lose some weight.

00:23:13.967 --> 00:23:14.646
Alright.

00:23:15.086 --> 00:23:16.207
What game are you playing?

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:17.566
All kinds of games.

00:23:17.566 --> 00:23:18.767
You wouldn't understand.

00:23:18.846 --> 00:23:19.646
You know what?

00:23:19.687 --> 00:23:22.927
Officer Long at our station
is really good at them.

00:23:23.447 --> 00:23:24.727
I'll let him teach you sometime.

00:23:25.527 --> 00:23:26.126
Okay.

00:23:28.566 --> 00:23:29.166
Hello?

00:23:31.047 --> 00:23:32.007
I'll be right there.

00:23:33.047 --> 00:23:34.806
Have Ye start the meeting first.

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:35.687
Got it.

00:23:36.287 --> 00:23:37.166
Okay. See you soon.

00:23:37.406 --> 00:23:38.606
Hurry. Run.

00:23:39.047 --> 00:23:40.247
Where are you off to?

00:23:40.247 --> 00:23:41.527
What's wrong with you?

00:23:43.287 --> 00:23:45.047
How dare you hit me!

00:23:45.047 --> 00:23:45.487
Get out!

00:23:45.767 --> 00:23:46.326
You!

00:23:48.606 --> 00:23:49.487
You actually hit me?

00:23:49.487 --> 00:23:50.287
Darn you!

00:23:51.007 --> 00:23:52.767
How dare you hit me!

00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:53.687
You hit me!

00:23:56.366 --> 00:23:57.086
How dare you!

00:23:57.487 --> 00:23:58.326
How dare you!

00:24:01.487 --> 00:24:03.487
This is a video from Liu Min's phone.

00:24:04.447 --> 00:24:08.967
It was sent to her
by an unregistered number.

00:24:10.007 --> 00:24:13.646
Likely filmed outside Room 601
at the Rose Garden Hotel.

00:24:14.207 --> 00:24:16.806
The person filming is probably
the one we're looking for.

00:24:25.086 --> 00:24:25.927
Who are you?

00:24:28.047 --> 00:24:30.646
Why... why did you hit me?

00:24:31.247 --> 00:24:32.126
Why did you hit me?

00:24:35.326 --> 00:24:36.646
Back in 2008.

00:24:37.967 --> 00:24:41.126
Baijia Village, Qili Town,
Renshan County.

00:24:46.366 --> 00:24:47.166
What?

00:24:48.247 --> 00:24:49.846
What 2008?

00:24:50.287 --> 00:24:51.207
I don't know.

00:24:51.207 --> 00:24:52.326
I don't know anything.

00:24:52.447 --> 00:24:58.447
A newborn baby was kidnapped.

00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:00.606
It was your doing.

00:25:04.447 --> 00:25:05.846
You... you're mistaken.

00:25:05.846 --> 00:25:06.606
You're mistaken.

00:25:06.606 --> 00:25:07.727
I didn't do that.

00:25:07.886 --> 00:25:09.166
Qili Town... Qili Town.

00:25:09.166 --> 00:25:10.846
That's my home. My home.

00:25:10.846 --> 00:25:12.406
Home... home.

00:25:20.646 --> 00:25:22.687
This video came
from Liu Jianyuan's phone.

00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:24.207
Like the previous one,

00:25:24.767 --> 00:25:26.247
it was sent from the same number.

00:25:26.846 --> 00:25:29.207
By accessing Liu Jianyuan's phone,

00:25:29.447 --> 00:25:31.047
we found his ticket purchase records.

00:25:31.287 --> 00:25:35.806
He came to the city lately with Liu Min,
who was impersonating Mai Qianqian.

00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:37.687
They likely conducted a transaction.

00:25:37.846 --> 00:25:41.207
Clues have been sent to colleagues
handling anti-human trafficking.

00:25:42.606 --> 00:25:44.927
The murder weapon
used to kill Liu Min, the ashtray,

00:25:45.406 --> 00:25:47.806
and the vase
at Liu Jianyuan's murder scene

00:25:47.806 --> 00:25:51.487
both had fingerprints
matching those on the outdoor drainpipe.

00:25:52.247 --> 00:25:55.366
The technical department is working
on enhancing the video quality.

00:25:56.247 --> 00:25:59.126
They're matching it against
the anti-trafficking database.

00:25:59.606 --> 00:26:00.967
Nothing has been found yet.

00:26:01.886 --> 00:26:03.967
About the Baijia Village
mentioned in the video,

00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:06.207
we also inquired of the local police.

00:26:06.287 --> 00:26:07.086
They said

00:26:07.846 --> 00:26:13.287
since around 2008, no child abductions
or missing children cases have occurred.

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:15.447
No related reports filed either.

00:26:16.406 --> 00:26:18.047
A teenager did these?

00:26:18.646 --> 00:26:20.447
Are kids these days crazy?

00:26:21.247 --> 00:26:23.126
Could there be someone else behind it?

00:26:23.846 --> 00:26:26.727
Cases using teenagers as a front
aren't uncommon.

00:26:31.672 --> 00:26:34.907
(Yunxi Police Department)

00:27:04.606 --> 00:27:05.247
Hello?

00:27:05.886 --> 00:27:06.687
Chief Xu?

00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:10.846
I'm downstairs. The meeting?

00:27:11.366 --> 00:27:12.447
No one notified me.

00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:14.646
Okay.

00:27:15.606 --> 00:27:17.606
I'll be there on time. Don't worry.

00:27:19.886 --> 00:27:20.967
Alright, stop playing.

00:27:24.207 --> 00:27:24.886
How's it going?

00:27:25.566 --> 00:27:27.207
Captain Leng, perfect timing.

00:27:27.566 --> 00:27:31.086
I rechecked the food containers
from Rose Garden Hotel.

00:27:31.086 --> 00:27:32.007
I found

00:27:32.007 --> 00:27:33.326
that kid's fingerprints on them.

00:27:33.326 --> 00:27:36.126
He was peeping, attacking,
and recording a video

00:27:36.606 --> 00:27:38.166
and still found time to eat.

00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:38.886
He's something.

00:27:39.566 --> 00:27:40.967
Does Ye Qian know?

00:27:40.967 --> 00:27:41.727
Told them.

00:27:44.086 --> 00:27:44.727
Son.

00:27:45.566 --> 00:27:46.247
Son.

00:27:46.527 --> 00:27:47.207
Come in.

00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:49.727
His mom's got some things
these few days.

00:27:49.846 --> 00:27:52.207
She asked me to watch him
for a couple of days.

00:27:52.806 --> 00:27:53.646
Say hello.

00:27:53.886 --> 00:27:54.646
Hello, everyone.

00:27:54.646 --> 00:27:55.767
What greeting is that?

00:27:56.247 --> 00:27:57.487
Address them properly.

00:27:58.247 --> 00:27:59.086
Uncle Jiao.

00:27:59.207 --> 00:28:00.207
Grandpa Jiao.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:01.927
Okay, that's enough.

00:28:01.967 --> 00:28:02.967
He can just stay with us.

00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:03.886
You go do your thing.

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:05.007
Got a meeting in the city.

00:28:05.007 --> 00:28:05.527
Okay.

00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:07.086
Watch him for me.

00:28:07.247 --> 00:28:07.806
Okay.

00:28:07.806 --> 00:28:08.846
Less gaming.

00:28:08.846 --> 00:28:09.767
More reading.

00:28:10.047 --> 00:28:10.646
You hear me?

00:28:10.646 --> 00:28:11.247
Okay.

00:28:15.287 --> 00:28:17.326
Need to look into this more.

00:28:40.287 --> 00:28:40.967
We're here.

00:28:45.886 --> 00:28:46.727
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:47.326
Thank you.

00:28:47.727 --> 00:28:48.287
Hello.

00:28:48.687 --> 00:28:49.247
This way.

00:28:49.487 --> 00:28:50.047
Okay.

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:57.326
I've said this many times already.

00:28:57.967 --> 00:28:59.086
Nothing like that happened.

00:29:00.646 --> 00:29:03.566
We've never had
any missing children here.

00:29:03.806 --> 00:29:04.606
Have some water.

00:29:05.447 --> 00:29:07.086
Seems like you came for nothing.

00:29:07.366 --> 00:29:08.846
Please, think carefully again.

00:29:09.287 --> 00:29:10.447
No need to think anymore.

00:29:10.927 --> 00:29:12.566
It's such a small place.

00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:16.086
Do you think I wouldn't know
about every household?

00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:21.007
Please look at these two people.
Have you seen them?

00:29:23.086 --> 00:29:23.886
Haven't seen them.

00:29:26.927 --> 00:29:27.806
What about him?

00:29:30.806 --> 00:29:31.606
Don't know him.

00:29:33.566 --> 00:29:36.527
Cooperating with police investigations
is every citizen's duty.

00:29:36.527 --> 00:29:38.447
You're the village Party secretary
and a member.

00:29:38.886 --> 00:29:40.487
I shouldn't need to say more.

00:29:41.727 --> 00:29:44.326
Hey, who are you trying to scare,
young man?

00:29:47.646 --> 00:29:48.687
Who am I trying to scare?

00:29:49.126 --> 00:29:51.727
This case involves a fugitive
with a warrant.

00:29:52.326 --> 00:29:54.967
If you maintain
this uncooperative attitude,

00:29:55.687 --> 00:29:59.527
then we have reason
to suspect you're harboring a suspect.

00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:11.566
Well... that kid
really did something wrong?

00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:21.646
Here.

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:30.606
It's not that I deliberately wanted
to hide it from you.

00:30:31.126 --> 00:30:31.927
About this matter,

00:30:32.566 --> 00:30:34.927
how do I put it... it's a family shame.

00:30:35.326 --> 00:30:38.927
Everyone in the village is related.
It doesn't sound good.

00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:12.366
(I saw him alone,)

00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:13.646
(and he didn't look well.)

00:31:14.326 --> 00:31:15.646
So I went over to ask.

00:31:16.767 --> 00:31:18.047
When I went up and took a look,

00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:21.767
that kid was definitely a Bai.

00:31:22.527 --> 00:31:26.487
His eyes and brows
looked exactly like Bai Youfu's.

00:31:26.927 --> 00:31:28.326
What's the deal with this family?

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:30.687
The household head is Bai Shengguo.

00:31:31.126 --> 00:31:32.767
Youfu is their youngest son.

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.967
He has an older brother and sister.

00:31:34.967 --> 00:31:36.247
They've all moved out.

00:31:36.727 --> 00:31:39.326
The youngest son stayed
to care for the ancestral home.

00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:42.287
So I took the kid home
to stay the night.

00:31:42.287 --> 00:31:44.166
I wanted to find out
what was really going on.

00:31:45.566 --> 00:31:47.406
The kid said his name

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:49.447
was Ning Haiyang.

00:31:49.447 --> 00:31:50.326
Yeah, Ning Haiyang.

00:31:50.727 --> 00:31:52.927
He was snatched by traffickers
soon after he was born.

00:31:53.326 --> 00:31:56.487
A couple from the neighboring province
adopted him soon after.

00:31:56.927 --> 00:32:00.126
His adoptive dad
died in an accident early on.

00:32:00.326 --> 00:32:02.008
His adoptive mom
soon died of illness too.

00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:03.727
His adoptive relatives

00:32:03.727 --> 00:32:06.126
didn't treat him like family.

00:32:06.126 --> 00:32:07.406
He wasn't biologically related.

00:32:07.406 --> 00:32:08.886
So they pretty much ignored him.

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:12.527
So the kid decided
to go find his birth parents.

00:32:13.047 --> 00:32:13.846
You know what?

00:32:14.326 --> 00:32:15.287
Somehow,

00:32:15.927 --> 00:32:17.007
he actually found them.

00:32:17.566 --> 00:32:19.727
His father is Bai Youfu.

00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:23.806
Why didn't the Bai family
report the child missing?

00:32:27.527 --> 00:32:29.007
Missing? No child went missing.

00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:31.086
That kid wasn't missing at all.

00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:34.927
He wasn't missing?

00:32:38.727 --> 00:32:40.806
Bai Youfu was working away from home,

00:32:40.806 --> 00:32:42.927
met a girl and started dating her.

00:32:43.487 --> 00:32:46.646
They got carried away,
and she ended up pregnant.

00:32:47.366 --> 00:32:49.927
Now with a baby on the way,
marriage was the next step, right?

00:32:51.287 --> 00:32:52.687
The girl demanded a betrothal gift.

00:32:53.767 --> 00:32:55.366
Youfu's brother had just gotten married.

00:32:55.927 --> 00:32:56.886
They'd thrown a feast

00:32:57.247 --> 00:32:58.207
and built a new house.

00:32:58.566 --> 00:33:00.086
The debts hadn't been paid off.

00:33:00.287 --> 00:33:02.287
They had no money
for Youfu's betrothal gift.

00:33:03.366 --> 00:33:04.646
Well, you know what?

00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:06.687
Youfu found a way himself.

00:33:07.247 --> 00:33:09.326
He gave the baby up for adoption

00:33:09.527 --> 00:33:12.566
and used the money from that adoption
for the betrothal gift.

00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:14.606
So according to you,

00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:16.927
the kid was sold by Bai Youfu himself?

00:33:17.326 --> 00:33:18.326
It wasn't selling.

00:33:19.886 --> 00:33:20.806
It was giving him away.

00:33:21.886 --> 00:33:23.326
That's a nice way to put it.

00:33:23.447 --> 00:33:26.086
Parents selling their own child
is still illegal.

00:33:28.927 --> 00:33:30.606
After Bai Youfu 'gave the child away',

00:33:31.126 --> 00:33:32.606
didn't his wife have any objections?

00:33:33.606 --> 00:33:34.326
From what I heard,

00:33:34.326 --> 00:33:36.047
they both planned it

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.687
together.

00:33:39.687 --> 00:33:43.047
Life was already tough enough
for Youfu and his wife.

00:33:43.047 --> 00:33:45.247
They didn't have the energy
or money to care for a baby.

00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:48.166
Did Ning Haiyang know?

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:49.967
Probably not.

00:33:50.886 --> 00:33:53.687
How could they tell their own child
something like that?

00:33:56.447 --> 00:33:58.366
The Bai family
was struggling financially.

00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:02.126
Bai Shengguo had to manage
what little land was left,

00:34:02.326 --> 00:34:04.447
take care of his elderly mother,

00:34:04.447 --> 00:34:06.606
and help raise his grandchildren.

00:34:06.727 --> 00:34:10.527
He lacked both the money and energy
for a kid appearing unexpectedly.

00:34:11.447 --> 00:34:13.566
The eldest Bai son
avoided his brother's troubles.

00:34:13.927 --> 00:34:17.527
And Bai Youfu himself
was under a lot of pressure.

00:34:18.126 --> 00:34:19.928
He and his current wife
had a baby last year.

00:34:20.086 --> 00:34:22.726
He did marry that girl he got pregnant,

00:34:22.766 --> 00:34:24.766
but they divorced
within a couple of years.

00:34:25.527 --> 00:34:28.126
His then remarried his current wife.

00:34:30.527 --> 00:34:33.166
When was the last time Ning Haiyang
came back to the village?

00:34:34.566 --> 00:34:35.847
About half a year ago.

00:34:36.606 --> 00:34:37.286
Yeah.

00:34:38.086 --> 00:34:40.407
I even let him stay at my place
for a night.

00:35:02.766 --> 00:35:06.447
I figured I'd find some time
to take him over

00:35:07.206 --> 00:35:11.126
to the Bai family
to ask some questions and talk it out.

00:35:11.527 --> 00:35:13.807
But the Bai family
wouldn't even open their door.

00:35:14.206 --> 00:35:15.246
I couldn't do much.

00:35:15.566 --> 00:35:17.967
I couldn't exactly force them out.

00:35:18.967 --> 00:35:21.246
The poor kid felt hopeless.

00:35:21.487 --> 00:35:22.807
So he just took off.

00:35:23.286 --> 00:35:25.246
Ning Haiyang is still a minor.

00:35:25.246 --> 00:35:26.887
And you just let him leave?

00:35:27.047 --> 00:35:29.686
Well, he came here on his own.

00:35:30.646 --> 00:35:31.686
That boy is tall,

00:35:32.367 --> 00:35:33.447
very mature for his age.

00:35:33.847 --> 00:35:36.047
He looks practically like an adult.

00:35:36.646 --> 00:35:37.967
And he knows how to fight.

00:35:38.527 --> 00:35:39.246
Oh yeah,

00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:41.047
there are dents on the tree in my yard

00:35:41.047 --> 00:35:42.726
from him practicing.

00:35:44.086 --> 00:35:46.047
I figured he'd be fine.

00:35:46.487 --> 00:35:49.047
Kids roughhousing a bit
shouldn't be a problem.

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:53.246
He's probably gone back
to his adoptive relatives by now.

00:35:54.007 --> 00:35:57.686
Do you know where Bai Youfu
and his ex-wife are now?

00:35:58.166 --> 00:35:59.807
I'm not sure about his ex-wife.

00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:04.126
But Bai Youfu and his current wife
got a big rig, doing long-haul trucking.

00:36:04.686 --> 00:36:06.007
He just left a few days ago.

00:36:17.086 --> 00:36:17.887
Kid,

00:36:18.286 --> 00:36:20.007
it's time to eat.

00:36:20.007 --> 00:36:20.766
What'd you like?

00:36:20.766 --> 00:36:21.807
I will buy it for you.

00:36:22.047 --> 00:36:22.766
No need.

00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:24.807
I'll just order takeout myself.

00:36:25.646 --> 00:36:26.447
KFC.

00:36:27.246 --> 00:36:28.447
What would you like?

00:36:28.447 --> 00:36:29.166
My treat.

00:36:31.126 --> 00:36:32.246
You're pretty loaded, huh?

00:36:32.246 --> 00:36:33.126
Quite well-off.

00:36:33.606 --> 00:36:35.126
Not rich, just getting by.

00:36:35.807 --> 00:36:37.487
What have you been up to?

00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:38.246
Let me see.

00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:40.407
Look. Sudoku.

00:36:41.646 --> 00:36:42.447
Impressive.

00:36:42.606 --> 00:36:44.286
No wonder your parents don't nag you.

00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:46.766
As long as my grades don't slip.

00:36:46.887 --> 00:36:48.126
My dad can't understand it.

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:51.246
Perfect, I have this too.

00:36:51.566 --> 00:36:54.246
I remember
there's an online versus mode.

00:36:54.246 --> 00:36:55.246
Let's have a match.

00:36:55.407 --> 00:36:56.206
Okay.

00:36:57.487 --> 00:36:58.887
Long, really?

00:36:58.887 --> 00:37:00.726
Why are you competing with a kid?

00:37:01.487 --> 00:37:02.566
With your gaming skills,

00:37:02.566 --> 00:37:04.407
aren't you just bullying him?

00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:05.766
It's fine.

00:37:06.246 --> 00:37:08.286
But if we're playing games
during your work hours,

00:37:08.286 --> 00:37:09.726
won't my dad get mad?

00:37:10.086 --> 00:37:12.166
No, it's lunch break.

00:37:12.807 --> 00:37:13.447
Go online.

00:37:13.686 --> 00:37:14.447
Okay.

00:37:19.967 --> 00:37:21.086
- Next to three.
- Long, over here.

00:37:21.086 --> 00:37:21.847
Left, left.

00:37:21.847 --> 00:37:22.606
- Three.
- Right, right.

00:37:22.606 --> 00:37:23.646
Stop talking.

00:37:23.686 --> 00:37:25.246
You're way too slow.

00:37:25.246 --> 00:37:26.246
- Nice.
- One row left.

00:37:26.807 --> 00:37:27.286
Check it.

00:37:27.286 --> 00:37:28.047
Here, here.

00:37:28.047 --> 00:37:29.527
And this cell.

00:37:29.566 --> 00:37:31.887
- Right.
- The cell on the right. Yes.

00:37:32.887 --> 00:37:33.566
Look.

00:37:33.646 --> 00:37:34.447
I won.

00:37:34.447 --> 00:37:35.686
Not bad, Xiaoyu.

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:36.407
You beat Long.

00:37:36.407 --> 00:37:37.646
Shut up, okay?

00:37:37.646 --> 00:37:38.407
One more round.

00:37:38.407 --> 00:37:40.327
Best of five. I'm done.

00:37:40.407 --> 00:37:41.726
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:43.847
Alright, break it up.

00:37:43.847 --> 00:37:44.487
Break it up.

00:37:44.487 --> 00:37:45.646
Can't handle losing?

00:37:46.566 --> 00:37:48.086
Win some, lose some. It's normal.

00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:50.047
Uncle Long,
you're not a sore loser, are you?

00:37:53.766 --> 00:37:55.086
You're a lot like your dad.

00:37:56.847 --> 00:37:58.086
I don't want to be like him.

00:37:58.766 --> 00:37:59.807
Why not?

00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:01.246
Your dad is amazing.

00:38:01.246 --> 00:38:03.646
He's the best cop
in our city and our province.

00:38:04.166 --> 00:38:06.086
I don't know
whether he's a great cop or not.

00:38:06.086 --> 00:38:07.686
Anyway, he's not a good dad.

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:09.327
Xiaoyu,

00:38:09.327 --> 00:38:11.047
your dad cares about you a lot.

00:38:11.246 --> 00:38:12.606
You've misunderstood him.

00:38:14.447 --> 00:38:15.447
Auntie Ziwu,

00:38:15.807 --> 00:38:17.447
I know you have feelings for my dad.

00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:20.327
If my dad agrees, I have no objections.

00:38:21.166 --> 00:38:22.847
But I advise you to think carefully.

00:38:23.566 --> 00:38:25.847
'Think carefully'? 'Think carefully'?

00:38:26.007 --> 00:38:27.766
Is that something
a kid like you should say?

00:38:32.367 --> 00:38:33.447
Don't eat takeout.

00:38:34.246 --> 00:38:35.286
I bought you a meal.

00:38:35.286 --> 00:38:35.967
Have some.

00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:36.726
Okay, thank you.

00:38:38.047 --> 00:38:38.847
Spoon.

00:38:49.566 --> 00:38:50.606
- Captain Leng.
- Captain Leng.

00:38:50.847 --> 00:38:51.766
Okay, got it.

00:38:53.246 --> 00:38:53.887
- Captain Leng.
- Master.

00:38:54.206 --> 00:38:55.606
We got in touch with Bai Youfu.

00:38:55.646 --> 00:38:57.246
He's on the Qinghai-Xizang route.

00:38:57.487 --> 00:38:59.847
He said Ning Haiyang
came looking for him again later.

00:38:59.847 --> 00:39:01.887
Also, Bai Youfu admitted

00:39:02.246 --> 00:39:05.606
he previously sold the kid
through Liu Min and Liu Jianyuan.

00:39:06.407 --> 00:39:08.566
He wanted to get rid
of Ning Haiyang's pestering.

00:39:08.566 --> 00:39:10.086
So he told Ning Haiyang about this.

00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:11.246
But he didn't tell the truth.

00:39:11.246 --> 00:39:13.407
Instead, he told Ning Haiyang
those two kidnapped him.

00:39:14.646 --> 00:39:17.527
So Ning Haiyang's motive was revenge?

00:39:18.206 --> 00:39:18.887
Possibly.

00:39:19.126 --> 00:39:20.847
Also, Bai Youfu said

00:39:21.407 --> 00:39:23.286
Ning Haiyang's biological mother
is in Yunxi.

00:39:23.487 --> 00:39:24.967
Maybe Ning Haiyang will go find her.

00:39:24.967 --> 00:39:26.686
You two,
look into Xiao Lan's whereabouts.

00:39:26.686 --> 00:39:27.206
Go.

00:39:27.206 --> 00:39:27.807
Yes.

00:39:27.807 --> 00:39:28.246
Yes.

00:39:28.246 --> 00:39:30.286
Young people nowadays are so impulsive.

00:39:30.286 --> 00:39:31.126
He's really only 18?

00:39:31.126 --> 00:39:31.927
You just graduated.

00:39:31.927 --> 00:39:33.206
Don't be like that.

00:39:33.206 --> 00:39:34.327
You sound like my dad.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:35.800
(Dan Qing)

00:39:38.872 --> 00:39:40.216
(Dan Qing)

00:39:41.807 --> 00:39:42.407
Sorry.

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:44.887
The number you dialed is busy.

00:39:45.007 --> 00:39:46.246
Please try again later.

00:40:00.086 --> 00:40:01.206
So many shops.

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:04.184
Xiao Lan's stall
is in the small commodities area.

00:40:04.327 --> 00:40:06.086
But at this hour, might it be closed?

00:40:06.086 --> 00:40:07.086
Let's take a look first.

00:40:14.456 --> 00:40:26.645
(Dan Qing, is everything going well?
When is the delivery?)

00:40:28.887 --> 00:40:30.887
These storefronts all look the same.

00:40:31.807 --> 00:40:34.007
Pay attention to her unit number, D1023.

00:40:34.047 --> 00:40:35.527
D1023.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.007
Okay.

00:40:47.245 --> 00:40:52.636
(Guangchang Mall)

00:40:53.007 --> 00:40:54.286
D1023. This is it.

00:41:02.246 --> 00:41:03.206
Are you Xiao Lan?

00:41:05.847 --> 00:41:08.047
I am. Who are you?

00:41:08.527 --> 00:41:10.246
We're from the Yunxi CID.

00:41:10.566 --> 00:41:11.646
Here are our IDs.

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:16.606
Don't be nervous.

00:41:24.847 --> 00:41:25.646
Ning Haiyang.

00:41:31.206 --> 00:41:32.007
Don't panic.

00:41:38.606 --> 00:41:41.047
Ning Haiyang ran east
along the riverbank!

00:41:41.047 --> 00:41:41.646
After him!

00:41:49.407 --> 00:41:50.487
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:08.927
What happened?

00:42:08.927 --> 00:42:09.686
You, go that way.

00:42:22.246 --> 00:42:22.807
Stop!
