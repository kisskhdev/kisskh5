00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:10.778
=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 19=

00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:19.218
The fatal injury
is a sharp-force puncture to the skull.

00:01:19.938 --> 00:01:21.619
The shape and spacing match the features

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.979
of a push dagger.

00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:25.938
Judging from the wound angle,

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:29.739
the killer had a height advantage
over the victim during the attack.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.459
Numerous punctate marks
were found on the top of the head,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.739
suspected to be multiple strikes

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:35.858
due to insufficient force.

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:38.059
If the victim is Ding Youcai,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.778
could it be a carjacking?

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.339
No cash, phone, or similar items
were found among the pile of clothes.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.378
So the suspect was likely a passenger
who hailed the taxi.

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:50.539
He killed the driver, robbed him,

00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:52.378
stole the car, and buried the body.

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:54.776
Ding Youcai's car
belonged to the company.

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:56.979
He returned it after quitting.

00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:03.459
Wang Tong, Liu Yang.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.179
Talk to Ding Youcai's former colleagues.

00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:11.378
Ye, let's visit his hukou location.

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:13.179
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir. Let's go.

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:41.818
Anything wrong,

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:42.619
Master?

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:44.899
You said your friend

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:49.258
could get the new
AD medication from abroad.

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.258
Give me your father's medical records.

00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.938
Forget it if it's too troublesome.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.258
It is troublesome.

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:10.938
Bring me the records.

00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:12.658
Okay.

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:15.098
Thanks.

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:21.778
He's definitely Baldy Ding.

00:03:22.938 --> 00:03:23.739
No doubt about it.

00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:27.098
Ding Youcai.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.658
Baldy Ding is his nickname.

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:32.459
He already had little hair
when he was young.

00:03:33.258 --> 00:03:35.059
What happened to him?

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.299
We haven't heard from him
in the village for years.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.658
Could you please
tell us about him in detail?

00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:46.698
Okay.

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:49.859
Ding Youcai...

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:51.859
Let me get you some water.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:55.258
He used to be idle and lazy,

00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:57.739
and spent all day gambling.

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.978
Our village was demolished
a long time ago.

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:04.339
His family had two small houses,

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.579
but he squandered and lost them both.

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:10.378
His parents had only him, this one son.

00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:13.459
They sold everything they had
to get him a wife.

00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:15.378
But he remained unmotivated.

00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:20.099
He was still going out

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.979
to fool around after he got married.

00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:24.299
So his wife didn't get along with him.

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:25.979
They fought a lot.

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:27.818
Thanks.

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:30.378
A few times, it got really bad.

00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:32.458
Even the local police came.

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:34.539
He beat his wife?

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:37.979
No, the other way around.

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.138
Ding Youcai's wife was fierce,

00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:42.859
tall, and strong,

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:44.099
very intimidating.

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.059
Ding Youcai usually
got the worst end of their fights.

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:51.659
I'd say they're a perfect match.

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.338
But eventually, things calmed down.

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:57.179
Well,

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.378
apart from that,
his wife was quite decent.

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:04.219
She gave birth to their son

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:06.779
and took care of her in-laws
until they passed.

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:10.258
Ding Youcai had a son?

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.859
Yeah.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:14.539
What's his name again?

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:21.258
Weren't Ding Youcai's wife and son
on the same hukou registration as him?

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.179
Ding Youcai's wife
came from the neighboring town.

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:27.659
Her surname was Yu, I think.

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:30.938
She had an urban hukou,

00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:33.859
so the child was registered under her

00:05:35.258 --> 00:05:39.378
to attend a better school in the county.

00:05:40.258 --> 00:05:42.258
Now, it's called the "district."

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.219
This was good for the child,

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:48.539
but Ding Youcai wasn't happy about it.

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.419
He felt it made him lose face,
having the child register

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.419
under the mother.

00:05:53.898 --> 00:05:56.338
He made a fuss about it several times.

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:00.458
But he couldn't convince his wife,

00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:02.258
so he got angry and left to find work.

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.138
When did that happen?

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:09.979
Must be about twenty years ago.

00:06:11.458 --> 00:06:14.818
His son, Ding Yu, is the same age
as my youngest daughter.

00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:15.659
They're 25 now.

00:06:16.498 --> 00:06:17.539
Where did he go to work?

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.059
I have no idea.

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:22.338
Did Ding Youcai
ever come back to the village?

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.099
Yes, he came back often.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.099
He wouldn't do hard labor

00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.138
and complained about everything.

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:31.578
H-He couldn't
hold down any job for long.

00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:36.138
His wife felt she couldn't rely on him,

00:06:36.338 --> 00:06:38.739
so she went to the city and found a job.

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.578
Then she took the child
to the city with her.

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.578
Can we still get in touch
with Ding Youcai's wife?

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:48.099
I'm not that capable.

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:49.458
She was cremated to ashes.

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:54.258
Ding Youcai's wife died of cancer.

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.018
Ding Yu was in middle school that year.

00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:00.539
That's about 13 years ago.

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:07.659
What is this Ding Yu doing now?

00:07:09.018 --> 00:07:10.539
I really have no idea.

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:14.539
Some say Ding Youcai took him away.

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:20.299
Others say he just gave him some money
and abandoned him.

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.338
But I did see him once later.

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:33.138
- Nice.
- Nice.

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:40.739
- Nice.
- Nice.

00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:43.338
Thank you.

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:43.938
Thank you.

00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:45.779
Come on, thanks, guys.

00:07:45.938 --> 00:07:46.498
Come on.

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:48.338
Enjoy the food and drinks.

00:07:48.338 --> 00:07:49.779
Enjoy the food and drinks.

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:50.739
Enjoy.

00:07:50.739 --> 00:07:51.859
Make yourselves at home.

00:07:51.859 --> 00:07:52.818
Alright.

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:57.458
Sit.

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:59.258
Enjoy the food and drinks.

00:08:00.338 --> 00:08:03.619
So Ding Youcai got remarried?

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:09.458
About nine or ten years ago.

00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:14.539
He brought a woman back to the village
and held a wedding banquet.

00:08:15.338 --> 00:08:17.979
He didn't ask me
to issue a marriage statement.

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:19.818
I don't know if they got registered.

00:08:20.698 --> 00:08:21.818
Then what?

00:08:21.818 --> 00:08:25.539
Then he took Ding Yu away.

00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:28.179
Ding Yu wasn't good at studying.

00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:29.378
He never got into high school.

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:32.899
He probably went to earn money
with his father.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.738
What happened to the woman
Ding Youcai brought back

00:08:37.738 --> 00:08:39.179
for the wedding banquet?

00:08:40.578 --> 00:08:43.899
Well, that woman looked quite young.

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:46.738
She rarely spoke.

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:50.618
She didn't seem much older than Ding Yu.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:08:58.098
We might've heard her name back then...

00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:00.738
But it's been too long.

00:09:00.738 --> 00:09:02.419
I-I've forgotten.

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:07.139
Thank you.

00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:09.259
No problem.

00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:12.259
We'll visit you again
if anything comes up.

00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:13.259
Alright.

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:14.139
Anytime.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:15.019
See you.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:15.698
Okay.

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:19.179
We'll take this back with us.

00:09:19.858 --> 00:09:20.818
Okay.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:21.978
See you.

00:09:22.139 --> 00:09:22.698
Take care.

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:27.338
Go back inside.

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:28.738
Thanks.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:30.139
Take care, officers.

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:30.659
Okay.

00:09:39.499 --> 00:09:39.978
Hello?

00:09:40.578 --> 00:09:41.259
Ye Qian.

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:43.419
We found something.

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:44.698
Hold on a second.

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:49.338
Go ahead.

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:53.618
We found traces of burnt tin foil
in the soil sample.

00:09:53.858 --> 00:09:55.938
It should be
from the funeral paper ingots.

00:09:57.139 --> 00:09:59.818
The killer burned spirit money
for the victim?

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:01.818
Who knows?

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:03.938
Maybe it was out of remorse.

00:10:04.858 --> 00:10:05.858
Okay, got it.

00:10:06.098 --> 00:10:06.698
Talk later.

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:11.299
Master.

00:10:11.659 --> 00:10:13.978
We still have
too little information on Ding Youcai.

00:10:14.659 --> 00:10:16.419
I think we should start with Ding Yu.

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:21.659
Ding Yu likely settled in town
with his mother.

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:24.299
I'll check his identity records.

00:10:25.698 --> 00:10:29.698
You've completely
ruled out robbery-homicide?

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.539
I think the victim knew the killer.

00:10:32.938 --> 00:10:34.539
Rural folks value their hometown.

00:10:35.139 --> 00:10:36.338
That's why the body

00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:39.299
was buried somewhere
near Ding Youcai's hometown.

00:10:40.499 --> 00:10:41.698
The burnt spirit money

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:44.379
shows that the killer felt guilty.

00:10:45.938 --> 00:10:47.179
And I think that CD

00:10:48.338 --> 00:10:50.019
was deliberately placed there.

00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:53.338
But I haven't figured out why yet.

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:16.539
Please take your belongings.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:17.618
Okay.

00:11:17.618 --> 00:11:18.299
Watch for cars.

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:50.139
Over here.

00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:50.738
Baby.

00:11:50.738 --> 00:11:51.379
I'm here.

00:11:53.499 --> 00:11:54.499
Slow down.

00:11:55.779 --> 00:11:56.578
Over here.

00:11:56.858 --> 00:11:57.659
Xixi.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:11:59.379
Come here.

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:03.179
Over here.

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:13.059
What did you learn today?

00:12:13.578 --> 00:12:14.738
You can't remember?

00:12:15.218 --> 00:12:16.578
Were you absent-minded?

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:17.618
No.

00:12:17.618 --> 00:12:18.899
Really?

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:20.059
Really.

00:12:20.938 --> 00:12:22.098
See anything you like?

00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:25.499
You like balloons?

00:12:25.938 --> 00:12:27.019
Put on your armor.

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:27.938
Let's get going.

00:12:28.618 --> 00:12:29.539
Keep your legs in.

00:12:36.858 --> 00:12:37.419
Sweetie.

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:39.659
Balloons aren't safe in the car.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.938
Dad will tie it here for now.

00:12:41.938 --> 00:12:43.539
Play with it when we get home, okay?

00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:53.578
Is this fun?

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:54.698
Yes.

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:02.938
Hello, officers.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:04.338
Fang Qihang, right?

00:13:04.338 --> 00:13:05.139
Yes.

00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:05.938
(Longxi Travels)

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:06.738
Police.

00:13:08.818 --> 00:13:09.738
We have some questions.

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.379
Let me see your ID first.

00:13:13.738 --> 00:13:14.299
Okay.

00:13:23.858 --> 00:13:25.016
You run this travel agency?

00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:26.098
Yeah.

00:13:26.818 --> 00:13:29.499
I have my business license
right there on the wall.

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:34.098
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

00:13:34.098 --> 00:13:35.259
I haven't done anything.

00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:38.098
Then why'd I hear you
ran a matchmaking agency

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:40.899
for cross-border marriages?

00:13:41.338 --> 00:13:42.139
Pretty trendy, huh?

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:42.938
No.

00:13:43.098 --> 00:13:45.338
I completely stopped

00:13:45.338 --> 00:13:49.059
the cross-border marriage service
almost ten years ago.

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:49.779
Really.

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:52.539
Officers, have a seat.

00:13:52.938 --> 00:13:53.738
Come on.

00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:56.259
Here.

00:13:56.938 --> 00:13:57.738
Thanks.

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.218
Do you know Ding Youcai?

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:06.858
Y-Yes, I know him.

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:08.059
What's wrong?

00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:09.899
What did he do?

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:11.738
Officer.

00:14:11.938 --> 00:14:13.179
I don't know anything

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:15.659
about what he has done.

00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:18.019
We haven't seen each other for years.

00:14:18.019 --> 00:14:19.458
Not even a phone call.

00:14:20.738 --> 00:14:23.218
But I heard you two were pretty close.

00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:28.338
We used to drive taxis together

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:30.818
and spent all day gambling.

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:33.618
And we used to play cards, too.

00:14:34.098 --> 00:14:36.059
That's how we got to know each other.

00:14:36.618 --> 00:14:40.019
But that was nearly ten years ago.

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:44.818
Fang, not driving today?

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:45.698
I just got back.

00:14:45.698 --> 00:14:46.218
Alright.

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:50.098
Nine of dots.

00:14:50.299 --> 00:14:51.059
I won.

00:14:51.338 --> 00:14:52.899
I let you win again? Here, take it.

00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:54.218
Seven pairs.

00:14:54.218 --> 00:14:55.499
Come on.

00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:56.539
Come on.

00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:57.738
Ding.

00:14:57.738 --> 00:14:58.419
Come on.

00:14:58.419 --> 00:14:59.818
Lucky streak today, huh?

00:15:00.218 --> 00:15:02.299
Today I'm going to win big time.

00:15:02.539 --> 00:15:03.738
I'm winning you today.

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:06.818
I've seen it too many times.

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:09.139
Changing players
is like changing blades.

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:12.299
I haven't won money off you in a while.

00:15:13.499 --> 00:15:16.019
Well, that depends on your luck.

00:15:16.338 --> 00:15:17.259
I'm going to win.

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:19.698
Not working today?

00:15:20.098 --> 00:15:21.499
Too few customers in this heat.

00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:23.259
We finally got a game together.

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:25.098
I've got to play to satisfy the itch.

00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:25.899
Yeah.

00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:28.738
Here, watch this.

00:15:30.818 --> 00:15:32.139
Did he have any enemies?

00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:37.218
Ding Youcai

00:15:37.618 --> 00:15:39.419
was a pretty decent guy,

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:41.858
generous and loyal to friends.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.139
As far as I know,

00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:46.259
he got along well with everyone.

00:15:47.338 --> 00:15:50.938
I wouldn't say he made enemies.

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:53.379
Did he love music

00:15:53.938 --> 00:15:54.659
or singing?

00:15:57.098 --> 00:15:59.299
He loved listening to Teresa Teng.

00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:00.818
He'd hum her tunes all the time.

00:16:02.098 --> 00:16:02.818
Red Dragon.

00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:05.338
North Wind.

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:07.458
Alright.

00:16:08.858 --> 00:16:09.858
So lucky.

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:11.858
How about that?

00:16:11.858 --> 00:16:12.698
Pay up.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:13.779
Here.

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:15.019
Unbelievable luck.

00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:17.059
You always beat me when you come.

00:16:18.499 --> 00:16:19.338
Watch me.

00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:21.848
What are you doing?

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:25.019
The battle song sounds,
and money goes around.

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:34.738
Come on.

00:16:35.338 --> 00:16:37.098
Watch me clean house today.

00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:41.098
You know Ding Youcai had a son?

00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:43.059
Yeah.

00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:44.179
I've seen him a few times.

00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:47.059
The two of them
took shifts driving the taxi.

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:51.338
Ding Youcai made his son drive the taxi?

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:53.659
A minor driving without a license?

00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:57.218
Well, Ding Youcai's son
looked older than he was.

00:16:57.458 --> 00:16:58.539
As long as he didn't speak,

00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:01.499
he could easily pass for someone
in his early twenties.

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:04.818
Besides, driving isn't that hard.

00:17:04.939 --> 00:17:06.338
It's all about practice.

00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:09.138
A few more runs,
and he got the hang of it.

00:17:10.418 --> 00:17:11.499
Straighten the wheel.

00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:12.418
Like this.

00:17:12.418 --> 00:17:13.658
Now shift into drive.

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:15.299
Yes, okay.

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:16.739
Come on, forward.

00:17:17.658 --> 00:17:19.219
This way, come out.

00:17:19.219 --> 00:17:20.658
Reverse. Turn the wheel.

00:17:20.898 --> 00:17:21.539
Okay.

00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:22.898
Back up.

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.059
Okay, slow down.

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:26.499
Back up, yeah.

00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:28.059
Turn the wheel.

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:29.338
Yes, back up.

00:17:29.338 --> 00:17:29.979
Keep going.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:31.098
Keep going.

00:17:32.858 --> 00:17:34.098
Were they close?

00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:39.378
Well, he was a teenager.

00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:42.779
They argued sometimes.

00:17:43.138 --> 00:17:46.418
But the kid was quite sensible to me.

00:17:46.939 --> 00:17:48.378
He took shifts for his dad

00:17:48.739 --> 00:17:52.418
and seemed to have
several part-time jobs.

00:17:53.818 --> 00:17:56.019
Ding Youcai had a girlfriend back then.

00:17:56.338 --> 00:17:57.618
Did you know her?

00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:02.059
Actually, I introduced her to him.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:05.019
I was trying to switch careers.

00:18:05.338 --> 00:18:06.818
Driving a taxi was too tough

00:18:06.818 --> 00:18:08.138
and didn't pay well.

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:10.338
A friend had connections in this field,

00:18:10.338 --> 00:18:13.739
so we partnered
and opened that matchmaking agency.

00:18:13.858 --> 00:18:15.939
We made some money,
and it was good karma too.

00:18:16.338 --> 00:18:18.818
I heard she was a foreign girl?

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:20.779
Look.

00:18:20.939 --> 00:18:25.059
It was hard for a single dad
to raise a teenage son.

00:18:25.658 --> 00:18:31.059
A man needs a wife
to look after him, right?

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:34.499
I tried finding him a local match first.

00:18:34.618 --> 00:18:36.219
But he wouldn't settle

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:38.618
for someone "not good enough",

00:18:38.858 --> 00:18:39.858
and the "good ones"

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:42.059
wouldn't look at him twice.

00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:44.779
Plus, he insisted on someone
quiet and obedient,

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:46.979
nothing like his former wife.

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:49.779
Since I was doing
the cross-border service,

00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:52.019
I found someone for him from abroad.

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:54.898
O-Officers,

00:18:55.138 --> 00:18:57.219
I have some business to attend to later.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.418
I have an appointment.

00:18:58.578 --> 00:19:00.578
Can we continue this another day?

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:13.739
What's wrong? Uncomfortable in this car?

00:19:15.418 --> 00:19:16.459
Not at all.

00:19:16.939 --> 00:19:18.539
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

00:19:18.898 --> 00:19:22.138
It's just my first time in a police car.

00:19:22.138 --> 00:19:25.059
I-I'm a bit excited.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.418
You're too kind,

00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:30.338
giving me a ride and all.

00:19:31.658 --> 00:19:33.258
Back to Ding Youcai's second wife.

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:35.939
Did she marry him willingly?

00:19:36.578 --> 00:19:38.019
You followed the legal procedures?

00:19:39.138 --> 00:19:40.739
Of course, she did.

00:19:41.178 --> 00:19:44.939
I even took him across the border
to meet her family.

00:19:45.178 --> 00:19:48.939
He handed the bride price
directly to her parents.

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:52.618
Everything was done by the book.

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:54.739
You charged a hefty fee?

00:19:55.578 --> 00:19:57.178
Just the cost price.

00:19:57.178 --> 00:20:00.739
A friend's discount, 100,000 RMB.

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:04.699
Tell me about the girl.

00:20:04.699 --> 00:20:05.618
In detail.

00:20:07.338 --> 00:20:11.338
I need to check my records for that.

00:20:11.338 --> 00:20:12.939
It's been a long time.

00:20:14.138 --> 00:20:15.699
I just remember

00:20:15.858 --> 00:20:19.578
they gave her a Chinese name
when she arrived,

00:20:19.578 --> 00:20:21.539
called Yu Meigui.

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:22.979
That's right.

00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:26.178
Same surname as his late wife, I think.

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:29.818
The girl was 17 then.

00:20:30.699 --> 00:20:31.338
Come on.

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:32.939
Don't give me that look.

00:20:33.138 --> 00:20:36.138
That's considered late to marry
and have children where she's from.

00:20:37.618 --> 00:20:38.898
But not here.

00:20:38.898 --> 00:20:41.338
They had to wait a few years
to register the marriage.

00:20:45.618 --> 00:20:48.138
Later, I stopped driving

00:20:49.219 --> 00:20:50.658
and got busy with the business.

00:20:51.019 --> 00:20:54.418
So I met with Ding Youcai less often.

00:20:54.658 --> 00:20:58.259
Eventually, we lost contact completely.

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:00.578
Officers,

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.898
what happened to Ding Youcai?

00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:07.219
It doesn't sound like he got in trouble.

00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:08.898
More like something happened to him.

00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:13.098
A set of remains was found.

00:21:14.098 --> 00:21:15.378
We suspect it's Ding Youcai.

00:21:15.739 --> 00:21:17.098
R-Remains?

00:21:19.138 --> 00:21:21.259
If it's confirmed to be Ding Youcai,

00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:24.658
then he died three years ago.

00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:31.898
But I saw his son just last year.

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:33.858
It was quite a coincidence.

00:21:34.219 --> 00:21:35.459
My car broke down that day.

00:21:36.098 --> 00:21:37.858
I called a ride-hailing car.

00:21:38.138 --> 00:21:40.418
That driver turned out to be his son.

00:21:44.578 --> 00:21:45.499
Last four digits.

00:21:46.259 --> 00:21:47.059
7482.

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:51.338
Aren't you Ding Youcai's son?

00:21:53.858 --> 00:21:56.459
How is your dad doing?

00:21:58.459 --> 00:21:59.658
He went back to his hometown.

00:22:34.459 --> 00:22:36.858
Harder. Don't act like
you haven't eaten.

00:22:37.459 --> 00:22:38.539
I brought some food.

00:22:41.618 --> 00:22:42.858
I was thinking,

00:22:43.418 --> 00:22:45.378
given the victim's height,

00:22:45.378 --> 00:22:46.219
it's quite difficult

00:22:46.219 --> 00:22:50.019
to cause such a wound
even if he was sitting down.

00:22:51.658 --> 00:22:53.259
What if it's a car seat?

00:22:54.378 --> 00:22:57.378
Haven't we already ruled out
the possibility of carjacking murder?

00:22:57.578 --> 00:22:59.459
We got a message from the taxi company.

00:22:59.658 --> 00:23:01.338
They checked the records.

00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:06.178
Ding Youcai didn't
return the car or resign in person.

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:08.259
His son, Ding Yu, did it for him.

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:10.779
Ding Yu had his father's ID card.

00:23:11.096 --> 00:23:12.378
He said Ding Youcai had business

00:23:12.378 --> 00:23:13.539
and was back in his hometown

00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:14.939
and asked him to handle it.

00:23:15.939 --> 00:23:17.779
That makes Ding Yu highly suspicious.

00:23:19.658 --> 00:23:22.578
Based on the injury
to the victim's skull,

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.059
if it happened in the car,

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:26.338
then he was sitting
in the passenger seat

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:29.059
or the right side of the back seat.

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:30.618
Can Ding Yu drive?

00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:31.739
Yes.

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:34.818
He started driving taxis
in shifts with his father as a teenager.

00:23:37.138 --> 00:23:39.019
Where was Ding Youcai's car found?

00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:40.299
It could be the crime scene.

00:23:41.138 --> 00:23:44.459
The taxi company said
that the car is almost at its scrap age,

00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:46.219
but they haven't dealt with it.

00:23:46.219 --> 00:23:47.384
They'll tow it over tomorrow.

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:49.739
Ding Yu is working in this city

00:23:49.858 --> 00:23:50.858
as a ride-hailing driver.

00:23:51.858 --> 00:23:54.338
We've already found
his address and contact information.

00:23:54.818 --> 00:23:56.618
Master is probably almost there now.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.280
What about Han Zhao?

00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:03.178
Is she really going abroad?

00:24:05.259 --> 00:24:06.178
Maybe.

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:11.098
I saw that post she made on Moments.

00:24:11.898 --> 00:24:13.259
The shop has been transferred.

00:24:14.138 --> 00:24:15.418
Haven't you been in contact?

00:24:17.098 --> 00:24:18.059
We have.

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:22.739
Right now, I'm just focusing on my job

00:24:23.618 --> 00:24:24.459
and waiting for her

00:24:24.578 --> 00:24:27.459
as a friend.

00:25:02.539 --> 00:25:05.699
(And this ring you've been wearing)

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:07.378
is made of plastic.

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.098
The paint is badly worn.

00:25:09.098 --> 00:25:09.818
I speculate

00:25:09.939 --> 00:25:11.818
he gave it to you when you played house

00:25:11.818 --> 00:25:12.499
as kids.

00:26:46.979 --> 00:26:49.939
This balloon carries the baby

00:26:49.939 --> 00:26:52.059
into an unknown world.

00:26:52.578 --> 00:26:54.378
With fear and curiosity,

00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:57.939
the balloon floats and floats.

00:26:58.098 --> 00:27:00.378
The baby runs hard.

00:27:00.818 --> 00:27:01.979
He hasn't realized

00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:04.699
that he has changed and grown.

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:09.699
Sleepy?

00:27:10.578 --> 00:27:11.898
Go to sleep, okay?

00:27:14.858 --> 00:27:16.019
Good night, Daddy.

00:27:16.499 --> 00:27:17.299
Good night.

00:27:21.059 --> 00:27:21.699
Be good.

00:28:10.098 --> 00:28:10.699
Hello?

00:28:12.618 --> 00:28:13.378
Ding Yu.

00:28:13.979 --> 00:28:15.499
We're from CID.

00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:17.138
CID officers?

00:28:17.898 --> 00:28:19.219
What do you need from me?

00:28:20.459 --> 00:28:22.299
You know why we're here for you, right?

00:28:23.338 --> 00:28:24.618
We're right downstairs.

00:28:31.658 --> 00:28:34.299
My child is home. He just fell asleep.

00:28:34.418 --> 00:28:37.019
Whatever it is,
can we wait until tomorrow?

00:28:38.178 --> 00:28:39.138
Ding Youcai.

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:46.979
You raise the kid alone?

00:28:47.418 --> 00:28:48.378
Please keep it down.

00:28:48.939 --> 00:28:50.219
Thank you.

00:28:51.658 --> 00:28:52.472
Where's his mother?

00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:54.939
We broke up.

00:28:57.219 --> 00:28:58.499
You found my dad?

00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:00.858
Why there?

00:29:01.979 --> 00:29:03.059
It's close to the hometown.

00:29:03.699 --> 00:29:05.098
He was superstitious,

00:29:05.578 --> 00:29:07.539
always talking about
returning to his roots.

00:29:08.578 --> 00:29:10.219
Too bad he didn't rest in a coffin.

00:29:11.378 --> 00:29:15.658
Weren't you afraid of being discovered
burning spirit money in the night?

00:29:17.299 --> 00:29:18.658
I was scared.

00:29:18.658 --> 00:29:20.219
So I didn't dare burn too much.

00:29:22.418 --> 00:29:27.578
You moved in with your dad
right after graduating from junior high?

00:29:28.178 --> 00:29:29.299
Were you close?

00:29:30.858 --> 00:29:31.818
Just so-so.

00:29:33.178 --> 00:29:34.578
I heard you often argued.

00:29:35.338 --> 00:29:37.699
I was young and simple-minded.

00:29:39.178 --> 00:29:40.578
Then why did you kill him?

00:29:40.858 --> 00:29:42.219
I-I didn't kill him.

00:29:42.618 --> 00:29:43.979
I didn't kill my dad.

00:29:46.098 --> 00:29:47.578
We came to see you today

00:29:47.578 --> 00:29:49.219
because we have obtained evidence.

00:29:50.499 --> 00:29:52.618
I-I'm telling the truth.

00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:55.299
I admit, I buried the body.

00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:56.459
But I didn't kill him.

00:29:56.939 --> 00:29:59.299
When I got that call and rushed over,

00:29:59.578 --> 00:30:00.898
he was already dead.

00:30:01.378 --> 00:30:02.499
Explain then.

00:30:04.779 --> 00:30:05.779
What call?

00:30:10.259 --> 00:30:11.059
Not driving today?

00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:11.898
I just got back.

00:30:39.832 --> 00:30:41.112
(Ding Youcai)

00:30:45.272 --> 00:30:47.256
(Cover my shift in South City.)

00:32:18.818 --> 00:32:20.299
If you didn't kill him,

00:32:20.378 --> 00:32:21.858
why didn't you call the police?

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:24.219
I was afraid
the police would suspect me.

00:32:25.178 --> 00:32:27.699
What were you afraid of
if you didn't do anything?

00:32:27.818 --> 00:32:30.338
My relationship with my dad
was always pretty tense.

00:32:31.378 --> 00:32:33.578
I saw on TV and online

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:35.219
that whenever there's a homicide,

00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:37.779
the police always suspect
people close to the victim.

00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:39.818
Your relationship was tense?

00:32:39.939 --> 00:32:40.499
Why?

00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:42.699
He wronged my mom.

00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:45.459
Even though we lived together,

00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:48.378
I couldn't get over it.

00:32:50.578 --> 00:32:53.098
Who called you then?

00:32:53.178 --> 00:32:55.699
The call and text
were both from my dad's phone.

00:32:56.418 --> 00:32:57.618
The call didn't go through.

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.499
The text just told me
to pick him up at that place.

00:33:01.378 --> 00:33:03.178
But whether my dad sent it himself,

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:04.499
I don't know.

00:33:05.699 --> 00:33:06.459
Then what?

00:33:07.378 --> 00:33:09.178
Then I headed towards our hometown.

00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:12.299
On the way, I bought
some spirit money and paper ingots.

00:33:13.178 --> 00:33:15.418
Where did you buy those late at night?

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:19.939
I-I remember it was
a 24-hour funeral supply shop.

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:21.818
Near a hospital, I think.

00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:28.019
What tool did you use to dig the hole?

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:30.299
A shovel.

00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:37.939
(It was always in the trunk
of the taxi.)

00:33:39.259 --> 00:33:40.920
(Because we often drove to the suburbs.)

00:33:41.578 --> 00:33:42.418
(The roads were bad,)

00:33:43.338 --> 00:33:44.699
(full of bumps and ditches.)

00:33:44.699 --> 00:33:45.784
(The car could get stuck.)

00:33:47.499 --> 00:33:49.378
(So we always kept a shovel.)

00:35:33.218 --> 00:35:36.539
After that,
I found a place to wash the car,

00:35:37.019 --> 00:35:38.178
returned it to the company,

00:35:38.778 --> 00:35:41.979
and told them
my dad had gone back to our hometown.

00:35:43.738 --> 00:35:45.499
This is the phone
my dad used at the time.

00:35:45.539 --> 00:35:46.899
The number was canceled.

00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:48.339
But I kept the phone.

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:50.658
I wanted to sell it second-hand.

00:35:54.738 --> 00:35:56.298
If I go to jail,

00:35:56.618 --> 00:35:57.578
my son...

00:35:58.578 --> 00:36:00.459
No other relatives?

00:36:01.578 --> 00:36:03.059
There are some on my mom's side,

00:36:04.178 --> 00:36:05.979
but we haven't been in touch for years.

00:36:07.618 --> 00:36:10.499
Your dad liked Teresa Teng?

00:36:13.778 --> 00:36:15.618
That CD is genuine.

00:36:16.178 --> 00:36:18.178
The limited edition is hard to get.

00:36:22.098 --> 00:36:23.218
My mom liked her.

00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:26.098
My dad liked listening to Teresa Teng

00:36:26.698 --> 00:36:28.138
under the influence of my mom.

00:36:29.178 --> 00:36:32.138
Back then, they got along pretty well.

00:36:33.499 --> 00:36:34.979
My dad bought the CD himself.

00:36:35.539 --> 00:36:37.218
It was always in his car.

00:36:37.218 --> 00:36:38.578
He never even got to open it.

00:36:39.512 --> 00:36:41.048
So I thought I'd save it for his trip.

00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:44.738
Let's talk about Yu Meigui.

00:36:45.298 --> 00:36:46.419
I wasn't close to her.

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:51.419
She left after my dad was gone.

00:36:52.578 --> 00:36:53.379
Where did she go?

00:36:54.939 --> 00:36:55.819
I don't know.

00:36:56.419 --> 00:36:57.618
Probably home?

00:37:00.459 --> 00:37:01.859
Did they register their marriage?

00:37:02.738 --> 00:37:03.419
No.

00:37:03.899 --> 00:37:05.899
She wasn't old enough
when she first came.

00:37:06.539 --> 00:37:08.419
But three years ago,
she was in her twenties.

00:37:08.419 --> 00:37:09.419
Why not register then?

00:37:10.379 --> 00:37:11.819
That's between her and my dad.

00:37:12.339 --> 00:37:13.578
How would I know?

00:37:14.218 --> 00:37:15.459
How was their relationship?

00:37:16.939 --> 00:37:17.899
Just so-so.

00:37:18.738 --> 00:37:19.819
You lived together?

00:37:20.499 --> 00:37:22.899
Money was tight,
renting one slightly bigger place.

00:37:23.459 --> 00:37:24.979
How could we afford two?

00:37:27.339 --> 00:37:29.459
So, to your knowledge,

00:37:29.859 --> 00:37:33.618
did your dad ever abuse Yu Meigui?

00:37:38.819 --> 00:37:42.019
She didn't have
friends or relatives here?

00:37:43.658 --> 00:37:45.258
Some hometown fellows, maybe.

00:37:45.939 --> 00:37:47.778
There were quite a few people like her.

00:37:48.178 --> 00:37:50.218
But I'm not so sure.

00:37:50.819 --> 00:37:52.019
Mr. Fang should know.

00:37:52.939 --> 00:37:54.459
They seemed pretty close.

00:37:56.059 --> 00:37:56.899
Fang Qihang?

00:37:57.539 --> 00:37:58.059
Yeah.

00:37:58.178 --> 00:38:00.859
They had gatherings
with their fellow people

00:38:01.578 --> 00:38:03.218
at Mr. Fang's place.

00:38:09.419 --> 00:38:10.658
Dad.

00:38:11.939 --> 00:38:13.019
We woke you up, sweetie?

00:38:13.819 --> 00:38:14.578
Come here.

00:38:16.658 --> 00:38:17.778
Well...

00:38:17.778 --> 00:38:20.138
These two uncles are Dad's friends.

00:38:20.459 --> 00:38:23.258
We're talking about adult stuff.

00:38:23.819 --> 00:38:26.778
You have to go to kindergarten tomorrow.

00:38:26.778 --> 00:38:28.778
How about we go inside and sleep?

00:38:33.819 --> 00:38:34.379
Be good.

00:38:41.698 --> 00:38:43.138
Captain Leng, what do we do now?

00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:44.298
What do you think?

00:38:46.059 --> 00:38:46.819
Monitor him.

00:38:48.098 --> 00:38:51.499
Yu Meigui's passport information,

00:38:51.899 --> 00:38:53.138
entry and exit records,

00:38:53.658 --> 00:38:55.178
and Fang Qihang's as well,

00:38:56.539 --> 00:38:58.339
need to be thoroughly investigated.

00:38:59.019 --> 00:38:59.618
Yeah.

00:38:59.658 --> 00:39:00.499
Note it down.

00:39:00.499 --> 00:39:01.098
Okay.

00:39:05.578 --> 00:39:06.298
Captain Leng.

00:39:08.258 --> 00:39:12.098
The logistics company
where Ding Yu worked three years ago

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:14.298
confirmed his employment information.

00:39:14.499 --> 00:39:15.738
The entry and exit department

00:39:15.738 --> 00:39:19.258
didn't find any exit record
of Ruan Shihong, aka Yu Meigui.

00:39:19.939 --> 00:39:22.578
Her visa renewal procedures

00:39:22.578 --> 00:39:24.979
were handled
by Fang Qihang's travel agency,

00:39:25.499 --> 00:39:27.138
even after Ding Youcai's death.

00:39:27.979 --> 00:39:30.578
And after Fang Qihang spoke with us,

00:39:30.578 --> 00:39:32.408
he booked a flight
heading southwest tomorrow.

00:39:35.218 --> 00:39:36.019
He's running away.

00:39:40.899 --> 00:39:42.178
- Give my money back.
- I want my money.

00:39:42.298 --> 00:39:43.379
- Give my money back.
- Where are you?

00:39:43.379 --> 00:39:44.059
- Come out.
- Come out.

00:39:44.059 --> 00:39:46.539
- Give my money back.
- Give my money back.

00:39:46.539 --> 00:39:47.419
- Where are you?
- Give my money back.

00:39:47.419 --> 00:39:48.218
Fang Qihang!

00:39:48.339 --> 00:39:48.859
Open up.

00:39:49.379 --> 00:39:50.258
What are you doing?

00:39:50.258 --> 00:39:50.778
Pay up!

00:39:51.379 --> 00:39:52.258
Police!

00:39:52.578 --> 00:39:53.859
Police. We are police.

00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:55.499
Put that down.

00:39:55.499 --> 00:39:56.339
Perfect timing, sir.

00:39:56.339 --> 00:39:58.138
Arrest that punk Fang Qihang.

00:39:58.138 --> 00:39:59.298
He scammed all our money.

00:40:01.339 --> 00:40:02.138
Fang Qihang.

00:40:03.939 --> 00:40:05.976
Fang Qihang,
we're from the city police department.

00:40:07.218 --> 00:40:08.098
Fang Qihang.

00:40:09.298 --> 00:40:11.138
Fang Qihang, you've met Captain Leng.

00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:12.539
I can't go out.

00:40:13.819 --> 00:40:16.138
Those people want trouble.

00:40:17.218 --> 00:40:18.298
They're blackmailing me

00:40:18.298 --> 00:40:19.578
and threatening me.

00:40:20.258 --> 00:40:22.419
Tell him to come out first.

00:40:22.618 --> 00:40:23.539
Talk things through.

00:40:23.778 --> 00:40:24.499
Fang Qihang.

00:40:24.578 --> 00:40:26.339
No matter what dispute you have,

00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:27.899
you can sit down and talk.

00:40:30.899 --> 00:40:31.698
Fang Qihang.

00:40:36.698 --> 00:40:39.899
They couldn't keep their foreign brides

00:40:40.098 --> 00:40:41.859
and came here to make trouble.

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:44.618
They picked those girls themselves.

00:40:44.618 --> 00:40:47.258
They arranged the marriages there.

00:40:47.298 --> 00:40:48.738
They even slept together.

00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:50.658
Now that the girls ran away,
they came to me.

00:40:50.738 --> 00:40:52.499
It's not like I told them to run away.

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:55.258
I just organized a tour group
to go there.

00:40:55.258 --> 00:40:57.098
It has nothing to do with me.

00:40:58.459 --> 00:41:00.899
My son didn't even touch her.

00:41:01.339 --> 00:41:03.859
That woman ran away
just two days after arrival.

00:41:04.059 --> 00:41:06.738
We saved up half our lives
to buy a wife for our son.

00:41:06.939 --> 00:41:07.778
She just vanished.

00:41:07.778 --> 00:41:08.778
No grandchild for us now.

00:41:08.859 --> 00:41:10.738
It's not just our family.

00:41:11.019 --> 00:41:12.218
You're just a swindler

00:41:12.258 --> 00:41:12.899
scamming money.

00:41:12.899 --> 00:41:14.178
- We're the same!
- Give my money back.

00:41:14.178 --> 00:41:15.138
He scammed all of us.

00:41:15.138 --> 00:41:18.379
- Give my money back.
- Give my money back.

00:41:18.379 --> 00:41:19.059
Put it down.

00:41:19.499 --> 00:41:21.298
Put that down.

00:41:21.298 --> 00:41:21.859
Put it down.

00:41:22.218 --> 00:41:22.979
Put it down.

00:41:24.979 --> 00:41:25.859
Notify the station.

00:41:26.339 --> 00:41:28.059
Ask for some officers.

00:41:28.059 --> 00:41:28.578
Yes, sir.

00:42:12.899 --> 00:42:13.899
It's been three years.

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:15.578
This car must have been cleaned.

00:42:16.379 --> 00:42:17.459
And it's a taxi.

00:42:17.459 --> 00:42:18.979
Countless people have ridden in it.

00:42:19.939 --> 00:42:21.258
So we have to be careful.

00:42:21.778 --> 00:42:23.379
Even if there's nothing on the surface,

00:42:23.899 --> 00:42:27.578
we'll definitely find clues
in the sponge or fabric.

00:42:28.578 --> 00:42:29.379
Be careful.
