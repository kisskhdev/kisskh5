WEBVTT

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.000
Keep a close eye on Jirasin.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.880
Why did he never tell me

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.640
that he has both an aunt
and an uncle-in-law like that?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.240
Then how am I
supposed to know who you are,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.840
and what really happened to my mom?

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.240
So what exactly do you want?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.920
If you do anything to Kluay,
it's the same as doing it to me.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.440
Because right now, we're dating.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.640
This girl?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.720
Shall we go in?

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.440
You promised. If I give you the signal,
we have to leave immediately.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.200
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.760
Please, come in. This way.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.080
We just finished fixing up the garden,
so it might be a bit messy.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.440
And there may be some insects.
It's the rainy season.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.360
That's fine.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.360
Uh, you're not scared, are you?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.760
Oh, no, I'm not.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.960
At my house,
we have flowers like this too,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.160
and there are lots of insects as well.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.520
You're just like Anong. She likes it too.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.800
This house focuses on fragrant flowers.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.880
Everyone in the family likes them.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.080
Oh, who says everyone? I don't.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.880
Strong-smelling flowers,
when the scent gets too heavy,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.200
they make me dizzy.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.000
Uh, Mr. Sarut.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.960
This is a small gift from my grandma.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.440
Here.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.800
-I'll help carry them.
-Sure.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.760
Oh.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.480
So you came all this way
just to bring the gift?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.400
Well, please thank your grandma for me.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.880
Yes. Actually,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.520
I also wanted to visit you, Mr. Sarut.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.720
On the day of the ceremony,
I was really busy.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.400
So I didn't really have time

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.760
to take care of you, or even talk to you.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.600
-Alright. Let's go inside.
-Uh.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.440
Shall we go inside?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.440
Please come in.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.080
Please come in.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.800
Kluay, are you okay?

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.080
-The smell…
-It's the tuberose scent.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.120
It might be a bit strong,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.480
but I think it smells nice.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.360
Please come in.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.800
I already know they didn't approve it.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.880
That's why I'm rushing
to find the documents.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.000
Do you know how much
I've lost because of this?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.880
The supplier even flew to Chiang Mai.
He ended up waiting for nothing.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.040
Everything has to wait
for Warat's sign-off!

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.720
Fine.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.920
Let's see. If I go back
and still don't get the documents…

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.160
I can't believe…

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.800
Warat.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.400
You know, back then,
when it came to popular sports,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.400
your father and I
used to go together all the time.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.400
Rock climbing and cliff jumping.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.960
Back then, it was incredibly fun.
Really thrilling.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.320
It was a test of courage,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.040
and of how ready your body was.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.520
I can't believe
my dad liked sports like that.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.160
Yeah.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.040
But

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.000
that was before all the serious problems.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.720
What problems?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.920
Well…

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600
Sin.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.280
Uh, you know each other too?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.080
What do you want?

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.200
Why are you here?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.920
Why can't I be here?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.920
I just have some business.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.960
Why?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.720
Is there some secret here?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.920
Is there some secret here?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.960
Is there some secret here?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Why?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.600
You shouldn't be here uninvited.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.160
Hey, hey, Sin. Easy.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.800
Mind your manners.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.280
He's my friend's son,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.840
and he's also an executive
at the company you work for.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.200
Alright. Don't mind him.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.360
Sin's probably stressed
and said something rude.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.160
Please accept our apologies.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.640
Anyway,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.560
Kluay, do you know Sin as well?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.400
Uh… sorry, everyone.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.600
Kluay might be allergic to something.
Please excuse us.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.320
Kluay, let's go.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.560
Why didn't you tell me
about that Kluay girl beforehand?

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.280
Forget it.
Today or any other day, it's the same.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.080
Because sooner or later,
she'll die just like Lak anyway.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.280
And Warat too.
I don't care whose son he is.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.320
If he keeps getting in my way,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.160
he'll die along with her.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.400
Hey. Sin!

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.840
Anong, look at him! Look at your nephew!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.320
Kluay?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.720
What happened, Mr. Warat?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.560
Yeah, what happened?

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.680
Kluay ran into Jirasin
at Mr. Sarut's house.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.840
What did he do to her?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.800
It's okay.
Let's listen to Mr. Warat first.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.240
He didn't do anything.
You can try talking to her yourself.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.200
Kluay saw Jirasin with my mom.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.680
Huh?

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.000
On the day she fell from the building.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.480
Huh?

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.360
-Whoa, Kluay.
-Hey.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.840
What's all that noise?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.160
Kluay?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.600
Oh, thank you, Mom.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.200
But really, you didn't have to.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.720
I'm better now.
I could've gone down myself.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.920
Well.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.160
Better how? Your face

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.880
is still pale,
like there's no color at all.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.240
Really?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.880
And look at your pajamas.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.080
They're torn here and there.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.920
You're still wearing them. So worn out.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.280
-See? Completely worn.
-Hey.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.760
Mom, that tickles.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.200
But they're comfortable.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.440
Alright.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.919
Hey, Kluay.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.520
I know

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.320
you're a good, kind-hearted girl.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.880
But helping someone

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.600
to the point
where you make yourself sick like this,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.120
that's not right for you.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.280
Mom, you don't have to worry about me.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.120
Ms. Mysterious promised that
she won't let this happen to me again.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.040
She feels bad about it too.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.360
When did you talk to her?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.440
Just now.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.040
Why didn't you answer your phone?

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.840
You're not answering me?

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.400
I don't want to talk.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.640
Go shower and go to bed.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.360
I'm not showering,
and I'm not sleeping either.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.080
We need to talk.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.840
But I'm busy with work.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.280
Your work is my company's work.
Just drop it.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.280
Stop it. Don't mess with my work.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.760
-That hurts.
-Come talk over there.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.320
Ow, that hurts. What are you doing, Det?

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.640
I'm just pulling you over.
I haven't done anything.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.680
You're really drunk, Na.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.400
Drunk like this is perfect.
It makes it easy to kill someone.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.720
I shouldn't have rushed back.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.480
I should've killed
those bitches, Kluay and Som.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.200
If you're talking to me about this,
I'm not listening.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.440
But you have to listen.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.840
You know damn well
what those two sisters did to me,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.560
-and you still act like nothing happened.
-You started it.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.640
If you side with them one more time,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.360
I'll take everything back.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.040
I told you,
don't talk to me like that again.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.720
I will. What are you gonna do?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.280
The house, the money, the job, the car.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.480
I'll take it all back if you still think
they matter more than me.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.760
Yeah!

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.080
They matter more. They're better.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.560
And I don't love you.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.520
I only stayed with you

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.160
because I put up with it.
I put up with it! You understand?!

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.760
Take it all back. I don't want any of it.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.440
Det, stop.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.680
-I said stop.
-What?!

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.920
Ow!

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.840
Good. Let some of the blood
rush out of your head.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.520
Maybe you'll learn right from wrong.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.640
What made you think you could leave me?

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.920
If you don't care about
a single piece of property,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.280
you should at least think about your dad

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.040
who's lying there,
barely breathing in the hospital.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.920
-Stop talking about my dad right now.
-I'll talk!

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.960
I'm talking
to bring you back to your senses.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.240
If your dad knew you abandoned me,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.320
abandoned my dad's company,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.920
a man who loves that company
more than his life like him

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.880
would definitely get worse.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.720
And if anything happens to him,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.640
remember this.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.600
You'll be the one who kills him.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.480
-Oops, sorry.
-Oh.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.720
-You can go first.
-Thank you.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.200
I must apologize, ma'am,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.080
for making it inconvenient for you
to get out of the car.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.480
It's okay.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.320
It's not inconvenient at all.
The path's wide. Let's go.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.760
-Let's go pay respects to the Buddha.
-Yes.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.680
Som.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.400
Sompaen, you're not heading out
to work yet, right?

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.840
Uh, I'll hitch a ride with you today.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.160
Som.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.880
Sometimes,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.160
mysterious signs come in the form
of clinking plates and cutlery.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.320
Oh, Mr. Warat?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.840
What's wrong?

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.560
I should ask you that.
What are you doing here?

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.520
Brought you porridge.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.840
if you're done here,
you can head back now.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.160
Just put it on the table.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.480
Don't tell me you're embarrassed?

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.640
It'd be weird if I weren't.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.600
But honestly, how you look right now
and how you usually look

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680
aren't that different.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.840
Hey, Mr. Warat.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.440
Wait. I didn't come to pick a fight.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.960
I'm here to make
the boyfriend act look convincing.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.200
Huh?

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.080
My grandma knows already. Supol snitched.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.800
Well. I mean, he told her

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.560
that the two of us are dating.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.120
-Oh.
-So from now on,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.680
I'm picking you up for work every day.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.560
-Huh?
-How long are you gonna keep saying that?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.920
Here. Eat.
And if you're not up for work today,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.720
you don't have to go.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.000
Okay, okay.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.560
You really do look terrible.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.520
Hey, Mr. Warat.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.920
You can go wait at the table.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.520
Turn around.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.520
And pour it
into a bowl while you're at it.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.320
Next time, don't bring anything for me.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.920
Food is never lacking here,
if anything, it's too much.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.360
Kluay and Som made all of this.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.160
They kept insisting

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.440
that Grandpa had to eat, competing to see

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.680
whose food you'd eat more.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.320
Those two girls never grow up.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.160
And how's Kluay now?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.440
She seems worse than before.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.160
What should we do, Dad?

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.000
I really don't understand

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.120
why all these spirits unanimously

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.000
come asking Kluay for help.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.720
It's the karma of their own actions.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.640
If they did good,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.840
the karma they receive will be good.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.720
Whatever she promised them, do it.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.720
Tell her that.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.880
As for me, I'll meditate,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.240
set my intention,
and dedicate merit to them as well.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.560
Thank you, Dad.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.400
According to the first conclusion,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.040
when people die, the body disintegrates,

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.360
leaving only the spirit
wandering to be reborn.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.280
Then what about appearing
in my grandson's dream

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.640
over and over,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.240
is that considered a spirit,
Venerable Sir?

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.560
It is the imprint
of having lived together,

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.760
a bond,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.600
an attachment,
lingering ties between one another.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.280
Thus, they appear as dreams.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.720
Do good deeds.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.000
Make merit.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.720
Dedicate the merit,

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.440
send goodness to them.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.240
Make merit for them

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:12.599
even though
they never knew each other at all?

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.280
Jirasin.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.760
Didn't you say that in your vision,

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.280
there was a boy, Ms. Kluay?

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.200
If we pin up a photo of a boy,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.520
it might look too cruel.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.720
This is connected
to Ms. Praewilai's death.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.480
So you used a teddy bear instead.
Isn't that too cute?

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.200
But I understand you, Mr. Arnon.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.840
A child that young couldn't have
done anything to Ms. Praewilai.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.520
Hey, everyone

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.000
has seen what state Jirasin is in now.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.440
When he was a child,
he could've killed someone.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.400
Mr. Warat,
but if he didn't actually do it,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.240
you'll incur bad karma.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.240
Hah.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960
You teddy bear.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.000
So how's the hospital information?

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.400
Mr. Sarut didn't say
anything about my dad.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.840
Good. Then moving forward won't be hard.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.240
And if in the end it was intentional

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.640
to cause Mr. Wichan to become critically
ill and die, can we take legal action?

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.680
I'll be the one to kill him myself.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.320
Calm down, Mr. Warat.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.640
Anything we do requires evidence.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.480
What evidence could there be?

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.320
My dad is dead,
and his body's been cremated.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.360
The only way to get even

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.960
is to kill and trade a life for a life.
That's the only fair deal.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.160
Alright, how about this.
Next time, we go to the field.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.080
I happen to know an old housekeeper
from the Vanich household.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.200
She's the one who took care of

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.160
Mr. Wichan and Ms. Praewilai.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.200
Then do it now.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.760
Why wait for next time?

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.120
SARUT

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.440
Uh, wait a second.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.080
From what I see,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.360
it seems like she wants us
to start with Sin when he was a child,

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.560
and with Mr. Sarut,
which we've already checked.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.960
-Jirasin?
-Yeah.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.080
His parents, where he was born,

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.880
when he was born, we know everything.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.200
The HR department of Vanich, of course.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.320
That's true.
You're really good, Mr. Arnon.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.960
Why are you so happy?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.640
What should I do

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.760
to get Warat to make merit for Ampha?

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.480
Supol, help me think.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.560
With the utmost respect, ma'am,
I think it'll be difficult.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.440
Mr. Warat won't listen to anyone.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.080
And if you speak to him,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.560
he'll definitely rebel against you.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.160
That's true.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.760
Honestly, the one who should be
sprinkled with holy water

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.880
isn't you or me.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.400
I think it should be Warat.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.560
Maybe it'll tame his stubbornness a bit.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.440
Yes, ma'am.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.960
-Oh, ma'am, the car is this way.
-Oh. Let's go.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.320
Ah… Oh, you…

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.000
-You're heading back too?
-Yes.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.080
-I come here to make merit regularly.
-Oh.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.400
-But we've never met each other before.
-Yes.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.080
I don't come very often.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.360
Only once in a while to pay respects.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.360
Please go ahead. May merit protect you.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.400
Thank you. Likewise.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.360
Thank you.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.640
Why does she look so familiar?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.960
With the utmost respect, ma'am,
is something wrong?

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.520
I feel something strange about that woman.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.720
It feels like

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.520
we've met before or maybe not.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.720
Like she's familiar, but not quite.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.680
I can't really explain it.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.960
From what I see,
she seems kind-hearted, ma'am.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.040
-Hello, Chat.
-Is Mr. Sin here?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.200
Yes, but…

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.240
It's fine.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.760
Yes.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.960
How's the Chiang Mai branch?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.160
How is it? You want to know?
Go see for yourself.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.240
It's still not settled?
I already told my team to handle it.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.120
Even if you brought your whole team,
it wouldn't help.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.840
Don't you really know that Warat
now controls almost everything in Vanich?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.320
I know. I heard
there's a major meeting next week.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.040
I didn't expect him to move this fast.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.920
Anything you're dealing with in Hua Hin,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.280
or the Phuket project,

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.200
wrap it up quickly.
Close them as fast as possible.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.280
In just one week?
I don't think that's possible.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.800
Have you even tried,
or are you just assuming it's impossible?

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.360
Yes.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.920
From now on,
we have to be much more careful.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.040
Don't leave any loopholes
for Warat to catch us on.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.880
Concede where we can.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.000
Don't let Mrs. Wanee feel like we're
on the opposite side from her grandson.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.080
Yes.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.440
Once we secure
the Vanich shares as planned,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.400
he'll finally learn
what loss really feels like.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.360
Mr. Sin, have you transferred the money
to Mr. Peng's account yet?

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.200
His people messaged me to follow up.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.320
Not yet.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.640
The reason I haven't transferred it
is because

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.000
I'm waiting to see how you do next week.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.320
But you already know

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.240
I'm willing to pay off your entire debt.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.520
It just has to be in exchange
for results that are worth it, remember?

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.960
Mr. Sin, this isn't an easy job.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.960
I need to fly to Phuket
to talk with the investors,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.320
and then they need to discuss it.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.360
The earliest we could close the deal
would be after the general meeting.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.880
By then, there'll be nothing left.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.000
But it's up to you. I still have

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.200
upcoming projects, and plenty of others.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.520
But you?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.600
Then I'll try it.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.400
That's the spirit.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.560
This is Sin's old house.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.080
The house looks fine.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.280
Uh, excuse me.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.800
May I ask if you know
someone named Jirasin?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.400
Jirasin? I don't know him.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.320
Then who owns this house?

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.920
Or did they
buy it from the previous owner?

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.360
What business do you have here?

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.360
If you have something to deal with,
find another way to contact them yourself.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.440
Oh?

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.120
I'm leaving.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.680
Uh…

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.880
I figured they wouldn't cooperate easily.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.600
But in the household registration
Mr. Arnon brought, this is the place.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680
DEATH CERTIFICATE

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.280
Father's name is Jinchai.
Mother's name is Naree.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.280
He had one younger sister, Lakkana.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.080
This is Jirasin's mom's death certificate.
It states she died from illness.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.440
But in the insurance records,

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.840
it's listed as suicide,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.200
which led to a prolonged legal battle
over compensation.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.080
Jirasin's side eventually won the case.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.360
But right after that, his father died too.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.600
And it's not illness.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.760
He died of heartbreak, following his wife.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.400
Why is this so sad?

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.320
The insurance money
from his mother's death

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.840
was used to treat his father.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.200
It's really tragic.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.520
They were basically wiped out

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600
and ended up bankrupt as well.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.280
But the person who received the benefits

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.720
wasn't Jirasin,
and it wasn't his sister either.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.920
Why?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.800
Because the beneficiary's name
was someone else.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.640
Who?

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.200
Ms. Praewilai, your mother.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.240
I don't even know where to begin.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.960
But I kind of have a sense that…

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.760
from what I've gathered,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.480
Jirasin's mom may have died
because of my mom.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.800
Don't say that.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.480
We don't know the truth yet.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.320
Don't jump to conclusions
that make you feel worse.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.400
Or should I imagine

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.480
that Jirasin and I are half-brothers?
Same father, different mothers?

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.560
Hey, I just said don't overthink it.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.920
Don't blame yourself.
Don't think badly of yourself.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.520
We still don't know the truth.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.080
I hate secrets. I hate lies.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.320
I hate everything
the old-timers hide from me.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.880
Hey, calm down.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.240
I think the person
who can give you the best answers

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.200
is Mrs. Wanee.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.000
If we could rely on Grandma,

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.280
we wouldn't be standing
here right now, Kluay.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.240
That's you. But this time it's me.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.400
How about this?
I'll go talk to your grandma for you.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.840
Okay?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.120
Since we're already here,

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.600
there's one more place
we need to go. Shall we?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.520
JIRAYU

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.800
-A grocery store?
-Yes.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.760
Grocery stores like this
are prime information hubs.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.640
Back when I needed to
research something for school,

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.760
places like this
were where I got the best info.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.200
Oh, let's go.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.000
Excuse me.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.960
-Yes?
-Do you work at this store?

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.280
Yes. If you want something,
just tell my mom.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.080
Mom, a customer.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.120
Of course I know it.
People call it the plumeria house.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.200
Why does it sound so sad?

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.680
Plumeria…

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.200
Well, that house

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.440
has a lot of plumeria trees
planted along the fence.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.040
Whenever people ask for directions,

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.880
they would say,
"Go past the plumeria house."

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.040
So it became a nickname.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.200
Like a landmark, right?

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.600
Yeah, that's it.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.560
But there really is a sad story.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.520
The husband brought his mistress

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.040
to live under the same roof
as his legal wife.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.840
Do you happen to know the mistress's name?

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.240
Her name?

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.280
That was a long time ago.
I'm not really sure.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.560
It was something long,
something like Prae…

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.560
But some people say
she wasn't actually a mistress.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.240
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you still here?

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.760
You were nice a moment ago.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.120
This is my store. I'll do whatever I want.
It's none of your business.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.120
But we haven't done anything yet.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.480
I told you to leave, so leave. Go away!

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.720
-We should go.
-Uh.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.080
What's wrong with him?

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.920
And you're still smiling?

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.560
I chased them off.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.880
All settled.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.720
Just a bit of money
can shut both mother and son right up.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.440
No wonder

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.880
Arnon checked my background through HR.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.400
He's stupid.
Didn't he know HR is full of our people?

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.680
You want to know what kind
of woman your mother was?

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.080
Fine. I'll let you find out slowly.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.960
I'll make you die of heartbreak.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.520
Where are you?
Why haven't you contacted me at all?

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.720
Peekaboo!

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.440
Are you buying coffee?

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.480
Som, you scared me.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.240
You're scared?
Who were you thinking about?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.160
Or were you thinking about me?

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.160
It's your sister and Mr. Warat.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.240
What trouble did those two cause again?

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.600
Grown-up stuff.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.400
If you don't ask more,
I'll buy you a coffee.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.760
Iced latte, less sweet.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.160
It's not our turn yet. Wait.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.080
Oh.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.080
Go sit down. I'll bring it over.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.120
Thank you.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.360
Daddy.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.360
-Som. Oh?
-Arnon.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.640
Chase that guy away.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.240
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.760
Why are you always messing with me, Det?

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840
I'll say this first.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.080
If there's trouble again today,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.440
I won't let your crazy Amoeba get away
with it this time. It'll be worse.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.280
Oh, so you're Ms. Ameena's boyfriend.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.920
Yes.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.400
Well, I'm warning you.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.160
It's better if you stay away from Som.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.440
She's not here today.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.760
I came here to wait for you, Som.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.920
Could you pass this letter to Kluay?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.520
She blocked my number a long time ago.
I can't contact her anymore.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.560
No.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.160
Ugh.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.280
When will this ever end?

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.480
If your girl finds out you're
sending letters to Kluay,

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.040
she'll pick a fight again.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.640
It just goes in circles, never ending.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.360
Take it back.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.960
Help him out. Don't you want him gone?

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.600
Fine. I'll handle it. You can go now.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.200
Go deliver it yourself.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.360
Hey.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.080
Is my order ready?

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.680
20 THB STOREWIDE

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.920
PRAEWILAI

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.960
SARUT

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.240
Did you see anything?

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.200
I didn't see anything. I'm just tired.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.560
I was thrilled. Thought you saw something.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.640
But it's strange.
I went there and didn't see any sign.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.120
Even though that house…

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.400
Someone died there.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.480
What are you startled for? It's me.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.080
Oh.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.280
I have something to tell you.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.080
Jirasin sent people to silence
the mother and son at the grocery store.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.920
Yes.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.800
That's very satisfying, just as planned.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.520
What plan?

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.880
Warat told me

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.080
to gather information from HR
to lure Jirasin out.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.680
And it turned out just like I said.
But why would Jirasin

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.560
want to silence those two?

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.600
So you two
knew about this and didn't tell me at all?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.600
I think it's good this way.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.280
Now Jirasin knows we're not incompetent.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.840
Wait. Are you saying I'm incompetent?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.400
Everything I say is wrong.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.640
Anyway, let's get back on topic.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.360
So, is the information we have
about Jirasin's parents correct?

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.880
I think my mother must be connected
to Jirasin's father somehow.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.360
What if Jirasin and I are brothers

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.640
with the same father?

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.600
I don't think so.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.240
Your grandma and your father
were both very sharp.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.560
They wouldn't be fooled that easily.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.600
I think you should go rest first.
You're overthinking this.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.760
I'll ride with you, okay?

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.080
So we can talk to Mrs. Wanee too.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.040
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.400
Here, clean this up too.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.080
SARUT

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.240
Where have you been?

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.720
At the hospital. I went to see my father.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.720
See your father?

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.320
Or to see Som?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.920
You had someone follow me?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.200
Of course I did!

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.880
If I didn't, how would I know
how stupid you think I am?!

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.280
Why do you have to do this?

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.240
Stop hurting me already, Ameena.
Let's just end it here.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.440
End it how?

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.000
You don't love me anymore. I don't
love you either. Why keep holding on?

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.840
So you won't go back to Kluay.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.800
I hate her.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.360
I hate how she holds her head high,

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.320
taking everything I ever wanted.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.600
I hate her. Do you hear me? I hate her!

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.960
You're imagining things. Kluay hasn't
cared about me for a long time!

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.360
And can you honestly say
you don't care about her?

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.719
See?

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.800
See?

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.480
And you expect me to just let you go back
to her? Let her laugh at me like that?

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.880
Enough, Ameena!

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.040
That love letter you wanted Kluay to read,

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.320
she won't be reading it anymore.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.600
Confused how I got it?

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:41.600
You searched my bag?

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.000
Smart.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.679
But realizing it now? That's stupidity.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.639
That letter

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:53.760
is useless now. You know why?

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.520
Because by now, Kluay must have
already read the fake letter I wrote.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.720
If you want to know what it says,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.960
just wait until the day
you shamelessly sneak off to meet her.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.680
You have to go.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.440
Don't miss it.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.560
You sure about this?

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.640
Yes.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.760
If we make Mrs. Wanee believe
we're really a couple,

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.640
she might open up to me faster.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.120
And we might find the truth
about your mother more easily.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.080
I hate liars.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.320
Then just put all the blame on me.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.080
I said I hate liars,
but the one who started lying was me.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.600
If being a bad person for a bit

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.320
helps untangle everything faster,

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.480
I think it's worth it. Let's go.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.560
What do you mean?

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.960
If we can make your grandma believe us,

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.760
and get the truth sooner,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.520
there's nothing to lose.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.000
Come on, let's go.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.680
Wait.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:32.960
Huh?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.320
Sweet.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.480
Baby.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.760
Honey.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.040
Babe.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.920
Pick one.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.280
Huh? What?

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.720
We're a couple, remember?
So she'll believe us.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.440
Oh. What?

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.560
Sweet. Honey.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.240
What else is there?

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.360
Babe.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.600
We don't have to go that far, do we?

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.080
Will she believe it otherwise?
Think about it.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.400
It doesn't have to be that much.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.920
I know my grandma well. Pick one.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.320
Then…

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.240
let's use

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.720
"Your girl" and "My boy."

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.280
Is that what people say in Thailand?
Wow, that's really old-school.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.440
I don't know either.
I've never really had a boyfriend.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.360
Oops.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.400
Ugh.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.080
Come on, go inside. Hurry.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720
Pick first.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.360
-"My boy," then. Come, hurry.
-No.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.440
Hey, hurry up.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.640
Fine. Babe, then.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.000
Yes, babe.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.600
Hold it sweetly, or she won't believe it.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.240
Okay. Let's go.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.160
Okay what?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.040
Babe.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.400
Thank you for coming
to introduce yourself formally.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.480
Well then,

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.960
I'll take this
as a good thing for our family.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.680
Because normally, Warat

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.400
never brings any woman here
for me to consider.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.760
You're the first.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.480
So, welcome.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.120
Thank you very much.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:38.840
NEXT EPISODE

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.160
Why did you hide the fact
that I'm an orphan from Mrs. Wanee?

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.320
What I did was to protect you.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.560
Rat would never take a woman

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.240
with an unknown background

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.960
to be my granddaughter-in-law.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.640
I heard the sound
of a child's anklet bells,

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.880
the same kind of sign
I sensed when I was with Mrs. Wanee.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.560
WARAT

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.400
"Warat."

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.840
