Let's use our lucky points.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.600
"Lucky points"?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.880
3,600 points.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.330
That should be enough.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm someone
who will be by your side

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.840
for three months, Miss Jane.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.160
You were sent to be my minion, right?!

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.360
Copy that, boss!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.160
Yay!

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.320
Whoa!

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.160
Hey!

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.320
Get out!

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.759
If you can't do anything,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.360
why did those above send you to me?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.800
Goodbye, bargain-bin pick.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.160
They have up to 48 hours
to request the wish back.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.080
Your vocals are insane!

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.880
The Six Degrees of Separation theory.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.480
There's a connection between everyone
through six people or fewer.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.400
I'll finally know

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.720
who I actually am.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.720
I'll make sure I find it!

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.220
Hot and sweet,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.840
can't do chores,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.520
has a sunny smile,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.200
and beautiful vocals.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.240
Out of all of that,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.560
only one is actually useful.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.860
This one.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.640
"Beautiful vocals."

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.240
If we had to start investigating,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.960
we'd start with your vocals.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.440
So we start by searching
'Singers near me':

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.480
Auntie Noi, a former mor lam singer,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.600
Uncle Seng, the legendary guzheng icon,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.760
Auntie Ploen, the winner of 'The Vote',

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.640
Jin, the guitarist,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.080
and GUN, the marching band director
in high school.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well...

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.680
Who are these people?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.880
Ugh!

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.120
They're my connections, obviously!

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.240
- I see...
- Mm!

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.479
Okay.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.860
What kind of music do you like?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.840
No clue.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.600
Back in the day, if you liked a song,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.680
what genre would it be?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.520
Hm...

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
Maybe you could sing me
a couple of songs.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.040
Whatever comes to mind.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.120
What song should I sing to you?

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.520
♫Happy Birthday to you♫

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.200
♫Happy Birthday to you♫

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.120
♫Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday♫

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.079
♫Happy Birthday to you♫

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.920
You even crushed
a simple Happy Birthday song.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.240
We're on the right track.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.660
I got it!

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.680
DoubleBam!

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.140
Do you know her?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.079
"DoubleBam"?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.720
Is she famous?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.940
I've never heard of her.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.600
What?

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.400
I think your vocals resemble hers.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.960
- Really?
- Mm!

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.340
I'll check her out.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.220
Well, then...

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.320
It's gotta be him!

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100
Jin.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.760
He's my connection No. 1.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.480
Jin, can you keep it down?

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.360
There are other people living here!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.480
Sorry, Auntie.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.550
What? Get a move on!

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.560
Who's she with?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.740
Whoa!

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.240
Hello.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.720
I thought I was seeing things.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.120
How long has it been
since she came back to A-Mah's home?

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:54.650
Oh...

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.440
I'm sure I've come back from time to time.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.880
And who's that?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.840
Your lover?

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.000
No, you've got it wrong!

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.080
She's not my lover!

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.440
Just a friend.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.320
So...

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.160
Is A-Mah not home?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.880
I'm here!

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.420
Hey...

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.040
Hello, A-Mah.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.920
Why are you here?

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.680
Oh, I just have something
to talk to Jin about.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.260
And...

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.400
This is Z, my friend.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.720
Please excuse me.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.159
What? Where are you rushing off to, huh?!

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.560
You're running away
the moment you arrived?

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.960
This girl can't be saved to save her life.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040
'Sup, bro.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.760
I need your help.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.920
We're coming in now.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.920
Six Degrees, my ass.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.360
Nope, I'm out.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.960
Delulu.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.520
I'm not being delulu,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.080
and you have to help me here

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.320
because you're my connection No. 1.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.640
That's it.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.640
See yourself out.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.760
I'm going back to guitar practice.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
Fine!

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.680
But don't you think
you're forgetting something?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.880
I know all about your little secret.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.280
Go ahead. I don't have any secrets.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.680
A-Mah! Jin got his tongue pierced!

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:02.640
Fine, I'll help.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.120
But you've gotta tell me

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.760
who your little friend is,
how you guys met,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.120
and what family she's from.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800
Bro, drop the dad act.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.680
If I'd known what family she was from,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.520
I wouldn't have come all the way here.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.160
It took a lot of courage
just to step foot in this house.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.400
To be honest...

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.960
She's not my friend.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.799
I knew it!

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.679
- Since the very moment you walked in...
- Man, let me talk!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.559
She's not a friend,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.080
but she is...

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:44.400
Listen carefully.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.640
She's from above.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.880
She's a lizard?

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.740
A gecko?

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.280
Gosh!

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.590
She's from Heaven.
Ever heard of it?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.160
- Heaven?
- Mm!

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.960
So she's a fallen angel
going, "Wee, thud," right?

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.240
That's how you guys met?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.760
Bro, you're not chronically online at all.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.840
Do you know this?

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.960
"Lucky Points, your longing
wish-redemption service."

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.360
That's a dramatic-ass name.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.440
Total nonsense.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.840
Dramatic or not,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.240
the wish I made is standing right here!

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.400
What?

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.800
Put your finger down.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.680
So? Are you in?

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.040
Nah, fat chance.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.980
Get out.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.640
A-Mah!

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.510
Jin got his tongue pierced!

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.120
Okay, Jane!

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.240
Okay!

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.280
You win.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.840
"Connection No. 1," you said?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880
Yes!

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.080
Okay, truce.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.720
Mm.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.880
You're not part of this.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.220
This is family business.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.720
Don't squeeze my hand so tight, please.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.480
How about we let go at the same time?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.050
If you want my help,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.600
then...

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.680
you'll sing while I play the guitar.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.760
Sure thing.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.640
Let me hear

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.720
vocals worthy
of a big singing contest.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.800
It's not all that good.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.820
You're ready!

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840
Don't be nervous.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.080
You ready?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.400
Ready?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.080
- She is!
- I am.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.080
There you go. Come on now.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.530
Don't be intimidated!

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.480
- Be confident!
- But I'm nervous!

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.120
Be confident!

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.520
♫Those nice words you whisper♫

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.520
♫And how you changed me for the better♫

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.680
♫Make me the luckiest one alive♫

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:18.680
♫I wonder how and why♫

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.720
♫We were perfectly thrown
into the same orbit♫

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.720
♫It may be coincidental or fated,♫

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:36.640
♫But it doesn't matter
as much as the way my love grew♫

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.800
♫What a pleasure to meet you♫

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.320
Jane!

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.800
Did listening to your friend sing

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.880
enchant you into a trance?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.920
No, it's just...

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.520
She sang beautifully.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.840
Can't argue with that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.600
After hearing how beautifully you sang,

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.640
I think I know who you're looking for.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.920
Really?!

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.700
There's no one else.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.680
See? He's connection No. 1 for a reason.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.720
You went all this way to help me

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.650
only because you want to take
full advantage of me, didn't you?

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880
That's not it.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.440
Or is this just a pity move
since I'm scared of ghosts?

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.480
Duang-Jai told me about it.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.000
That's not it!

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.000
What?

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.520
Why are you doing this, then?

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.040
After you passed away,

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.920
you didn't know
how you were leaving this world.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.360
Mm.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.280
So what?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.760
You're a jinx.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600
You caused my son's death!

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.780
A-Mah...

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.400
That's enough.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080
Come with me.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.440
A-Mah!

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.520
Am I really a jinx, Mom?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.760
Don't listen to what she said.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.400
If that day...

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.400
Papa hadn't been
in such a rush to pick me up,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.640
he...

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.400
wouldn't have died.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.600
No, don't say that.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.910
Do you think...

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.760
he was aware right then...

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720
that he wouldn't get
to be with us anymore?

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.160
Poor him, don't you agree?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.320
Those who left this world
without a chance to say goodbye

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.440
must've carried deep sorrow.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.480
For me,

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.760
the most dreadful way to face death...

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.480
is when you don't know
how you're leaving.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.920
I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye to Mom.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.520
All of a sudden, she was gone...

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.040
without a sign.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.280
She told me...

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.320
the most dreadful way to face death...

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.560
is not knowing how you're leaving.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.600
Come on.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.120
They probably weren't in sorrow.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.800
What makes you think that?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.520
Look at me.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.920
I can't remember my past,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.220
but I've never felt sad.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.120
Who knows? If I'd known how I'd die,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.440
I might have been even sadder.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.800
So why are we doing all this?!

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.370
Well...

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.730
Since we came all the way here,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.560
I'm starting to have a good time!

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:11.520
Come to think of it,

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.520
you're actually pretty nice, Jane.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.540
With that intense gaze,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.040
you two might as well get a room.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.520
Jin, what the hell?!

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.160
Just get outta here.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.760
Don't listen to him!

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.900
I got us an appointment.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.560
Whoa, really?!

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.360
Hey!

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.360
But...

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.040
This one is like a mad dog.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.400
Just a heads-up.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.240
Here are your visitor passes.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.440
Oh.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.580
How long have you been here?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.560
Gosh, took you long enough.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.600
We got the passes ages ago.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.400
Good girl, how smart of you.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.480
Shall we?

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.840
I never thought

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.320
I'd get a chance
to set foot in the Clare Tone Building.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.840
I've always listened to their songs.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.520
Now that you mention it,

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.200
that kinda rings a bell.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.280
Really?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.960
It's a prominent company, isn't it?

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.920
It really is.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.480
He's also under this company,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.720
but I don't know why
he never really blew up.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.920
For bands like us, it's called...

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.800
being 'niche-famous.'

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.000
You wouldn't discover it
if you had crappy taste.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.640
Here's someone with fine taste.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.860
We dress like this!

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.920
Right?

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.820
That looks ordinary.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.520
Do you know why
Jin never became famous?

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.540
Because his band
is literally called 'Almost Famous,'

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.160
so he's stuck being almost famous!

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.320
I can hear you!

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.300
Let's go.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.510
Speaking of taste? Everything went wrong
after you named the band.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.280
Nope!

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.240
I said, "No fucking ad-libs." Try again!

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.440
♫I'm at fault for discovering a fine tree
with a chipped axe blade♫

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.200
♫I wouldn't dare claim it…♫

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.080
♫I'm at fault for discovering a fine tree
with a chipped axe blade♫

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.360
♫I wouldn't dare claim it…♫

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.320
Miss Clare...

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.480
What now?!

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160
What, Jin?

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.720
Why didn't you call ahead?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.480
Hello.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.960
I'm fucking buried in work.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.800
Who did you bring with you?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.320
Just say what you want.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.600
I've wasted all day on this artist.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.280
He can't fucking do it right.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.960
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760
Right!

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.960
It's nothing.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.080
It's just that this guy
is all the rage right now!

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.040
Uh, let's get to the point.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.840
They need help,

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.800
and they will be
the ones asking you for it,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.520
right?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.600
She's right here, so go ahead.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.560
Why are you here talking about angels?

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.040
That's nonsense.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.640
Am I a fucking joke to you?

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.590
Go play outside, children.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.160
And tell your little friend

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.160
that what she's wearing
doesn't work.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.800
That look is terrible.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320
It does work.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.360
Excuse me.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.920
Are you praying for her downfall?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.360
That heavy wolf cut is so last decade.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.040
Huh?!

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240
Heavy wolf cut?

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.720
What heavy wolf cut?

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:33.760
What?

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.440
Honestly, she has a point.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.640
I was gonna bring it up
when we were out front.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.400
Can't you take hints?

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.960
You're dressing funny.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.200
Your hair was just short yesterday.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.200
Did you suddenly get extensions
just for that hairstyle?

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.080
Let me take a photo.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:46.920
Smile.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.480
Three, two, one, cheese!

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:54.720
- Shit!
- Shit!

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.160
Why does she look like that?

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.800
What? The camera quality is solid.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.840
Heaven's order.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.040
Are you really an angel?

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.960
You bet I am.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.800
Come on, say that again.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.720
You bet I am.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.880
That's familiar.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.800
Isn't it?

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.980
- It is.
- It is, isn't it?

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.720
Yes, ma'am.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.240
Hey, doesn't she sound familiar?

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160
I can't place it.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.160
Damn, forget it.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.880
Get out.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.960
Mr. Jin, please escort your friends out.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.840
Miss Clare is exhausted today.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.720
Please leave for now.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.040
Jane, watch out!

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.440
Take a pic!

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.360
Maybe that's it!

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.880
You two, freeze for a sec.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.880
Just stay still like so.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.160
Maybe that's it. It's possible, right?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.640
It is possible, Miss Clare.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.110
What do you mean?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360
Nothing.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.160
What did you want my help with?

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.680
Right, we would like to trouble you
to introduce someone to us.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.000
My friend, Z, has such beautiful vocals,

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.080
so I thought you might know

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.360
a friend of a friend of a friend
of a friend of a friend of a friend

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.440
who you can introduce to us.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.120
Jin...

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.000
These kids are unhinged.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.480
Unhinged?

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.000
Out of everyone in this room,
you're the most unhinged one.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.720
Come on, let's go home.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.640
No chance I'm staying. Let's get a move on.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.320
You like getting on my nerves, huh?!

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.530
- What's on your mind?
- Argh!

00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.880
What?

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.720
Can you stay out of my business for once?

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.160
What's your position?

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.640
A manager, isn't it?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.520
Then, your job
is to take care of your artist.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.520
If you can't finish recording,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.640
I'll fucking charge
every single one of you.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.160
Assholes...

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.320
Here.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.800
Don't expect too much, Jane.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.360
There are tens of millions of people.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.680
There's no way we'd find one that easily.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.840
Aren't you curious

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.400
why everyone suddenly
saw you as weird-looking?

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.960
Why was that?

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.360
I heard Duang-Jai said...

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.000
Heaven's order.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.440
"Heaven's order."

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.000
But this wasn't the case before,

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.640
and as far as I know,
it doesn't happen to other angels.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.520
Honestly...

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.680
Sometimes, those above

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.920
are pretty wacky.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.680
What for, though?!

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.040
Ugh, I don't get it!

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.520
There, there.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880
Whoa!

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.540
Hey!

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.480
You still have the audacity
to be in the kitchen?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.680
What?

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.560
I just want to take care of you.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.960
It's a piece of cake, really.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.700
And it's for you.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.290
Look at you being all caring.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.400
What do you really want?

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.640
I just want to be useful for once.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.380
It does look yummy.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.440
Cute, isn't it?

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.240
Right,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.560
last night, I slept on it.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.720
Since those above

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.200
decided to make you
look like an old-school idol,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.880
should we turn you
into an influencer of that style?

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.040
If you blew up,

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.120
you could help me
with my shio pan business.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.600
That sounds interesting.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160
But...

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.440
if I were in front of a camera,

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.320
wouldn't I be super tense?

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.720
What? Just don't think about it!

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.320
Come on, let's give it a try.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.520
Three, two, one.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.560
Whoa!

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.900
Look!

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.160
Whoa, why is it like this?

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120
Does this mean...

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.040
you're gonna change every day?

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.000
How is that even possible?

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.800
That means the content
I've come up with is down the drain!

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.560
Heaven, why are you doing this to me?

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.520
Isn't this already hard enough?!

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.120
But...

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.640
This might work better for your content.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.520
How?

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.790
Well, since I'm gonna change every day,

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.880
you won't even have to come up
with something new.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.400
Whoa, you're right!

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.000
Snap and switch!

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.040
How awesome.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.440
Dope!

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.350
Dope!

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.740
Are you ready?

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.960
I am!

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.880
- Today, we're going to Mars!
- Mars!

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.680
Let's do it!

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.360
And action!

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.480
Shio pan, shio pan.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.640
Buy 2, get 1 free. Buy 4, get 2 free.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.800
Buy 8, get 3 free!

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.630
Hey!

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.080
Get 4 free!

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.280
Shio-shio pan,

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.920
how scrumptious, how scrumptious.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.560
Shio-shio pan,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.600
have you tried it, have you tried it?

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.760
Let's eat!

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.480
Yay!

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.640
We're definitely going to Mars today!

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.040
Yay!

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.560
What's the matter?

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.720
What are you doing?

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.120
Your nails are really tough.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.440
I got it.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.030
What are you doing?

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.240
Scratch my back.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.420
- Scratch your back?
- Mm!

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760
Go a bit lower.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.400
A little to the left.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.320
There.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.200
A bit longer, please?

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.840
Do it right in the middle.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:09.800
Okay...

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.680
Can you do the level 1 speed?

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.520
Here's level 1.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.520
Level 2!

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.640
Level 3!

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.880
That tickles!

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.920
Do it right!

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.040
How about the swing mode?

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.080
- Just kidding.
- You try it.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.240
Like this!

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.320
Hey, there are some likes coming in.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.640
Some comments, too.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.800
I'll read it for you.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.440
"Where do you get that costume?

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.920
It looks so realistic!"

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080
Five,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.320
nine,

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480
two,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.600
four,

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.520
five!

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.200
Whoa, look!

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.160
These are the orders
from yesterday's video!

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.680
Whoa, that's a lot!

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.240
Exactly!

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.520
- Wow!
- Aw, I'm so happy!

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.920
Finally, you made yourself useful!

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.920
Yay!

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800
Here.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.200
Why are you giving me this?

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.960
So you can start writing
a new song in the meantime.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.000
Today, we're taking it further.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.000
A new song?

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.040
Mm!

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:55.760
Okay.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:03.440
It's Jin.
[Slide to answer]

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.480
Hello, Jin. What's up?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.880
Huh?!

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.920
Miss Clare has agreed to help?

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.380
Yeah.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:20.040
But she said you had to work for it.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.679
Work? What work?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.120
Well, acting in an MV.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.080
Huh? An MV?

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:30.520
Right.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:32.159
She texted me saying,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.120
"Tell Jane and Z

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.480
they have to help me with my work
if they want my help.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:39.760
It'll take fewer than five days,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.760
less than two hours a day.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.639
And most importantly,
they have to get dressed up at home."

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.760
Are you fucking crazy, bro?!

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.280
And she knows Z's outfit
changes every day, doesn't she?

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.280
"That's what I like.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.679
No need to find costumes.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.080
You two will play girlfriends.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120
The idea is that you're mad at her,

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.160
and she dresses up every day
in fancy outfits to win you back."

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.680
There's that. Are you down?

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.640
What the actual hell?

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.640
Okay, Jin.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.760
Thanks.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.400
That angel's voice sounds familiar to me.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.840
If you wanna know where I recognized it from,
come help me with my work.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.680
Periodt!

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.800
Irasshaimase!

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.560
Are you Jane?

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.560
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.080
I'm gonna give you a rough briefing.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.520
For you, it's basically nothing.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.240
Just sit still and look pretty
while she makes up with you.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.040
The hard part's on you.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.840
That's fire.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.320
I heard you have a lot of costumes
in your wardrobe.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.840
That's even better than what
our costume team prepared.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.520
- Right...
- Here's the plot.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.360
You're gonna dress funny
to win her back every day.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.400
She gets mad on Friday,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.240
then caves and makes up with you
on Monday.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.000
That's about it.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.240
Thank you.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.520
Why do we have to go this far?

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.480
We're not even getting paid.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.160
What?

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.760
Didn't you say you'd help
find out about who I am?

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.520
I'm helping!

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.960
Miss Clare is here!

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.240
Be ready, guys!

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.400
Hello.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.120
Hello.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.320
You'd better do it right.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.000
Don't waste my time.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:56.880
So? Are we gonna start?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.320
Yes, ma'am.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.280
- Thought so.
- Has the camera been set up?

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.440
And action!

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160
Hey, you.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.370
Let's make up...

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:19.960
'Kay?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:20.600
Huh?!

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:21.510
'Kay?

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.440
Cut!

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.000
Did you just straight-up read the lines?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.680
I can do that myself
with a fucking script.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.120
If you're dressed like a samurai,
you need to act like one!

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.320
Jeez! Not like that.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.960
You're gonna act funny to win her back!

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.360
Do you get it?

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.680
You fucking suck.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.240
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.140
If you two can't get it right,
I won't be helping you anymore.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.600
Can I please have ten minutes?

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.480
Make it five.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080
Alright, five minutes.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.240
We'll be back.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.830
Let's go, we'll take five!

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.600
Why can't you even do that?

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.520
Can you please calm down?

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.320
I've just never been
in front of a camera before.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.240
Neither have I.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.000
You need to stop being a dead weight,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:26.990
jerk!

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.640
What's going on?

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.040
Did Miss Clare get into your head?

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.400
Look at all the cursing.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.440
If you keep fumbling,

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.080
I'll send you back to the ghosts.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.400
Hey!

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.360
Please don't, Jane.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:57.280
From now until we're done filming the MV,

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.600
don't ever talk to me.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.200
Can we please make up?

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.350
Here.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.000
Jane!

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.240
Jane!

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.320
Are you still mad at me?

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.720
Didn't I tell you that we weren't gonna talk

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.040
until we're done filming the MV?

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.560
But...

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.040
Don't follow me!

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.070
Jane!

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.680
Give me that!

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.680
No!

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.240
Let me have it!

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160
Give me that!

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.400
Please let me sleep by your side.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.560
Please...

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.400
Let go!

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.550
Sleep here.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.040
Jane, don't do this to me!

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.280
Please let me sleep by your side...

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.360
No!

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.080
No!

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.320
Get out!

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.280
That! That's it! On point!

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.080
Everything went right!

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.640
Flawless!

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.920
I'm gonna cry...

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.320
That was good, really.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360
But let's do it again.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.400
There's nothing I'd fix.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.360
Good, good.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.000
You're so cold-hearted.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.960
What? Your acting was so stiff.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.280
If we'd kept acting like that,
Miss Clare would've kicked us out.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.880
I was completely terrified.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.440
I thought you were going to send me back
to the Spirit Relations Department.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.770
Look.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.160
Even if I don't send you back myself,

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.160
if you keep misbehaving,

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.360
the app will take you back anyway.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.680
Don't threaten me, Jane!

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.640
I don't wanna.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:43.830
Wanna try?

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:44.950
Wanna go back?

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.960
Well,

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.840
says the person who kissed me
in front of everyone.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.880
Weren't you shy?

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.880
It was a peck,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.560
- not a kiss!
- But it was.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.680
Just a peck!

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.160
Ugh!

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.800
Gosh!

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.320
Uh!

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.120
- What's the difference?
- Huh?

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.000
Don't bring this up ever again.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.960
I only did it
to help you find your relatives.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.320
Fine.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.680
Okay, that concludes today's conversation.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.840
Time to go to bed.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:04.760
Sleep!

00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.480
Right,

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.560
tell Joon and the team to gather
all of last year's demos for me.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.560
Everything from last year... Yeah.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200
Make it quick.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:09.400
Bye.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:45.400
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:52.160
♫Your smile almost got me on the ground♫

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.760
There's only one left,

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.040
so let's share it.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:15.800
Mm.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.120
Here.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.720
Wait!

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640
That's so good!

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.220
Mm!

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.840
We sold two boxes today.

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.040
Your video was helpful, you know?

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.640
It brought in two customers.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.880
Wow, two customers...

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.130
Hm?

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.200
It's Miss Clare.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.640
Hello?

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.920
Is everything okay?

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:17.080
Yeah, the lines I sent you.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.080
Tell your friend to record them
and send them back to me.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.640
Alright, I'm on it.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.800
All of them, yeah.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.280
Here.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.840
She asked if you could read these lines

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.480
for me to record.

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.720
What is that? A poem?

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.520
And why do I have to sound it out?

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.120
Gosh, just do it.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.360
Here, give it a try.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.840
"You secretly got my head in the clouds."

00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:00.240
"Your smile almost got me on the ground."

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.480
Why are you making that face?

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.740
I don't know.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.840
That poem just suddenly felt familiar.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.360
But I think it's nothing.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.520
Okay.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.560
You secretly got my head in the clouds.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.240
Whoa...

00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.480
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.800
Are they the same person?

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.120
You secretly got my head in the clouds.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.310
She sent something else.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.440
Here.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.800
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.480
♫Your smile...♫

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:38.840
♫You secretly got my head in the clouds♫

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:45.680
♫Your smile almost got me on the ground♫

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.720
♫You secretly...♫

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.420
Do you know this song?

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.280
I don't.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.240
What?

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.680
But it just rolled off the tongue
after listening to it.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.480
What is it that she sent?

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.710
Look.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.240
This is a demo someone sent me.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.440
Nobody's heard it except my team and me.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.100
Does this mean...

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.960
Do you happen to know

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.680
who sent the demo?

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.560
I'll find a way to help you then,

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.720
but I have a lot on my plate right now.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.120
Can you two give me a hand first?

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.280
No matter how many times I listen to this song,
it still sounds like your voice.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.000
Why doesn't it ring a bell?

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.840
When fate smiles on you, luck favors you!

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.160
If you're in such a hurry,
you should've come yesterday.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.080
Hello, Jane.

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.320
My office is no different
from a zombie apocalypse!
