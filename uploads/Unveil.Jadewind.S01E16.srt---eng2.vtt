{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:39.425
Or someone is using this
to harm the prince,

00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:42.345
it all goes
to the Palace Investigation Bureau

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:44.785
for a thorough investigation!

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:46.945
Physician Liu,

00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:48.785
ultimately,

00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:50.825
you'll have

00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:53.745
to explain it yourself.

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:03.905
No.

00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:06.185
This prescription can't be wrong.

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:07.905
Did you mix something up?

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:09.665
No, it can't be.

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:11.505
My master checked it.

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.545
He scolded me for being stubborn.

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:17.105
But it wouldn't kill anyone
even if it's strong.

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:21.185
Let me out.

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:22.425
I want to see Liu Jia's body.

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:23.345
I need to know the truth.

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:26.225
To stop the epidemic from spreading,

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:27.665
the Imperial Medical Office
burned the bodies.

00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:32.265
Then I'll never clear my name.

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.665
Instead of proving
that eunuch is at fault,

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:38.145
find a way to prove your medicine works.

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:42.665
Your Ladyship, please get me a set
of used bowls and chopsticks.

00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:46.545
No one has ever
ordered me around like this.

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:49.385
I spoke out of turn, Your Ladyship.

00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:52.145
But I'm not doing this
to compete with Supervisor Huang.

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:54.065
This epidemic shows no mercy.

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:55.665
We can't lose anyone else.

00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:58.425
Saving lives comes first. I'll help you.

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.065
Pei Yu, Her Ladyship gave you this.

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:08.345
Be careful with it.

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.385
{\an8}PRESCRIPTION

00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:40.425
- Where's Her Ladyship?
- She went back to her room to sleep.

00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:42.185
She's usually up past the Hai Hour.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.425
Why did she turn in so early tonight?

00:03:58.745 --> 00:03:59.585
You're sick?

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:04.545
Your Ladyship?

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:06.025
Open the door!

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:08.865
I'm fine.

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:10.305
I'm still alive.

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:13.745
Li Peiyi? Open up!

00:04:31.585 --> 00:04:32.865
How dare you

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:34.705
call me by my full name?

00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:37.065
Don't hide.

00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:44.665
You're burning up.

00:05:01.745 --> 00:05:03.385
Why is it so bad?

00:05:03.465 --> 00:05:04.985
Did you catch it in Lady Su's palace?

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:07.185
No. We can't waste time.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.225
I'll go get Physician Liu.

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:09.585
Mr. Xiao, wait!

00:05:12.465 --> 00:05:14.425
What's the use of finding
the imperial physicians?

00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:17.545
We both know
there's no cure for this right now.

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:20.545
If I'm not meant to die,

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:23.265
I'll make it through this.

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.145
But if I can't escape it…

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:28.905
Don't talk like that.

00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:31.105
I'll call the imperial physicians.

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:32.545
Once they arrive,

00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:35.825
it won't be easy for me

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:37.425
to see you again.

00:05:41.145 --> 00:05:42.465
You know

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:44.905
what haunts me most

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:48.225
is the truth behind the massacre
at the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:05:53.145 --> 00:05:54.385
If I die,

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:57.785
please uncover the truth for me.

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:03.425
You're thoughtful,

00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:06.025
kind, and sharp.

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:08.185
I trust you.

00:06:26.025 --> 00:06:27.425
You won't agree?

00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:33.025
You never speak straight.

00:06:34.145 --> 00:06:35.345
Forgive me. I can't promise.

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:40.265
If you won't, fine.

00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:43.025
After I'm gone,

00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:45.745
you won't let me down.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:52.865
But then,

00:06:54.865 --> 00:06:56.545
you wouldn't even
agree with me saying that.

00:07:14.985 --> 00:07:17.105
That old man Du Zhixing

00:07:18.025 --> 00:07:19.545
never lets anyone rest easy.

00:07:20.465 --> 00:07:21.825
He looks tough,

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.705
but all these years,
he's ruined his health.

00:07:28.105 --> 00:07:29.465
If I die,

00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:33.425
promise me you won't
mess with him using poison again.

00:07:34.945 --> 00:07:36.585
And make him drink less too.

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:39.665
That girl Wuren

00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:43.345
has gotten better at cases.

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:46.545
I'm not worried.

00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:51.865
Prosecutor Gu is a good man.

00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:55.145
If one day she wants to marry him,

00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:58.545
you need to vet him for me.

00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:02.065
Wait for me.

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:05.345
Mr. Xiao!

00:08:08.465 --> 00:08:10.505
You want me to gamble with fate?

00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:14.745
You're just lucky.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:17.585
Thank goodness
that arranged marriage wasn't binding.

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:19.945
Otherwise, if I really died,

00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:24.465
you'd be a widower at such a young age.

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:51.945
These past few days,
more people have fallen ill.

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:53.585
Our medical officials
have gone to the palaces.

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:55.345
No one's left to make house calls.

00:09:00.065 --> 00:09:01.905
If she runs a fever, she should drink
this Minor Bupleurum Decoction.

00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:04.545
If she coughs or her throat hurts,
she should take these pills.

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.185
This is all we can do for now.

00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:08.625
Tomorrow morning,
if any medical officials return,

00:09:08.705 --> 00:09:09.905
they'll go
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:24.425
Your Ladyship,

00:09:24.945 --> 00:09:26.185
the imperial physicians
are all out on calls.

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:28.145
Here's something for fever and throat.

00:09:28.945 --> 00:09:30.105
Take them for now.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.185
We both know they won't help.

00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:37.665
They can't cure it, and they taste awful.

00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:39.545
That's what really makes me suffer.

00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.665
If you're truly miserable,

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:43.585
don't hold back.

00:09:47.705 --> 00:09:49.345
No medicine beats getting a good sleep.

00:09:51.105 --> 00:09:52.825
You should rest too.

00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:56.105
If you catch the epidemic because of me,
it won't be worth it.

00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:13.025
So much for "I don't believe in that."

00:11:14.345 --> 00:11:16.425
Looks like he's scared I'll die.

00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:29.065
You didn't catch a chill, did you?

00:11:31.665 --> 00:11:34.225
Last night, you fell asleep in the yard.

00:11:34.305 --> 00:11:35.865
Her Ladyship told us to carry you back.

00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:38.265
Her Ladyship is already sick.

00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:39.865
You can't fall ill too.

00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:42.465
Thank you.

00:11:42.545 --> 00:11:43.505
How is Her Ladyship?

00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:46.505
She won't let us see her.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.185
To clear my name,

00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:02.785
you even made yourself get infected
to test my medicine.

00:12:03.385 --> 00:12:04.665
I will do everything I can…

00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:12.785
Mr. Xiao, you visited
the Imperial Medical Office.

00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:14.585
Since no physicians can treat me,

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:16.505
let Technician Pei try.

00:12:22.345 --> 00:12:23.225
In that case,

00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:26.625
Technician Pei, please do
everything you can to treat Her Ladyship.

00:12:37.025 --> 00:12:38.225
He's so kind.

00:12:40.305 --> 00:12:41.945
If I die by your hand,

00:12:42.505 --> 00:12:44.065
then no one can help you anymore.

00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:02.465
Why are you coughing so hard?

00:13:06.025 --> 00:13:08.665
Does Pei Yu's medicine even work?

00:13:09.585 --> 00:13:10.785
Put it down. Go.

00:13:14.705 --> 00:13:16.705
You wouldn't let me see you.

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:19.025
Even just one day,

00:13:19.105 --> 00:13:20.865
I missed you like crazy.

00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:23.105
How can you be so heartless?

00:13:24.265 --> 00:13:26.265
I'm not fully better yet.

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:27.505
I just didn't want you to catch it.

00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:31.665
I got this from the Imperial Food Service.

00:13:32.305 --> 00:13:33.305
It's cold and sweet.

00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:35.665
It'll soothe your throat.

00:13:38.305 --> 00:13:39.785
Take your medicine first.

00:13:54.385 --> 00:13:56.305
Stop waiting for him. Mr. Xiao

00:13:56.385 --> 00:13:58.185
left early this morning.

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:00.825
No.

00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:03.025
He didn't ask if you're feeling better?

00:14:05.265 --> 00:14:06.825
And you aren't curious whether I'm better?

00:14:10.345 --> 00:14:11.185
Fever's gone.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.145
My cough's much better too.

00:14:16.025 --> 00:14:17.465
You were coughing so hard earlier.

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:18.905
So you were faking it.

00:14:34.225 --> 00:14:35.505
Mr. Xiao, you're back.

00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:58.225
From your pulse,

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:00.985
you have recovered.

00:15:01.585 --> 00:15:03.865
For the next few days,
eat some nourishing foods,

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:05.385
and you'll be back to normal.

00:15:06.025 --> 00:15:07.425
How do you feel, Your Ladyship?

00:15:08.265 --> 00:15:09.585
Much lighter.

00:15:10.105 --> 00:15:11.985
I didn't cough at all last night.

00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:13.105
Slept till dawn.

00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:16.185
I told you my medicine was fine.

00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:22.665
Tell Mr. Xiao

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:23.745
I'm not dying anytime soon.

00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:27.385
Mr. Xiao left early this morning.

00:15:29.745 --> 00:15:31.265
He didn't ask about me at all?

00:15:37.025 --> 00:15:38.865
He's just calm and reserved.

00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:40.825
He must've known I'd recover.

00:15:42.905 --> 00:15:45.065
Your Ladyship, you're done for.

00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:47.665
Now you even make excuses for him.

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:01.745
That day, a supervisor
from the Imperial Medical Office came.

00:16:01.825 --> 00:16:03.785
He'd draw lots to pick someone
to test the medicine.

00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:07.225
He carried a bamboo basket
filled with folded slips.

00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:09.625
He said whoever drew a slip
with writing would go test it.

00:16:10.225 --> 00:16:11.785
Everyone drew?

00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:14.985
Yes. At first, a dozen were blank.

00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:17.465
Until Liu Jia drew one with writing.

00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:19.585
Everyone envied him at first,

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:22.585
until they heard the drug killed him.

00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:24.185
Then they all got scared.

00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:26.545
Did you see what the slip looked like?

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:28.945
On Liu Jia's slip, there was a character.

00:16:29.025 --> 00:16:31.305
Everyone tried to get a look.

00:16:31.385 --> 00:16:32.945
But Liu Jia said his hands were wet,

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:35.465
and the paper got damp and tore,
so he tossed it.

00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:37.745
What did the supervisor look like?

00:16:37.825 --> 00:16:39.425
A man.

00:16:40.105 --> 00:16:41.945
He had a scar
on the back of his right hand.

00:16:44.105 --> 00:16:45.065
Got it.

00:16:50.425 --> 00:16:52.065
Greetings, Your Majesty, Your Highness.

00:16:59.225 --> 00:17:00.625
You're really recovered!

00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:03.145
Look at you.

00:17:03.665 --> 00:17:04.905
You got sick and didn't say a word.

00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:06.944
Only told us after you got better.

00:17:12.585 --> 00:17:14.785
I'm here today to beg forgiveness.

00:17:14.865 --> 00:17:16.385
With the palace gates sealed,

00:17:16.464 --> 00:17:18.145
you still managed to stir up trouble.

00:17:19.065 --> 00:17:20.385
I didn't cause a disaster this time.

00:17:20.464 --> 00:17:21.704
Let's hear it.

00:17:22.985 --> 00:17:25.704
Last time we tested the new prescription,
a eunuch died suddenly.

00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:27.745
Yet the Physicians
at the Imperial Medical Office

00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:30.465
all said this prescription
wouldn't cause such a violent outcome.

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:32.745
To verify it again,

00:17:33.785 --> 00:17:35.145
I chose to infect myself

00:17:35.225 --> 00:17:37.265
and asked Technician Pei to treat me,

00:17:37.345 --> 00:17:38.465
using the same prescription.

00:17:40.545 --> 00:17:42.945
I acted first and reported later,
so I'm here to apologize.

00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:47.785
You were far too reckless.

00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:49.425
Good thing you recovered.

00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:50.905
Truly a stroke of luck.

00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:56.185
Since this was to verify
the new prescription

00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:57.305
and ease Your Majesty's burden,

00:17:57.385 --> 00:17:58.985
then please don't punish her.

00:18:03.785 --> 00:18:04.705
Get up.

00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:09.305
Look at you.

00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:12.065
You made me and Consort Shu worry sick.

00:18:12.145 --> 00:18:14.585
That's a crime!
And crimes deserve punishment!

00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:17.305
But… not today.

00:18:17.945 --> 00:18:20.505
Where's the one
who wrote the prescription?

00:18:20.585 --> 00:18:23.105
She's only a woman technician.

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.345
She's waiting outside.

00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:31.025
Summon the technician!

00:18:39.825 --> 00:18:40.865
Your Majesty.

00:18:41.465 --> 00:18:44.185
This guilty subject, Pei Yu,
pays respects to Your Majesty.

00:18:44.785 --> 00:18:45.985
Look up and speak.

00:18:48.585 --> 00:18:51.225
Is this prescription
the same as last time?

00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:53.785
What Her Ladyship took
was the same as last time.

00:18:53.865 --> 00:18:56.305
Then why did it kill someone last time?

00:18:57.785 --> 00:18:59.385
Your Majesty, because that man

00:18:59.465 --> 00:19:01.145
already had a severe stomach illness.

00:19:01.225 --> 00:19:03.825
These past few days,
I've spoken to his coworkers.

00:19:03.905 --> 00:19:06.825
They all knew
he'd suffered from it for years.

00:19:06.905 --> 00:19:09.145
The records show it as well.

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:11.625
When I took his pulse before the test,

00:19:11.705 --> 00:19:13.585
I could tell he had stomach trouble.

00:19:13.665 --> 00:19:15.025
But it didn't seem serious.

00:19:15.105 --> 00:19:17.945
It seems he took stomach medicine
before the test.

00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:19.985
I adjusted the prescription,

00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:22.105
but he still couldn't handle the strain,

00:19:22.185 --> 00:19:23.105
so…

00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:26.185
So the problem wasn't the prescription,

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:27.785
but the hidden condition,

00:19:27.865 --> 00:19:29.665
which affected Technician Pei's diagnosis.

00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:32.145
With this medicine,

00:19:32.825 --> 00:19:35.385
can Jing handle it?

00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:37.665
Before treating the young prince,

00:19:37.745 --> 00:19:39.465
I'll review the pulse records
from these days

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.065
and his current condition.

00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:51.505
Good. Then my son is in your hands.

00:19:52.665 --> 00:19:54.465
I won't fail Your Majesty!

00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:08.345
You've recovered?

00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:11.505
Yes. Thanks to Technician Pei's medicine.

00:20:17.545 --> 00:20:20.505
And thank you, too,
for getting help that night.

00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:23.505
It was nothing.

00:20:23.585 --> 00:20:25.145
If it were me who fell ill,

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:27.585
I'm sure you would do the same.

00:20:35.425 --> 00:20:36.585
I have to say it, after all.

00:20:37.825 --> 00:20:38.785
Mr. Xiao,

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:43.785
I got infected on purpose to help
prove Technician Pei's prescription.

00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:46.825
I promised you before
I wouldn't hurt myself again,

00:20:46.905 --> 00:20:48.585
but I broke it.

00:20:49.105 --> 00:20:50.705
Say what you want.

00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:52.185
I won't make excuses.

00:20:53.145 --> 00:20:54.865
I trusted Technician Pei…

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:58.905
but I didn't know if I'd live.

00:21:00.985 --> 00:21:02.865
I lied to you about why I got sick.

00:21:03.385 --> 00:21:06.345
But what I said back then
was all from the heart.

00:21:06.945 --> 00:21:08.185
If you're angry,

00:21:08.705 --> 00:21:09.905
I don't blame you.

00:21:10.665 --> 00:21:11.825
But…

00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:16.105
being sick is awful.

00:21:16.185 --> 00:21:17.065
Don't ever get sick.

00:21:22.425 --> 00:21:25.505
I've seen you risk your own body
for the cases.

00:21:26.265 --> 00:21:28.705
And I always thought it looked brave

00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:29.985
yet somewhat reckless.

00:21:30.865 --> 00:21:31.905
But this time,

00:21:31.985 --> 00:21:34.185
I finally get your intention.

00:21:34.785 --> 00:21:35.985
In this deep palace,

00:21:36.505 --> 00:21:38.745
sometimes only a do-or-die move

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:41.865
can lead you to the truth and save lives.

00:21:45.865 --> 00:21:47.225
You're flattering me.

00:21:47.985 --> 00:21:49.185
I'm not that noble.

00:21:50.385 --> 00:21:51.985
My position just grants me

00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:53.785
more room to act than others have.

00:21:54.705 --> 00:21:56.545
I'm anxious about the epidemic here.
That's true.

00:21:57.305 --> 00:21:59.545
I wanted to help Pei Yu
prove the prescription. That's true too.

00:22:00.145 --> 00:22:02.385
I'm not afraid of death. That's true.

00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:04.585
But I'm afraid…

00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:11.105
Don't be.

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:13.545
You drew an auspicious hexagram.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:14.825
I knew I'd be fine.

00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:18.225
You didn't come to check on me those days,

00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:19.985
so I thought you were mad.

00:22:20.065 --> 00:22:22.145
Turns out I was being petty.

00:22:22.225 --> 00:22:25.025
You were investigating
that eunuch who tested the medicine.

00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:29.345
If I were hovering around you all day,

00:22:29.425 --> 00:22:31.025
you wouldn't have recovered this fast.

00:22:32.945 --> 00:22:34.825
You wanted to clear Technician Pei's name.

00:22:34.905 --> 00:22:36.225
All I could do was a small thing

00:22:36.825 --> 00:22:39.545
to prove that failed test
wasn't entirely her fault.

00:22:40.265 --> 00:22:42.865
Liu Jia being picked to test it
wasn't a coincidence.

00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:44.305
Right.

00:22:44.385 --> 00:22:46.585
The one who came to pick someone
was Huang Futong.

00:22:47.985 --> 00:22:50.585
You chose Liu Jia on purpose, didn't you?

00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:52.465
So you're saying

00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:56.065
his death from Pei Yu's prescription
was my scheme?

00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:01.745
That woman can barely practice medicine,

00:23:01.825 --> 00:23:03.785
yet her witchcraft is impressive.

00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:05.665
Everyone's defending her.

00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:09.385
Pei Yu's prescription is harsh.

00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:11.105
To keep her from rising,

00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:13.185
you found Liu Jia
infected with the epidemic

00:23:13.265 --> 00:23:14.545
and with a stomach disease on top of it.

00:23:16.825 --> 00:23:18.185
How ridiculous.

00:23:19.025 --> 00:23:21.145
I do one rotation every three months,

00:23:21.225 --> 00:23:23.905
and I've treated countless.

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:25.505
How would I know who has stomach trouble?

00:23:25.585 --> 00:23:28.665
Besides, the patient
was picked by drawing lots.

00:23:29.265 --> 00:23:30.865
It was fate.

00:23:37.785 --> 00:23:38.705
HUANG FUTONG

00:23:39.665 --> 00:23:40.665
Fate…

00:23:41.745 --> 00:23:42.745
like this?

00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:47.385
I don't know what "magic" you're playing,

00:23:47.465 --> 00:23:50.065
but if you have solid proof

00:23:50.145 --> 00:23:52.105
that I rigged anything,

00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:53.425
I'll plead guilty.

00:23:54.225 --> 00:23:55.345
Otherwise,

00:23:55.425 --> 00:23:57.705
I'd ask you to stay away
from the Medical Office.

00:23:58.305 --> 00:24:00.265
We're already short-handed.

00:24:00.345 --> 00:24:03.105
If you delay treatment for the nobles,

00:24:03.185 --> 00:24:05.505
you won't be able to bear that blame.

00:24:08.545 --> 00:24:09.785
It's alum.

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:12.145
The Medical Office has plenty of that.

00:24:12.745 --> 00:24:16.745
I suspect Huang Futong used alum water
to write on every slip,

00:24:16.825 --> 00:24:20.345
then tricked Liu Jia to wet his fingertip
before the draw.

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:22.345
That way, no matter which slip he took,

00:24:22.425 --> 00:24:24.505
the hidden ink would show.

00:24:25.785 --> 00:24:27.185
But Liu Jia is dead,

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:30.105
and the slips from that draw
have long vanished.

00:24:33.825 --> 00:24:34.745
Master!

00:24:35.545 --> 00:24:36.705
Master!

00:24:38.665 --> 00:24:40.465
Still steaming your eyes now?

00:24:41.745 --> 00:24:43.065
Master?

00:24:59.545 --> 00:25:00.865
Master?

00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:03.545
Master?

00:25:04.585 --> 00:25:05.865
Master?

00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:10.385
Master…

00:25:14.185 --> 00:25:15.505
Master…

00:25:27.185 --> 00:25:28.985
When you arrived,
Physician Song was like this?

00:25:33.905 --> 00:25:34.905
No.

00:25:35.625 --> 00:25:36.625
When I came in,

00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:38.665
Master had a cloth over his head.

00:25:39.265 --> 00:25:40.745
He had an eye illness.

00:25:40.825 --> 00:25:42.505
Every night before bed,

00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:44.825
he would steam his eyes
with this decoction.

00:25:44.905 --> 00:25:48.145
He leaned over the basin
and let the steam bathe his eyes.

00:25:48.745 --> 00:25:49.745
It's been cold lately.

00:25:49.825 --> 00:25:52.625
With a warm cloth on top,
the water would cool more slowly.

00:25:58.225 --> 00:25:59.545
Could there be something wrong
with this medicine?

00:26:00.145 --> 00:26:01.865
I know Master's formula.

00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:20.545
It wasn't the problem.

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:23.305
Then this decoction?

00:26:23.385 --> 00:26:26.185
If there were an issue,
Master would've noticed.

00:26:26.265 --> 00:26:28.345
And it was mild in nature.

00:26:28.425 --> 00:26:30.665
No clashing ingredients in it.

00:26:31.865 --> 00:26:33.825
Did he steam his eyes every night?

00:26:34.825 --> 00:26:35.825
Yes.

00:26:36.425 --> 00:26:37.425
Who knew about this?

00:26:38.145 --> 00:26:39.585
Everyone at the Medical Office knew.

00:26:44.985 --> 00:26:46.945
Technician Pei,
please step outside with me.

00:26:54.505 --> 00:26:55.865
Without her master's protection,

00:26:55.945 --> 00:26:57.865
with that blunt temperament,

00:26:57.945 --> 00:26:59.625
it'll be even harder for her there.

00:27:07.705 --> 00:27:09.505
Had Physician Song been acting odd lately?

00:27:10.865 --> 00:27:13.105
The epidemic can't be contained.

00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:15.745
Every day, Master was working
on new prescriptions.

00:27:15.825 --> 00:27:18.265
Last night I spoke with him a bit,

00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:19.665
then someone called him away.

00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:21.145
What time was that?

00:27:21.825 --> 00:27:24.385
Around… half past the Xu Hour.

00:27:25.025 --> 00:27:26.185
Did you see him after that?

00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:30.625
The next time

00:27:31.505 --> 00:27:32.745
was just now.

00:27:50.305 --> 00:27:51.225
Your Ladyship.

00:28:08.225 --> 00:28:09.145
Your Ladyship,

00:28:09.985 --> 00:28:11.985
this wasn't caused by medication.

00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:15.345
His eyes were bloodshot, his ears flushed.

00:28:15.425 --> 00:28:18.385
Likely from a violent surge
of qi and blood inside.

00:28:18.985 --> 00:28:20.265
A sudden stroke?

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:21.945
That's right.

00:28:22.025 --> 00:28:23.505
He passed out in an instant,

00:28:23.585 --> 00:28:25.385
and his face fell into the decoction.

00:28:25.465 --> 00:28:27.665
When it hit, he still had a faint breath,

00:28:27.745 --> 00:28:30.745
but couldn't save himself and drowned.

00:28:31.385 --> 00:28:33.785
He was in his prime.
How could he have a stroke so suddenly?

00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:36.745
Physician Song already had
a tendency toward strokes.

00:28:36.825 --> 00:28:39.185
With the epidemic, he was swamped.
No sleep, no rest.

00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:41.425
So it struck him all at once.

00:28:41.505 --> 00:28:43.825
Pei Yu! Physician Song
died because of you!

00:28:43.905 --> 00:28:45.585
Huang Futong! Don't lay a hand on her!

00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:51.665
You've never obeyed Physician Song.

00:28:51.745 --> 00:28:53.705
He must've stopped you
from crossing the line,

00:28:53.785 --> 00:28:55.025
so you killed him!

00:28:55.105 --> 00:28:56.265
Nonsense!

00:28:56.345 --> 00:28:57.345
I have proof!

00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:01.705
Your Ladyship.

00:29:02.345 --> 00:29:05.505
I saw Pei Yu arguing with Physician Song
in the dispensary last night.

00:29:05.585 --> 00:29:08.265
I couldn't hear clearly
what they were saying,

00:29:08.345 --> 00:29:11.145
but his last words were loud and clear.

00:29:11.225 --> 00:29:12.585
What did he say?

00:29:12.665 --> 00:29:14.025
He said,

00:29:14.105 --> 00:29:15.425
"Only over my dead body!"

00:29:16.185 --> 00:29:19.025
- So you killed him!
- I didn't kill my master!

00:29:19.105 --> 00:29:21.625
Supervisor Huang said you argued.

00:29:21.705 --> 00:29:22.665
Is that true?

00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:25.865
I…

00:29:26.745 --> 00:29:28.665
Yes, I argued with Master.

00:29:28.745 --> 00:29:31.145
Master and I have always argued like that.

00:29:31.825 --> 00:29:33.905
Sometimes we say harsh things.

00:29:33.985 --> 00:29:36.145
But how could I kill him for that?

00:29:36.225 --> 00:29:37.225
Still lying, are you?

00:29:37.745 --> 00:29:39.185
We've already checked.

00:29:39.265 --> 00:29:42.745
Physician Song died of a sudden illness.

00:29:42.825 --> 00:29:43.825
No one killed him!

00:29:43.905 --> 00:29:46.705
But his stroke-related illness
had persisted for over ten years.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:47.985
He was always fine.

00:29:48.065 --> 00:29:50.185
If not for working
himself to death lately,

00:29:50.265 --> 00:29:52.785
how would he die so young? So suddenly?

00:29:52.865 --> 00:29:55.265
If you'd noticed sooner

00:29:55.345 --> 00:29:57.305
it wasn't a cold but the epidemic,

00:29:57.385 --> 00:29:58.985
you could've eased his burden.

00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:01.065
He wouldn't have worked himself to death.

00:30:01.585 --> 00:30:02.905
- You…
- Enough!

00:30:04.345 --> 00:30:05.265
Your Ladyship,

00:30:05.345 --> 00:30:06.505
Physician Song's sudden death

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:09.385
leaves Supervisor Huang
overwhelmed with grief.

00:30:09.465 --> 00:30:10.585
Forgive the outburst.

00:30:11.665 --> 00:30:12.505
Leave.

00:30:15.065 --> 00:30:16.945
Treating the young prince
matters most. Go back first.

00:30:19.505 --> 00:30:20.825
I regret that.

00:30:21.345 --> 00:30:23.385
I shouldn't have given
Master that prescription

00:30:23.465 --> 00:30:24.305
and made him angry.

00:30:37.945 --> 00:30:40.025
Father, Mother, I'm done drinking it.

00:30:42.225 --> 00:30:43.905
Come on. Let's go play!

00:30:51.545 --> 00:30:52.905
Just keep it up for seven more days,

00:30:52.985 --> 00:30:54.905
dress warm, morning and night,
and he'll be fully well.

00:30:55.745 --> 00:30:58.145
We really have Technician Pei to thank.

00:30:58.225 --> 00:31:00.345
Your Majesty should reward her.

00:31:01.945 --> 00:31:03.105
Of course I will.

00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:04.865
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:07.825
Thank you, Lady Su.

00:31:14.825 --> 00:31:15.785
Your Majesty,

00:31:15.865 --> 00:31:18.745
Technician Pei has studied
under Physician Song since childhood.

00:31:18.825 --> 00:31:19.865
She's exceptionally gifted.

00:31:20.465 --> 00:31:23.545
She just never had the chance
to ease Your Majesty's burden.

00:31:25.265 --> 00:31:26.705
Now that the new prescription works

00:31:27.305 --> 00:31:30.105
and she understands this illness,

00:31:30.185 --> 00:31:31.705
I believe the epidemic here

00:31:31.785 --> 00:31:34.425
can be wiped out within half a month.

00:31:36.745 --> 00:31:37.665
So you're saying

00:31:38.345 --> 00:31:40.945
Technician Pei already has a cure?

00:31:41.025 --> 00:31:42.545
I'm still working on it.

00:31:44.105 --> 00:31:45.665
You're being modest.

00:31:46.185 --> 00:31:47.705
You've studied this illness

00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:49.065
and written so many notes.

00:31:49.145 --> 00:31:51.305
Everyone at the Medical Office
has seen it.

00:31:53.025 --> 00:31:55.225
Our previous treatments were too cautious.

00:31:55.305 --> 00:31:57.625
But your approach is a pleasant surprise.

00:31:57.705 --> 00:31:59.545
You'll surely overcome this epidemic!

00:32:00.745 --> 00:32:02.945
Earning Your Majesty's trust is my honor.

00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.945
I'll give it everything I have.

00:32:05.025 --> 00:32:08.665
If… I can't clear
the epidemic within half a month,

00:32:08.745 --> 00:32:10.065
I'll resign.

00:32:15.185 --> 00:32:16.785
She got a few compliments

00:32:16.865 --> 00:32:18.745
and thought she's something,

00:32:19.425 --> 00:32:22.545
swearing an oath
right in front of His Majesty.

00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:25.385
In half a month, she'll pack up and leave.

00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:27.865
Supervisor Huang
really knows how to play it.

00:32:28.385 --> 00:32:30.025
I've never liked her, honestly.

00:32:30.105 --> 00:32:31.145
Right?

00:32:31.665 --> 00:32:32.705
I…

00:32:34.785 --> 00:32:38.745
I worked hard to find that eunuch
with the stomach disease.

00:32:39.545 --> 00:32:41.385
I didn't expect her to be so lucky.

00:32:41.465 --> 00:32:43.145
Even the County Princess
is protecting her.

00:32:43.225 --> 00:32:46.345
I thought once she "killed" someone,
she'd be kicked out.

00:32:46.865 --> 00:32:50.225
Instead, she ended up
winning the Emperor's favor.

00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:53.665
Don't celebrate too soon.

00:32:53.745 --> 00:32:57.825
Only the end reveals fortune or ruin.

00:32:59.425 --> 00:33:01.945
Fine. We'll just endure her
for half a month.

00:33:07.465 --> 00:33:09.185
Your Ladyship, save me!

00:33:09.705 --> 00:33:12.025
Your Ladyship! Pei Yu's trying to kill me!

00:33:13.145 --> 00:33:15.545
She found out Liu Jia
was picked by you on purpose.

00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:17.065
How… How did she know?

00:33:18.305 --> 00:33:19.145
You deserve death.

00:33:21.785 --> 00:33:22.705
Your Ladyship!

00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:24.785
I did do something awful to her before,

00:33:24.865 --> 00:33:26.545
but does that make murder okay?

00:33:27.065 --> 00:33:28.225
You can't just ignore it!

00:33:29.265 --> 00:33:31.785
Look, you haven't lost a single hair.

00:33:31.865 --> 00:33:33.225
Why say she's trying to kill you?

00:33:33.305 --> 00:33:34.225
It's…

00:33:36.985 --> 00:33:37.825
Because…

00:33:38.585 --> 00:33:42.025
Because on my bed was a headless dead rat!

00:33:43.025 --> 00:33:45.105
She did that to warn me.

00:33:45.185 --> 00:33:48.065
She'll kill me the same way
she killed that rat!

00:33:49.425 --> 00:33:51.505
Your Ladyship, it's right there!

00:34:02.505 --> 00:34:03.745
You're a supervisor.

00:34:03.825 --> 00:34:06.625
Can't you tell the cut isn't from a blade,

00:34:06.705 --> 00:34:08.905
but from a cat or weasel's teeth?

00:34:09.585 --> 00:34:11.985
Maybe that witch trained it?

00:34:13.264 --> 00:34:15.824
Then summon Pei Yu and confront her.

00:34:17.105 --> 00:34:18.304
Forget it.

00:34:18.905 --> 00:34:20.385
If you're truly scared,

00:34:20.465 --> 00:34:22.225
come back with us
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:34:22.304 --> 00:34:23.505
We'll keep you safe.

00:34:24.025 --> 00:34:25.065
Really?

00:34:25.145 --> 00:34:26.344
You killed Liu Jia.

00:34:26.425 --> 00:34:29.145
That's enough to rot in our prison
for the rest of your life.

00:34:31.824 --> 00:34:33.665
I spoke without thinking just now.

00:34:33.744 --> 00:34:35.705
If you want to pursue this,

00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:37.105
then show me proof.

00:34:38.105 --> 00:34:39.985
I have urgent business to attend to.

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:42.025
Your Ladyship. Deputy Director Xiao.

00:34:42.985 --> 00:34:44.065
Take care.

00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:03.025
Someone's dead!

00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:04.905
Someone's dead!

00:35:06.545 --> 00:35:08.745
Someone's dead…

00:35:17.225 --> 00:35:18.545
You're not
from the Imperial Medical Office.

00:35:22.545 --> 00:35:23.465
Your Ladyship,

00:35:23.545 --> 00:35:24.385
‪XIA SHISAN
‪IMPERIAL FOOD SERVICE EUNUCH

00:35:24.465 --> 00:35:26.705
this servant
is from the Imperial Food Service.

00:35:27.585 --> 00:35:28.985
Did you see anyone pass by just now?

00:35:30.145 --> 00:35:31.025
I…

00:35:32.185 --> 00:35:33.465
I just came out and saw…

00:35:34.025 --> 00:35:36.865
Enough. If you remember
anything, report it at once.

00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:38.745
Understood.

00:35:40.465 --> 00:35:42.585
Before it happened, where were you two?

00:35:43.305 --> 00:35:45.265
Your Ladyship, we were in the dispensary,
sorting the new medicines.

00:35:45.345 --> 00:35:47.105
Did you notice anything unusual?

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:52.585
When it happened,

00:35:52.665 --> 00:35:54.985
you were standing closest
to the dispensary.

00:35:55.585 --> 00:35:56.585
Did you see anything?

00:35:56.665 --> 00:35:59.105
The Imperial Medical Office
has been nonstop today,

00:35:59.185 --> 00:36:00.545
not a moment to rest.

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:02.305
If that eunuch hadn't screamed,

00:36:02.385 --> 00:36:04.025
we'd never have known a murder happened.

00:36:31.785 --> 00:36:34.625
The killer likely used a rake
to pry up the millstone,

00:36:34.705 --> 00:36:37.185
then set one side of it
on a wooden sleeper.

00:36:37.265 --> 00:36:38.625
The millstone slid down.

00:36:39.225 --> 00:36:40.345
There was no one on the roof.

00:36:40.425 --> 00:36:43.705
The millstone must've been held in place
by some method,

00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:45.945
then dropped at the right moment
when Huang Futong showed up.

00:36:54.185 --> 00:36:55.305
So that's it.

00:36:55.945 --> 00:36:56.905
Rope.

00:36:58.105 --> 00:36:59.145
Let's check inside.

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:08.425
This spot is perfect.

00:37:09.345 --> 00:37:11.145
With a rope from the roof into the room,

00:37:11.225 --> 00:37:13.825
someone inside can control the millstone.

00:37:13.905 --> 00:37:15.505
There were five
or six people in here then,

00:37:15.585 --> 00:37:16.545
all busy with their own work.

00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:18.105
No one likely noticed who was who.

00:37:18.185 --> 00:37:19.545
Supervisor Huang is dead!

00:37:20.145 --> 00:37:21.545
Supervisor Huang is dead!

00:37:21.625 --> 00:37:24.425
Pei Yu killed Supervisor Huang!

00:37:24.505 --> 00:37:26.585
Pei Yu killed Supervisor Huang!

00:37:27.185 --> 00:37:28.745
Your Ladyship, save me!

00:37:28.825 --> 00:37:31.105
It… It had to be Pei Yu!

00:37:31.185 --> 00:37:33.145
I can't stay here anymore. Your Ladyship!

00:37:33.225 --> 00:37:34.945
Pei Yu will kill me too!

00:37:35.665 --> 00:37:37.905
She'll kill all of you!

00:37:38.545 --> 00:37:40.545
Your Ladyship, save me!

00:37:43.745 --> 00:37:45.425
It was her.

00:37:45.945 --> 00:37:48.145
It was her!

00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:50.785
Pei Yu hasn't come back
to the Imperial Medical Office.

00:37:50.865 --> 00:37:52.905
How can you be so sure
she killed Supervisor Huang?

00:37:52.985 --> 00:37:55.825
Who knows how she did it?

00:37:55.905 --> 00:37:57.385
All I know is, if you cross her,

00:37:57.465 --> 00:37:58.745
nothing good happens.

00:37:58.825 --> 00:38:01.265
Technician Pei has been focused
on the new prescription.

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:03.865
So what did you do to offend her?

00:38:06.105 --> 00:38:08.025
That woman really has some skill.

00:38:08.105 --> 00:38:10.265
Even Mr. Xiao speaks up for her!

00:38:10.865 --> 00:38:12.945
Quit talking nonsense out of jealousy.

00:38:13.025 --> 00:38:15.705
If you were innocent,
we'd speak up for you too.

00:38:17.665 --> 00:38:18.585
Before,

00:38:18.665 --> 00:38:21.225
Pei Yu leaned
on Physician Song's protection

00:38:21.305 --> 00:38:23.185
and looked down on all of us.

00:38:23.265 --> 00:38:26.025
Now, because of one prescription,
she has won His Majesty's favor.

00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:29.065
All of us who studied for years

00:38:29.145 --> 00:38:29.985
feel even more bitter!

00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:32.185
So a few days ago, Supervisor Huang

00:38:32.265 --> 00:38:34.505
deliberately praised her to the skies
in front of His Majesty,

00:38:35.185 --> 00:38:36.665
forcing her to promise

00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:38.865
to end the epidemic within half a month.

00:38:38.945 --> 00:38:40.225
And if she can't?

00:38:40.305 --> 00:38:41.625
If she can't,

00:38:41.705 --> 00:38:43.505
then, of course, she'll get kicked out.

00:38:46.545 --> 00:38:47.705
As imperial physicians,

00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:49.865
instead of stopping the epidemic,

00:38:50.465 --> 00:38:53.185
you waste your schemes
bullying your colleagues.

00:38:53.945 --> 00:38:56.105
If Huang Futong
really died because of Pei Yu,

00:38:56.185 --> 00:38:57.385
then maybe it's fate.

00:38:57.985 --> 00:38:59.625
No, Your Ladyship!

00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:03.425
You have to save me! Please, save me!

00:39:11.185 --> 00:39:12.745
Where would the rope be tied?

00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:21.265
No.

00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:23.505
The sleeper hasn't moved.

00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:25.345
If it were tied to the sleeper,

00:39:25.425 --> 00:39:26.865
it'd be hard to pull the rope back.

00:39:26.945 --> 00:39:29.425
It must've been something smaller,

00:39:29.505 --> 00:39:31.585
lower than the sleeper.

00:39:35.945 --> 00:39:37.945
The sleeper's edge has cut marks.

00:39:38.025 --> 00:39:39.825
The killer likely cut it
to the right length

00:39:39.905 --> 00:39:41.665
to test and balance the weight.

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:45.785
Wait.

00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:22.305
How long has it been since you went back?

00:40:22.945 --> 00:40:24.185
I haven't kept track.

00:40:26.025 --> 00:40:29.105
His Majesty allowed you
to go out openly and treat patients,

00:40:29.185 --> 00:40:30.825
but it must still be hard.

00:40:31.705 --> 00:40:33.545
I'm still just a woman technician.

00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:34.905
His Majesty gave the order,

00:40:34.985 --> 00:40:37.145
but those people may not listen to me.

00:40:37.225 --> 00:40:38.785
So I have to do everything myself.

00:40:41.465 --> 00:40:42.305
Huang Futong is dead.

00:40:47.905 --> 00:40:49.025
We're short-handed now.

00:40:49.105 --> 00:40:50.425
The Imperial Medical Office
will be even busier.

00:40:51.105 --> 00:40:53.145
You don't want to know
how Huang Futong died?

00:40:56.705 --> 00:41:00.145
If what you mean is
whether I killed Supervisor Huang,

00:41:00.745 --> 00:41:01.665
then I'll tell you now,

00:41:02.345 --> 00:41:03.625
it wasn't me.

00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:09.105
These days, all I think about
is to keep people alive.

00:41:10.145 --> 00:41:11.865
I don't want to see anyone else die.

00:41:12.825 --> 00:41:14.945
The epidemic has improved a lot.

00:41:15.705 --> 00:41:18.065
The consorts and princes
are getting better,

00:41:18.145 --> 00:41:20.745
but the infected servants
are still dying in droves.

00:41:21.265 --> 00:41:22.705
I can't stop for even a moment.

00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:25.945
Why? Don't you already
have a prescription?

00:41:26.545 --> 00:41:30.305
Rhino horn and pearls
are far too rare and expensive.

00:41:30.385 --> 00:41:32.905
Ordinary eunuchs and maids
can't get treated.

00:41:34.105 --> 00:41:36.825
I want to use common herbs
to make a new prescription,

00:41:38.065 --> 00:41:39.625
but I still haven't cracked it.

00:41:49.865 --> 00:41:51.905
Your Ladyship, it's all ready!

00:41:51.985 --> 00:41:53.065
Keep watch at the entrance.

00:41:53.145 --> 00:41:54.145
Understood!

00:41:58.345 --> 00:42:00.025
Your Ladyship, begin!

00:42:06.105 --> 00:42:08.225
It landed right on the spot
where the millstone fell that day.

00:42:08.305 --> 00:42:09.585
This pit.

00:42:10.425 --> 00:42:11.305
Looks like we're right.

00:42:12.745 --> 00:42:13.865
But…

00:42:13.945 --> 00:42:16.665
Where could a rope so long be hidden?

00:42:18.065 --> 00:42:20.145
There really wasn't any rope
in the dispensary.

00:42:24.905 --> 00:42:25.945
No, Your Ladyship.

00:42:26.705 --> 00:42:27.545
Look,

00:42:27.625 --> 00:42:29.625
the millstone fell here,

00:42:29.705 --> 00:42:31.745
right by the edge of the dispensary door.

00:42:31.825 --> 00:42:34.665
But when people go in and out,
they rarely hug the side.

00:42:35.305 --> 00:42:36.385
How did the killer know

00:42:36.465 --> 00:42:39.425
Supervisor Huang would enter
through this exact spot?

00:42:41.305 --> 00:42:42.665
- That cart.
- That eunuch.
