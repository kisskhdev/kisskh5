WEBVTT

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.013
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:38.934
EPISODE 4

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:44.481

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.792
You may take the call.

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:19.850
DEFENDANT

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:39.453
Hello?

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:44.583
Hello?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.129
Nice to meet you

00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:58.263
Ms. Kim Ga-yeong.

00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:09.441
PROSECUTOR

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:41.181
Password, please.

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.481
I guess he's taking it all the way.

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:51.441
I guess so.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.861
All photos on Ms. Kim Ga-yeong's phone are

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:56.280
subject to confiscation.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:57.572
As they are key evidence

00:02:57.656 --> 00:02:59.866
for Defendant Park Hyeok-jun's case

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.410
we will unlock the phone

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:04.121
even without your permit, ex officio.

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:05.497
Ms. Kim

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.541
why don't you cooperate with the court?

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.340
Ms. Kim?

00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:35.402
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:49.499
No way.

00:03:49.624 --> 00:03:52.294
- What?
- Are they dating?

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:54.087
- What are they doing?
- Unbelievable!

00:04:05.807 --> 00:04:07.017
Please!

00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:08.852
Please.

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.520
Please...

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:13.398
Can you please not show that photo?

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:15.484
Please.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.944
Come on!

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:26.411
DEFENDANT

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.581
Yeah.

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.585
It's all my fault.

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:39.800
Hey, Seon-hui!

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:41.176
Hey, Ga-yeong.

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:45.263
Hyeok-jun, say hi.

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:47.641
She's my closest cousin.

00:04:48.517 --> 00:04:49.726
I promised

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.062
to show my boyfriend to her first
when I got one.

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:54.189
I kept my promise, okay?

00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:55.649
Right on. Thanks.

00:04:57.275 --> 00:04:59.361
Before Seon-hui came into the picture...

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:01.488
I'm Kim Seon-hui.

00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:03.448
Hello, I'm Park Hyeok-jun.

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:05.867
our relationship was perfect.

00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:11.373
No way. Really?

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:12.833
For real.

00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:14.918
Okay, fine. Cheers.

00:05:24.302 --> 00:05:26.471
I shouldn't have done that.

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:31.810
Should I tell Ga-yeong?

00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:33.061
No, you can't do that.

00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:34.688
I'll leave you to tell her.

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:37.983
I want a wedding
before my baby bump grows.

00:05:39.943 --> 00:05:41.361
Hyeok-jun

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:43.280
why are you suddenly doing this?

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.282
Why are you doing this to me?

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:48.493
How could you do this to me?

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:53.999
At least tell me
why you suddenly want to break up.

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:55.167
But

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:58.086
Seon-hui wasn't pregnant.

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:00.380
She faked a positive pregnancy test

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:03.425
to make sure
I didn't choose Ga-yeong over her!

00:06:04.092 --> 00:06:06.511
When I realized Seon-hui lied to me

00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:10.015
I felt so betrayed

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:14.686
that I called Ga-yeong again.

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:16.146
And

00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:21.485
I secretly got back with Ga-yeong
without Seon-hui's knowledge.

00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:31.077
So, he didn't murder her for money

00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:33.330
but for his complicated relationships?

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:40.212
Doesn't it seem like Judge Lee knew it all
from the start?

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:43.423
Yes.

00:06:44.424 --> 00:06:47.093
It felt like he knew how it'd go
before even starting the trial.

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:50.514
I'm glad I came.

00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:54.643
But isn't he already on Yi-seok's side?

00:06:56.144 --> 00:06:57.395
I'll look into it.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.359
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:07:29.844 --> 00:07:30.971
I hope Sin-jin

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:33.723
enjoyed this trial.

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:36.518
IT WASN'T JUST AN INSURANCE FRAUD
BUT MESSY ROMANCE

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:37.978
DEFENDANT CONFESSES EVERYTHING

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.312
THE RINGING CELLPHONE SETTLED IT ALL

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:42.107
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE DEAD BRIDE-TO-BE

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.067
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG SOLVES
ANOTHER MURDER CASE

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.779
SEEING THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS
AND FINDING THE TRUTH

00:08:05.755 --> 00:08:07.674
It didn't take long
for Seon-hui to find out

00:08:07.757 --> 00:08:09.968
about Hyeok-jun getting back
with Ga-yeong.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.978
And all the betrayal and jealousy ended

00:08:20.687 --> 00:08:22.522
with murder.

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:46.296
I'd known Seon-hui for so long

00:08:46.379 --> 00:08:49.090
but I guess I didn't know
everything about her.

00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:55.305
You suspected something
between the two from the start, right?

00:08:55.388 --> 00:08:57.974
Do you know her cousin

00:08:58.058 --> 00:08:59.392
Ms. Kim Ga-yeong, then?

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:02.479
Yeah, I do. We all hung out with Seon-hui.

00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:04.439
Do you know her personal phone number?

00:09:04.522 --> 00:09:06.483
Not her work number on her business card.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:08.401
Yes, I do.

00:09:08.485 --> 00:09:10.654
I got her number
when we hung out with Seon-hui.

00:09:11.237 --> 00:09:13.031
The police investigate the case

00:09:13.114 --> 00:09:14.991
but judges examine records and evidence.

00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:18.328
Often, when we puzzle the pieces together

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:20.121
the hidden truth shows itself.

00:09:22.957 --> 00:09:24.209
I don't get it.

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:27.170
Don't you want to know
why I pretended to be a detective?

00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:30.298
No, it's fine.

00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:34.552
Come to think of it,
you never said you were a detective.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.847
I just jumped to the conclusion
that you were.

00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:40.058
My intuition is so off.

00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:43.645
You played a huge part in this trial.

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:46.648
If I can help you in any way,
let me know anytime.

00:09:48.608 --> 00:09:51.903
I feel so powerful
with a judge having my back.

00:09:53.196 --> 00:09:56.199
Oh, I should get going.

00:09:56.282 --> 00:09:57.283
Okay.

00:10:09.963 --> 00:10:13.341
All three involved in Kim Seon-hui's case
were victims and accomplices.

00:10:14.342 --> 00:10:16.136
Blinded by jealousy and greed

00:10:16.469 --> 00:10:18.513
they did each other dirty

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:21.349
and left themselves in agony.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.351
A TRAGIC STORY OF JEALOUSY AND GREED

00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:25.103
A CLOSED MURDER CASE
INVOLVING A LOVER AND FAMILY

00:10:25.186 --> 00:10:28.022
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

00:10:38.742 --> 00:10:40.118
That was a good trial today.

00:10:41.578 --> 00:10:45.165
Since it's a different type of case now,
it'll have bench trials.

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:49.002
Do you want to take it to the end
this time as well?

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:51.755
No, sir. I can't do that every time.

00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:53.339
Okay.

00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:58.928
Both cases will escalate
to the Supreme Court.

00:10:59.137 --> 00:11:01.431
And by the time
they reach the Supreme Court

00:11:01.514 --> 00:11:03.266
I would've become a Justice.

00:11:03.683 --> 00:11:05.769
They're doing
an internal investigation on him.

00:11:05.852 --> 00:11:07.812
It's a part of becoming a Justice.

00:11:07.896 --> 00:11:09.856
Choose one you feel more confident about

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:11.483
and write the verdict.

00:11:11.983 --> 00:11:14.277
I need that for whenever I boast to others

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.695
about having trained you here.

00:11:18.406 --> 00:11:20.992
The Judiciary will be caught
in heavy restructuring soon

00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:22.368
and the new Justice, Yi-seok

00:11:22.452 --> 00:11:24.579
will resign soon after that,
unable to keep up.

00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:27.749
If I leave him to become the Justice,
he'll be at risk.

00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.251
I'd like to focus
on hands-on practice for now.

00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:36.299
Is that so?

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:40.637
I was going to move you to Seoul
once I became the Justice.

00:11:41.012 --> 00:11:42.847
- Hey.
- Sorry, sir.

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:45.183
I'm not ready for that yet.

00:11:53.817 --> 00:11:55.360
To strike Sin-jin and Tae-sik

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:56.569
I'm going to need Yi-seok.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.198
I have to stop Yi-seok
from becoming the Justice.

00:12:07.163 --> 00:12:08.164
Han-young!

00:12:19.676 --> 00:12:20.677
What?

00:12:21.052 --> 00:12:22.053
Did he come in?

00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:32.981
What's wrong with you?

00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:34.607
I like being in court.

00:12:34.858 --> 00:12:36.484
You think you're quite the star?

00:12:37.026 --> 00:12:38.611
You're so unbelievably cocky.

00:12:38.695 --> 00:12:41.573
Well, I still have
a lot to learn from you.

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:42.657
Whatever.

00:12:43.575 --> 00:12:46.494
Mr. Baek told me to do you a favor,
no questions asked.

00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:50.540
Man, I don't even get why he likes you.

00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:52.292
Bye, then.

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:53.626
Gosh, my back.

00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:05.638
Why would you crawl under your desk?

00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:09.976
Yes, Ms. Song.

00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:12.353
Judge Lee

00:13:12.437 --> 00:13:16.190
you told me to call you
whenever I needed your help, right?

00:13:16.649 --> 00:13:17.942
You need me already?

00:13:19.068 --> 00:13:20.445
Well, here's the thing.

00:13:20.987 --> 00:13:24.115
My father is a security guard
at Gangcheon Palace

00:13:24.699 --> 00:13:27.201
and he's being accused for theft.

00:13:27.744 --> 00:13:29.829
We need to take legal action right now

00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:31.998
but I don't know anything about that.

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:34.792
But a judge isn't allowed to be

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:36.628
a private legal counsel, though.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.054
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:13:46.137 --> 00:13:47.221
Hello.

00:13:50.183 --> 00:13:51.184
What?

00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:53.311
What did you just say?

00:13:54.187 --> 00:13:55.438
What did you lose?

00:13:56.856 --> 00:13:59.817
Don't be like that. Please help me.

00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:04.572
I can't be your legal counsel,
but I can listen.

00:14:04.948 --> 00:14:06.074
Exactly!

00:14:07.533 --> 00:14:09.494
So, your father works at Gangcheon Palace?

00:14:09.786 --> 00:14:12.497
Yes, the high-rise complex in Gangnam.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.921
Wait, didn't that incident happen
around this time?

00:14:20.755 --> 00:14:23.091
Do you know whose house was robbed?

00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:25.426
The Director of Hanguk Hospital.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.221
What happened exactly? Tell me straight.

00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:31.683
Well, I found out

00:14:32.517 --> 00:14:34.978
only after I got home from work
last night.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.656
Director Lee Chang-hyo of Hanguk Hospital.

00:14:47.156 --> 00:14:48.741
If I play my cards right on this case

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:51.369
I can stop Yi-seok
from becoming a Justice.

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:56.249
Don't you realize what'll happen
if the world finds out?

00:15:02.755 --> 00:15:04.716
When was the account book last updated?

00:15:05.216 --> 00:15:09.137
The copy I sent you on the flash drive was
the latest version.

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:23.568
Mr. Kang.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.528
Is something wrong?

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:32.326
VICTIMS SUE THE NAMMYEON DISTRICT OFFICE

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.871
How did Ha-na manage to get this case?

00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:40.418
If she wins this case,
she's going to gloat over it forever.

00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:41.753
Man, that sucks.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.880
I can't stand her!

00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:52.680
My gosh!

00:15:53.222 --> 00:15:55.516
Are you just going to sit
and watch Ha-na do her thing?

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.727
What? The Nammyeon District sinkhole case?

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.228
I guess you're not a total moron.

00:16:05.777 --> 00:16:07.570
NAMMYEON DISTRICT MAYOR ADMITS
HIS ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SINKHOLE CASE

00:16:07.653 --> 00:16:09.363
BUT REFUSES TO ADMIT
THAT THE DISTRICT IS AT FAULT

00:16:11.365 --> 00:16:12.533
He's right.

00:16:14.827 --> 00:16:15.828
No.

00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:19.499
The District Mayor is saying
he's not responsible.

00:16:19.582 --> 00:16:22.335
"Sorry that it happened,
but it wasn't our fault."

00:16:22.418 --> 00:16:23.419
That's the gist, right?

00:16:23.503 --> 00:16:24.754
If Mayor Chu wins this case

00:16:24.837 --> 00:16:27.673
everyone will know Haenal
as "the evil law firm."

00:16:28.174 --> 00:16:29.884
It'll hurt the firm's reputation

00:16:30.802 --> 00:16:32.261
and we won't get big cases for a while.

00:16:32.345 --> 00:16:34.680
And if we lose,
we blame Ha-na for her incompetence?

00:16:35.306 --> 00:16:36.849
I guess you're not a moron, either.

00:16:37.183 --> 00:16:38.476
Damn it.

00:16:39.644 --> 00:16:42.146
What was Dad thinking
when he told her to take the case?

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.399
He's always curious
about how good his kids can be.

00:16:46.275 --> 00:16:48.569
But you should focus
on the blind-date judge guy.

00:16:49.362 --> 00:16:52.323
I hear he's pretty skilled
for a small college graduate.

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:55.952
You know very well
why Dad wants him as his son-in-law.

00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:57.036
No, I don't.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.871
I don't like him.

00:17:00.248 --> 00:17:01.582
Think about it carefully.

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:03.543
It's your chance to keep your office here.

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:05.253
You're not even a licensed attorney.

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:06.712
I don't need to be one.

00:17:06.796 --> 00:17:08.506
Once I become the owner of Haenal

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:09.966
I'll be above them all, anyway.

00:17:11.425 --> 00:17:14.095
My baby sister can be so ambitious.

00:17:14.762 --> 00:17:15.930
But it's too bad.

00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:18.933
Article 34 of the Attorney-at-Law Act.

00:17:19.016 --> 00:17:20.017
"No person who is not an attorney-at-law"

00:17:20.101 --> 00:17:22.186
"shall establish or operate a law office
by employing an attorney-at-law."

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.063
And you realize that this firm is

00:17:25.314 --> 00:17:27.233
a law office, right?

00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.862
I'll just choose an attorney
as a Firm Partner

00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:33.823
and make them do as I say.

00:17:34.157 --> 00:17:35.867
Consider getting on my good side.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.120
Maybe I'll get you
a fancy Partner business card, too.

00:17:39.912 --> 00:17:41.706
That's also illegal.

00:17:42.331 --> 00:17:44.083
Haenal can defend me in court, then.

00:17:54.343 --> 00:17:57.013
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:00.349
- Whoa.
- Get out.

00:18:05.313 --> 00:18:06.439
What a jerk.

00:18:06.522 --> 00:18:08.316
WOMAN SLAPPING HER DATE, WHO'S A JUDGE

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.861
Thinks he's all that.

00:18:12.153 --> 00:18:13.821
I know what favor I want to ask you.

00:18:14.155 --> 00:18:16.616
I need to take some days off
from today until Friday.

00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:18.159
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE LIM JEONG-SIK

00:18:18.242 --> 00:18:19.327
What a guy.

00:18:21.746 --> 00:18:23.080
That's random.

00:18:23.497 --> 00:18:25.708
Oh! He must be hitting it off

00:18:26.292 --> 00:18:27.668
with Haenal Law Firm's daughter.

00:18:28.002 --> 00:18:29.128
Hilarious.

00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:39.347
HONEY, SORRY FOR BEING A BAD HUSBAND
AND CAUSING YOU SO MUCH PAIN. GOODBYE...

00:18:43.184 --> 00:18:44.894
Help...

00:18:44.977 --> 00:18:50.274
JUNE 4, 2025, HAN JUN-YEONG

00:18:52.944 --> 00:18:54.028
Please.

00:18:54.445 --> 00:18:57.615
Please let me just call Sin-jin once!

00:18:57.698 --> 00:18:59.575
Damn it!

00:19:02.995 --> 00:19:04.914
NUMBER ONE

00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:09.627
Yes.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.045
I need you to find something.

00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:13.839
From Unit 1204 of Gancheon Palace
in Gangnam.

00:19:14.507 --> 00:19:16.342
Director Lee of Hanguk Hospital's house.

00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:18.469
I don't care about anything else.

00:19:18.761 --> 00:19:21.222
It's an account book.
You just need to get that.

00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:23.724
Be sure to stay low.

00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:25.226
Yes, sir.

00:19:26.394 --> 00:19:27.603
Updates on Attorney Han's account number?

00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:29.814
Mr. Kang!

00:19:30.773 --> 00:19:32.441
I'm so sorry.

00:19:33.067 --> 00:19:37.238
Please, just don't kill me!

00:19:38.364 --> 00:19:39.657
I got it.

00:19:40.908 --> 00:19:42.159
Time to wrap it up, then.

00:19:44.203 --> 00:19:45.204
Yes, sir.

00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:48.249
Why are you hanging up?

00:19:48.749 --> 00:19:50.459
Let me speak to him!

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.253
What did he say?

00:19:53.129 --> 00:19:55.506
I told you my bank account number!

00:19:56.674 --> 00:19:58.092
Did you tell him that?

00:19:58.175 --> 00:19:59.719
Will he forgive me?

00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:05.099
He would've forgiven you.
He's a very understanding guy.

00:20:07.685 --> 00:20:08.686
Really?

00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:12.023
Let me go already, then!

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:15.276
But just because he forgives you

00:20:15.735 --> 00:20:17.903
doesn't mean he has to spare your life.

00:20:20.781 --> 00:20:21.824
That's the end.

00:20:21.907 --> 00:20:24.160
What? What do you mean?

00:20:26.287 --> 00:20:28.581
No, don't do it! Stop!

00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:30.333
What the hell are you doing? No!

00:20:32.626 --> 00:20:33.878
We found the account.

00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:35.421
SENIOR PRESIDING JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:40.801
I knew he was delusional

00:20:40.885 --> 00:20:42.720
for believing he brought success to Haenal

00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:45.306
but I didn't expect him
to have taken commission.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.642
But it's fine now, right?

00:20:53.022 --> 00:20:55.274
MY WILL

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:57.276
JUNE 4, 2025, HAN JUN-YEONG

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.236
There's even a handwritten will

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.197
so there shouldn't be any issues.

00:21:02.031 --> 00:21:03.199
Does the missing book have

00:21:03.616 --> 00:21:05.826
Justice Kim Jun-man's son's name in it?

00:21:08.704 --> 00:21:11.499
It might get in the way
of his appointment as the Chief Justice.

00:21:11.582 --> 00:21:13.959
Should I pull some strings
with the police?

00:21:14.043 --> 00:21:15.795
Let's wait for now.

00:21:17.546 --> 00:21:19.340
The world can't see the account book

00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:23.552
for this file to do me any good.

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:34.772
CHUNGCHEONGNAM-DO, THE HOME OF BIG HEARTS

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.696
DELIVERY SERVICE

00:22:00.005 --> 00:22:01.674
Where are you? I'm by the front gate.

00:22:09.557 --> 00:22:10.724
Judge Lee!

00:22:21.986 --> 00:22:23.988
You're wasting both of our time.

00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:26.866
Return everything you've taken
before I take action.

00:22:28.075 --> 00:22:29.994
Come on, Mr. Song!
You're being ridiculous!

00:22:30.077 --> 00:22:31.745
Hey, bring me a stick.

00:22:32.329 --> 00:22:33.372
Hold it tightly.

00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:34.790
It's going to hurt.

00:22:34.874 --> 00:22:35.916
Dad!

00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.418
Get out!

00:22:37.501 --> 00:22:38.502
Dad!

00:22:38.586 --> 00:22:39.920
- Na-yeon!
- Are you okay?

00:22:40.754 --> 00:22:41.839
Hey, lady.

00:22:42.256 --> 00:22:44.758
Your dad is fine. We aren't.

00:22:45.092 --> 00:22:46.677
Did you know your dad was a thief?

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.388
No, there's no way.

00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:51.932
Have you checked the surveillance cameras?

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:54.101
Those are for lower-class people.

00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:56.812
The higher-ups despise
surveillance cameras.

00:22:57.646 --> 00:22:59.940
- They're all very private.
- You should leave.

00:23:00.024 --> 00:23:01.650
I'll sort it out and go. Hurry!

00:23:01.734 --> 00:23:02.902
No!

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.653
Alright, then.

00:23:04.737 --> 00:23:07.573
We'll need to keep your pretty daughter

00:23:08.324 --> 00:23:10.618
until you bring back

00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:12.244
what you've stolen.

00:23:12.328 --> 00:23:13.662
Let's call it

00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:15.080
a collateral.

00:23:15.331 --> 00:23:18.667
This is unlawful confinement.

00:23:18.751 --> 00:23:20.794
Yeah, I know. I do it all the time.

00:23:21.462 --> 00:23:23.130
You're so pretty.

00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:28.552
There was a case

00:23:28.636 --> 00:23:30.012
where the court ruled

00:23:30.095 --> 00:23:32.139
that the strata management wasn't liable

00:23:32.223 --> 00:23:33.933
for the theft of a resident's valuables

00:23:34.016 --> 00:23:35.434
while they were away on a trip.

00:23:35.976 --> 00:23:39.063
So, the resident's claim for damages

00:23:39.146 --> 00:23:40.356
was dismissed.

00:23:40.439 --> 00:23:41.690
What the hell is that?

00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:43.359
- As per the security service contract
- As per the security service contract

00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:44.652
- the resident was supposed
- the resident was supposed

00:23:44.735 --> 00:23:46.028
- to have reported all valuables
- to have reported all valuables

00:23:46.111 --> 00:23:48.197
- to the security guard in advance
- to the security guard in advance

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.824
- which they didn't do.
- which they didn't do.

00:23:51.784 --> 00:23:52.826
What the hell?

00:23:53.452 --> 00:23:55.663
What the hell is this bitch saying?

00:23:57.623 --> 00:23:58.624
Dad

00:23:58.707 --> 00:24:00.417
did the resident notify you

00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:03.045
that he had valuables at his home
before going on that trip?

00:24:03.337 --> 00:24:06.924
Who would notify their security guards
like that?

00:24:08.342 --> 00:24:11.554
Gangcheon Palace has a disclaimer,
stating that it isn't responsible

00:24:11.637 --> 00:24:12.888
- for any lost belongings
- For any lost belongings

00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:15.015
- that the resident didn't notify them...
- that the resident didn't notify them

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:16.892
in advance.

00:24:17.851 --> 00:24:19.436
Seriously, what are you?

00:24:22.064 --> 00:24:23.190
A lawyer?

00:24:23.983 --> 00:24:25.025
No.

00:24:26.777 --> 00:24:28.737
I'm a reporter for Daejin Daily.

00:24:29.071 --> 00:24:30.114
Oh.

00:24:30.364 --> 00:24:33.492
And everything that's been said

00:24:34.702 --> 00:24:36.787
has been recorded right here.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.206
All the sexual harassment and threats!

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:40.916
Damn.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.835
You should've thought it through

00:24:42.918 --> 00:24:44.545
before telling me about that evidence.

00:24:44.628 --> 00:24:46.088
- Hand it over.
- No.

00:24:46.755 --> 00:24:48.424
- No!
- Na-yeon!

00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:52.845
Piss off!

00:24:52.928 --> 00:24:53.971
Hey, that's my phone!

00:24:54.054 --> 00:24:56.265
No wonder the call got disconnected.

00:24:56.348 --> 00:24:57.349
Huh?

00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:00.311
What are you guys doing here?

00:25:00.769 --> 00:25:02.146
- What? Who are you?
- Excuse me.

00:25:02.229 --> 00:25:03.606
Excuse me.

00:25:03.689 --> 00:25:05.816
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Who are you?

00:25:07.484 --> 00:25:08.777
Isn't this expensive?

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.362
Yes, what do I do?

00:25:10.446 --> 00:25:12.031
I'm still paying for it monthly!

00:25:12.114 --> 00:25:14.116
- It's all smashed.
- Am I invisible to you?

00:25:14.199 --> 00:25:15.868
Are you ignoring me?

00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:17.286
Who the hell are you?

00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:18.579
Are you a reporter, too?

00:25:19.121 --> 00:25:21.540
You're too young
to be talking like that to me.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.501
What?

00:25:26.253 --> 00:25:28.839
What, you're an old soul inside?

00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:29.965
Hey

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:31.842
get moving already!

00:25:31.925 --> 00:25:33.844
No, wait.

00:25:36.096 --> 00:25:38.766
Article 366 of the Criminal Act
on Destruction and Damage of Property.

00:25:39.975 --> 00:25:41.727
A person who, by destroying, damaging

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.271
or concealing another's property document
or special media records

00:25:44.355 --> 00:25:46.357
such as electromagnetic records, etc.

00:25:46.857 --> 00:25:48.067
shall be punished by imprisonment
for not more than three years

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.860
or by a fine
not exceeding seven million won.

00:25:49.943 --> 00:25:52.738
I'd recommend three years in jail, though.

00:25:53.113 --> 00:25:54.114
Sure, sure.

00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:56.533
You work really hard, huh?

00:25:56.617 --> 00:25:58.702
I didn't know reporters memorized laws
these days.

00:25:59.536 --> 00:26:01.789
You haven't lived long enough, huh?

00:26:01.872 --> 00:26:03.374
You still think I'm a reporter?

00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:08.170
What, then? You a lawyer?

00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:12.091
Not a prosecutor, right? Sir?

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.593
I'm sure you've been in court often.

00:26:15.052 --> 00:26:16.053
You know how there are

00:26:16.136 --> 00:26:17.680
prosecutors, attorneys, and one more?

00:26:17.763 --> 00:26:19.014
In the highest seats.

00:26:19.932 --> 00:26:21.975
There can be
up to three of us.

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:23.602
If you're more familiar
with seeing three

00:26:23.686 --> 00:26:25.312
you're really, really bad.

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:28.941
After all, bench trials are for murders,
robbery, and aggravated assault.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.402
No, sir.

00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:34.029
I usually only see one of you.

00:26:35.489 --> 00:26:36.490
You want to sit?

00:26:36.573 --> 00:26:37.950
- You can sit there.
- Yes, sir.

00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:39.493
Everyone, take your seats.

00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:41.370
Go ahead. Sit.

00:26:48.085 --> 00:26:50.504
Within less than 30 minutes,
you guys have committed

00:26:50.587 --> 00:26:53.006
unlawful confinement, damage to property

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.216
and assault.

00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:56.885
How many years of imprisonment
you think that'll be in total?

00:26:57.344 --> 00:26:58.345
You're curious, right?

00:26:58.429 --> 00:27:00.514
But I'll tell you that later

00:27:00.597 --> 00:27:01.849
in court.

00:27:01.932 --> 00:27:02.933
Well...

00:27:03.016 --> 00:27:05.310
There's only one code of law,
but I get to judge.

00:27:05.394 --> 00:27:07.104
Let me explain it to you.

00:27:07.521 --> 00:27:09.064
The moment you commit a crime

00:27:09.148 --> 00:27:11.275
your lives depend on what I say.

00:27:11.358 --> 00:27:14.570
So, if you don't want to screw
your lives up

00:27:14.653 --> 00:27:16.905
do everything at all costs to avoid me.

00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:18.907
But

00:27:20.784 --> 00:27:22.619
are you really a judge?

00:27:22.703 --> 00:27:25.289
Is a judge allowed to be
so verbally forceful?

00:27:25.372 --> 00:27:28.751
Why not? It sounds more legit,
coming from a judge.

00:27:29.668 --> 00:27:31.754
Should I call a prosecutor

00:27:31.837 --> 00:27:33.172
and start with a search?

00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:35.090
Wow!

00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:40.053
I'd love to see a face like yours
in court one day.

00:27:40.596 --> 00:27:42.598
Don't be ridiculous.
We have our lawyer, too.

00:27:44.057 --> 00:27:45.642
Threatening to arrest us

00:27:45.726 --> 00:27:47.227
without any real charges is

00:27:47.728 --> 00:27:48.896
illegal.

00:27:49.313 --> 00:27:51.064
Oh, but it's too bad.

00:27:51.148 --> 00:27:52.441
The judge also gets to decide

00:27:52.524 --> 00:27:53.942
what's legal or not.

00:27:55.652 --> 00:27:57.070
And I'm a judge.

00:27:57.946 --> 00:27:59.072
I'm a judge.

00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:00.657
I'm a judge!

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:05.204
I'm a judge.

00:28:06.079 --> 00:28:07.873
Let's start with this.

00:28:17.841 --> 00:28:19.134
What if that bastard

00:28:19.218 --> 00:28:21.094
isn't even a judge?

00:28:23.222 --> 00:28:24.223
Should I drag him back?

00:28:24.556 --> 00:28:25.599
You crazy?

00:28:30.729 --> 00:28:32.189
- Careful, Dad.
- Okay.

00:28:33.982 --> 00:28:36.026
- Oh? Hold on, Dad.
- Okay.

00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:41.073
My gosh, Judge Lee!

00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:44.701
You were so cool...

00:28:44.785 --> 00:28:49.498
Anyway, you know you're an oddball, right?

00:28:52.209 --> 00:28:53.544
Ta-da!

00:28:54.253 --> 00:28:57.339
You can pay for your broken phone upfront

00:28:57.422 --> 00:28:58.841
and get a new one with this.

00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:02.594
Anyway, you can't write an article
about this, okay?

00:29:02.678 --> 00:29:06.098
It could get your dad
and the other security guards fired.

00:29:07.099 --> 00:29:08.350
I know.

00:29:09.184 --> 00:29:10.185
Thank you

00:29:10.686 --> 00:29:12.062
for today.

00:29:14.857 --> 00:29:15.858
Bye, then.

00:29:32.165 --> 00:29:33.375
Stone Jeong-ho!

00:29:52.561 --> 00:29:54.438
Hey, young Han-young!

00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:56.189
Has the ride been smooth?

00:29:57.774 --> 00:29:58.775
Me?

00:29:59.359 --> 00:30:01.111
I'm on my way to work. Why?

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.031
SUNI'S SUNDAE SOUP RESTAURANT

00:30:12.873 --> 00:30:14.499
Boss

00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:17.210
may I also order some suyuk?

00:30:17.294 --> 00:30:20.297
You can eat all the suyuk they have here.

00:30:20.547 --> 00:30:22.215
Thank you!

00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:23.884
Hey, suyuk time!

00:30:29.306 --> 00:30:31.975
Did those bastards starve for days

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:34.144
to have sundae soup and suyuk or what?

00:30:34.227 --> 00:30:37.064
Seriously, I know you're broke

00:30:37.147 --> 00:30:39.274
but why would you borrow money
from Jeong-ho?

00:30:39.358 --> 00:30:41.401
Don't you know what he's like?

00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:42.653
Gosh.

00:30:45.948 --> 00:30:50.035
That's 20 bowls of sundae soup.

00:30:50.118 --> 00:30:52.412
There were 8 of you.
You didn't have 20 bowls.

00:30:52.829 --> 00:30:54.998
Look at how big they are.

00:30:55.082 --> 00:30:56.583
Some had two bowls

00:30:56.667 --> 00:30:58.085
and this guy had three.

00:30:58.168 --> 00:30:59.753
And...

00:30:59.836 --> 00:31:01.380
Hey!

00:31:03.715 --> 00:31:05.717
I told you not to drink while working.

00:31:06.802 --> 00:31:10.013
I'm deducting the price of that soju
from your next paycheck.

00:31:10.097 --> 00:31:12.641
Boss, does that mean

00:31:12.724 --> 00:31:14.559
I can have one more bottle, then?

00:31:14.643 --> 00:31:15.811
- Just one more?
- Yeah!

00:31:15.894 --> 00:31:16.937
You want to die?

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.564
- You want to get fired?
- No, sir! I'm sorry, sir!

00:31:19.648 --> 00:31:20.816
Forget it.

00:31:21.608 --> 00:31:25.153
We had 20 bowls of sundae soup,
which is 8,000 won each.

00:31:25.237 --> 00:31:26.530
And the soju is

00:31:27.572 --> 00:31:28.949
4,000 won per bottle.

00:31:30.242 --> 00:31:32.202
As for the suyuk...

00:31:32.786 --> 00:31:35.622
That's at least eight big plates.

00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:41.420
Okay, that's 280,000 won deducted
from what you borrowed.

00:31:41.503 --> 00:31:42.504
- Deducted?
- Deducted?

00:31:42.587 --> 00:31:44.506
Gosh, she's not making any money, then!

00:31:45.382 --> 00:31:47.134
How is she supposed to make a living?

00:31:47.217 --> 00:31:48.218
Suni

00:31:48.635 --> 00:31:51.888
you have until next month
to pay me 5,250,000 won.

00:31:53.223 --> 00:31:54.516
Be on time, alright?

00:31:54.975 --> 00:31:56.601
If not, watch me just...

00:31:56.685 --> 00:31:58.979
bring every elderly person in town here.

00:32:01.857 --> 00:32:03.150
Gosh.

00:32:03.483 --> 00:32:04.860
Are you crazy?

00:32:05.402 --> 00:32:07.863
If you keep deducting our debts
because we're struggling

00:32:08.363 --> 00:32:09.740
you're going to go broke.

00:32:10.365 --> 00:32:13.201
Hey, did Jeong-ho pay you the market price

00:32:13.285 --> 00:32:15.620
for the cabbage and spinach at your shop?

00:32:15.704 --> 00:32:17.789
Jeong-ho would never.

00:32:17.873 --> 00:32:19.750
He paid full price for them

00:32:19.833 --> 00:32:23.045
but sold them for half the price
or for nothing to charity.

00:32:23.545 --> 00:32:26.089
I have to check Jeong-ho's back.

00:32:26.173 --> 00:32:27.924
He's got to have wings!

00:32:29.801 --> 00:32:31.970
He basically grew up at the market

00:32:32.054 --> 00:32:33.680
stuck right by his mom's side.

00:32:33.764 --> 00:32:36.141
Gosh, our bratty little Jeong-ho.

00:32:36.224 --> 00:32:37.225
It feels like yesterday

00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:39.352
that he was begging his mom for 100 won.

00:32:39.436 --> 00:32:41.521
He grew up to be such a fine man.

00:32:41.605 --> 00:32:44.524
The market basically raised him, you know?

00:32:44.608 --> 00:32:47.235
- For sure.
- So, sell more.

00:32:48.445 --> 00:32:50.363
You need to sell more to earn more

00:32:50.447 --> 00:32:51.823
then you can pay off your debt

00:32:51.907 --> 00:32:53.366
and keep me from going broke.

00:32:57.287 --> 00:32:58.288
Han-young!

00:32:59.164 --> 00:33:00.207
Hey!

00:33:02.584 --> 00:33:04.878
Guys, say hello.

00:33:04.961 --> 00:33:07.923
This is my best friend,
Judge Lee Han-young.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.841
Boss Judge!

00:33:09.925 --> 00:33:11.176
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:33:11.259 --> 00:33:12.719
Oh, hi, everyone.

00:33:15.013 --> 00:33:16.056
I didn't see you bow.

00:33:17.224 --> 00:33:19.309
Please support our local market.

00:33:19.643 --> 00:33:20.685
Grocery chains are great

00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:22.729
but we must keep our local markets afloat.

00:33:22.813 --> 00:33:24.314
Please take this.

00:33:24.397 --> 00:33:27.275
Please support our local market.
Thanks so much.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.613
So, you give loans to the market people
and let them pay in food and goods?

00:33:31.696 --> 00:33:33.698
And you donate the goods to those in need.

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:36.076
Those people have been feeding me

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:38.203
and giving me allowances
since my diaper days.

00:33:38.286 --> 00:33:40.038
Please check out our local market.

00:33:40.122 --> 00:33:41.289
Thank you.

00:33:41.373 --> 00:33:42.916
We love you.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.793
What if you go broke?

00:33:45.752 --> 00:33:47.045
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

00:33:47.129 --> 00:33:48.296
- Go broke?
- Yeah.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:49.422
Hey

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.175
I have 12 full-time employees.

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:53.552
They're fully insured

00:33:53.635 --> 00:33:55.679
and I offer severance pay
and holiday bonuses.

00:33:55.762 --> 00:33:57.722
Even then, I'm still going. How?

00:33:58.473 --> 00:34:00.225
Because I'm CEO Seok Jeong-ho.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.313
It's going up!

00:34:05.397 --> 00:34:07.315
Nice, boss!

00:34:07.399 --> 00:34:09.693
ARCADE

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.572
Hello, sir.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:15.824
LOTTERY SHOP

00:34:15.907 --> 00:34:16.950
Did I win first place?

00:34:17.284 --> 00:34:19.327
Yes, you did!

00:34:24.166 --> 00:34:25.375
- Everything good?
- Yes, sir.

00:34:29.129 --> 00:34:31.339
KARAOKE

00:34:31.756 --> 00:34:33.633
- Sorry.
- No!

00:34:33.717 --> 00:34:35.218
I'm the owner.

00:34:35.302 --> 00:34:36.511
I'll give you extra time.

00:34:37.095 --> 00:34:39.681
CONVENIENCE STORE

00:34:40.223 --> 00:34:41.850
It's expiring at the end of the day.

00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:43.143
I'll take it if you don't want it.

00:34:44.936 --> 00:34:46.229
Thank you, sir.

00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:53.069
I don't just have a loan business.

00:34:53.153 --> 00:34:55.322
I have four subsidiaries.

00:34:55.405 --> 00:34:56.531
I won't ever go broke.

00:34:59.784 --> 00:35:00.785
By the way

00:35:01.411 --> 00:35:03.371
what is Your Honor doing in Seoul?

00:35:03.455 --> 00:35:04.539
What are you doing?

00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:09.044
Some thieves broke into Gangcheon Palace
in Gangnam.

00:35:09.753 --> 00:35:11.421
But it's not about finding the thieves.

00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:13.673
We need what they have taken.

00:35:15.258 --> 00:35:18.345
Clearly, the police can't find out
about it.

00:35:19.387 --> 00:35:20.555
That's none of my business.

00:35:22.933 --> 00:35:24.684
What if this causes you trouble?

00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:26.102
No.

00:35:26.519 --> 00:35:28.104
I can't do it if it causes you trouble.

00:35:28.188 --> 00:35:29.689
I refuse.

00:35:31.983 --> 00:35:33.193
It's fine.

00:35:35.237 --> 00:35:36.446
It won't take long, then.

00:35:36.529 --> 00:35:38.907
I know the robbers in Gangnam.

00:35:39.658 --> 00:35:40.742
Sidekick!

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.706
Yes, boss.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.541
Find out who robbed Gangcheon Palace.

00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:50.585
I'll pay you for it.

00:35:50.669 --> 00:35:52.170
Yes, boss.

00:35:57.968 --> 00:35:59.719
What exactly are you looking for?

00:36:00.804 --> 00:36:02.514
If the cops can't hear about it

00:36:02.597 --> 00:36:05.892
and you've come to me instead of the cops

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:07.644
it has to be something real special.

00:36:07.727 --> 00:36:08.770
It's an account book.

00:36:09.145 --> 00:36:11.189
It's a long list of names.

00:36:11.773 --> 00:36:13.858
And those people are real trouble,
I assume.

00:36:18.905 --> 00:36:19.906
By the way

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.953
you're still not thinking
about that incident, right?

00:36:27.289 --> 00:36:28.373
What incident?

00:36:31.876 --> 00:36:32.877
Nothing.

00:36:33.128 --> 00:36:34.462
I need to check on my shops.

00:36:34.546 --> 00:36:35.547
I'll call you later.

00:36:35.964 --> 00:36:38.049
Gosh.

00:36:44.264 --> 00:36:45.265
I know

00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:47.600
what you're worried about.

00:36:56.901 --> 00:36:58.903
I'm going to buy that. I called dibs.

00:36:58.987 --> 00:37:00.280
No, I'm getting it.

00:37:00.363 --> 00:37:02.824
I called dibs first. Get something else.

00:37:02.907 --> 00:37:03.950
Do you even have money?

00:37:04.534 --> 00:37:06.411
My dad gets paid tomorrow.

00:37:06.494 --> 00:37:09.080
He buys me anything I ask for
on his payday.

00:37:09.164 --> 00:37:10.457
How much does he make?

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.584
He makes millions of billions of won!

00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:15.128
My dad makes billions of billions!

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.340
Han-young,
how much does your dad get paid?

00:37:18.715 --> 00:37:21.217
Hey, his dad doesn't have a job.

00:37:22.635 --> 00:37:23.636
Really?

00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:31.853
You can't just leave like that.

00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:36.149
You have to pay me back

00:37:36.232 --> 00:37:38.151
and give me money for living expenses.

00:37:38.485 --> 00:37:41.988
Am I not giving you money
because I'm hiding it?

00:37:43.073 --> 00:37:44.699
Just be a little patient.

00:37:44.783 --> 00:37:47.577
Mr. Hwang said he'd pay me
for all the overdue pay

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.829
if I joined him for his new business.

00:37:49.913 --> 00:37:51.331
And you believe him?

00:37:51.414 --> 00:37:54.376
You keep getting scammed
because you trust too easily.

00:37:57.462 --> 00:37:59.089
You can't help him at all

00:37:59.172 --> 00:38:01.591
until he pays you for what he owes you.

00:38:01.841 --> 00:38:05.053
At least make him pay you
a month's salary first, okay?

00:38:05.345 --> 00:38:06.763
Fine, fine.

00:38:07.138 --> 00:38:09.182
I'll work harder.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.477
Are you just coming back from school?

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.895
Yes, I'm back.

00:38:13.978 --> 00:38:14.979
Okay.

00:38:16.022 --> 00:38:17.524
- Dad.
- Yeah?

00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:18.983
The stationery shop

00:38:19.317 --> 00:38:21.194
- has a...
- Han-young

00:38:21.653 --> 00:38:23.988
you have to study hard
and become a judge, okay?

00:38:28.868 --> 00:38:30.870
He works hard for nothing.

00:38:30.954 --> 00:38:32.914
He's too gentle to stand up for himself.

00:38:37.335 --> 00:38:38.586
The stationery shop?

00:38:39.379 --> 00:38:40.547
You need school supplies?

00:38:43.049 --> 00:38:45.969
Whenever my father saw me,
he told me to become a judge.

00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:48.888
I hated hearing him say that

00:38:49.305 --> 00:38:51.599
like it was a habit.

00:38:53.059 --> 00:38:54.352
So, that day

00:38:55.854 --> 00:38:57.272
I stole something.

00:38:58.773 --> 00:39:00.817
Let us live!

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.944
- Let us live!
- Let us live!

00:39:03.027 --> 00:39:04.779
Out with S Construction!

00:39:04.863 --> 00:39:06.739
- Out!
- Out!

00:39:06.823 --> 00:39:08.992
Let us live!

00:39:09.075 --> 00:39:11.369
- Let us live!
- Let us live!

00:39:11.453 --> 00:39:12.579
Hey, Jeong-ho

00:39:12.662 --> 00:39:14.122
should we just open a business?

00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:16.082
This contract guard work is the same

00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:17.625
as being in a gang, anyway.

00:39:17.709 --> 00:39:18.793
One day.

00:39:20.086 --> 00:39:22.422
Out with S Construction!

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.768
FIGHT

00:39:37.854 --> 00:39:39.022
FIGHT

00:39:55.997 --> 00:39:56.998
Are you okay?

00:40:03.838 --> 00:40:05.590
Don't come here!

00:40:06.299 --> 00:40:07.383
Father?

00:40:08.343 --> 00:40:09.427
No!

00:40:15.308 --> 00:40:16.309
Father!

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:18.520
Let's go, Han-young.

00:40:18.603 --> 00:40:20.522
- Hurry!
- Jeong-ho!

00:40:21.481 --> 00:40:22.607
Look.

00:40:26.736 --> 00:40:27.862
Hey, we have to run.

00:40:31.115 --> 00:40:33.159
FIGHT

00:40:35.537 --> 00:40:37.372
Everyone, please be seated.

00:40:44.003 --> 00:40:46.548
We will commence the session
for Case 2007GH5432

00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:48.299
involving Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:40:48.383 --> 00:40:50.760
on his violation
of the Punishment of Violences Act

00:40:50.843 --> 00:40:53.263
in an incident
of a mass weaponized assault.

00:40:54.013 --> 00:40:55.682
We are now in session.

00:40:56.683 --> 00:40:58.268
Defendant, please come in.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:36.139
MAIN COURTROOMS 417, 418, 419

00:41:38.641 --> 00:41:40.435
The verdict for Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:41:40.518 --> 00:41:42.854
on his violation
of the Punishment of Violences Act

00:41:42.937 --> 00:41:46.482
in an incident
of a mass weaponized assault is ready.

00:41:47.317 --> 00:41:48.735
I hereby announce

00:41:50.486 --> 00:41:53.656
that the Defendant used a weapon

00:41:54.073 --> 00:41:55.908
to cause fractures to the hired guards

00:41:55.992 --> 00:41:59.037
in his conflict with them.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.456
Hit in the head by a wooden baton

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:03.750
my father passed out
as soon as the fight broke out.

00:42:03.833 --> 00:42:05.376
So, he denied his allegation

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.128
but the Judiciary rejected his appeal.

00:42:07.211 --> 00:42:11.007
Furthermore, the witnesses' stories match

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:14.719
and the Defendant was confirmed
to have fled the site.

00:42:14.802 --> 00:42:16.512
The judge accepted the false claims

00:42:16.596 --> 00:42:18.222
of the security company.

00:42:19.015 --> 00:42:20.183
But in court

00:42:20.266 --> 00:42:23.436
there was one witness
who could testify to his innocence.

00:42:25.313 --> 00:42:27.899
The court hereby orders
Defendant Lee Bong-seok

00:42:28.316 --> 00:42:31.611
to one year and six months
of imprisonment.

00:42:33.738 --> 00:42:35.573
The Defendant has one week to appeal

00:42:35.657 --> 00:42:38.576
to the court's decision
from the day of the announcement.

00:42:39.035 --> 00:42:40.578
If an appeal is not filed

00:42:40.662 --> 00:42:43.831
the decision will be carried out
as announced.

00:42:50.546 --> 00:42:51.547
And that was

00:42:53.341 --> 00:42:54.592
me.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.391
But I couldn't say anything.

00:43:02.392 --> 00:43:03.810
Because if I testified

00:43:04.977 --> 00:43:07.397
I would've had to admit
that I left my father behind

00:43:08.147 --> 00:43:09.732
to save myself.

00:43:22.787 --> 00:43:25.039
So, that became the second day
I abandoned my father.

00:43:25.498 --> 00:43:27.041
But that was the day I decided

00:43:27.125 --> 00:43:28.918
I'd become a judge, as he always wanted.

00:43:33.506 --> 00:43:34.632
Because I thought

00:43:35.299 --> 00:43:37.719
if I became a judge

00:43:38.344 --> 00:43:40.930
I could bring myself to ask him
if he saw me at the fight.

00:43:44.767 --> 00:43:45.768
But

00:43:46.227 --> 00:43:48.020
I never got to ask him.

00:43:51.607 --> 00:43:52.859
Because before I realized it

00:43:53.693 --> 00:43:56.404
I'd become someone just like Jang Tae-sik.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.912
Damn it.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.250
Hey, are you crazy?

00:44:09.333 --> 00:44:11.127
- Prosecutor Kim!
- Are you trying to die?

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.503
Hold up.

00:44:12.587 --> 00:44:13.838
Please excuse me.

00:44:21.846 --> 00:44:24.515
I'm Kim Jin-a of the Specialized Division
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

00:44:24.891 --> 00:44:26.267
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a?

00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:36.027
I'm Kim Jin-a, a prosecutor
at the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

00:44:38.196 --> 00:44:40.072
I didn't know prosecutors pulled

00:44:40.406 --> 00:44:42.366
insurance frauds these days.

00:44:43.242 --> 00:44:46.996
Mr. Jang, you're under emergency arrest
on charges of offshore tax evasion.

00:44:47.371 --> 00:44:49.332
You have the right to an attorney

00:44:49.415 --> 00:44:51.167
and a chance to explain yourself.

00:44:58.341 --> 00:44:59.509
You got a lighter?

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:03.304
Whoa, Jang Tae-sik!

00:45:03.888 --> 00:45:05.598
Is he crazy?

00:45:05.681 --> 00:45:07.225
Hey! Get down right here.

00:45:07.308 --> 00:45:08.851
- Detention?
- Please calm down.

00:45:08.935 --> 00:45:10.102
Ten years?

00:45:10.186 --> 00:45:11.312
Let go!

00:45:12.021 --> 00:45:14.357
You have the right to request
a review of the legality of your arrest

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.067
and to remain silent.

00:45:20.279 --> 00:45:21.322
Let's go.

00:45:27.537 --> 00:45:30.164
I hear you're always dying
to prosecute S Group.

00:45:30.248 --> 00:45:31.541
Is that your life's mission?

00:45:31.624 --> 00:45:33.709
Or is it for personal vendetta?

00:45:35.419 --> 00:45:36.420
Both.

00:45:39.257 --> 00:45:41.884
I went after Jang Tae-sik
as soon as I became a prosecutor.

00:45:46.264 --> 00:45:49.267
Wow, wow, wow.

00:45:50.768 --> 00:45:53.729
Maybe I should've asked
what the revenge was for.

00:45:57.316 --> 00:46:00.403
We had no choice with the police starting
an internal investigation.

00:46:01.529 --> 00:46:03.865
The emergency arrest calmed things
for now.

00:46:04.866 --> 00:46:05.867
What should we do?

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:07.910
Let's just wait.

00:46:09.287 --> 00:46:10.746
Yes, sir.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.335
S GROUP CHAIRMAN JANG YONG-HYEON

00:46:19.297 --> 00:46:20.506
It's me, Kang Sin-jin.

00:46:22.967 --> 00:46:25.928
The prosecution made an emergency arrest
of Mr. Jang Tae-sik.

00:46:26.387 --> 00:46:28.389
So, the police won't investigate it

00:46:28.472 --> 00:46:30.600
but he must stay in custody for 48 hours.

00:46:31.726 --> 00:46:34.228
To make the prosecution look good

00:46:35.271 --> 00:46:36.856
and keep others from talking.

00:46:38.608 --> 00:46:39.692
Alright.

00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:40.818
JANG YONG-HYEON, CHAIRMAN OF S GROUP

00:46:44.655 --> 00:46:46.032
Let's follow the procedure

00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:50.077
and go one by one.

00:47:01.672 --> 00:47:04.133
Don't say anything,
and nothing will happen.

00:47:04.216 --> 00:47:05.259
Alright.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.471
That's what you're here for.

00:47:14.435 --> 00:47:15.436
Oh, my.

00:47:16.062 --> 00:47:18.189
There you are, Prosecutor Kim.

00:47:20.024 --> 00:47:21.192
REPORT ON S SHOPPING'S CHARGES
ON OFFSHORE TAX EVASION

00:47:24.987 --> 00:47:25.988
Alright.

00:47:30.868 --> 00:47:32.328
GANG-GIL, DO NOT PICK UP

00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:36.457
Let's begin.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.335
But you got a call.

00:47:39.418 --> 00:47:41.963
If you don't pick it up

00:47:42.046 --> 00:47:44.465
you'll get in trouble.

00:47:45.257 --> 00:47:46.258
Lighter.

00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:49.345
Lighter!

00:47:50.846 --> 00:47:52.223
It's been an hour now

00:47:52.306 --> 00:47:54.266
so you just have 47 more to go.

00:47:56.519 --> 00:47:58.020
Don't be so sure yet.

00:48:04.318 --> 00:48:06.070
GANG-GIL, DON'T PICK UP

00:48:10.074 --> 00:48:11.909
Yes, sir.

00:48:13.536 --> 00:48:14.620
Come in.

00:48:21.293 --> 00:48:22.294
You'll receive files

00:48:22.378 --> 00:48:24.505
about S Shopping's tax evasion
tomorrow morning.

00:48:25.923 --> 00:48:28.384
I already got the files
from the police investigation.

00:48:28.467 --> 00:48:29.969
No, not those.

00:48:30.553 --> 00:48:32.763
Just let Mr. Jang go to bed tonight

00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:34.306
and start when you get the files.

00:48:35.057 --> 00:48:36.058
Come on.

00:48:36.142 --> 00:48:38.477
We don't want them attacking us
for human rights abuse.

00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:40.938
CHIEF PROSECUTOR MA GANG-GIL

00:48:42.815 --> 00:48:43.816
You can leave now.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.948
CHIEF PROSECUTOR MA GANG-GIL

00:48:53.617 --> 00:48:55.786
But you told me to make
an emergency arrest!

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:57.538
What's with him now?

00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:02.752
I have a feeling

00:49:04.045 --> 00:49:05.337
this is going to be shit.

00:49:13.929 --> 00:49:17.058
An emergency arrest was made
on CEO Jang of S Shopping

00:49:18.434 --> 00:49:19.894
an hour ago.

00:49:19.977 --> 00:49:21.103
It's offshore tax evasion.

00:49:21.187 --> 00:49:22.271
Dad!

00:49:22.354 --> 00:49:24.774
They made an emergency arrest
of CEO Jang of S Shopping!

00:49:26.525 --> 00:49:27.985
Oh, you knew it already.

00:49:28.652 --> 00:49:29.653
You, too?

00:49:29.945 --> 00:49:32.406
Yeah, Father knew about it

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:34.116
but I didn't know
it was an emergency arrest.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.951
HAENAL LAW FIRM

00:49:36.035 --> 00:49:37.703
What about his offshore tax evasion?

00:49:38.412 --> 00:49:41.123
You can't run a law firm
just by being a good lawyer.

00:49:41.582 --> 00:49:43.584
You need good business skills, too.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.671
I read the police investigation files.

00:49:47.755 --> 00:49:48.881
I see.

00:49:52.802 --> 00:49:54.845
Why do you guys always get so serious
without me?

00:50:03.646 --> 00:50:05.481
The police started investigating
S Shopping

00:50:05.564 --> 00:50:07.983
for offshore tax evasion charges.

00:50:08.067 --> 00:50:10.778
The prosecution must've taken over
before it got more serious.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:14.281
It's an emergency arrest.
He'll be detained for 48 hours

00:50:14.365 --> 00:50:17.493
then he'll be let go once they confirm
the tax evasion and his slush funds.

00:50:18.494 --> 00:50:19.870
And all media outlets will have

00:50:19.954 --> 00:50:22.248
S Department Store and S Mart ads
all over for a while.

00:50:23.457 --> 00:50:25.126
What's the point of knowing it all?

00:50:25.209 --> 00:50:26.877
None of this is beneficial for us.

00:50:29.296 --> 00:50:30.297
Dad

00:50:30.631 --> 00:50:32.508
I think we're going to win

00:50:32.591 --> 00:50:34.093
in CQR Group's merger case.

00:50:35.553 --> 00:50:37.930
The judge is now on our side.

00:50:39.974 --> 00:50:43.185
With all the evidence
and the shareholders' testimonies

00:50:43.269 --> 00:50:44.812
we see some hope now.

00:50:49.441 --> 00:50:51.235
Whether we flip the coin

00:50:52.403 --> 00:50:53.696
or set it straight

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:56.949
doesn't it entirely depend
on whose hand it's in?

00:51:03.247 --> 00:51:04.874
It's the same in court.

00:51:09.336 --> 00:51:11.547
Okay, keep up the good work until the end.

00:51:12.506 --> 00:51:13.507
Okay.

00:51:14.592 --> 00:51:17.011
Se-hee, how are things going
with that judge?

00:51:21.015 --> 00:51:22.266
You know.

00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:24.143
I didn't set up that date
to entertain you!

00:51:24.226 --> 00:51:25.394
Do you know what I mean?

00:51:29.023 --> 00:51:30.065
Yes, I hear you.

00:51:33.235 --> 00:51:35.654
Ha-na, is the Nammyeon-gu sinkhole case
going well?

00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:38.449
Yes, Father, don't worry.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.789
They're always busy talking about the firm
whenever I'm not around.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.959
Just wait and see.

00:51:49.418 --> 00:51:51.003
Whatever in the Judiciary you are

00:51:51.086 --> 00:51:53.464
I'll trample over all of you.

00:51:54.798 --> 00:51:56.884
Just don't beg me for mercy then.

00:51:58.886 --> 00:52:02.014
Man, why hasn't he called me yet?

00:52:05.184 --> 00:52:08.187
Or do I look desperate
to catch a rich lady?

00:52:10.356 --> 00:52:13.150
That's it? He makes that one comment
and ghosts me?

00:52:17.905 --> 00:52:20.282
He's definitely a player.

00:52:21.825 --> 00:52:23.744
HAENAL LAW FIRM

00:52:23.827 --> 00:52:26.497
No updates from the sinkhole victims yet?

00:52:27.873 --> 00:52:29.041
And the district office?

00:52:30.626 --> 00:52:33.087
S Shopping is currently denying

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.214
all allegations of accounting fraud

00:52:35.297 --> 00:52:36.715
CEO Jang's offshore tax evasion

00:52:36.799 --> 00:52:39.134
and slush funds.

00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:41.011
S Shopping announced

00:52:41.095 --> 00:52:43.430
- Isn't that him?
- that nothing was illegal in management

00:52:43.514 --> 00:52:45.724
- Huh?
- and that all accounting...

00:52:45.808 --> 00:52:47.434
Who's "him"?

00:52:47.518 --> 00:52:49.812
The guy who locked me up in jail

00:52:49.895 --> 00:52:52.940
and threatened to make me go bankrupt
with the settlement.

00:52:54.233 --> 00:52:56.610
He was the CEO of the construction company

00:52:56.694 --> 00:52:58.445
but now, he runs a department store.

00:52:59.488 --> 00:53:01.073
Nothing's changed.

00:53:01.657 --> 00:53:03.701
The rich are still corrupt.

00:53:03.784 --> 00:53:06.996
I'm sure he'll live just fine,
even after committing all those crimes.

00:53:07.079 --> 00:53:09.331
First, they allegedly set up
an overseas paper company

00:53:09.415 --> 00:53:12.167
and forged a contract
with S Shopping's affiliate...

00:53:15.796 --> 00:53:19.300
I didn't know he threatened my father
with the settlement payment.

00:53:20.009 --> 00:53:23.095
I bet he evicted everyone that way.

00:53:35.482 --> 00:53:39.153
Mr. Jang, you're under emergency arrest
on charges of offshore tax evasion.

00:53:39.236 --> 00:53:40.863
We could do so much

00:53:40.946 --> 00:53:43.073
if we became a team.

00:53:56.086 --> 00:53:57.546
SAME-DAY LOANS AVAILABLE

00:53:57.629 --> 00:53:59.548
ALL CASH FOR YOU

00:54:04.303 --> 00:54:06.055
- Hey, sidekick.
- Hi, boss.

00:54:06.138 --> 00:54:08.682
This guy, "Open Sesame,"
got out of jail this year

00:54:08.766 --> 00:54:11.685
and rumors say he pulled a big one
with his restaurant buddies.

00:54:11.769 --> 00:54:12.770
Okay!

00:54:13.437 --> 00:54:14.480
Good work.

00:54:33.749 --> 00:54:34.917
Jjajangmyeon delivery.

00:54:38.128 --> 00:54:39.421
DELIVERY

00:54:55.896 --> 00:54:57.564
Come to Room 903 at Edge Motel.

00:54:57.815 --> 00:54:59.733
We should be able to destroy the stuff.

00:55:16.625 --> 00:55:19.461
The thing is at Open Sesame's house.

00:55:19.753 --> 00:55:21.255
We took care of the entrance

00:55:21.338 --> 00:55:23.549
and Open Sesame was in charge of the safe.

00:55:23.882 --> 00:55:25.759
There should've been an account book

00:55:26.969 --> 00:55:28.512
among what you've stolen.

00:55:29.012 --> 00:55:30.806
Account book...

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:42.860
Hey, take everything out.

00:55:42.943 --> 00:55:44.570
Take it all.

00:55:45.988 --> 00:55:47.281
Yes, there was.

00:55:47.906 --> 00:55:49.950
Oh, but that...

00:55:59.376 --> 00:56:00.544
It's all in here.

00:56:09.553 --> 00:56:10.846
I hear they call you "Open Sesame."

00:56:10.929 --> 00:56:13.015
- Yes.
- Guess what they call me.

00:56:15.517 --> 00:56:16.518
Bear?

00:56:16.602 --> 00:56:18.061
Teddy.

00:56:18.896 --> 00:56:19.897
Grizzly.

00:56:20.647 --> 00:56:21.690
Teddy bear!

00:56:22.065 --> 00:56:23.525
What do they call you?

00:56:24.443 --> 00:56:25.736
People call me

00:56:26.528 --> 00:56:27.696
an angel.

00:56:27.779 --> 00:56:29.823
- Why?
- When I get mad...

00:56:30.449 --> 00:56:31.617
Move over.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.621
I send them to heaven with one blow.

00:56:37.122 --> 00:56:39.208
What do you say, Open Sesame?

00:56:39.917 --> 00:56:40.918
You want to go?

00:56:41.001 --> 00:56:42.461
No, sorry!

00:56:42.794 --> 00:56:44.171
Why would you lie, then?

00:56:45.964 --> 00:56:46.965
I don't see

00:56:48.217 --> 00:56:50.093
what my friend is looking for here.

00:56:51.595 --> 00:56:53.055
What is it?

00:56:58.644 --> 00:56:59.770
What is this?

00:57:00.395 --> 00:57:01.897
Why did you even bring it?

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.065
You told me to take everything.

00:57:03.148 --> 00:57:05.359
- Just chuck it.
- Okay, let's go already.

00:57:22.501 --> 00:57:23.502
Oh, gosh.

00:57:23.877 --> 00:57:26.880
I collected so much today.

00:57:28.674 --> 00:57:29.841
Oh, gosh.

00:57:33.095 --> 00:57:34.096
Over there!

00:57:34.596 --> 00:57:35.639
Right there.

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:51.363
What does the book look like?

00:57:51.446 --> 00:57:54.366
It had a black cover with a coil.

00:57:54.825 --> 00:57:57.077
Hey, don't touch that! Young!

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.620
- Hey.
- Step aside!

00:58:03.208 --> 00:58:04.501
I definitely chucked it here.

00:58:08.755 --> 00:58:11.466
Hey, I'll send you an address.

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:13.969
Gather everyone
aside from those running the shops.

00:58:15.345 --> 00:58:16.346
Here...

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:21.810
A lot of elders collect scraps
in the area.

00:58:25.314 --> 00:58:27.107
- Hello, boss!
- Hello, boss!

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:28.191
Hey.

00:58:32.279 --> 00:58:33.488
We'll begin

00:58:33.572 --> 00:58:36.199
a search for a coiled notebook
with a black cover now.

00:58:36.283 --> 00:58:39.161
Check the scrap-collecting elders
and nearby junkyards first.

00:58:39.244 --> 00:58:41.246
Be as polite and efficient as possible.

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:42.331
Get on it.

00:58:42.414 --> 00:58:43.415
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:58:43.498 --> 00:58:45.208
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:58:45.292 --> 00:58:46.293
Thank you.

00:58:47.919 --> 00:58:49.880
- Have a good day.
- Stop right there.

00:58:49.963 --> 00:58:50.964
Come here.

00:58:51.381 --> 00:58:53.091
Where are you going?
We haven't found it yet.

00:58:53.175 --> 00:58:54.217
I'll look for it.

00:58:54.301 --> 00:58:55.302
- As you should, right?
- Yes.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.060
We'll be right back.

00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:05.520
Stay right here, and don't move an inch.

00:59:12.486 --> 00:59:13.820
Oh, my goodness!

00:59:13.904 --> 00:59:15.906
What the hell are you doing?

00:59:17.032 --> 00:59:19.326
Oh, no. What are you doing?

00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:23.413
Hello.

00:59:23.747 --> 00:59:24.790
Hey.

00:59:25.123 --> 00:59:27.459
Have you seen a black notebook
in the garbage?

00:59:27.542 --> 00:59:29.086
No, I haven't.

00:59:29.169 --> 00:59:30.170
Keep looking.

00:59:33.507 --> 00:59:34.841
- Open Sesame.
- Yes?

00:59:35.175 --> 00:59:36.426
Get on it. Don't piss me off.

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:37.719
Yes, sir!

00:59:40.889 --> 00:59:42.057
Man!

00:59:42.557 --> 00:59:43.558
Nothing yet?

00:59:43.642 --> 00:59:44.685
I don't think so.

00:59:45.227 --> 00:59:49.856
CLOTHING COLLECTION BIN

00:59:58.115 --> 00:59:59.658
Hey, Ms. Shin. I'm busy right now.

00:59:59.741 --> 01:00:03.912
Aren't you on a break? Why are you busy?
That's a business trip, not a vacation.

01:00:04.413 --> 01:00:06.498
I know. Is something wrong?

01:00:06.581 --> 01:00:08.542
No, nothing is wrong.

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:10.669
But I just got a load of scraps

01:00:10.752 --> 01:00:13.422
and there was an account book in the pile.

01:00:16.133 --> 01:00:18.051
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:23.056
REPORT ON S SHOPPING'S CHARGES
ON OFFSHORE TAX EVASION

01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:29.980
I was wondering who sent it,
and it's S Shopping.

01:00:31.064 --> 01:00:34.192
It matches the police report perfectly.

01:00:34.776 --> 01:00:35.986
That they're in the clear.

01:00:37.446 --> 01:00:38.447
Mr. Baek

01:00:39.364 --> 01:00:41.533
is it really possible to prepare this

01:00:41.616 --> 01:00:42.951
just overnight?

01:00:43.034 --> 01:00:45.662
They must've forged the report
to go with the police report.

01:00:47.914 --> 01:00:48.915
So

01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:51.626
they got the report from the police
in advance

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:54.171
and saw the emergency arrest coming?

01:01:02.137 --> 01:01:04.973
Have you compared the reports
from S Shopping and the police?

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:06.308
Do we stand a chance?

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:09.728
You knew you didn't wait
because we stood a chance.

01:01:10.771 --> 01:01:13.148
You want the judge
to crush us in court, then?

01:01:15.317 --> 01:01:18.278
How dare you cross boundaries
when I'm doing this for you?

01:01:19.362 --> 01:01:22.699
If you can't do it,
let him go after the 48 hours are over.

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:26.119
The prosecution has dignity to maintain.

01:01:34.294 --> 01:01:35.337
Man.

01:01:35.754 --> 01:01:38.673
Dignity? You're putting us to shame.

01:01:39.633 --> 01:01:41.968
At this rate, the case will close
without charges.

01:01:43.887 --> 01:01:46.932
I held him in custody for 48 hours
with the emergency arrest

01:01:47.015 --> 01:01:48.308
and what? No charges?

01:01:49.226 --> 01:01:52.354
And the police closed the investigation
once we took over.

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:57.484
I get why people die of shame now.

01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:15.836
Ms. Shin!

01:02:15.919 --> 01:02:16.920
Han-young!

01:02:30.058 --> 01:02:31.059
DAEHAN CENTRAL PARTY, CHO HU-HEON

01:02:31.226 --> 01:02:33.103
SUPREME COURT, KIM JUN-MAN

01:02:49.494 --> 01:02:50.537
He's coming.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:56.501
CHUNGNAM DISTRICT COURT

01:03:22.277 --> 01:03:23.445
Serving in the military

01:03:23.528 --> 01:03:26.531
is an honorable responsibility
for all Korean men.

01:03:26.615 --> 01:03:29.618
We must not allow those
with high social status

01:03:30.035 --> 01:03:32.495
to meddle with this responsibility.

01:03:33.204 --> 01:03:34.456
The courts of Korea will put

01:03:34.539 --> 01:03:36.833
all of those involved
in conscription evasion

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:38.793
to strict trial under the law

01:03:39.669 --> 01:03:42.172
regardless of their social statuses.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.549
The court will condemn

01:03:44.633 --> 01:03:47.052
not only those who evaded conscription

01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:50.764
but also those who colluded in
or supported the evasion

01:03:50.847 --> 01:03:52.474
without exception.

01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:56.645
No preferential treatment or tolerance

01:03:56.728 --> 01:03:58.396
will be allowed.

01:03:59.648 --> 01:04:00.732
Everyone

01:04:01.691 --> 01:04:04.069
I promise
that all will be punished heavily

01:04:04.611 --> 01:04:06.071
as they deserve

01:04:06.404 --> 01:04:09.157
for abusing their power

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.492
invested by the people.

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.745
MR. PRESIDENT PARK GWANG-TO

01:04:13.995 --> 01:04:15.163
I will now read the names.

01:04:16.039 --> 01:04:18.333
Senior Presidential Economic Advisor
Jang Jun-seo

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.169
Senior Presidential Secretary
for Civil Affairs, Seo Ji-ho

01:04:22.003 --> 01:04:24.172
CEO of Baekheon Group, Oh Yu-jun

01:04:24.631 --> 01:04:26.925
Party Leader Cho Hu-heon
of the Daehan Central Party

01:04:27.634 --> 01:04:29.386
Justice Kim Jun-man

01:04:30.387 --> 01:04:33.723
and Member Lee Yeong-hyeon
of the New People's Future Party.

01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:38.395
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:05:02.502 --> 01:05:04.087
He seems ambitious.

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:05.755
He's complicating everything.

01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:07.298
Since it's come to this

01:05:07.382 --> 01:05:09.467
let's check what type Lee Han-young is.

01:05:09.551 --> 01:05:11.136
You're kidding me.

01:05:11.219 --> 01:05:14.389
Because people finally feel regret
when death is at their doorstep.

01:05:14.472 --> 01:05:15.807
It's like you've died once.

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:16.933
Of course not.

01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:18.518
Sin-jin directly reached out to me.

01:05:18.601 --> 01:05:20.395
He wants to know what kind of guy I am.

01:05:20.478 --> 01:05:22.981
In our previous lives, he killed me
without having spoken a word with me

01:05:23.064 --> 01:05:25.817
but he wants to team up with me
as soon as we meet this time?

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.652
The Minister of Justice has
the confirmation hearing in two weeks.

01:05:27.736 --> 01:05:29.070
Can you oust him before that?

01:05:29.154 --> 01:05:31.531
I'll do everything it takes
to become someone you need.

01:05:33.992 --> 01:05:35.994
