(Jiangcheng Educated Youth Office)

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.026
I was going to tell him about it
in the next few days.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.630
That's great.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.340
I knew it.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.700
Jiangcheng No. 1
Textile Factory is a huge organization.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.080
I'm sure you guys
are very responsible.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.640
Let me thank you on the hero's behalf.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.010
Don't mention it.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.220
We're just doing our duty.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.500
Alright.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.080
Did you hear that?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.970
I did.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.490
Ms. Xu said yes herself.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.440
As for you,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.180
you should head back and wait patiently.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.410
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.570
Feng, what's wrong?

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:24.900
You're so careless today.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.090
Sorry, Ms. Xu.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.090
I was careless.

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:30.004
Alright now. You may resume your work.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.450
Mom.

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:32.960
Don't call me that in the office.

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:35.900
I want to request something from you.

00:02:36.426 --> 00:02:38.604
I want to take Fei Ni home
for lunch this weekend.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.970
Don't discuss
personal affairs in the office.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.900
Is it a yes or a no?

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.030
Fine.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.140
Take her home.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.970
Really?

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.060
If I must say,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.530
Ms. Xu, you do have great awareness.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.315
You sorted out
your thoughts in an instant.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.090
Mom, prepare some of
your signature dishes this weekend.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.000
Fei Ni loves fish.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.720
Remember that.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.550
This shampoo does
make our hair smell great.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.820
Ni, this is your first time
visiting their family.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.060
You must be courteous.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.820
Ni.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.370
Wait.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.930
Come here.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.530
All done.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.460
Here's your bag.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.020
Ni,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.090
take these tea leaves

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.450
and these cans

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.740
with you.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.060
I think Ye Feng's mother will like them.

00:03:49.293 --> 00:03:51.530
Dad, no need for that.
Just keep them for yourself.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.370
It's fine. I'm fine with
drinking the crumbs.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.240
I requested my friend to buy them.

00:03:57.315 --> 00:03:58.970
It's your first time
visiting his family.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.530
Yes.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.690
I know we aren't
as well-off as they are.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.626
But we can't just embarrass
ourselves, you know?

00:04:03.804 --> 00:04:04.900
There's no need for this.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.290
Mom...

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.960
It's fine. Just listen to me.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.937
It's your first time
visiting their family.

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:10.300
We mustn't let them belittle us.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.760
Precisely.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.160
Am I right?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.090
- Take them.
- Here.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.900
Here.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.850
Just listen to me, okay?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.750
Alright.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.320
I'll be going now.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.430
Go now.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.220
I'll be going now.

00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:23.604
You guys should remain here.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.410
Dear,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.250
don't you think things
are progressing too quickly for Ni?

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.180
How is it quick?

00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:34.871
You wanted to sleep with me
the second day you knew me, you know?

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.460
(Unite and Achieve Greater Victory!)

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.910
Fei Ni.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.500
Let me help you out.

00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:55.626
Be careful.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.370
It's already good enough
that you're here.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.937
No need to bring all these things.

00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:01.150
When you go upstairs,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.420
don't be nervous, okay?

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.270
You see,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.960
although my mother might look strict

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.129
when she's in the factory,

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.890
she's completely different
when she's home.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.840
Besides,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.980
I'm here too.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.690
Okay.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.730
I'm not nervous at all.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.900
Great.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.360
Here are your keys.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.940
Let's go.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.810
Come.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.790
Mom.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.760
Fei Ni is here.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.450
Why are you shouting?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.180
You have no manners at all.

00:05:35.848 --> 00:05:36.390
Go inside.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.370
Fei Ni is here.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.180
Hello, Ms. Xu.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.790
Hello.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.350
Mom,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.180
Fei Ni bought these especially for you.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.570
We have top-grade tea leaves,

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.420
canned yellow peaches

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.160
in malted milk syrup, and so on.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.300
Leave them on the table.

00:05:54.382 --> 00:05:55.782
Don't just stand there. Have a seat.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.330
Here.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.090
Here.

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:08.890
Have some water.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.860
Thank you.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.390
How is it?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.960
My place is pretty okay, isn't it?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.980
Yeah.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.890
Oh yeah, Mom,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.420
are the dishes ready?

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.270
Let's eat.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.620
Wait a little longer.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.890
Another guest is coming.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.020
Another guest?

00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:24.480
Isn't our guest already here?

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.680
Who's there?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.410
Hi, Ms. Xu.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.320
Ling!

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.730
Please come inside.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.940
We were waiting for you.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.060
Ms. Xu,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.770
I've brought you two excellent
revolutionary novels.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.100
Mom, this...

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.990
"Sparkling Red Star",

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.680
and "Song of Ideals", huh?

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.340
Just look!

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.450
All of her gifts serve
to nourish our spirits!

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.160
Unlike some individuals

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.100
who only buy food and stuff.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.130
The trip is quite long.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.120
You must be sweating.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.970
Let me make you some tea.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.440
Here.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.030
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.450
Don't call me that when we're at home.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.440
Call me Mrs. Ye.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.330
Thank you, Mrs. Ye.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.090
Ye Feng,

00:07:20.182 --> 00:07:21.440
why are you still sitting there?

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.500
Head to the kitchen.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.620
I was washing some lychees.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.715
Hurry and bring them here.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.000
Okay.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.300
Fresh lychees are the best.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.890
I'm allergic to lychees.

00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:43.271
Wait, are people
actually allergic to lychees?

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.640
I'll pass it to them, then.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.810
You guys can enjoy them.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.060
Here.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.400
Ling Yi.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.370
This is a huge one.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.280
Thank you, Mrs. Ye.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.570
You're welcome.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.210
You're welcome.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.915
Have some water.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.280
Fei Ni.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.370
I heard from Ye Feng

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.130
that you love fish.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.430
Yeah.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.250
I bought one especially for you.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.010
Look.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.100
Isn't my mom nice to you?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.650
Please go and prepare it.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.490
Mom,

00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:30.910
that's inappropriate of you.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.610
Coincidentally,
Ling Yi loves fish as well.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.340
Why don't we have

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.660
braised fish for dinner?

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.210
Mrs. Ye, that's fine.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:38.850
Okay.

00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:40.090
We'll do braised fish, then.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.210
Mom!

00:08:41.293 --> 00:08:42.450
The kitchen is over there.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.280
Okay.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.060
Fei Ni, I'm truly sorry about this.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.730
I didn't know that Ling Yi
would be coming.

00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:01.404
My mom didn't tell me
about it beforehand.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:12.900
But, think about it...

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.490
My mom is a sharp person.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.740
You're a part of the family

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.660
while Ling Yi is a guest.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.360
That's why she allowed you
to use our kitchen.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.090
Doesn't that prove

00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:25.250
that she has accepted you
as her daughter-in-law?

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.290
I'm fine.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.848
I understand the situation.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.450
I'm not mad either.

00:09:35.782 --> 00:09:36.760
I'm glad to hear that.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.250
Here,

00:09:37.337 --> 00:09:38.090
let me help you.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.370
Ye Feng, what are you doing?

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.720
Come and entertain our guest.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.600
You should go.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.490
After all,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.480
Ling Yi is your guest.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.700
Alright, I'll head there first.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.137
I'll come back and help you later.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.890
What's wrong?

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:06.960
Here,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.180
have some fish.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.180
Thank you, Mrs. Ye.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.310
Here, Fei Ni.

00:10:10.537 --> 00:10:11.350
Have some fish, too.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.420
Don't stand on ceremony.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.460
Just make yourself at home, okay?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.490
Here, have some vegetables.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:24.580
Ye Feng,

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.600
hurry and offer Ling Yi a toast.

00:10:27.804 --> 00:10:30.471
She spent a lot of effort
just to write that article, you know?

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.240
Mom,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.700
it was just a short article.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.530
Even Fei Ni could
write something like that.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.630
Fei Ni, what about this?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.100
Write an article for us tomorrow.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.340
Paste it on
the factory's bulletin board.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.130
How could they be the same?

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.530
Only the best of the best
could enroll in college, you know?

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.080
Just look at her.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.600
She gives off a different air.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.220
I don't see
anything different about her.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.870
Besides,

00:10:59.937 --> 00:11:01.960
so what if she manages
to enroll in college?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.120
It's more honorable

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.560
to be one of the working class.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.250
Do you know how many people
are scrambling to get in?

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.530
That was because
she hadn't figured it out yet.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.470
Serving one's husband
and educating one's children

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:12.700
are what a woman should do.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.370
They try to enroll in college

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.693
in order to get a good job

00:11:15.737 --> 00:11:18.250
so that they can get married
to a good husband, right?

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.220
Fei Ni, once you get married to me,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.370
I'll buy you all the books

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.250
you want to read.

00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:24.848
Why would she need to go to college
if she could have all this?

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.715
She wouldn't even attend it.
Am I right, Fei Ni?

00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:27.804
Here. Have some vegetables.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.470
In my opinion,

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.320
women should still enroll in colleges.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.060
Undergraduates are cultured
and well-educated.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:36.650
Mom,

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.890
didn't you tell me

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.910
that you would let
Fei Ni marry into our family

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.130
as long as she didn't attend college?

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.540
But why are you

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.890
praising undergraduates

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.340
nonstop right now?

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.060
The two of them are different.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.340
How are they different?

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.010
I heard from Ms. Liu

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.220
that Fei Ni could play the piano.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.250
Fei Ni,

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.420
although we don't have a piano here,

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.010
we have an accordion.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.300
The one where you have
to pull it and play it vertically.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.700
I think it's the same as a piano.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.660
Not at all.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.920
Mrs. Ye,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.520
I know how to play the accordion.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.130
Why don't I perform a song for you all?

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.700
Sure.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.750
Ms. Xu,

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:11.890
I'm done.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.204
You guys can enjoy your meal.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.340
I suppose you won't be using

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.610
all the things I brought.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.850
I'll take them with me as well.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.890
Fei Ni?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.730
Fei Ni?

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.750
She has no manners at all.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.820
She finished the entire fish

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.350
by herself!

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.680
I don't know what
Ye Feng likes about her.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.130
Fei Ni, why are you mad?

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.610
Fei Ni?

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:49.750
Ye Feng.

00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:52.940
What if I say I won't let you
play basketball again?

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.026
Will you be happy with that?

00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:55.010
Of course not.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.130
Playing basketball is my career now.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.650
It's a dream I had since I was a child.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.340
Enrolling in college
is my dream as well.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.310
Since you're not willing
to give up on your dream,

00:14:02.315 --> 00:14:03.648
why should I give up on mine?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.520
Fei Ni,

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.730
so what if you enroll in college?

00:14:08.093 --> 00:14:10.300
Can you find someone
with a better background than me?

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.900
Right now, our priority

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.850
is to get into a relationship

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.360
and get married as soon as possible.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.580
You should head back.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.890
I can't just head back alone.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:22.700
I can't face my mom.

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:23.530
What about this?

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.400
Apologize to my mom.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.940
You won't be able to face your mom
if you bring me with you now.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.848
It's obvious that your mom sees Ling Yi

00:14:29.871 --> 00:14:31.300
as her future daughter-in-law.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.800
Her attitude doesn't
represent mine, you know?

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.430
Fine.

00:14:36.448 --> 00:14:37.650
Let me ask you this, then.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.630
What if your mom disagrees
with our relationship?

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.460
I'll try to persuade her.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:50.960
Ye Feng,

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.690
I think we need

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.700
to reconsider this.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.740
Reconsider what?

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.300
We don't suit each other.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.270
Fei Ni,

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.820
what makes you say that?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.200
Don't be angry.

00:15:08.337 --> 00:15:10.130
I can persuade my mom
to change her mind.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:12.460
Fei Ni.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.360
Fei Ni?

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.340
Don't worry!

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.410
Mom always listens to me!

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.780
(Inpatient)

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:46.600
Fei Ni.

00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:49.300
You're finally here to visit me.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.100
I'm here to deliver something to you.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.370
Sorry about that,

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.060
Ye Feng.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.200
Ms. Xu just told me
to join her for lunch.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.137
I didn't know
that your girlfriend would be here.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.340
Was she upset?

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.820
Why don't I

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.530
seek her out

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.980
and explain things on your behalf?

00:16:14.337 --> 00:16:15.060
No need for that.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.940
Fei Ni isn't that petty.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.360
Besides,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.130
she's upset because of my mom,

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.130
not you.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.420
Since when did you
get together with Fei Ni?

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.300
Not that long ago.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:27.130
We...

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.530
Comrade Ling Yi.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.130
You see, my mom

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.130
loves to play matchmaker.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.940
But I'm a man with my own convictions.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.010
I have a girlfriend.

00:16:38.093 --> 00:16:40.300
You should know
what I'm trying to get at here.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.530
I understand.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.530
Don't misunderstand me.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.130
I just

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.220
admire you a little.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:50.510
Admire me?

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.240
For what?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.280
I admire you

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.130
for being a great basketball player.

00:17:02.404 --> 00:17:03.610
You're right about that.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.010
When it comes to basketball,
I'm one of the top players

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.840
in the municipal league.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:09.940
What about this?

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.620
Just tell me beforehand
if you want to spectate the matches.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.026
I'll reserve a good seat for you.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:15.140
Sure.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.290
Alright, I won't see you off, then.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.090
Take care.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.048
I'll head back first.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.460
Okay.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.220
She was picking on you.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.010
Not entirely.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.290
I understand her feelings.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.430
To Ms. Xu,
I'm not good enough for Ye Feng.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.360
Ye Feng is the one
who isn't good enough for you.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.560
That's not the main point.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.170
The main point is, I feel sorry for us.

00:17:45.293 --> 00:17:46.250
Do you know something?

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:47.770
Last time, when Ye Feng visited us,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.620
my parents went to borrow
some braised beef.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.860
My dad is a glutton.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.380
Even so, he didn't take a single bite.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.660
He gave Ye Feng all of it.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.900
When I was at Ye Feng's house,

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.700
I tried my best to devour the fish.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.290
But fish isn't as expensive as beef.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.900
I couldn't get my money's worth.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.460
It would've been a major loss for us

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.620
had I not brought these back.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.050
Remember to have them.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.190
They're good stuff.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:07.160
Okay.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.220
By the way,

00:18:10.226 --> 00:18:11.940
I have two pieces of good news for you.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.190
Firstly,

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.590
I got myself a job.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.220
Really?

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.490
Yeah. I'll be drawing comic strips
for a magazine firm.

00:18:19.537 --> 00:18:21.150
I need to undergo
two months of training,

00:18:21.182 --> 00:18:23.004
but I'll get subsidized
during that period.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.670
That's great.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.050
Two months aren't that long.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.490
You have to do well in your training.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.250
Do not slack off.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.290
Alright. I won't slack off.

00:18:31.537 --> 00:18:32.650
Just look at me. Before this,

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.910
I was seriously wounded.

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.570
Now, not only have I fully recovered,

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.115
but I also managed to find myself a job.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.810
Therefore, certain things take time.

00:18:39.048 --> 00:18:40.900
We'll find a way to resolve
our issues eventually.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.340
It's the same for you.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.460
You mustn't be impatient.

00:18:43.493 --> 00:18:44.600
Never settle for less.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.469
Go on more
blind dates before getting married.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.270
You should go on
as many blind dates as you can.

00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:50.260
After that,
compare all of the candidates. You'll...

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.570
If so, I don't think

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.380
I'll ever get married.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.180
What's the second piece of good news?

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.430
Secondly,

00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:02.582
the textile factory you're working at

00:19:02.604 --> 00:19:04.248
agreed to give me a separate unit.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.980
This is great.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.050
That means you can settle down now.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.250
When will you move there?

00:19:11.293 --> 00:19:13.048
I think I still have
to wait for some time.

00:19:13.071 --> 00:19:15.420
Until your factory
finishes assigning all the new dorms

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.620
and vacates the old ones

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.690
before it's my turn.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.490
That's already good enough.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.840
I was afraid that they might
go back on their word.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.626
I suppose they still have a conscience.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:27.680
Fei Ni,

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:29.880
once I get the unit,

00:19:30.493 --> 00:19:31.715
you should come and stay.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.090
That won't do.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.980
How could I stay with you?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.010
I mean, I'll let you stay there
for the time being.

00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:40.460
You're in a rush to move out, right?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.460
I'm a man. I can survive anywhere.

00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:44.293
At most, I'll just sleep
in the magazine firm.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.460
This won't do either.

00:19:45.648 --> 00:19:46.900
That definitely won't do.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.290
The unit is yours. You managed
to earn it by risking your life.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.570
How could I monopolize it?

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.810
How are you monopolizing it?

00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:55.982
I'm just going to let you
stay there for now.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.050
At most,

00:19:57.826 --> 00:19:59.382
I'll charge you some rent.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.730
No.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.010
Okay.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.410
But I know.

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:07.937
You're just trying to help me out.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.180
Thanks for that.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.050
I'll be going now.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:12.850
Okay.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.700
I'll remember.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.700
Remember to finish them.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.130
Okay.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:30.770
Remember, okay?

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.309
There's a good reason why ancient people

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.240
enjoyed climbing high places
to gaze into the distance.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.290
When I stand here,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.050
it feels like all of my worries

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.660
will melt away amidst the gorgeous view.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.860
One of the most deceptive functions
of the human brain

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.460
is its knack for creating illusions.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.220
But I usually describe it
as avoiding reality.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.290
You sound like

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.170
a neurosurgeon now.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.050
Sometimes,

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.940
avoiding reality isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:28.900
We should take
a break sometimes, you know?

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.010
I hear your research focus is on

00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:40.350
computational mathematics.

00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:43.290
Did you inquire about me
from Professor Wu?

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.290
Why not pure mathematics?

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.420
I've heard you've won the gold medal

00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:51.700
in the Jiangcheng Math Competition
more than once.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.515
You did inquire a lot about me, huh?

00:21:54.648 --> 00:21:56.448
That's the most basic information

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.320
one can find out if we wish
to understand them.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.290
My mom...

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:05.680
She said

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.080
plenty of people can handle

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.180
dull theoretical research.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.340
What the country needs right now

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.360
is the development
of computational mathematics.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.582
I should devote myself
to the most meaningful task.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.980
Most importantly,

00:22:17.271 --> 00:22:18.471
I like the subject.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.570
I understand.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.040
May I ask you a question?

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.900
What if I say no?

00:22:35.315 --> 00:22:36.400
Will you stop asking me?

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.770
This question is very important to me.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.090
Have you truly drawn the line

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.830
with your parents

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.670
and your family?

00:23:02.715 --> 00:23:04.050
My father's last name is Fang.

00:23:04.093 --> 00:23:05.380
My mother's last name is Mu.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.900
That's how I got my name.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.570
How can I draw a line with them?

00:23:11.048 --> 00:23:12.660
My parents have made mistakes.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.860
Even so, they've never let me down.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.900
My younger brother didn't
draw a line with them.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.980
Did that stop him from being a hero?

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.715
It's getting windy out here.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:35.920
Let's head back first.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.900
(Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory)

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:00.040
Feng, don't give yourself
too much emotional burden.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.040
Mr. Gao of
the Educated Youth Office called us

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.090
to discuss the issue with
Comrade Fang Muyang.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.290
You heard it as well.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.330
After the discussion our higher-ups had,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.050
you were the only single person

00:24:12.426 --> 00:24:14.240
on the organization's
new unit name list.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:15.900
Therefore...

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.460
Ms. Xu.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.700
Fang Muyang is a hero
who saved other people.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.900
He deserved to have a unit
allocated to him.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.010
No matter what,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.770
I should give him the unit.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.050
Feng,

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.010
I admire you for your intelligence,
your ability to pick up things fast,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.090
and your awareness.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.770
Keep up the good work.

00:24:32.937 --> 00:24:34.604
You'll definitely become the backbone

00:24:34.604 --> 00:24:35.810
of our factory in the future.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:36.700
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.820
Good job.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.900
Ms. Xu, I'll return to work first.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.700
Alright, go ahead.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:50.860
Ms. Xu.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.090
There are certain things

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.290
that I don't know if I should tell you.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:56.530
What is it?

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.570
Tell me.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.050
Tell me about it.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.180
Don't hesitate.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.250
I'm just a little worried.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.770
Will the hero, Fang Muyang,

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:10.730
have a negative impact on you

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.290
in the future?

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.380
What are you saying?

00:25:17.448 --> 00:25:18.871
You see, there's something off

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.730
about his conduct.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.510
Feng,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.380
you mustn't spout such nonsense.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.050
That's a heinous offense.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:28.700
I didn't make this up.

00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:31.293
Our comrades in the factory
all witnessed it themselves.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.090
Fang Muyang

00:25:33.337 --> 00:25:35.620
heads over to the factory
to find Fei Ni every other day.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.240
But everyone knows

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.660
that Fei Ni and Ye Feng

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.560
are dating each other now.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.640
And, just a few days ago,

00:25:43.204 --> 00:25:45.048
I even saw Fang Muyang and Fei Ni alone

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.800
at the bottom of their unit.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.070
They were so close.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.093
Fei Ni even tied
Fang Muyang's shoelaces for him.

00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:55.290
I would've thought
that they were a couple

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.710
had I not known any better.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.900
Even so, that doesn't prove

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.470
that Comrade Fang Muyang's conduct
is problematic.

00:26:07.515 --> 00:26:10.250
After all, he hasn't fully recovered
from his brain damage yet.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.760
We cannot hold him

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.900
to the same standards
as ordinary people.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:16.500
Indeed.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.160
But you see,

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.280
he knew how to seek out

00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:23.620
the Educated Youth Office
and Mr. Gao's help

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:25.804
to get him a unit even before
he had fully recovered.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.050
If he's fully recovered,

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.980
he might do something worse.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.220
Don't forget,

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.860
Fang Muyang deceived you

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.860
by pretending to be fully recovered.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.430
Let's drop the fact

00:26:41.804 --> 00:26:44.271
that there might be something
between Fei Ni and Fang Muyang.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.160
But he places so much trust in Fei Ni.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.680
I'm just worried

00:26:49.715 --> 00:26:51.490
that if you allocate
the unit to him today,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.471
he'll demand something else
in the future.

00:26:53.515 --> 00:26:55.010
If so, we'll be at a disadvantage.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.200
And, in the future,

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.110
if you want him to do something for you,

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.770
you and he won't be on the same page.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.460
It's more than just about the unit.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:11.170
But Ms. Xu,

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:12.860
I'm different.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.620
I was personally promoted
and nurtured by you.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.050
I'll definitely side with you.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.110
And, most importantly,

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:23.690
once Fang Muyang

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.460
joins our dorm,

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.570
he'll be one of us.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:31.680
He's the hero

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.700
whom you nurtured personally.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:35.800
But in the future,

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.930
if he does something detrimental

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.080
under someone else's command,

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.290
your reputation is the one
that'll be affected.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:51.370
Come.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.480
Hurry! Block him!

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.770
Spread out!

00:27:57.182 --> 00:27:59.700
Spread out the defensive baseline!
Don't leave anyone open!

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.660
Ask for the ball.

00:28:08.382 --> 00:28:09.460
Pull the line outward.

00:28:12.204 --> 00:28:13.220
Here, ask for the ball.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.330
Breakthrough.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.290
Are you saying

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.648
that you've allocated
my unit to someone else?

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.090
So now, I have no unit?

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.800
Comrade Fang Muyang,

00:28:23.404 --> 00:28:25.530
it's not that I've allocated
your unit to someone else.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.680
You just have to
wait for the next batch.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.500
But you already promised me last time.

00:28:29.604 --> 00:28:31.330
Why don't we discuss this
with Mr. Gao, then?

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.810
I did promise you before.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.140
But according to our higher-ups,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.730
since the name list for
the current batch has been confirmed,

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.530
we shouldn't alter it for no reason.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.430
If not,

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.660
it can easily lead to other issues.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.330
Other issues? What issues?

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.700
Whose instruction was this?

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.960
What kind of attitude is that?

00:28:50.693 --> 00:28:51.980
Are you interrogating me now?

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:55.900
That's not it.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.700
Ms. Xu,

00:28:56.915 --> 00:28:59.293
you know that my brain
hasn't been functioning well

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.110
after

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.550
I was injured.

00:29:02.293 --> 00:29:03.860
That's why I spoke without thinking.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.060
You're a hero.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.400
You're a role model.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.730
You're someone everyone
should aspire to be.

00:29:12.804 --> 00:29:14.050
What does a role model do?

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.320
A role model should
uphold their principles

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.900
and place the interests
of the people above all else.

00:29:20.048 --> 00:29:22.160
For example, the unit allocation
for the current batch.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.160
You should

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.230
meet the needs of ordinary workers

00:29:26.426 --> 00:29:28.404
and carry forward
the spirit of Lei Feng.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.700
What do you say?

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:34.090
If so, do you have a unit?

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:35.510
I do.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.050
Why don't you uphold your principles

00:29:38.271 --> 00:29:39.770
and follow the example of Lei Feng

00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:41.804
by giving other people your unit, then?

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.460
Stop messing around here.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.280
Our factory's unit allocation policy

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.810
prioritizes
married employees with families.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.160
Nothing will change unless you give me
your wedding certificate

00:29:52.182 --> 00:29:53.093
by tomorrow!

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.670
Fei Ni.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:12.940
Are you still upset?

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.730
Ye Feng,

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.140
I've given it some thought.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:19.140
We don't suit each other.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.410
Just look at you.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:21.890
I told you already.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.640
My mom always listens to me.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:24.860
Stop your nonsense, okay?

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.420
Ms. Xu isn't the main issue here.

00:30:28.671 --> 00:30:30.115
Let me ask you something.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.940
If we do get married,

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.490
and I still insist on enrolling
in college, will you support me?

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.340
Fei Ni, that's enough of you.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.980
I already begged my mom
to give your brother a job.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.440
I already argued
with my mom because of you.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.660
I've rejected Ling Yi as well.
What else do you want?

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.180
What's going on over there?

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.410
Isn't that Fei Ni and the captain?

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.080
Are they having an argument?

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.920
Did I say something earlier

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.140
that gave you the wrong idea?

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.230
I've never requested you to get a job

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.330
for my brother.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:07.940
I'm not good enough for you.

00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:09.320
You can find someone better.

00:31:09.604 --> 00:31:11.760
Since you know
you're not good enough for me,

00:31:11.804 --> 00:31:13.893
don't you think you should
treat my mom and me better?

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.140
That day, you left my house
after throwing a tantrum.

00:31:16.226 --> 00:31:18.660
I didn't say anything about it.
I even apologized to you.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.730
But look at you.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:21.430
Fei Ni,

00:31:21.582 --> 00:31:23.330
don't you think
you should be more sensible?

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.115
That's precisely why

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.250
you should find someone
who's more sensible,

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.330
who's obedient to you,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.250
and who your mom likes.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.860
Clarify yourself.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.620
Ye Feng, let go.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.700
Clarify yourself!

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.320
Let go!

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.626
- Clarify yourself!
- Let go!

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.020
What are you doing here again?

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.460
Fang Muyang?

00:31:52.004 --> 00:31:53.180
What are you doing here?

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.490
I'll tell you about it later.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:56.700
Comrade Fang Muyang,

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.100
Fei Ni is my girlfriend.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.390
You'll affect her reputation
if you keep finding her,

00:32:00.404 --> 00:32:00.915
you know?

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.030
I don't.

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.600
Did you forget?

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.090
My brain is damaged.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:06.990
Just now, I heard Fei Ni saying

00:32:07.337 --> 00:32:08.730
that you two don't suit each other.

00:32:10.337 --> 00:32:11.715
Did you forget about that too?

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:14.090
Come.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.600
Fei Ni,

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:19.700
hop on.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.730
How dare you?

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.380
If you dare to get on his bike,

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.730
I'll stop helping
your brother get a job.

00:32:32.737 --> 00:32:34.380
Even if you wish to enroll in college,

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.090
you still need my mother's permission.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:41.350
Get on my bike.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.960
Fei Ni, you'd better not regret this!

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.460
What are you guys staring at?

00:33:20.648 --> 00:33:22.080
- Why did you guys stop?
- Let's go.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.490
Keep playing!

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.140
I'll send you home.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.420
I don't feel like going home now.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.570
(I'll stop helping
your brother to get a job.)

00:33:54.693 --> 00:33:56.360
(Even if you wish to enroll in college,)

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.090
you still need my mother's permission.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.010
(Undergraduates are cultured
and well-educated.)

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.570
(The two of them are different.)

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.560
He refused to come back

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.980
because he was afraid you might
have no place to stay after his return.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.810
I promise.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.940
I'll make him come back
and marry you in three months.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.690
Don't be upset. I'll take you somewhere.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.860
What's on your mind?

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.130
Actually,

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.300
I've never considered
marriage seriously.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.040
In my opinion,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:05.270
if I have to get married eventually,

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.750
it's better for me to get married now.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.582
At least I can help resolve
the housing issue

00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:09.780
for my brother and Lin Mei.

00:35:10.293 --> 00:35:11.980
But after that, I realized I was wrong.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.190
I thought getting married
was so much easier.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.260
I thought I was already
mentally prepared.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.000
But I realized

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.080
that I still couldn't accept

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.570
an unequal relationship.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:26.570
Perhaps love
doesn't exist in my marriage.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.490
However,

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.380
respect is a must.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.170
You're right.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.900
Why did you go to the factory today?

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.300
Xu Hongqi told me to come.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.030
She told me

00:35:46.226 --> 00:35:48.093
that the unit she promised
to allocate to me

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:49.740
was gone.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:52.230
But why?

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.671
Because there's only
a limited number of units.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.330
Xu Hongqi said

00:35:56.448 --> 00:35:59.026
that they had to prioritize
married workers with a family.

00:35:59.515 --> 00:36:00.604
But I won't give up.

00:36:00.626 --> 00:36:02.093
If they don't allocate it to me today,

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.839
I'll head to
the Educated Youth Office tomorrow.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.490
I'm going to bring
a reporter with me as well.

00:36:05.493 --> 00:36:08.310
I'll interview her and ask her if it's
appropriate to let a hero like me

00:36:08.448 --> 00:36:09.848
stay hospitalized all this while.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.980
Fang Muyang,

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.440
why do you desire a unit that much?

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:21.660
You told me this yourself.

00:36:22.248 --> 00:36:24.448
You said I shouldn't stay
in the hospital for too long.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.520
If not, I'll fall sick for no reason.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.130
I have a solution
to resolve your housing issue.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.160
What is it?

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.570
Let's get married.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.090
Don't panic.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.110
It's fake.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.940
I mean,

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.920
are you willing to stage
a fake marriage with me?

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.420
Let me tell you the situation.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.050
Since Ms. Xu said

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.260
the units are only allocated to
married workers with a family,

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.560
if we get married,

00:37:01.648 --> 00:37:03.115
that means she has no excuses

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.980
to not allocate any units to you.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.380
Although

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.700
the marriage certificate is real,

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:11.790
the marriage is fake.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.780
Do you understand?

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:21.040
I do.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.570
But don't you think

00:37:23.782 --> 00:37:25.490
this is too much of a sacrifice for you?

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.000
I have my own plans too.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.940
You know my situation as well.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.370
Therefore, when we get married,

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.050
you'll receive your unit.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.190
And, half of the unit

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.580
should be mine.

00:37:36.893 --> 00:37:37.915
Is that okay with you?

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.390
Yeah.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.170
When should we register our marriage?

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:49.950
Have you

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.940
recovered your memory?

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:57.980
I remember you told me

00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:59.570
that you liked me a lot.

00:37:59.626 --> 00:38:01.404
You said that no one liked me
as much as you.

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:02.804
That's why I never forgot about it.

00:38:02.804 --> 00:38:03.480
That's nonsense.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.570
I never said that before.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:05.360
If you don't like me,

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.130
why did you come to the hospital
to take care of me?

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.582
Those are two different matters.
I went to take care of you

00:38:09.604 --> 00:38:11.130
because I wanted to enroll in college.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.050
Don't make it

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.090
sound so trivial.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.570
If so, when did you start liking me?

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.239
I've never liked you.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.940
If so, why are you trying
to marry me?

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.170
It's because of the unit.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:21.340
You need the unit too.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.940
The unit will be split equally among us.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.090
Why is that the case?

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.530
Your parents live together, right?

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.860
Because they love each other.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.050
We're doing it to get a unit.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.090
Can't we do both?

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:29.900
No.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.860
If we get married,

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.420
I'll own half of it.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.550
Okay.

00:38:37.648 --> 00:38:38.804
Whatever you say.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.920
There's one more important condition.

00:38:45.404 --> 00:38:47.260
I won't stop you
from enrolling in college.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:48.990
On the contrary,

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:51.750
I'll do my best to support you.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:01.120
Thank you.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.980
Why are you staring at me?

00:39:26.026 --> 00:39:28.210
How would you know if you weren't
staring at me yourself?

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.170
I suppose this is how you stare
at the nurses usually, huh?

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.210
Are you upset?

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:35.510
No.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.860
I did it because I had to draw them.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.426
I had no choice but to observe them.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:41.000
I think you were trying to draw them

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.530
because you wanted to observe them.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.260
That's an interesting take.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.300
This is just a reminder.

00:39:47.337 --> 00:39:49.382
No matter if you're
drawing a portrait or so on,

00:39:49.404 --> 00:39:50.610
if you keep staring at girls,

00:39:50.715 --> 00:39:52.340
people will complain about your conduct.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.380
You should be more careful.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.570
Once we get married,

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.540
you'll be the only girl I draw.

00:39:57.737 --> 00:39:59.210
That way, no matter how I draw you,

00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:00.690
people won't complain about my conduct.

00:40:00.693 --> 00:40:01.804
No need for that.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.380
You can draw whoever you like.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.671
It's none of my business.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:12.880
Come on.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.460
I'll send you home.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.690
Hop on.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:26.540
♪If the future cannot be grasped♪

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:28.890
You...

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.040
Did you wash your shirt again?

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.050
Did you scrub it on a washboard?

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.460
If you keep washing it like this,

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.380
this shirt of yours
will have a huge hole again,

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.650
just like your previous shirt.

00:40:39.426 --> 00:40:40.900
If so, you should show me an example.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.460
I'll learn it from you some other day.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.170
♪Will receive the most♪

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.690
How did you wash your clothes when
you were in the countryside?

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:50.460
I don't remember.

00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:52.460
Perhaps some other girls
washed them for me.

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:53.940
Stop bragging.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.300
Anyway, I won't do your laundry.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.340
I'll do yours, then.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.090
No need.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.380
You might ruin my clothes.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.940
Who knows for sure?

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.340
How did your training go?

00:41:04.493 --> 00:41:07.160
They said that I could draw comic strips
for the magazine firm

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.170
after I completed the training.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.490
And, I'll get paid for it.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:12.900
That's great.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:14.490
What's great?

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.010
Everything's great.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.260
Alright, you may stop here.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.090
Regarding our fake marriage,

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.780
we must keep it from my parents.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.810
They'll never agree to it.

00:41:42.871 --> 00:41:45.340
It'll be troublesome
if the unit allocation gets delayed.

00:41:45.404 --> 00:41:47.204
Let's acquire
our marriage certificate first.

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:49.280
They can't do anything about it
even if they find out.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.570
But can we actually hide this from them?

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.090
We should do it first.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.570
Take this bicycle with you tonight.

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:58.780
Go to the Educated Youth Office tomorrow
morning to get a letter of introduction.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.530
I'll get one too.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.940
Let's proceed with the procedure.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.740
We'll be fine once we receive the unit.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.320
Understood.

00:42:04.471 --> 00:42:06.471
I wish to live with you
as soon as possible too.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.710
No.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.740
That's not what I mean.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.980
I mean, I don't want any
additional trouble to crop up.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.460
It'll be troublesome if Ms. Xu

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.693
goes back on her word again.

00:42:15.715 --> 00:42:16.460
Understood.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.650
Alright now. It's getting late.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.090
You should head back now.

00:42:22.582 --> 00:42:23.690
You should head back first.

00:42:23.782 --> 00:42:25.050
I'll leave once you're inside.

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:26.130
I'm already an adult.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:26.980
You should leave now.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:32.780
Go now.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.610
See you at the hospital
tomorrow morning.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:41.340
