00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.739
(9 years ago, 2nd year of the Hongzheng)
(Big Flower, is your leg healed?)

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.980
(I really want
to dance with you again.)

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.180
Is this wood carving
the young emperor?

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.179
Mm.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.540
Big Flower is my dearest friend.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.540
Being friends
with the Emperor is no blessing.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.099
Why not?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.339
Xiao Man,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.740
keep this in mind.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.820
It's because he bears a debt of guilt.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.779
He owes the Zhen family.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.540
Even across lifetimes,
he could never repay it clean.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.020
And between us and him,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.820
it will end only in death.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.220
Why does he bear such guilt?

00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:22.099
♪Do you know, our fingertips
are bound by one string♪

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.699

=Shall We Dance=

00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:00.057
=Episode 5=

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.100
Your Majesty.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.899
There has been unrest lately.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.220
Strange incidents arise.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.219
However,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.180
there is one curious matter.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.660
Nearly everyone who harbours secrets

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.940
seems to gather in one place.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.100
Where?

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.140
Yanbo Parlor.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.299
(Eastern Secret Chamber, Yanbo Parlor)

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.620
Princess.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.140
Princess.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.379
(Chief of the Zhenzhe tribe, Yun Shuyan)
The envoy purchased black iron ore.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.859
I've looked into the bulk purchase.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.619
As expected,
they are forging black iron weapons

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.339
in a highly concealed location,

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.500
and continue to recruit
soldiers and allies.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.580
They've only just suffered a heavy blow,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.340
yet still have the funds for all this?

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.140
Exactly my thought.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.299
So I kept digging.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.899
The silver they're using

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.300
is clearly newly smelted.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.860
But one ingot appears
to have escaped the furnace,

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.620
bearing the official
mint mark of Great Qian.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.100
I risked my life to track down
this intelligence for you, Princess.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.100
How do you intend to reward me?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.300
That can be arranged.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.619
I've acquired
some land along the frontier.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.779
There, waters run everywhere,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.979
and flowers bloom at every door.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.219
When I no longer
concern myself with palace affairs,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.700
I shall go there and build a few houses.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.739
Each day, I'll ride freely,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.500
living as my name suggests,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.460
enjoying years unbound and unrestrained.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.460
When that time comes,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.540
I'll take you in, you little rascal,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.739
and have you roam the world with me.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.140
We'll be free and unbridled.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.939
Truly?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.340
I give you my word.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.780
- Then it's settled.
- Then it's settled.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.219
(Western Secret Chamber)
Now, the Grand Princess appears

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.139
(Yanbo Tower)
to have returned power to His Majesty,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.579
but she grows ever more ambitious.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.019
She rules from behind the curtain.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.579
And now she has grown close to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.580
Yun Shuyan of the Zhenzhe tribe.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.459
Whether it is military
authority of Great Qian

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.619
or forces she can draw
upon beyond the borders,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.419
she holds both firmly in hand.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.580
Does she mean
to become another Wu Zetian?

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.380
She may not harbour Wu Zhao's ambitions,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.099
but power is a thing

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.299
that once grasped

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300
can never easily be relinquished.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.580
It can even drive one to madness.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.780
That young emperor has
played the fool for ten years.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.300
By now,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.580
he must have had enough of his aunt.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.059
You mean to say...

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.499
Aside from the Zhenzhe tribe,

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.660
other border tribes
are growing stronger as well?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.740
Now you command
the Ministry of War at court,

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.580
while I manoeuvre within the palace.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.060
In addition,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.899
I have secured allies
at the frontier to correspond with us.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.620
When the moment is ripe,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.060
the great undertaking will succeed.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.460
I've learned that

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.139
the Grand Princess

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.980
and Yun Shuyan,
leader of the Zhenzhe tribe,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.260
Jia Yi of the Directorate of Ceremonial,

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.700
and Minister of War Sun Gong,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.420
have each held secret talks
in the chambers of Yanbo Parlor.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.300
I never would have thought

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.099
that Yanbo Parlor would become

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.740
the most
sought-after place in the capital.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.700
Who else visited the place?

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.380
There is one more.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.380
Xiao Man.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.340
Wait.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.260
Sun Gong...

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.500
Is he not my aunt's man?

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.740
Then what ties
does Jia Yi have with them?

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.060
And Xiao Man...

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.260
Who exactly is he?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.100
Friend or foe?

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.860
Ten years between
life and death, all lost to the void.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.939
Though the view remains,
people have changed.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.580
Everything has come to nothing.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.300
Those who still carry hope

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.780
must not disappoint me.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.459
Why has Your Majesty brought me here?

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.900
To meet an old acquaintance.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.219
Ever since my return,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.979
Your Majesty keeps staring at me.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.540
What are you looking at?

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.500
Because you've changed.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.540
How so?

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.019
You've grown taller.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.260
More handsome.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.980
No longer like when you were little,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.500
all flustered and adorable.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.019
Flustered and adorable?

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.060
That's right.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.219
If this were back in our childhood,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.620
you'd definitely be...

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.779
"Ah, Your Majesty,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.380
I know my fault.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.220
I will never repeat the same mistake."

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.299
Good.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.499
Exactly like that.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.100
Your Majesty is impressive.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.700
Xiao Man,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.820
I always try to find

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.100
the look you had as a child.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.940
Why not act it out now?

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.539
I command you,

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.060
do it at once.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.500
No.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.020
Go on, just do one.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.140
Do it for your dearest friend.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.020
Ah, Your Majesty.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.540
That's it.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.140
Another one.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.340
Ah, Your Majesty.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.219
I...

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.140
I am...

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.500
I can't do it.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.780
I can never undo that.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.099
You couldn't call yourself a servant,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.860
right?

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.740
I knew it.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.299
Ever since you returned,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.219
you've been
avoiding that form of address.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.420
You're avoiding
your identity as a eunuch.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.300
Very well.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.579
Today, I grant you
pardon on two matters.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.540
First,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.300
stop referring to yourself as a servant.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.340
Second,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.220
when there is no one else,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.820
call me by my name.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.020
Like now.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.700
Your Majesty.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.620
What was the name again?

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.380
Big Flower?

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.580
No.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.579
I am Chu Ying,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.740
nineteen years of age.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.180
May I ask this young gentleman's name,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.380
and how many years he has seen?

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.020
I am but one year older,
Young Master Chu.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.260
My name is...

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.900
My name is Xiao Man.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.220
Why do you always avoid me?

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.020
Is there something wrong with that name?

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.460
No.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.340
Good.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.779
Then listen closely.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.139
To me, "Xiao Man"

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.420
is the most
beautiful name in this world.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.780
He gave me warmth
when I was most helpless.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.619
He embodies a friendship

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.420
I have carried for ten years.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.180
I will not allow anyone to erase him.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.940
I thought we were here
to meet an old acquaintance?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:05.900
Come on.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.980
Look who's here.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:12.419
This is

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.540
Little Flower.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.980
You've been

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.059
looking after Little Flower
after I left?

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.180
I have.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.219
You were gone a full ten years.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.460
Little Flower's grown
into Old Flower now.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.420
Even its fur has faded.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.660
Lucky you still got to see it.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.100
Take it away.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.100
Thank you.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.580
After you left,

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.060
I kept everything you left behind.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.739
Ten years you were gone,

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.940
without a single word.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.419
The only way I could ease my thoughts

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.179
was to look

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.340
at the things you left me.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.940
In my hardest, most helpless moments,

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.180
I could only confide in Little Flower.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.740
Perhaps you're not one for sentiment.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.940
After all, beyond these palace walls,

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.900
there are so many new faces,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.260
so many new things.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.820
I remember.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.540
I remember everything.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.419
It was those memories

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.580
that carried me through my darkest days.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.820
Darkest days?

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.020
This is where you and I first met.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.900
I came every night to bring you food.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.939
One bitterly cold evening,

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.540
your nose was running from the chill.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.860
So then...

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.060
That was how it began for us, wasn't it?

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.659
It was.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.780
Just like that.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.420
Xiao Man,

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.499
from now on,
let us be as we once were.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.780
No distance between us.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.980
Will you?

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.780
"I would buy
cassia blossoms and sail with wine,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.300
yet in the end,

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.060
it is not our wanderings."

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.740
Listen to this melody.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.179
After you left,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.780
I had the musicians of the Imperial
Music Office play it for ten years.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.580
But no one ever danced it with me again.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.220
Do you still remember the steps?

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.820
I remember.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.180
Well...

I have never changed.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.540
As long as you are the same,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.220
