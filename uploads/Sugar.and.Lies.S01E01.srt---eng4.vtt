00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.080
If you walk out now,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.880
we're done.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.880
Fine.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.080
I'll respect your choice.

(Suga Love)

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.120
This outfit looks awful.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.120
But since I get to match with you,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.520
I actually think it looks great.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.040
We can't choose our background,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.880
but I'll protect you.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.680
Ding Daang and Chen Aming

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.960
will stay together forever.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.690
Who gave you the right to decide for me?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.720
- But...
- Ding Daang.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.000
I owe you more than I can repay.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.360
I told you, I just can't pay it back.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.240
If you're that kindhearted,
why not adopt a dog instead?

let's meet up for drinks.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.240
Hi everyone, I'm your relationship coach,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.280
Zhou Haoran.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.720
Let me introduce my stunning partner,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.880
Miss Gu Ruomai.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
Hello everyone,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.040
I'm Maimai.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.000

Aming.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.880
It's really you.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200
Ding...

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.520
Daang.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.280
My name's Ding Daang.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.640
Like the sound

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.040
from a spoon falling into a bowl.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.120
Such a lovely name.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.840
I remember you.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.520
Really?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.280
My...

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.640
mom works for your family as a maid.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.320
Sister Bi.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.720
Long time no see.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.080
You're back in Mancheng.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.880
Is that a problem?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.160
Let's... reintroduce ourselves.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.120
I go by

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.880
Yu Kun now.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.480
Yu... Kun.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.680
President Yu.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.600
Miss Ding.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.840
Miss Ding.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.240
Goodbye.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.320
(No,)

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.840
(you're not Yu Kun.)

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.280
Chen Aming!

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.200
In the future you planned,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.280
was I never part of it?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.640
Didn't we agree to
work through this together?

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.800
Together?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.000
Haven't I been trying hard enough?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.640
Tell me,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.600
what more do you want me to do?

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.200
Ding Daang.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.360
Being with you is exhausting.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.520
I've done everything I could.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.480
Please, just let me go.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.600
I'm begging you, set me free.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.880
I'm begging you.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.040
I'm begging you.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440
What happened?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.910
You...

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.560
What happened to you?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.600
Are you dealing with something tough?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.280
Talk to me, I can help you.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.120
Aming, I can help you.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.920
Wow, you're really caring.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.280
If you're that kindhearted,
why not adopt a dog instead?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.320
Aming.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.520
Come back.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.760
Come back, please.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.000
It really is Chen Aming.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.640
But why did he change his name?

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.080
He's not quite how you remember him, right?

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360
Still the same.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.440
Don't fall for his tricks again.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.240
That Zhou Haoran sure talks a lot.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.520
I can ask around.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.440
You're drunk.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.400
Let me send you home.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.000
Send me home?

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.000
And who exactly are you to me?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.160
Your bestie's busy chatting
with Mr. Zhou.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.800
She can't look after you right now.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.480
Tell me,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.960
should I call you Aming…

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.760
or Yu Kun instead?

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.800
And what about me?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.640
Should I be calling you

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.800
Miss Ding

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.720
or...

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.400
Mrs. Hu?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.960
Got you, huh.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.240
Still pretending.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.600
You've already dug up all the details.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.720
I think you should call me,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.200
First Love.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.600
Well, Miss First Love,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.400
you're getting engaged in just two days.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.160
Still not done having fun?

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.680
Do you even dare?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.680
Completely useless.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.960
You

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.760
haven't changed at all.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.320
Hand me the drink.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.800
Come on.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.240
That's all you can handle.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.320
And you're drinking out?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.200
Give me the drink.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.960
No way.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.840
You've had enough.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.160
Water.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.480
Stop bossing me around.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.880
Fine.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.240
I won't bother you.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.640
Call your fiancé.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.120
Ask him

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.330
to take you home.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.480
Cut the chatter.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.000
Just tell me,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.280
do you dare to play?

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.640
Alright.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.960
Your place or mine?

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.240
Actually,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.160
I'm curious about you two's place.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.280
What's it like?

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.520
Interesting.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.040
Chen Aming.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.040
Why did you come back?

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.000
You made that choice back then.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.440
You should've disappeared for good.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.680
Why show up out of nowhere now?

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.440
Why come back just to mess with my life?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.200
Fine.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.600
I'm sorry.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.680
I should go.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.800
Miss Ding.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.200
What exactly do you want from me?

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.760
The past

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.680
isn't something I can forget at will.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.400
Didn't you always say

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.800
that you owed me too much?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.160
Alright then.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.800
You'll have to make up all the pain

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.400
I went through back then.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080
Fine.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.480
How do you want me to make it up to you?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.720
If you truly feel guilty about it,

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.380
stay with me for one more week.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.400
What do you think?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.560
And after that?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.360
After that,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.250
we go our separate ways.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.440
Deal?

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.400
(Aming,)

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.800
(wait for me.)

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.960
Have you made up your mind?

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.680
You said you'd make it up to me.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.520
Ruomai.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.960
Where's Ding Daang?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.040
President Hu.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.720
I'm her fiancé.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.100
(Hu Yitong)
Then who am I?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.280
Good question.
