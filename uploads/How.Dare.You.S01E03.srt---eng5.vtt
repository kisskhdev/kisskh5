WEBVTT

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.030
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 3]

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.390
What I meant was

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.350
that my temper is indeed terrible.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.170
Please sit, Mother.

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.380
Mother, why get angry

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.840
over a mere consort?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.479
Here, have some tea.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.289
Let's talk things through.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.200
Little Crown Prince,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.950
how are your studies lately?

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.640
F-

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.560
Father...

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.920
recently

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.720
m-my studies have been satisfactory.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.910
Very good!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.260
Thanks to Mother's virtuous influence,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.090
the little Crown Prince
has been raised so well.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.590
Little Crown Prince,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.430
if you need anything in the future,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.710
feel free to tell me.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.120
Yes.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.110
Now you're acting like a proper father.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.520
There is indeed something

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.680
you can help the Crown Prince with.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.280
Our Crown Prince

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.520
is exceptionally intelligent.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.520
However, his horsemanship
and archery skills

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.100
are somewhat lacking.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.630
Doesn't General Luo have a young son

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.630
of similar age?

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.710
Why not summon him to the palace

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.740
to be a companion to the Crown Prince?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.190
General Luo

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.200
has just been commended for his merits.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.630
Wouldn't this be somewhat...

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.150
Guards!

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.360
Here we go again.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.470
I'll draft the decree immediately.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120
Guards!

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.000
Serve tea to Consort Yu.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.140
Your Highness.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.740
What are you doing?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.860
Your Highness,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.520
I was blessed with a son
only in my forties.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.840
He is my life.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.590
Now, His Majesty summoning him
to the palace—

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.680
while it sounds like
making him a study partner,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.400
in reality,
it's actually holding him as hostage.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.190
What if...

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.800
What if he fails
to please the Crown Prince?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.130
If anything goes wrong,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.320
it could cost my entire family's lives!

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.600
General Luo,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.320
please rise to speak.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.560
I was a companion
to the Crown Prince since childhood.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.079
The hardships involved,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
no one understands better than I do.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.010
General Luo,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.870
if you still trust me,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.310
give me some time.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.750
I promise to bring your child back

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.240
safe and sound.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.630
Your Highness is most gracious.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.959
I am but a simple warrior

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.839
and don't know fancy words.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.750
If you can save my beloved son,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.010
I will lay down my life,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.870
and follow

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.240
your lead alone.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.330
Rest assured, General Luo.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.190
I will keep my promise.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.750
I shall

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.070
take my leave now.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.840
I've only just realized

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.000
why you suddenly came
to the Empress Dowager today

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.200
and put on such a show.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.590
What show?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.690
You wanted everyone in the palace to know

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.950
that you won't tolerate me
being criticised,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.600
let alone being framed.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.500
This way they'll think

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.120
this demonic consort has become
the emperor's weakness.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.380
Controlling her means controlling you.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.800
This would make them lower their guard

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.430
while they continue fighting
among themselves.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.030
This way we can develop our strength
in secret.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.470
Right?

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.590
You figured that out?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.000
Is my acting that bad?

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.770
Your acting was excellent.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.100
It took me a whole day to figure it out.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.250
You're truly a mastermind.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.420
Now I've become both your shield
and your weakness.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.680
When one day,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.870
an assassin

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.870
holds a sword

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.420
against my throat to force your hand,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.540
you could just say,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.650
"What a fool.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.250
I don't care about her."

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.830
Then with one stroke,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.050
skewer both me and the assassin
like candied fruits.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.720
If you really think that way,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.950
aren't you angry?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.390
Not at all.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.960
We're all drowning people.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.920
Whoever can swim to safety
does so by their own ability.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.380
I understand completely.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.920
I'd do the same in your position.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.600
Besides,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.390
didn't I not let him know
about Prince Duan

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.850
contacting me in private?

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.790
Moreover,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.000
my request to go to the library
was also self-serving.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.360
The two doors there connect
the inside and outside of the palace,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.510
providing my escape route from this place.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.310
But let's be clear about one thing.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.310
Don't give me that
self-sacrifice nonsense.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.430
If someday only one of us can survive,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.270
don't go easy on me
just because I'm a woman.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.960
I won't go easy on you either.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.810
No matter what,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.840
I will never betray you.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.730
Even if in the end

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.400
you choose Prince Duan,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.940
it would still be the same.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.110
Of course,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.050
if you don't want to choose anyone,

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.430
if someday I die first,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.040
before I die,

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.510
I'll send you out of the palace,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.370
away from this place of conflict,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.030
toward the freedom that belongs to you.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.010
No one will harm you in the slightest.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.890
I swear.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.630
That's all far in the future.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.070
Let's first

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.060
handle the immediate matters at hand

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.420
and enjoy the moonlight while we can.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.310
The moon is so full tonight.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.210
Because today is the 15th.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.310
I see.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.070
The

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.360
15th...

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.090
Yong'er.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:09.770
My lord.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.870
I haven't seen you for days.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.270
Why have you lost weight?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.740
Did something happen?

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.630
Nothing serious.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.070
Just today,

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.360
when Consort Zhuang and Consort Yu went to
pay respects to the Empress Dowager,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.020
I teased Consort Yu a few times

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.530
and was slapped by His Majesty.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.059
One must be careful

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.960
in the harem about everything these days.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.799
I'm scared...

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.890
Scared that one day...

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.630
You took such a great risk

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.440
to entrust your true feelings to me.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.500
As long as I am here,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.770
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.010
Actually, these few days,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.390
I've been carrying the sachet you gave me

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:00.960
on me.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:02.930
When I see it,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.950
it's like seeing you.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.480
We staked out an hour in advance

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.780
just to eavesdrop?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.320
This isn't just any eavesdropping.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.600
The book says

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.170
that their first date on a full moon night

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.910
laid the foundation for

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.200
years of cooperation between the leads.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.720
Do you remember how I died?

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.870
-Seriously—
-Stop complaining.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.330
I can't hear anything now.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:30.990
By the way,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.910
why hasn't Your Highness
sent any news for days?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.840
Are you busy with official duties?

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360
It's a long story.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.900
Why did they change locations again?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.880
Why did she leave just like this?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.550
Recently, the affairs at my residence
have been troublesome.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.410
I truly have little leisure time.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.170
It's related to the harem too.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.630
Actually, I risked coming to see you

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.960
because of this matter.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.670
The connection between women
in the harem and the court

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.490
is always about their family background.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.620
If it makes Your Highness so hesitant,

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.830
it must be either Consort Shu's brother

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.090
or Noble Consort Wei's father.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.510
You are indeed clever.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.150
It is indeed Grand Tutor Wei.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.080
Grand Tutor Wei.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.780
A key character has appeared.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.720
Grand Tutor Wei's son recently

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.550
trampled a commoner to death
with his horse in the street.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.550
The victim had come to the capital
to file an imperial complaint

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.150
against the Salt Inspector
from his hometown.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.360
Intercepting an imperial complaint

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.420
is a serious crime.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.750
The scoundrel knew he had committed
a terrible offense

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.910
that couldn't be undone,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.120
so he privately contacted Grand Tutor Wei.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.720
Grand Tutor Wei, eager to protect his son,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.520
managed to suppress the matter.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.030
Grand Tutor Wei
is the Empress Dowager's man.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.030
Noble Consort Wei

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.200
is also highly favored because of this.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.660
He is
the Empress Dowager's right-hand man.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.000
For years, he's been using
the Salt Transportation License

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.800
to amass wealth
and commit all kinds of evil deeds.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.250
What goes around

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.630
comes around.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.070
That's exactly how it's written
in the original novel?

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.200
Word for word.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.920
The author must be
an "Infernal Affairs" fan?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.170
Where's the straw mat for your lower body?

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.010
This imperial palace is too poor.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.010
Come in quickly.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.200
Your Highness need not say more.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.660
Tell me what you want to do.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.030
I want to take this opportunity
to eliminate Grand Tutor Wei

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.830
and bring justice to the people.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.510
But this matter is of great importance,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.320
and I haven't figured out a good plan yet.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.600
I know a good way.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.210
The Salt Inspector

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.270
once gave

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.720
Grand Tutor Wei a sarira as a bribe.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.750
-But he thought...
-Look. Is it beautiful?

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.550
It is just an ordinary red agate,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.080
so he gave it to his daughter,
Noble Consort Wei.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.320
How did you learn of this?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.280
It's a secret.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.070
Anyway,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.410
I will find a way to get it

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.120
to help you.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.530
Yong'er...

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.030
If that's true,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.760
you'll be doing me a great favor.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.480
What a jerk.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.280
Playing Xie Yong'er like a fool.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.330
You're really getting into
this eavesdropping.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.670
That relic they mentioned,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200
is it really true?

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.030
It should be real.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.610
Let's go.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.840
Xie Yong'er is willing to do anything—

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.480
even theft—for Prince Duan.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.910
She's really going all out.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:08.030
You stepped on my foot.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.960
I-I'm sorry.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.600
Who's there?

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.280
Your Majesty.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.250
Your Highness.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.360
Did His Majesty and Consort Yu

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.550
have a fight in the Imperial Garden?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.340
Why are you so gossipy?

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.120
I can't believe our plan
to drive them apart

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.320
actually...

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.790
Worked!

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.090
Who's there?

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.630
My Prince,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.650
it was me.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.750
He didn't report us.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.750
He even

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.120
covered for us.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.320
If I'd known I was so good at recruiting,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.140
I should have gone into HR.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.960
In that case,

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.150
Xu Yao switching sides

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.330
is just a matter of time.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.000
Taking down Prince Duan

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.080
is not far from succeeding.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.840
When Grand Tutor Wei is imprisoned,

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.600
Xu Yao will surely use the opportunity
to investigate his father's case.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.260
He might even sneak in
to question him directly.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.670
Then I should get there before him
to question him—

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.030
to take control of the situation.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.080
This Prince Duan

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.510
is not a fool.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080
Once he finds out,

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.030
Xu Yao might be in danger.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.600
Then I'll create

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.000
a new career change plan for him.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.930
He can get land allocation rewards

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.240
based on his own merit.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.840
Full benefits,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.270
annual leave, and paternity leave—

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.600
line them all up for him.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.360
Then I can't sleep here tonight.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:52.670
Why?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.870
Xie Yong'er is going to

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.550
go steal
Noble Consort Wei's sarira bead tomorrow.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.950
I need to be in the palace.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.860
Otherwise,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440
with no audience,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.040
who will the actors perform for?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.800
How about a couple more special drinks?

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.970
Nope. Drinking too much
will interfere with business.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.480
Help! There's a thief!

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.270
One.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:16.860
Two.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.000
Three.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:18.510
[Changning Palace]

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:18.850
Four.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:19.930
Five.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.700
Six.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:21.670
Seven.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.510
My Lady, bad news!

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.000
Two.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:24.880
Three.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.650
Four.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.570
Five.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.360
Six.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.550
My Lady!

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.630
Something valuable went missing
from Noble Consort Wei's palace.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.870
They're searching everywhere for it.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.600
Concubine Xie is also spreading rumors.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.480
She's saying you must be involved
in this matter.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.720
Isn't that a malicious accusation?

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.120
Eight.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.320
My Lady!

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:38.840
Two.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.510
Are you listening to me?

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:42.810
Five.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.080
Four.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.600
Three.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.080
Two.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.240
One.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.120
The treasure I've lost is priceless.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.180
Ten of your lives wouldn't be enough
for me to pay for it.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.790
You few, search the back courtyard.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.520
The rest of you, search inside.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.480
Your Highness, we haven't found anything.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.360
Useless fools.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.450
I'll search myself.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.570
Sister, let me help you.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.550
Nothing here?

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.610
Oh, Sister.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.710
Come quickly.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.150
There's a hidden compartment here.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.130
But I'm certain there's nothing inside.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.950
By the way, Sister.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.080
There are 10 more chests over there.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.200
There are 6 cabinets there

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.260
and 3 makeup boxes.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.110
Let's search them all carefully.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.630
[Changning Palace]

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.090
Sister!

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.440
Are you not going to search anymore?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.170
Hasn't anyone found anything?

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.050
All of you are useless!

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.200
Your Highness.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:55.860
We found it.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.370
There's a hidden compartment in here.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.440
Yu Wanyin.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.870
What do you have to say for yourself?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.329
Caught you red-handed.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.010
Guards!

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.210
Arrest her!

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.750
I'd like to see who dares.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.700
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.490
Shouldn't he be attending court
at this hour?

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:21.550
Surprised?

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.930
I left early.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.359
Your Majesty.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.520
Please don't blame Lady Wei.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.030
She lost a rare treasure.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.480
She's too anxious.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.310
that's why she's

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.510
blindly taking her anger out on me.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.280
Your Majesty.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.590
Don't listen to her nonsense.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:42.520
I have evidence.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.290
Someone saw a young eunuch

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.270
steal my agate,

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.400
and deliver it to Consort Yu's palace.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.200
Bring it here!

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.030
Your Majesty!

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.000
Is this your so-called evidence?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.880
This is impossible.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.940
It was clearly a...

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.070
It was clearly a precious pearl.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.530
How did it turn into a date?

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.830
After all, it was given
to my beloved consort by the Grand Tutor.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.440
I imagine

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.800
it must be extremely valuable.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.070
I won't stop you.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.090
I'll even help you.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.810
Let's continue searching together.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.000
What's happening?

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.790
Why all this commotion?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.160
Empress Dowager.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.560
I heard that

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.510
Noble Consort Wei lost
an extremely precious jewelry.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.770
So early this morning,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.440
she went to Consort Yu's place

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.440
to search for it.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.680
It's just a piece of jewelry.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.590
Is that worth making such a fuss?

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.680
I also find it strange, Your Highness.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.240
Though the Consort's rank is high,

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.110
she isn't actually favored.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.640
Yet His Majesty

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.460
is willing to search the palace

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.110
for her.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.500
You're saying this matter
even involved the Emperor?

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.270
Yes.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.640
Something isn't right.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.830
Something's suspicious.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.930
Your Highness.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.880
How's it going on outside?

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.210
I've found out, My Lady.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.160
Noble Consort Wei

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.790
didn't find the red agate
in Consort Yu's quarters.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.920
They didn't find it?

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.350
Are you certain you personally

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.160
gave it to someone from her palace?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.360
Absolutely certain.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.200
I even saw that young eunuch

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.830
enter Changning Palace with my own eyes.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:51.960
That's impossible.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.350
Oh, Your Highness.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.190
This food was sent by Consort Yu.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.680
Sending food at a time like this?

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.450
Your Highness.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.550
Why would she

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:08.920
only send steamed buns?

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.230
How...

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:19.880
How...

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.240
How did the red agate end up here?

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.030
Was this food box sent

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.570
before the palace search

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.550
or after?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.380
Shortly after the search.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.110
Are you sure?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.200
I'm certain.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.880
The guards had just left.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.080
I was quite flustered

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.930
and almost dropped the box
when receiving it.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.650
If this box was sent after the search,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.770
it means she wasn't trying to frame me.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.930
It also shows she knows I did this.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.030
Yet, not only didn't she report me,

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.230
she even returned it.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.400
Could it be that when she came last time,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.460
she genuinely wanted to befriend me?

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.590
A 2D character

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.070
couldn't possibly be this magnanimous.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.730
Or perhaps,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.880
because I changed the original storyline,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.350
a butterfly effect was caused?

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.880
She never had the chance
to fall in love with Prince Duan,

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.410
so she never had the opportunity
to turn evil.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.840
Wait.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.880
If she didn't turn evil,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.790
then the biggest villain in this story

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.190
would be me, wouldn't it?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.510
Your Highness.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.400
What should we do

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.200
with this red agate now?

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.350
I've summoned all ministers today

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.030
to ask about

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.790
the preparations

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.100
for the Grand Longevity Banquet.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:53.920
May I ask, Your Majesty,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.820
are you referring to last year's
or this year's?

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.530
This year's, of course.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.400
Your Majesty's birthday from last year

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.590
was just over a month ago.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.240
This year's Grand Longevity Banquet

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.200
[Chief of the State Ceremonial Bureau]

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.060
has not yet been

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.000
scheduled by us, Your Majesty.

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.390
Seems like the Ministry of Rites

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.220
is not doing anything.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.800
Your Majesty!

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.110
Your Majesty.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.910
Your Majesty.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.470
The agate has been found.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.250
It's just a small agate.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.370
There's nothing special about it.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.250
Why does Noble Consort Wei

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.110
value it so highly?

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.410
Your Majesty doesn't know.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.250
It's not an ordinary agate.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.880
It's a sarira that the Qiang State

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.550
specially presented to Your Majesty

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.610
for your birthday.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.000
It's a priceless treasure.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.400
This was presented to me?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.480
Why haven't I seen it before?

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.590
Your Majesty,

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.680
I know all the gift records

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.960
by heart.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.070
There's absolutely no mistake.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:18.730
This...

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.880
Perhaps

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.530
Your Majesty gave it to Noble Consort Wei?

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.720
Grand Tutor Wei,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.110
did I

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.270
give this to Noble Consort Wei?

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.000
Impossible!

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.830
Your Majesty,

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.630
this couldn't possibly belong
to my daughter.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:34.720
Perhaps

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.000
it looks similar

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.640
and the palace servants made a mistake.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.700
If that's the case,

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.960
let Noble Consort Wei
come and identify it herself.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.020
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.770
I'll summon her right away.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:50.030
What?

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.890
You're saying Noble Consort Wei's

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.400
lost red agate

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.200
was found in our pond?

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.760
And it's a sarira bead
offered by the Qiang State?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.580
Yes.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.720
His Majesty was furious when he found out.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.850
I heard he's already ordered Eunuch An

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.250
to bring Noble Consort Wei to identify it.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.040
This is not good.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.510
If Noble Consort Wei admits

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.790
this is what she lost,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.070
then the crime of hiding tribute items

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.800
could lead to
the execution of her entire family.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Empress Dowager,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.770
if we don't stop this now,
it will be too late.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.680
No.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200
Something's off.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.990
This tribute item was

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.160
found in my quarters.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.640
Everyone at court knows
who Grand Tutor Wei is loyal to.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.110
If I go there now,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.830
wouldn't it basically be
announcing to everyone

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.200
that I'm the mastermind behind this?

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.950
Sorry for not realizing it beforehand.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:53.950
You...

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.240
Oh, my God...

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:56.730
These...

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200
These two guys are

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.880
good for nothing

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.640
but trouble.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.550
Fools! Fools!

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.290
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.600
My dear, please rise.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.440
My dear, come and see

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.850
if what I've found is

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.880
what you lost.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.200
Your Majesty,

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.880
this is indeed the agate I lost.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.880
Where did you find it, Your Majesty?

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.340
In the pond
at the Empress Dowager's palace.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.720
How could that be?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.510
My dear, please look carefully.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.750
Don't mistake something

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.410
that isn't yours for your own.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.810
How could I be mistaken?

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:59.290
This was my birthday gift from my father.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.920
I had been wearing it all the time.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.510
This agate even has

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.680
my childhood nickname
carved on its bottom.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.240
Shut up!

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.920
You foolish girl!

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.350
You don't even know

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.790
when it was switched,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.850
yet you dare talk such nonsense here!

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.400
As precious as this item is,

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.640
how could it have been switched?

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.500
Father, what on earth is going on?

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.520
Your Majesty,

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.440
I'd like to expose
Grand Tutor Wei's corruption.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.640
[Vice Minister Wu]

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.550
He allowed his son to accept bribes

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.680
and ride recklessly in the streets,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.440
killing a commoner
who was filing a petition!

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.440
His crimes are too numerous to list.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.210
This is complete nonsense!

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.670
Who put you up to this

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.790
to frame me?

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.510
If my son

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.590
truly committed such serious crimes,

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.030
I

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.730
would never cover for him!

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.720
Your Majesty,

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.400
I'm telling the truth!

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.400
Truth?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680
Do you have evidence?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.400
I do.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.900
[I want to charge the Salt Inspector]

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.030
[with selling Salt Transportation

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.270
Blocked petitions,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.010
engaged in corruption,

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.920
accepted bribes,

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.400
and hoarded tribute items.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.170
Grand Tutor Wei,

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.110
it seems that you're not content
with being my father-in-law.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.400
You even want my throne, huh?

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.200
I wouldn't dare.

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:15.510
[Mu Yun]

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.310
Your Majesty,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.650
may I request

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:20.410
the Empress Dowager's presence?

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440
I promise

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.400
I will come clean.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.000
On my way here with Noble Consort Wei,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.680
I noticed the lights
in the Empress Dowager's palace were out.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.240
I think

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.610
the Empress Dowager

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.730
went to rest early
to avoid being disturbed.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.790
In that case,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.670
I have to send Grand Tutor Wei

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.590
to the Court of Revision.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.750
[Yongyan Hall]

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.080
That's total bullshit!

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.400
Noble Consort Wei
wears that sarira agate every day.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.000
How could you not know about that?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.640
Stop!

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.400
The way you talked was way too modern!

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.330
Can you please stick to the script?

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.750
You've revised it so many times.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.950
Who can remember all those lines, miss?

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.590
It's my first time directing.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.140
I'm a bit nervous, too.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.410
No worries.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.350
I'm a CEO.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.270
Manipulating employees is

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.330
easy-peasy for me.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.950
To deal with Grand Tutor Wei,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.760
I can simply improvise on the spot.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:21.270
What about Xu Yao?

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.110
You must make sure he's present.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.440
He's so concerned about anything

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.680
related to Senior Minister Xu.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.920
So he rushed to the Court of Revision
as soon as he

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.830
got the news.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:31.760
That's good.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.590
Is Xu Yao really that important?

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.550
Of course!

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.910
In the original story,
he's a legendary minister.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.030
Only with his help

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.880
can we defeat Prince Duan

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.730
and make you a good emperor.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.550
Besides,

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.240
that young man is so handsome.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.260
Can you bear to see him
deceived and utilized by others?

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:53.750
I knew it.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.080
All right,

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.030
since you're ready,

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.090
you may set off now.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.680
Come on!

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.960
What are you waiting for?

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.360
Hurry!

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.790
I'll wait for your good news
in the library.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.390
Good luck!

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.760
Your Majesty.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.070
Your Majesty!

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.780
I've been wronged!

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.790
I was only focused
on easing your burdens, Your Majesty.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.830
It was those villains who set me up.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:29.960
Are you saying

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.930
I've wronged you for the issue

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.560
regarding the sarira agate?

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.990
I wouldn't dare say that.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:35.760
It's just...

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.200
It's just that there's more
behind the issue about that sarira agate.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.460
My son brought it home.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.000
My daughter liked its bright color

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.280
and asked for it.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.030
I had no idea it was so valuable!

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.030
I see.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.640
So everything was

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.550
done by your son and daughter.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.570
Fine.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.250
I'll release you immediately

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.930
and imprison them instead.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.720
That's not what I meant.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.720
Then you mean

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:08.930
you did everything yourself?

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.310
You deceived me?

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.840
That's not what I meant either.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.920
Neither this nor that.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.880
Then how exactly
did today's incident happen?

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.080
My daughter lost her jewelry
at a rather suspicious time.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.370
Also, Vice Minister Wu

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.690
and the Capital Prefect

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.110
[I want to charge the Salt Inspector]

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.030
carried the so-called evidence with them.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.380
[with selling Salt Transportation
and Sales Licenses for personal gain.]

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.680
Your Majesty, you wouldn't believe

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.730
that they didn't plan this
in advance, would you?

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.480
Then I'm even more confused now.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.440
Vice Minister Wu and the Capital Prefect

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.300
have no regular contact with you.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.720
Why would they set up
such an elaborate trap

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.550
to get you?

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.200
Yeah!

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.660
They all work for Prince Duan!

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.020
Prince Duan...

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.180
Could it be Prince Duan trying to harm me?

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.890
Why would Prince Duan want to harm me?

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.550
Do you know

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.550
that among Prince Duan's counselors,

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:21.010
there is one called Xu Yao?

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.000
Xu Yao?

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.240
He's still alive?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.720
Back then,

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:28.930
Senior Minister Xu's case was

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.560
orchestrated by you, right?

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.240
Yes.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.040
But at that time,

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.930
it was all Prince Duan's idea.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.160
What a coincidence.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.240
The hunting dog is cooked
after the rabbit is caught.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.770
The bow is put away
when the birds are all gone.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.240
He used you

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.680
and then abandoned you,

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160
saving

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.920
your enemy,

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.960
Xu Yao.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.800
He also made Xu Yao see you
as his lifelong nemesis.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.350
My brother is

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.590
so horrible.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.030
First, he used you

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.060
to eliminate Senior Minister Xu.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.240
Then he used Xu Yao

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.350
to get rid of you.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.350
He truly kept it fair to both sides

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.960
like no one else in this world.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.110
I also know

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.390
why you joined
the Empress Dowager's faction.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.610
You studied hard since childhood

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.940
with lofty ambitions.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.480
But...

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.060
Your talents went unrecognized.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.830
By chance,

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.170
Prince Duan valued
me as someone with potential

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.790
and gave me an opportunity.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:44.070
He privately persuaded me

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.000
to impeach Senior Minister Xu

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.570
and cooperate with him

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.040
to fabricate flawless evidence of crimes.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.000
Fortune favors the bold.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.510
I won my gamble!

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.440
I not only gained merit
with the Empress Dowager

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.300
but also won Prince Duan's trust.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.070
From then on,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.030
my career soared.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.320
Among all the court officials,

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.270
only you

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.640
could play both sides

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.840
with such stability.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.240
You've been working

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.000
for both of them.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.830
Only I, the Emperor...

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.160
I am

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.440
so sinful and deserve to die.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.480
Your Majesty,

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.400
I know

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.690
that I can not survive this.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.030
I just want to know

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.480
how you learned about this, Your Majesty.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:00.360
Stand up.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.340
I just guessed.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:17.960
Just guessed?

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.090
Your Highness.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.800
How did Xu Yao

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.880
get into the Court of Revision?

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.320
According to the guards,

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.250
he entered with an imperial token.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.000
Oh, Xu Yao...

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.150
I'm afraid you're

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.110
going to lose this game.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.280
Who's there?

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.400
I need to see Her Highness
for something urgent.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.400
Without His Majesty's decree,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.860
no one is allowed to enter.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.300
Your Highness!

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.370
Your Highness!

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.440
Xu Yao?

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.830
Why is he here?

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.280
Let him in now.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.190
Yes.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:23.740
Please.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.480
Mr. Xu?

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.480
What brings you here?

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.340
Your Highness,

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.840
I need to see His Majesty
for some urgent matters.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.100
Could you please help me, Your Highness?

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.630
Mei, go invite His Majesty over.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.360
Understood.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.870
What's wrong?

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.480
Is someone after you?

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.610
Don't worry.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.760
You're absolutely safe here.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.620
Your Highness,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.010
it's really urgent.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.630
If it's about Senior Minister Xu,

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.890
I think I know about it.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:56.190
Your Highness,
you truly have His Majesty's favor.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.320
I was investigating

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.440
my father's wrongful conviction.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.320
I found all the evidence
pointed to Prince Duan all of a sudden.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:02.850
Just now,

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.570
I returned to my room

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.890
and took a sip of tea.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.270
I noticed a weird taste, felt

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.000
a burning pain in my stomach,

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.440
and realized I was poisoned.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.500
You were poisoned?

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.880
Let's go find the imperial physician.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.590
Your Highness,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.630
since Prince Duan wants me dead,
I have no chance of survival.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.150
So,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.400
I pretended to know nothing,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.110
snuck out through the back door,

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.170
and temporarily escaped
Prince Duan's secret guards.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.960
With no way to meet His Majesty,

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.360
I could only come to the library

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.360
to ask for your help, Your Highness.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.440
Xu Yao!

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.440
I know my sins are grave.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.290
But before I die, I have only one request.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.280
I've worked for Prince Duan for years,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.800
and I know all his crimes.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.410
If His Majesty can save my father,

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.040
I, Xu Yao,

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.340
will surely repay this kindness!

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.650
Don't worry.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.760
His Majesty is a man of his word.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.090
Senior Minister Xu is already on his way
back to the capital.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.920
Is that true?

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.610
That's wonderful.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.330
My father

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.280
has always hoped

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.230
that His Majesty could be a good emperor.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.030
If he returns,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.960
he will certainly serve
with absolute loyalty,

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.880
using all his knowledge
to assist His Majesty,

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.030
making His Majesty...

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.440
Xu Yao!

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.070
Don't worry.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.000
His Majesty values
Senior Minister Xu's talents greatly,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.530
and he values yours as well.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.480
Also, His Majesty

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.360
has already arranged a way out for you.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.360
He wants you to safely switch sides.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.840
Let's get out of here first, alright?

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.370
Let's go.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.360
I'm afraid

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:38.270
I won't be able to see His Majesty today.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:41.900
[Library]

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.760
Fire! Come and help put it out!

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:01.360
Someone please help!

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.690
It's on fire?

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.490
Let's go!

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.160

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:11.680
Go.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.070
Get up!

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.970
Your Highness,

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:26.910
it's too late.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.110
I've recorded all

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.590
of Prince Duan's plans in a book

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.030
and buried it under the window
of his mansion's back kitchen.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.590
Don't go looking for it right away.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.960
Wait at least 7 days.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:35.880
Stop this talk.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.910
Let's get out first.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:37.440
Let's go.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.030
Run.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.170
Don't look back for whoever you meet.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.630
Stay alive.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:58.840
Xu Yao!

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:00.570

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.140
Xu Yao,

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:05.440

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.680
I heard the library caught fire.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.130
I've sent my guards to put out the fire.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.360
Fortunately, Her Highness is blessed
with good luck.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.660
Are you hurt anywhere,

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.960
Your Highness?

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.010
Your Highness,

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.770
I don't think this is appropriate.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:39.830
It's an emergency.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.760
I'm simply escorting Her Highness
back to the palace.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:50.410
Your Highness!

Let me go with you.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.510
No need for help here.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.960
Please fetch the imperial physician,
Your Highness.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:07.150
All right.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.010
Why are you trembling so much,
Your Highness?

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.340
Are you scared of heights,

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.020
worried about falling down these steps?

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.110
If you're scared,

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.110
you can hold onto me tightly.

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.240
It's just the gusts.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.920
They're making me feel chilly.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.540
Your Highness, I hope you and I can remain

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:43.240
as we were when we first met,

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.000

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.480
without distance.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.480
Do you know

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.890
serving the emperor is
like living with a tiger?

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.760
Instead of fearing me,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.230
you should fear His Majesty.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.800
That's much better.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.940
After all, Grand Tutor Wei's collusion
with the Salt Inspector is

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:18.000
an open secret throughout the court.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.090
Yet His Majesty has kept ignoring it.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.660
To exonerate the Salt Inspector,

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.850
they've exploited
the common people and sold

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.210
Salt Transportation and Sales Licenses
privately to line their own pockets,

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.200

who wrote petitions in blood

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.280
could only die from their lashings.

this world

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.200
has suffered from tyranny for too long.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.990
What are you talking about, Your Highness?

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.710
I don't understand.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.440
