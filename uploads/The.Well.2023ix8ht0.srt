1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:54,690
Can I sit here?

4
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:55,490
Sorry?

5
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,038
Is this free?

6
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,357
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

7
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:00,487
Absolutely. Have a seat.

8
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:01,317
Thank you.

9
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:02,987
Yeah, sure.

10
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:03,817
Sorry.

11
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:06,137
Thanks.

12
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:09,167
So, you're American too?

13
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,276
Oh, yeah.

14
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,497
I'm from Philadelphia originally.

15
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:13,937
I'm Tracy.

16
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:15,496
Oh, Lisa.

17
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,056
Hi.
- My name is Tony.

18
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:17,886
Hi, Tony.

19
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,596
Madison.

20
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:21,466
Madison, hi.

21
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:24,436
Where are you all going?

22
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,266
Sambuci.

23
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:28,756
I am also going to Sambuci.

24
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:29,586
Really?
- Yeah.

25
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,185
What are you doing there?

26
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:32,565
I'm a restorer.

27
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:34,163
I restore paintings.

28
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:36,015
Well, what about you guys?

29
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,175
We're biologists,

30
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,995
and we're going to observe
the local fauna.

31
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,195
That's fascinating.

32
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:43,785
I'm their Italian guide,

33
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:46,395
and I take care of all the technical
stuff.

34
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,984
And what do I do?

35
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,755
I carry their bags.

36
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:50,735
Yeah.

37
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:51,565
Got it.

38
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,059
Yeah.

39
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:39,831
[Italian] Thank you.

40
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,801
Well, I'm heading towards
the centre of town.

41
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:52,971
You can follow us.

42
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,200
We can walk part of the way together.

43
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,890
Okay, great.

44
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:02,710
You guys must really love what you do

45
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,690
to be willing to travel all over for it.

46
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,870
I could say the same thing about you.

47
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,270
You don't come to a place like this

48
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,669
if you're not passionate about your work.

49
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,170
You're not wrong about that.

50
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,509
Well, my hotel is that way.

51
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:33,038
Where are you guys staying?

52
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,838
We'll put down our tents at
the edge of the woods

53
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:37,389
where we'll, you know, shoot
some footage and stuff.

54
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:39,298
So we'll already be on location tomorrow.

55
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,178
I don't know if you guys
have some days off,

56
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,368
if you maybe want to like, hang out.

57
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:48,458
Well, we should be done in a few days,

58
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,437
and then we'll come see you.

59
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:52,548
I would love that.

60
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,647
Good luck.
- Thanks.

61
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,127
Good luck to you guys.

62
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:01,957
Bye.

63
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:03,097
See ya.
- Bye.

64
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,097
Bye.
- Bye.

65
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:28,385
[Italian] Miss, the bus is gone.

66
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:30,656
Sorry?

67
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,125
[Italian] Oh, you don't speak Italian.

68
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:37,025
Sorry, the bus, it doesn't work anymore.

69
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:38,375
Oh, really?

70
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,205
- Yes.

71
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,075
But where are you going?

72
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,134
- The Malvizi mansion?

73
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:45,035
- Ah, okay.

74
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,434
Well, I'm going to work right now,

75
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:50,014
so I can help, maybe.

76
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:51,304
Oh, no, you don't have to.

77
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:52,545
It's okay.
- No, no, please, please.

78
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,314
It's okay, I'll take your...

79
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,354
Okay.
- Okay?

80
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:56,464
Yes. Thank you.

81
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:02,224
My name is Marcus, by the way.

82
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:03,054
I'm Lisa.

83
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:05,423
Ah. Nice to meet you.

84
00:07:05,423 --> 00:07:06,353
Nice to meet you.

85
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:07,183
I can carry...

86
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,014
No, no, no, no.

87
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:09,063
It's okay. Please.

88
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,173
Okay.
- Go?

89
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:11,063
Yeah.

90
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:16,683
So, what is a girl like you
doing in Sambuci?

91
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,222
I'm restoring a painting.

92
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:21,482
Ah, wow.

93
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,312
Impressive.

94
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:24,742
So you are an important person, no?

95
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,902
Not exactly.

96
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,272
My dad is the important person.

97
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,102
Ah.

98
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:33,632
It's his restoration studio.

99
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,072
Here we are.

100
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,491
It's the palazzo Malvizi.

101
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:39,852
It's enchanting.

102
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:41,101
Yes, yes.

103
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:45,392
Do you know, it's a very
beautiful and ancient mansion.

104
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:49,981
You know, the most important
nobles in all of Lazio,

105
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:51,300
they used to live there.

106
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,130
Seriously?

107
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,041
Yes, seriously.

108
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:54,711
It's beautiful.

109
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:56,391
Wow.

110
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,350
There it is.

111
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,989
That's the entrance, right there.

112
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,300
Wow.

113
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,229
Well, here's hoping it goes well.

114
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,759
Oh, yes. It will.

115
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,869
You'll see.

116
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:28,229
The widow, Malvizi, she's very nice.

117
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:32,729
She's from a different time,
but she's very nice.

118
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,559
Okay.

119
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,948
Well, that's good to hear.

120
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:35,778
Yeah.

121
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:38,418
Well, thank you.

122
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,198
Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.

123
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,548
Yeah, yeah.

124
00:08:41,548 --> 00:08:43,708
Maybe I'll see you around?

125
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,537
Yes, yes.

126
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,698
I think you will, because actually,
I run this pub.

127
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:49,648
So you know, if you have time,

128
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,177
I would love for you to come by.

129
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:52,167
Yeah.

130
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,277
If I have time.

131
00:08:53,277 --> 00:08:54,148
Oh, yes, of course.

132
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:55,167
Okay.
- Okay.

133
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:57,037
[Italian] Bye.

134
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:57,877
Bye.

135
00:08:57,877 --> 00:08:59,577
[Italian] Bye.

136
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,416
Good morning.

137
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,646
It's a pleasure to meet you.

138
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:27,415
I'm Emma Fosca Malvizi.

139
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:28,465
You must be Lisa.

140
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:29,485
Yes, Lisa Gray.

141
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,165
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

142
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,485
The pleasure is mine.

143
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,905
The daughter of the maestro Gray?

144
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:35,745
Yeah.

145
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:36,865
Did you have a good trip?

146
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:37,694
Yeah.

147
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,084
It was a little long, but it went well.

148
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:39,915
Thank you.

149
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,335
Excellent, so.

150
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,165
Come.

151
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,454
Let me show you the work
that needs to be done.

152
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:45,284
It's upstairs.
- Okay

153
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,464
Follow me

154
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:47,295
Oh, yeah.

155
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,364
Coming.

156
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,343
You can leave the bag here.

157
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:08,903
Oh, okay. Great.

158
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:12,473
So, this is the painting.

159
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,592
A fire broke out from the fireplace,

160
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:18,683
and luckily we acted promptly, but...

161
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:22,222
So the painting wasn't burned,
but it ended up like this.

162
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,052
I see.

163
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,163
And who's the artist?

164
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:26,452
Arcano.

165
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:29,122
An artist from the 1500s.

166
00:10:29,122 --> 00:10:32,722
Not well known, but revered
by connoisseurs

167
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:36,261
due to his innovative way
of painting the unknown.

168
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,762
Well, restoring it won't be easy.

169
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:43,281
The canvas is completely blackened.

170
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:45,501
That's why I turned to the best studio.

171
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,971
I'll do my best, but it'll take time.

172
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:51,681
Normally, a painting of this size

173
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,510
would take at least a month.

174
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,350
So, two weeks-

175
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,781
Time is a real enemy.

176
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,420
In two weeks, it has to be finished.

177
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,980
It'll take part in an exclusive
auction in London,

178
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,830
and there are very important
sums at stake.

179
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,189
Your father didn't warn
you of the urgency?

180
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,380
Of course.

181
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,329
I'll get started immediately.

182
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,649
Good.

183
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,230
And I'd like to sleep in this room?

184
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,689
It's the best way for me to
get acquainted with the work.

185
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:21,769
Yes, of course.

186
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,278
As you wish.

187
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:25,108
Great.

188
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,019
I'll see you later.

189
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,769
Thank you, Duchess.

190
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:45,487
What did they do to you?

191
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,238
Okay, let's get you shiny again.

Who are you?

199
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,726
What was that?

200
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:23,395
Sounded like Tony.

201
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:28,295
Tony?

202
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:30,915
Tony?

203
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:38,805
Tony?

204
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:46,434
Tony?

205
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:52,434
I'm going to go look for him.

206
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:53,504
Okay, no, no

207
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:54,984
Wait, wait, wait

208
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,403
Hey, hey

209
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,873
Don't worry.

210
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,203
Stay here, okay?

211
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:01,333
Tony!

212
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:04,653
Tony!

213
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:09,483
Tony!

214
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:12,212
Are you okay?

215
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:29,241
Tony?

216
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:34,041
Tony!

217
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:47,771
Tony!

218
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:07,900
What the fuck?

219
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:18,909
What's going on?

220
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:19,949
We need to go to the police.

221
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,168
Why? What happened to Tony?

222
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:23,249
Something bad.

223
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,079
Okay.

224
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,248
Madi!

225
00:17:32,248 --> 00:17:33,158
Madi! Madi!

226
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:38,578
Madi!

227
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:48,374
Who are you?

228
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,574
Where the fuck are we?

229
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:08,422
Madi. Madi.

230
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,033
Madi. Madi.

231
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,292
Madi, where are you?

232
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,272
Tracy? Tracy?

233
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:15,102
Over here.

234
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:23,641
What's going on?

235
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:24,702
Where are we?

236
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:25,532
Try to stay calm.

237
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,362
Where are we?

238
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,741
Try to stay calm.

239
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:28,581
What?

240
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,910
Tony? Tony?

241
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,160
Tony, Tony.

242
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,990
We're here, we're here

243
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:01,319
[Italian] Shit!

244
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:12,739
Am I disturbing you?

245
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:14,359
Oh, not at all. Come on in.

246
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,958
I'm just finishing up for today.

247
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,428
Well, for a first day's work

248
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:24,888
I would say we're on the right track.

249
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:28,698
The colors look more beautiful than ever.

250
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:30,228
Well, thank you.

251
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:34,818
The blackened layer is extremely thick,
as you know.

252
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,147
So I'm doing my best to remove
it quickly, but carefully,

253
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:41,208
as not to damage the painting
with the solvents.

254
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,817
I must confess that when your
father told me

255
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,197
he couldn't come in person,

256
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,117
I was really worried.

257
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:51,857
But I was wrong.

258
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:54,346
You're really worthy of his name.

259
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,737
Thank you.

260
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:58,886
I won't disappoint you.

261
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:00,706
I hope not.

262
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:04,336
Will you be dining with us tonight?

263
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:06,676
You can meet my daughter Julia.

264
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:08,895
I think I actually saw her today.

265
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:10,966
A young girl with long hair?

266
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,346
Yes, that's her.

267
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:13,176
Yeah.

268
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:14,525
She was singing something...

269
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:19,485
Well, I tried approaching
her, but she ran away.

270
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:20,315
I know.

271
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:22,905
She's shy and she's quite uneasy
with people

272
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:23,865
she doesn't know.

273
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:26,895
You need a little patience.

274
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:28,185
Yeah, sure. Of course.

275
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,074
So, we dine at nine.

276
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,095
Downstairs.

277
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:34,995
See you at nine.

278
00:21:57,803 --> 00:22:00,073
You like it?

279
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:01,473
It's delicious, thank you.

280
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:03,612
I'm glad you like it.

281
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:08,622
When did you start doing restorations?

282
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,562
I was very young.

283
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:15,252
I would watch my father
work for hours, you know?

284
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:19,001
Admiring these beautiful
pieces he'd bring to life.

285
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:25,331
To observe is the best way to learn.

286
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,171
Absolutely.

287
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,681
So, Julia, what grade are you in?

288
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,980
Did I say something wrong?

289
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,260
No, no, no.

290
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,920
It's not your fault.

291
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:04,269
Unfortunately, my daughter suffers

292
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:07,509
from a severe personality disorder,

293
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,128
and I had to stop sending her to school.

294
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:15,699
I'm so sorry.

295
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:16,898
I had no idea.

296
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:21,459
If you don't mind me asking,
what does she suffer from?

297
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:23,978
She doesn't get along with
anyone her age.

298
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:27,818
It's a difficult situation.

299
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:33,007
It's like she doesn't accept being 13.

300
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:33,837
Of course.

301
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:34,957
I get it.

302
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:36,848
I was the same way when I was her age.

303
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,507
I was in such a hurry to grow up.

304
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:47,197
There are people who yearn to grow up,

305
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:50,196
and people who yearn to stop time.

306
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,426
Time's been incredibly kind
to you, Duchess.

307
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:56,446
You're gorgeous.

308
00:23:59,226 --> 00:24:00,126
Thank you, dear.

309
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:07,476
Well, I'm actually feeling kind
of tired, so...

310
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:08,306
Oh.

311
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:09,306
Maybe I can go to bed,

312
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:13,115
and I'd want to get an early
start tomorrow anyway.

313
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:15,425
Oh. Of course.

314
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:16,475
Good night.

315
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:18,025
And thank you for your company.

316
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:20,025
Thank you, Duchess.

317
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,502
[Italian] What the fuck is this?

318
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:25,481
[Italian] Open the door, eh?

319
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:41,790
Don't look at him.

320
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,130
[Italian] Open the door, right?

321
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,031
[Italian] Can you open the door?

322
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,670
[Italian] Open the door for me.

323
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,320
[Italian] Open this fucking door!

324
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:52,460
[Italian] Open the door!

325
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,460
[Italian] Open this fucking door!

326
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,179
Shut up!

327
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,909
[Italian] Fuck you, asshole!

328
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:00,910
[Italian] Open this fucking door!

329
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:02,909
[Italian] Psychopath!

330
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,349
Shut up, are you crazy?

331
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:08,249
[Italian] Open it!!!

332
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:48,996
[Italian] Open the door asshole.

333
00:26:56,596 --> 00:26:57,936
[Italian] Holy shit!

334
00:26:59,056 --> 00:27:00,145
[Italian] Fuck!

335
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:13,185
[Italian] Listen to me, open the door.

336
00:27:13,475 --> 00:27:15,375
[Italian] I kill you!

337
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:22,774
Oh my God!

338
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,222
Stop, stop.

339
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:15,211
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

340
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:23,321
No!

341
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:26,971
No, no, no!

342
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,051
Stop, please!

343
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,350
Don't!

344
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,931
No, no, no.

345
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,679
Please, please, stop!

346
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,089
Stop, please, please, please!

347
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,429
Tony!

348
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:14,608
Tony!

349
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,768
I hate you! I hate you!

350
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:22,898
What's going on?

351
00:30:59,262 --> 00:31:00,092
Fuck!

352
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,590
Hey.

353
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,110
Sir?

354
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,110
Sir, excuse me, you can't be here.

355
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,749
Sir!

356
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,160
Dad?

357
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:56,459
Dad?

358
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,058
I should never have trusted you.

359
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:12,008
What are you doing?

360
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,538
Dad?

361
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:17,138
No.

362
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:17,968
No, Dad.

363
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,528
Dad, what are you doing?

364
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:25,257
Dad, stop!

365
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:48,416
Dad?

366
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:00,956
What are you doing?

367
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,535
Fuck!

368
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:06,475
There's a passage.

369
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:08,615
A passage.

370
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:10,715
I was trying to force this grate, but...

371
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:12,934
This piece of broke!

372
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,034
If I make it down there,
I'll go and get help.

373
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:24,154
Try using this.

374
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:52,883
Okay.

375
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:57,162
Come on.

376
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:15,252
Tracy.

377
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:20,721
We'll get out of here.

378
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:21,561
I promise.

379
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:52,059
Run away...

380
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:53,419
While you still can.

381
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:54,248
Julia.

382
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:56,059
Jesus, you scared me.

383
00:37:57,649 --> 00:37:59,088
This painting is cursed.

384
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:01,728
It contains evil.

385
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,318
What are you talking about?

386
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:09,648
She's a witch.

387
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:11,868
Her name is Dorca.

388
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:15,257
She's always living in this house.

389
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,158
Who told you all this?

390
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:24,978
If you give life to this canvas,
you'll be haunted.

391
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:26,957
It will curse you.

392
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,037
Forever.

393
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,266
Oh, thank you.

394
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,266
Of course.

395
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,585
You look worried.

396
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:05,685
Is it work?

397
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:07,775
It's more than that.

398
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,315
What is it?

399
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:15,334
The painting.

400
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:24,103
I've been having these
horrible nightmares,

401
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:27,704
and they feel so vivid.

402
00:39:27,704 --> 00:39:31,273
So vivid they feel like they're real.

403
00:39:40,632 --> 00:39:45,532
I think maybe you are just
a little bit overwhelmed.

404
00:39:46,932 --> 00:39:51,552
I mean, you're in a foreign country,
you're tired.

405
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,152
You have so many expectations on yourself.

406
00:39:56,502 --> 00:39:59,832
But you are going to do great.

407
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,471
And your father, he is going
to be so proud of you.

408
00:40:03,522 --> 00:40:04,352
You'll see.

409
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,752
My father is...

410
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:13,751
He's difficult.

411
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:18,751
How so?

412
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:21,521
He's always been strict.

413
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,200
You know, hard on me.

414
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,450
But deep down, he knows
that you are so good.

415
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,030
Because you are here.

416
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,730
Okay?

417
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,780
If not, he would've sent somebody else.

418
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:40,249
There is no one else.

419
00:42:47,302 --> 00:42:48,132
Tracy.

420
00:42:50,462 --> 00:42:51,552
If he dies...

421
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:54,342
We're done for.

422
00:42:58,942 --> 00:42:59,782
Hey!

423
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:06,642
You're a fucking filthy monster,
killing innocent people!

424
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,461
No, no, no, no, no.

425
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:15,291
No, no.

426
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,620
I'm not scared of you, motherfucker!

427
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,810
Sir, please!

428
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,370
No, no, no, leave her!

429
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:52,429
No, no, no, please.

430
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:23,427
Stop!

431
00:44:28,686 --> 00:44:29,517
No...

432
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:31,527
No!

433
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:50,995
No, no, no.

434
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:51,915
No, please.

435
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:56,465
Please, just stop it!

436
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:57,455
Stop!

437
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:58,565
Stop it!

438
00:44:58,565 --> 00:44:59,874
Let her go!

439
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:01,155
No!

440
00:45:01,155 --> 00:45:05,524
Enough!

441
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:06,444
No! Please!

442
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:49,306
Oh, Madison.

443
00:47:57,141 --> 00:47:57,981
What?

444
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:00,594
Julia, I was...

445
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,465
Are you okay?

446
00:48:09,614 --> 00:48:11,834
I was hoping we could
talk about the painting,

447
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:14,474
but it's obviously not a good time.

448
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:26,134
Do you want to, maybe talk about it?

449
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,193
Whatever.

450
00:48:51,732 --> 00:48:53,441
That'll be you someday.

451
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:56,172
And sooner than you think.

452
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:00,971
Yeah, I doubt that.

453
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,201
Of course it will.

454
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:05,181
It's just how life works.

455
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,731
He's the one who never wants
to see me ever again.

456
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,560
What's going on exactly?

457
00:49:30,129 --> 00:49:31,539
I'll always be alone.

458
00:49:32,709 --> 00:49:33,539
Forever.

459
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:35,649
And it's all my mother's fault!

460
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:37,899
What do you mean by that?

461
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:41,679
She always thinks about herself,

462
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,899
and she ruined my life completely.

463
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,378
[Italian] Julia, what are you saying?

464
00:49:48,548 --> 00:49:49,609
[Italian] Get out!

465
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:51,778
[Italian] You know I don't want you
in my room!

466
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:54,148
[Italian] Don't dare talk to your mother
like that.

467
00:49:54,308 --> 00:49:56,168
Okay, I'm sorry.

468
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:58,118
I don't really know what's going on,

469
00:49:58,118 --> 00:50:00,368
so maybe it's best if...

470
00:50:00,368 --> 00:50:02,077
I know it's not my place,
but we could take...

471
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:03,177
Please come with me.

472
00:50:06,638 --> 00:50:07,467
Okay.

473
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:22,507
She's angry with me,

474
00:50:22,507 --> 00:50:25,956
because I'm stopping her from
having a boyfriend.

475
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,447
But the problem is, all those
she falls in love with

476
00:50:28,447 --> 00:50:30,546
are much older than her.

477
00:50:30,546 --> 00:50:31,716
What can I do?

478
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,336
Yeah, sure.

479
00:50:33,336 --> 00:50:34,165
Could I...

480
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:36,786
Could I ask you something?

481
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:38,016
Yes, of course.

482
00:50:38,016 --> 00:50:38,846
What is it?

483
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:46,625
Julia told me some unsettling
stories about the painting.

484
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,285
And I was just wondering, do
you know anything about that?

485
00:50:50,285 --> 00:50:53,345
Her terrifying tales are one
of the main reasons

486
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:55,144
I had to take her out of school.

487
00:50:55,144 --> 00:50:56,944
Please, do not listen to her.

488
00:50:58,085 --> 00:51:01,654
She has the strangest fantasies.

489
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:10,084
And please, now, try to concentrate
on your work.

490
00:51:10,084 --> 00:51:11,373
I'm sure your father told you

491
00:51:11,373 --> 00:51:14,344
about a substantial penalty
included in the contract.

492
00:51:14,344 --> 00:51:15,634
In case of delay.

493
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:17,403
Of course. You don't have to worry.

494
00:51:17,403 --> 00:51:18,753
Okay, good.

495
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:20,854
I'll see you then.

496
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:39,739
Help us.

497
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,369
So, what are you going to do?

498
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:05,717
I don't know.

499
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:09,887
I want to leave.

500
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:12,697
But if I do that,

501
00:53:13,766 --> 00:53:16,797
the studio will be destroyed
by the penalty.

502
00:53:18,806 --> 00:53:19,806
But if I stay...

503
00:53:22,587 --> 00:53:23,657
Everything that...

504
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:24,876
Hey, hey, shh.

505
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:26,166
[Italian] Be calm.

506
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:27,306
Okay?

507
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:30,516
It's just nightmares.

508
00:53:30,516 --> 00:53:31,446
Okay?

509
00:53:31,446 --> 00:53:32,276
I promise.

510
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:35,025
It feels so real.

511
00:53:36,635 --> 00:53:38,286
And I feel like...

512
00:53:38,286 --> 00:53:41,285
I feel like something is after me.

513
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:42,355
I don't feel safe.

514
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:44,636
No. It's okay.

515
00:53:44,636 --> 00:53:46,735
Okay? Nothing ever happens here.

516
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:52,585
It's always the same people, every day.

517
00:53:53,425 --> 00:53:55,105
Nothing ever happens.

518
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:59,775
Did three tourists come
and visit you at the pub?

519
00:54:02,604 --> 00:54:03,434
No.

520
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:04,614
No, no.

521
00:54:04,614 --> 00:54:05,844
I would've noticed.

522
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:07,994
Why?

523
00:54:08,844 --> 00:54:09,994
We traveled together.

524
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:13,093
They said they'd come visit me.

525
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:18,153
Well, you know, maybe they left already.

526
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:20,183
I mean, these things happen.

527
00:54:20,183 --> 00:54:21,263
Sure, of course.

528
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,003
I was really looking forward
to it, you know?

529
00:54:26,003 --> 00:54:27,023
Yeah.

530
00:54:27,023 --> 00:54:30,273
I'm feeling kind of lonely, you know?

531
00:54:36,012 --> 00:54:36,842
Well...

532
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:45,292
How about you just try and
finish the job, okay?

533
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:48,842
And then after, if you want,

534
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:51,771
we can spend some more time together, no?

535
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:56,951
Si?

536
00:54:56,951 --> 00:54:57,791
Yeah.

537
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:36,845
What's going on here?

538
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:39,696
Oh, God.

539
00:56:41,415 --> 00:56:42,795
What's wrong with you?

540
00:56:47,925 --> 00:56:49,675
Are you taking drugs?

541
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:51,464
No.

542
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:58,324
Wait.

543
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:01,874
You're behind!

544
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:03,914
And you get in at three in the morning?

545
00:57:07,693 --> 00:57:10,094
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

546
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:14,323
I wasn't feeling well,
so I went out to get some air.

547
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:15,153
And...

548
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:18,333
If I'm being honest,

549
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:21,793
I don't think I can stay here
anymore, okay?

550
00:57:21,793 --> 00:57:24,042
So, look, maybe we can work something out,

551
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:26,203
and I can come back or...

552
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:27,823
You're not leaving, Lisa.

553
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,242
Until you finish this work.

554
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:34,002
If you try to leave, I give you my word.

555
00:57:34,002 --> 00:57:35,032
You'll regret it.

556
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:50,861
Come on, come on, come on.

557
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,791
Yes, I did it!

558
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,621
I did it!

559
00:58:05,491 --> 00:58:08,030
I'll come back for you.

560
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:36,399
No!

561
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:15,253
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

562
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:20,773
I need to talk to you.

563
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:22,628
Yeah, come in.

564
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:25,062
But look whatever it is,
it's got to be quick, okay?

565
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:27,152
Because I really have to finish this.

566
01:00:27,152 --> 01:00:27,983
No, no, no.

567
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:31,262
I'm telling you, if you finish this,
you'll end up like the others.

568
01:00:31,262 --> 01:00:32,092
Look, Julia...

569
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:34,402
I don't have time for your
stories tonight, okay?

570
01:00:35,582 --> 01:00:37,592
No, I'm telling the truth.

571
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,422
Believe me.

572
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:48,301
This painting was painted in 1493.

573
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:54,151
They sacrificed Billy to
lure that monstrous being.

574
01:00:57,961 --> 01:01:00,181
That's how they captured Goran.

575
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:36,569
It was all my mother.

576
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:39,448
She demanded this curse,

577
01:01:39,448 --> 01:01:42,838
so that she could have eternal
youth from Goran's blood.

578
01:01:46,168 --> 01:01:47,368
Listen, I'm telling you.

579
01:01:48,298 --> 01:01:49,547
You have to listen to me.

580
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:53,608
Tonight, the moon is going to be red again.

581
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:56,357
And if it shines on the painting
before midnight,

582
01:01:59,188 --> 01:02:01,917
the curse will be renewed
for another 500 years.

583
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:03,017
And that can't happen.

584
01:02:04,257 --> 01:02:05,086
Please?

585
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:10,247
Look.

586
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:14,757
You have a great imagination, okay?

587
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:15,627
You really do.

588
01:02:15,627 --> 01:02:17,156
But please leave.

589
01:02:17,156 --> 01:02:18,386
I don't have any time left.

590
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:19,376
Okay? Please.

591
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:21,706
Yeah.

592
01:02:21,706 --> 01:02:23,776
Those three new victims don't
have time either.

593
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:25,546
Three?

594
01:02:26,515 --> 01:02:28,765
Yeah, it's the last three
that they captured.

595
01:02:29,606 --> 01:02:32,035
It was a boy and two girls.

596
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:35,575
One was black and the other
has blonde hair.

597
01:02:38,365 --> 01:02:41,005
Julia, are you sure?

598
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:42,844
Are you sure about this?

599
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:43,944
Of course, 100%.

600
01:02:43,944 --> 01:02:45,775
Where are they now?

601
01:02:45,775 --> 01:02:46,605
Come with me.

602
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:52,525
Shh.

603
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:56,274
I'll bring you where they
keep the prisoners.

604
01:02:58,553 --> 01:02:59,964
Stay quiet, okay?

605
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:42,281
Julia? Julia?

606
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:44,001
[Italian] Julia, where are you?

607
01:03:44,001 --> 01:03:47,811
I have to go. Just make up an excuse.

608
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:49,641
What are you gonna do?

609
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:52,771
I have to help them.

610
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:55,551
Okay, but Lisa, listen.

611
01:03:56,451 --> 01:03:58,300
You have to be careful.

612
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,380
Okay. Okay.

613
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:01,811
Julia!

614
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:03,680
Okay.

615
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,496
Okay.

616
01:12:17,702 --> 01:12:18,532
No...

617
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:22,042
Wait, wait, wait.

618
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:48,610
Please!

619
01:13:11,349 --> 01:13:12,219
No, no, no, no.

620
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:13,049
Please, please.

621
01:13:13,049 --> 01:13:14,379
I don't want to...

622
01:13:31,768 --> 01:13:32,598
Tracy!

623
01:13:36,547 --> 01:13:39,398
Come on!

624
01:13:42,347 --> 01:13:43,527
Okay.

625
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:06,966
Okay, okay, okay.

626
01:14:08,526 --> 01:14:09,816
I'm going to pull it out, okay?

627
01:14:09,816 --> 01:14:11,326
Tracy, I'm going to pull it out.

628
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:12,156
I'm sorry.

629
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:23,055
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

630
01:14:23,996 --> 01:14:26,495
Come on. It's okay, it's okay.

631
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:12,249
Go!

632
01:16:30,798 --> 01:16:32,558
Oh, Marcus, good to see you.

633
01:16:32,558 --> 01:16:34,598
We really need your help.

634
01:16:48,217 --> 01:16:50,387
Go inside! Now!

635
01:16:50,387 --> 01:16:51,227
Okay, okay.

636
01:16:51,227 --> 01:16:52,926
Inside to the room with the painting!

637
01:16:59,496 --> 01:17:00,776
Quickly, now!
- Okay.

638
01:17:18,726 --> 01:17:21,095
Bring everything back to light.

639
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:22,055
Immediately!

640
01:17:23,855 --> 01:17:24,685
Come on.

641
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:55,213
It's almost midnight! Hurry up.

642
01:18:21,472 --> 01:18:22,812
Hurry up!
- Okay.

643
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:27,602
That section, down there.

644
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:40,020
(Emma chants in Latin)

645
01:18:44,231 --> 01:18:45,070
Come on!

646
01:18:56,699 --> 01:18:59,220
If you don't hurry up, you're dead!

647
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,060
You hear me?

648
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,499
Yes.

649
01:19:01,499 --> 01:19:03,879
This is gasoline, everybody step away!

650
01:19:03,879 --> 01:19:04,710
Right now!

651
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,659
And you put that down.

652
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,899
Do not touch this painting.

653
01:19:14,069 --> 01:19:15,059
This is over.

654
01:19:16,928 --> 01:19:18,988
Julia, don't.

655
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,039
You shed blood.

656
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:22,338
I did it for all of us!

657
01:19:22,338 --> 01:19:24,238
Not for me!

658
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:25,318
You have kept me stuck

659
01:19:25,318 --> 01:19:28,768
in a little girl's body for centuries.

660
01:19:28,768 --> 01:19:30,628
I'm through with you.

661
01:19:30,628 --> 01:19:31,548
Kill her!

662
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:43,407
Damn you!

663
01:19:54,346 --> 01:19:55,186
Lisa!

664
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:57,676
Kill them.

665
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:10,659
I'm sorry.

666
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:11,499
Sorry.

667
01:22:13,038 --> 01:22:15,659
I have to go.

668
01:26:17,124 --> 01:26:19,825
The Prime Minister has arrived
with his wife.

669
01:26:19,825 --> 01:26:21,804
He needs more...

670
01:26:23,364 --> 01:26:25,354
Tell him I'll see him in 5 minutes.

671
