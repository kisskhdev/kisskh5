"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 3)

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840
You turn around first.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:30.760
Turn around.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:31.480
Turn around.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.480
Why do I gotta turn around anyway?

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:33.159
Stop the nonsense.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.920
The pain's too much—I can't take it!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Hurry—come on, hurry up!

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120
Lift your hips up for me.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.519
Lift it up.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.280
Hurry—lift it up!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.640
Quick, quick—lift it up!

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.040
Yes, yes, it's done now.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.640
Let's go.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.736
Why am I carrying you
if it's just a toothache?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.680
Don't make me talk.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.560
My tooth hurts like hell, seriously.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.200
Get a doctor—hurry up!

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.879
Let's go.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.879
Go, quick.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.439
Go, go, quick!

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
Okay.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.280
This one hurts too.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.599
Ow, ow, ow!

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.919
How about this one?

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.639
Ow, ow, ow! It hurts!

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.639
This one too.

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.599
Super painful, super painful!

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.560
Uncle.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680
What do you think?

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.120
This one is a bit troublesome.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.639
I...

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.919
There's no anesthetic.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.640
What do you need anesthesia for?

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.199
This tooth of yours is rotten.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800
Needs surgery.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.080
Needs to be pulled out.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.800
Sur... surgery?

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.879
Wait a moment.

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.759
It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.759
Yang Meng.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm not in pain anymore.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.919
A miracle doctor!

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.759
Miracle doctor.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.199
It's fine, it's fine.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.599
Yang Meng.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800
It's fine.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.680
It's okay now.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.199
Absolutely doesn't hurt anymore.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.919
Are you messing with me?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.680
Uncle, thank you.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960
Okay.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.976
I... I wasn't messing with you.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.200
I just had some internal heat.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.439
I just had some internal heat.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.079
It's better now, it really doesn't hurt.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.840
Just messing with people.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520
Yang Meng.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.478
I really had some internal heat.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.039
It's better now.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.519
It's an old issue, comes and goes.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
Yang Meng.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
Yang Meng.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.039
Yang Meng.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.800
If you leave, how do I get back?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520
Baby Yoki～

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.879
What's going on today?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.879
I asked the director.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.000
He was all evasive.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.399
Do you need me to get you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.439
book a hotel room?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960
No need.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.800
Good, I was waiting for you to say that.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.480
If you can endure it,

00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:19.720
then we'll just tough it out.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.480
Otherwise,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.879
the problem won't be solved.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.759
At worst, I'll just

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.295
give that director a piece of my
mind for you to help you cool off.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.976
You don't have to bother with it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.480
That works too.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.600
Our Yoki has really grown up.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.000
But, baby,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.800
your current situation

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.959
is really dangerous.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.800
You absolutely must not have

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:35.920
any more slip-ups.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.920
Don't worry.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920
My medicine

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.360
hasn't arrived yet.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.920
Medicine?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160
What medicine?

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.199
Don't take random medicine!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.680
It's very dangerous, I'm telling you.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.720
Lift your head up.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.280
What are you running from?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.480
Does it tickle?

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:21.959
Does it tickle you?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600
Does it tickle?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.120
Speak.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.839
Speak.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.360
Does it tickle or not?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.079
Speak.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.040
Speak!

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.240
Speak!

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.279
Speak.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.519
Where are you looking?

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.920
Say it.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:46.399
I'm letting you look...

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.800
Did I say you could look?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360
Speak.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.960
I'm asking you a question.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.040
I'm asking you a question.

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:53.959
Stop!

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.120
Y... You just wait! Let's go, go.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.800
Big brother.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.079
Wait for me, wait for me!

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.439
Big brother, he's so scary!

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.360
Scary my foot.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.680
I was afraid one punch from me

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.399
would send him to the hospital.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.776
Didn't you see he was twitching constantly?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800
Let's go.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.480
I know.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
That's called epilepsy.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720
Wait for me, boss.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.760
Didn't get beaten up, did you?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.840
How come you only know one move?

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.439
Didn't practice the later ones.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.159
Bro, what are you getting so excited about?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560
No way.

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:00.239
I need to figure out a
way to stay away from him.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.120
It looks so good.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:41.958
Yoki is awesome, Yoki is awesome!

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:42.959
Yoki is awesome!

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:57.920
Hey, what are you doing?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.879
I was just about to sleep.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.199
Sleep? In whose bed?

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:03.719
Sis, what nonsense are
you talking about again?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.120
Like I don't know what you're like.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.120
During this time,

00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:07.680
you just stay there quietly.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:08.879
Stop messing around!

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:10.559
My filming schedule is
very heavy every day.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.240
Alright?

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:12.240
I simply don't have the time

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.359
or energy for these things.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:14.839
Okay, okay.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:15.839
I believe you.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.120
Then you should sleep quickly.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.839
Staying up late is bad for your health.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.040
Got it, hanging up.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.360
How come I only matched with one?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.240
Could it be that the photos I uploaded

00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:36.559
aren't handsome enough?

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:39.319
Seems like I need to be more proactive.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.799
These muscles are nice!

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:43.399
Four kilometers...

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360
Too far.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.720
Doesn't matter.

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:52.919
I'd better focus on Yoki.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:55.239
What kind of godforsaken place is this?

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.039
Director.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.879
The way we're treating Yoki
isn't it too much?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.360
I'm afraid...

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:00.559
What do you know?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.480
It was my idea to hide the shoes, or
scattering shells, and drawing lots for rooms.

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:07.519
But...

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:10.840
My wedding ring fell in there.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:11.879
Come here quickly.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.160
Come and help me fish it out.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240
Fish it out?!

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.279
Hurry up!

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.840
Coming, coming, I'll be right there!

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.000
Wash your hands a few more times.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.360
Why does it still smell so strong?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360
Director!

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:22.759
Yang Meng.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200
As the saying goes,

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.279
"A starved camel is
still bigger than a horse."

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.520
What do you think you are?

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.000
What?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.000
What are you?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360
Answer me, please.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:35.679
A horse.

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:36.360
An ant.

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:37.879
Ya-hey!

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080
Ants, yah-ha!

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.039
Ants, yah-ha-ha!

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:43.120
Director.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.679
The way we're treating Yoki

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:45.799
isn't it too much?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.399
I'm afraid...

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.679
What do you know?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.960
It was my idea to
hide the shoes...

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.120
Yang Meng.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.679
What a shame about this phone.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.440
It won't even turn on anymore.

00:10:22.152 --> 00:10:23.433
How about our program team

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:24.799
buy you a new one?

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.039
No need.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.399
How would that do?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.760
We should at least make
it up to you somehow.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.479
I want Yoki to have better accommodations.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.960
To let everyone better experience

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.799
the folk life of our fishing village,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.279
our program team has decided

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:52.080
to arrange for everyone's accommodation

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.559
in our villagers' homes.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.519
Please reveal your "love number tags."

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.120
Who is number four?

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:11.759
Thank you, director! Thank you!

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.360
You two.

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:13.639
Where are the suitcases?

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:15.360
This one.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600
Come, follow me.

00:11:17.206 --> 00:11:18.206
Thank you, director.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:42.759
Yang Meng.

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:44.639
Where's your number one?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.360
His number one is right here.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.760
I want Yoki to have better accommodation.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:01.759
Just that simple?

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:02.360
Right.

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:03.879
Deal with him.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.279
The mosquitoes here

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.480
are like special forces.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.600
They bit me all night,

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.679
couldn't sleep at all.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.879
Just now, you seemed not surprised at
all when the accommodation was assigned

00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:37.839
That was me being
utterly disappointed, okay?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.200
Absolutely disillusioned.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.720
I thought the production team

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.559
would arrange some kind of

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.039
seaside villa or something for me.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.519
Could it be that you

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.600
deliberately arranged this?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.480
Do I look like I have that kind of power?

00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:50.159
No.

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:51.399
Then that settles it.

00:12:58.919 --> 00:12:59.919
So we're here.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320
Good morning, grandpa!

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.519
Have you eaten?

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720
Wait for me.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720
Grandma.

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:33.440
This is

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:35.096
the guest from that variety show I'm on.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.559
His name is...

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:36.279
Hello, Grandma.

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:37.759
I'm Yoki.

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:38.320
For this period of time,

00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:39.696
I might have to stay at your house.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720
Sorry for the intrusion.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.440
It's no trouble at all.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.960
This is Grandma Tong.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.560
All of this area belongs to her family.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.120
Grandma is so rich!

00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:50.799
Grandma,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.880
You look really beautiful.

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:53.176
I imagine when you were young,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.600
you were definitely a great beauty.

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:55.840
I brought you a gift.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.520
I'm sure it will suit you perfectly.

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:03.639
Your skin is so nice.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.639
Wearing this

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.480
will definitely make you look very young.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600
Let me put it on for you.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.039
When did you prepare this?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.720
Thank you.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.440
How come I didn't know about it?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720
Good child.

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:17.519
How could I possibly let you know?

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:24.799
Didn't expect that, did you?

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:39.096
What are you muttering about?

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:39.519
Grandma.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.320
Do you like it?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.399
I like it.

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:42.559
I like it.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.799
The style of your house

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.719
is quite consistent with your personality.

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:21.879
The environment is acceptable.

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:23.839
The scenery isn't bad either.

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:30.799
Does he just not know how to smile?

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:32.039
But he's quite handsome.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.039
It's just a bit hot.

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:51.039
He's actually quite considerate.

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.639
This is a rag.

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:57.159
Staying at my place,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.480
though there's no rent

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.600
it's not free either.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:02.799
Starting today,

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:04.799
you have to work to pay it off.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.600
What?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Not willing?

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:12.119
I didn't even say anything.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.600
How do you know what I'm thinking?

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:37.960
I feel like I've entered a fairytale world.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.120
Where do I sleep?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.640
You'll sleep here tonight.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.800
Seems like there are still
plenty of mosquitos here.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.440
I got bitten like this last night.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.559
Could you really bear

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.000
to let me feed the mosquitoes again?

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.040
There's a mosquito
coil, I'll light one for you.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.879
Your mattress is way too hard.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.120
I just remembered,

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:00.960
from the last time filming an action scene,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.680
the back injury I got hasn't healed yet.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.519
I... it hurts so much.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:15.079
Well,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.600
I'll go ask Grandma instead.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.119
What exactly do you want?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440
I see...

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.119
isn't there a bed over there?

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
That's my bed.

00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:30.759
That's fine.

00:17:31.146 --> 00:17:32.335
I'll reluctantly squeeze in with you.

00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:33.359
I don't mind.

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.039
What "squeeze in"?

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.119
Then how else are we supposed to sleep?

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.960
I just want to sleep

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:41.279
in a bed with a mosquito net.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680
Tonight, you

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920
either sleep here

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:49.799
or get out.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.720
Alright, alright, alright.

00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:55.759
I'll sleep here.

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:58.159
Might as well let them bite me to death.

00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:00.119
My back

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.400
is so itchy.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440
My back

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:03.799
is so itchy!

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920
My back

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
is so itchy.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Don't move.

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:51.559
Sleep a little longer.

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:53.279
You...

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880
You...

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.160
"You" what?

00:18:57.359 --> 00:18:57.920
When did you

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.920
get into my bed?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.080
What are you so nervous about?

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:03.519
Just sleepwalking.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160
Sleepwalking?

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.880
Do you think I'd believe that?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.720
There have been times before

00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:09.839
when this happened.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.479
Even I don't remember myself

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480
what occurred.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.920
But I really didn't do it on purpose.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.880
Really?

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:21.559
Really.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480
Is that really necessary?

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:34.799
It's just a normal
physiological phenomenon.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.240
If you still want to keep living here,

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:43.119
you must agree to three rules with me.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920
Starting tonight,

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.575
if you can't control yourself

00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:47.719
and climb into my bed again,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
you get out.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.000
But I really can't control it!

00:20:02.079 --> 00:20:03.480
You have this kind of fetish?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.038
I'm telling you, if you can't control it,

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.239
then tie yourself up to sleep.

00:20:08.279 --> 00:20:09.599
Will you be the one to tie me up?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Yes.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.200
And will you tie me up well?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
You'll know once you try.

00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:18.839
Make me breakfast.

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:29.559
Sure enough, holding onto my "medicine"

00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:30.559
lets me sleep soundly.
