00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:48.778
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

00:00:51.948 --> 00:00:52.824
I'm a widow.

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:53.741
I know.

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:55.118
And you're the Grand Prince.

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.035
Who cares?

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.497
People will call it immoral and mock us.

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.456
Let them.

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:13.094
Let's go.

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:22.187
{\an8}Don't take that hand.

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:29.319
{\an8}You're not allowed to leave.

00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:30.737
{\an8}You can't leave this house

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.656
{\an8}until you die.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:36.743
{\an8}Move.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:40.121
{\an8}Unlike the noble Grand Prince,

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.457
{\an8}I can become petty very easily.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.208
{\an8}She belongs to this family,

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:47.253
{\an8}so she can't leave this house
until she dies.

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:50.882
{\an8}If I were to be petty,

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:52.342
{\an8}everyone in this house,

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:55.511
{\an8}except Hong Eun-jo, would leave dead.

00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:58.973
Dae-chu, my sword.

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:04.229
Bring it on.

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:05.730
Drop the titles.

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:06.940
Drop the ranks.

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:07.941
Drop the honorifics.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:12.612
- You know how to fight?
- You're still talking?

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:14.989
What are you doing? Let's just go.

00:02:15.073 --> 00:02:17.575
I never turn down a challenge.

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:26.251
I like that.

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:28.878
Officer Seo, are you just
going to stand there and watch?

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:31.422
Boys grow up fighting.

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:35.009
If I win, Hong Eun-jo will die
a natural death in this house.

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:37.303
And if I win,

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:39.389
she will live
a long, healthy life in my house.

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:41.266
You're acting like children.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.183
Look, both of you,

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:44.727
I decide where I die!

00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:46.688
Agreed?

00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.440
- Agreed.
- What?

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:51.818
If either of you
can actually wield a sword--

00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:04.872
You're good with a sword.

00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:06.499
And you've got some strength.

00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:09.836
What are you doing?

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:13.881
My lord.

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:16.092
How did you…

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:22.265
Eun-jo, follow me.

00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:28.354
Oh, dear.

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:30.815
What do I do?

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.026
What's this sound?

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.152
Did you say Father's back?

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:37.322
Could you go and stop him? Please.

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:45.038
Father!

00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:46.789
Father!

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.126
You…

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.377
I knew you would do this.

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:53.713
You really made Father…

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:56.716
No, Father!

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:00.219
Please! Enough already!

00:04:00.303 --> 00:04:01.888
As her father, this is my fault.

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:04.390
Her father?

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:07.435
You keep saying that
to a concubine's daughter.

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:09.979
That's why she thinks
she can get her way in everything!

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:12.857
She lied to all of us about her marriage!

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.400
But it's not too late.

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:16.736
I will discipline her properly.

00:04:17.362 --> 00:04:18.613
As a slave.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.991
You, come out.

00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:24.619
Come out!

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:52.313
You think I can't do it, right?

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:03.783
Move.

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:09.789
How pathetic.

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:11.249
I'm sick of this!

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.952
How long have you been here?

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:49.162
The whole time.

00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:51.247
Leave.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.540
I don't want us to look close.

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:54.292
Same here.

00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:56.210
Leave, will you?

00:05:56.294 --> 00:05:57.628
This is where I live.

00:05:57.712 --> 00:06:00.381
Think about for whom
it would make more sense

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.049
to stand here by this wall.

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:05.678
Think about who would look cooler

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:06.762
standing by this wall.

00:06:09.182 --> 00:06:10.224
The battle isn't over yet.

00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:13.227
The judge will decide the winner,
not the sword.

00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:14.812
You picked the wrong opponent.

00:06:14.896 --> 00:06:17.481
I don't think so. My skills never fail me.

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:19.817
And I never give up.

00:06:20.693 --> 00:06:22.904
Sorry to interrupt you
in the middle of a fight,

00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:26.407
but you're not just going to stand there
until one of you leaves, right?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.368
This isn't about your ego, right?

00:06:29.452 --> 00:06:30.286
Not at all.

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:31.579
Never.

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:34.373
You've been standing like that
over an hour. Your leg must be numb.

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.210
Your back must hurt.

00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:42.340
All right. How about this?

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.843
I'll count to three,
and then you'll go your separate ways.

00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:48.763
All right. One.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.765
Two.

00:06:50.848 --> 00:06:52.016
Three!

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.392
Three and a half!

00:06:53.893 --> 00:06:54.894
Four!

00:06:57.313 --> 00:07:00.524
Wow, you had to go on four
so you wouldn't lose.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.444
When it comes to childishness,
you two are tied.

00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:04.695
My arm hurts.

00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:09.700
I found out everything the day
before the wedding, and still let her go.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.787
You should blame me.

00:07:14.247 --> 00:07:15.706
Where is Eun-jo?

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:20.586
I told her to get some air.

00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:27.635
I told her to go outside and cool down.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.430
Hello!

00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.182
Come and take a look at our ornaments.

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:16.559
Come on, Lady.

00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:18.603
Come here.

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:20.479
Oh, my.

00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:21.772
How about something like this?

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:23.774
Let's just see how it looks on you.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:26.110
Oh, my.

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:29.280
It really brings out your features.
This is perfect for you.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.867
How pretty.

00:08:33.284 --> 00:08:35.578
Your face is glowing.

00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:39.081
It's out-of-this-world beauty.

00:08:55.514 --> 00:08:56.641
Do you want to try it?

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:58.643
Swing high

00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:02.229
and leave all your worries in the sky.

00:09:03.064 --> 00:09:04.649
I don't want to.

00:10:01.497 --> 00:10:03.332
Hong-si seems fine.

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:05.251
She probably isn't.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.086
It's because you buried everything

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:09.964
beneath the words "I'm fine."

00:10:10.047 --> 00:10:11.424
You buried your heart.

00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:14.009
She must be hiding her feelings again,

00:10:14.552 --> 00:10:16.512
behind her calm face,

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:18.180
burying them all.

00:10:37.074 --> 00:10:38.743
- Let's check out other places too.
- Sure.

00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:58.137
Why are you following me around?

00:11:03.476 --> 00:11:04.477
Well…

00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:06.228
So I could pull you out

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:08.272
if you get lost in thought
and fall into a ditch,

00:11:08.355 --> 00:11:11.066
pour you another drink
if you feel like one,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.069
and pat your shoulder if you cry.

00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:25.539
When did you notice?

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:30.836
It's hard to miss someone that tall.

00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:34.006
I tried my best not to stand out,

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.007
but you got me.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.555
The reason I sent the letter
to Lord Hong was…

00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:46.060
What was the reason?

00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:49.563
As the Grand Prince of this kingdom,

00:11:50.272 --> 00:11:52.066
I meant to set right the wrongful marriage

00:11:52.149 --> 00:11:54.735
and correct misguided customs.

00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:56.278
I see.

00:11:56.904 --> 00:11:59.406
And someone like that
sent a letter in my name.

00:12:01.158 --> 00:12:02.159
I did?

00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:05.329
I was in your body
when I wrote the letter.

00:12:06.163 --> 00:12:07.915
I must have written your name by accident.

00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:09.208
I see.

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.627
My name was written by my hand.

00:12:13.796 --> 00:12:14.838
I know.

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:16.340
I was being rash again.

00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:19.635
Hit me. I can take a hit.

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:21.262
Be gentle.

00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:24.473
I'm not doing that.

00:12:26.976 --> 00:12:28.435
I understand.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:31.730
You were about to live as a widow,
not knowing when it would end.

00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:34.608
Of course you wanted to find a way
to escape that family.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.197
It had to happen at some point.

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:42.783
I'm relieved we switched back

00:12:42.866 --> 00:12:44.034
before it was too late.

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:48.163
Are you all right?

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.422
Then it's fine.

00:12:58.882 --> 00:12:59.967
This is

00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.468
my proposal.

00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:02.886
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

00:13:07.433 --> 00:13:08.475
And…

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:09.643
You said you're all right.

00:13:10.102 --> 00:13:11.770
That's all I need to hear today.

00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:24.325
I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.

00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:27.620
I'm the one who should apologize
for asking such a big favor.

00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:37.129
Look here, Min-jik.

00:13:39.965 --> 00:13:41.925
Why, if it isn't my cousin!

00:13:45.346 --> 00:13:47.848
I was actually thinking
about visiting you after work.

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:50.434
Funny running into you here.

00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:02.571
I should be on my way, or I'll be late.

00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:07.451
I'm truly grateful.

00:14:07.993 --> 00:14:11.121
As I said, it's because
he saved my life on the battlefield.

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:17.211
You must be Eun-jo.

00:14:18.045 --> 00:14:18.879
Yes, sir.

00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:21.882
Don't trouble yourself to see me out.

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:25.719
Please tell Min-jik
that I enjoyed my visit.

00:14:25.803 --> 00:14:26.679
Yes, sir.

00:14:33.602 --> 00:14:34.853
Eun-jo,

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.023
it's over now.

00:14:39.608 --> 00:14:41.318
What do you mean?

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.195
As Your Highness commanded,

00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:46.865
I said that it was easy money
from selling the land.

00:14:49.618 --> 00:14:50.953
Let's keep this between us.

00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:53.622
May I ask why?

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.502
I just hope
it will make things a little easier.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.379
Pardon?

00:15:02.006 --> 00:15:03.465
I heard that in the Gyeongo Year,

00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:07.511
Lord Hong Min-jik had all his property
confiscated by the royal court.

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:10.514
Consider this its return.

00:15:24.862 --> 00:15:26.030
My lord,

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:29.908
where are you coming from?

00:15:35.122 --> 00:15:36.582
I'm sorry.

00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:38.542
Did you…

00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:42.755
Did you give all the land we received
from the lord from Naju

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:45.716
to the Chief Secretary's family?

00:15:50.345 --> 00:15:51.764
Please take it back.

00:15:51.847 --> 00:15:53.140
That marriage was my choice--

00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:54.641
It was neither your choice

00:15:55.434 --> 00:15:57.019
nor your responsibility

00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.271
nor

00:15:59.813 --> 00:16:01.732
your marriage.

00:16:02.649 --> 00:16:04.610
It was my mistake.

00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:10.157
With that land, we could live
the rest of our lives comfortably--

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.325
Enough.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:15.162
Do not disgrace yourself anymore.
I have never treated you that way.

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:18.332
If you

00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:20.626
truly wish to do good to me,

00:16:21.794 --> 00:16:23.337
treat yourself with respect.

00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:30.302
Whatever happened in that family,

00:16:32.096 --> 00:16:33.222
forget it all.

00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:39.353
And please forgive

00:16:40.687 --> 00:16:42.356
your foolish father.

00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:55.327
As you wished,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.913
I've left it all behind me.

00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:03.752
You must be hungry.

00:17:04.753 --> 00:17:06.922
I will help my mother
and prepare the meal.

00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:40.497
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:52.134
My Grand Prince Dowol
is a grown-up now, but has no spouse.

00:17:52.217 --> 00:17:53.385
Thus, a formal marriage proposal is made
according to tradition. Please accept.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.349
"Grand Prince Dowol"?

00:18:04.855 --> 00:18:07.900
It was Your Highness
who sent for Lord Hong?

00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:10.319
He was the Minister of War
of this kingdom.

00:18:10.652 --> 00:18:14.364
I hear he led countless battles to victory
in the north.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.618
As a man of virtue
living upon the land he has protected,

00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:19.244
it is only right to wish him well,

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:21.705
and for his family

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:23.457
to live comfortably.

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.584
Are you sure it wasn't for Hong-si?

00:18:26.752 --> 00:18:30.088
She only happens to be the daughter
of the man I wish well.

00:18:30.172 --> 00:18:33.300
So it was for Physician Hong.

00:18:33.842 --> 00:18:35.385
What? What's wrong?

00:18:35.469 --> 00:18:37.179
Lord Hong Min-jik

00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:39.723
was dismissed by His Majesty
in the Gyeongo Year.

00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:42.976
The royal family
is practically the enemy of his family.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.322
HYEMINSEO

00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:00.953
Thank you.

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:05.582
You came back just in time.

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:06.625
Go back to work.

00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:08.418
Yes, sir.

00:19:11.672 --> 00:19:14.967
I'm so glad
that stupid marriage fell through!

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.137
I can finally enjoy a drink
when I'm on night duty.

00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:21.223
That's what you're happy about?

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:22.975
I was going to drink with you too, dear.

00:19:23.058 --> 00:19:24.226
What? "Dear"?

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:25.978
What, you boor?

00:19:26.061 --> 00:19:27.229
- Dear?
- Boor?

00:19:27.312 --> 00:19:28.772
- Dear?
- Boor?

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:29.982
- Dear?
- Boor?

00:19:30.065 --> 00:19:30.899
- Dear?
- Boor?

00:19:30.983 --> 00:19:32.192
Be quiet!

00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:36.446
Eun-jo, I'm so happy for you.

00:19:39.783 --> 00:19:42.119
Have you two already seen a physician?

00:19:42.828 --> 00:19:43.829
Yes.

00:19:44.663 --> 00:19:48.750
My stomach's been aching a little,
so I came to see if it was the plague.

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:50.961
But it turns out it was only constipation.

00:19:51.044 --> 00:19:55.007
My head was spinning,
so I thought it was the plague…

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.925
You're just hung over.

00:19:57.551 --> 00:19:58.468
You saw it too, right?

00:19:58.552 --> 00:20:01.221
These days,
half the patients are like this.

00:20:01.305 --> 00:20:03.473
I blame the false rumors
spreading through the capital.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.145
I'm worried about the people
outside the capital.

00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:09.938
I can't believe there's a plague.

00:20:16.194 --> 00:20:19.573
If the plague spreads into the capital,
it will unsettle the people.

00:20:20.073 --> 00:20:22.659
Plague comes every year.

00:20:22.743 --> 00:20:25.662
If we let it be,
it will die down on its own.

00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:30.417
My concern is that whenever His Majesty
goes hunting to Onyang,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.878
the court is left unattended for too long.

00:20:33.712 --> 00:20:37.466
Perhaps we should establish
a hunting ground closer to the capital.

00:20:38.925 --> 00:20:41.762
There are people's dwellings and farmlands
around the capital.

00:20:41.845 --> 00:20:43.305
That will not be allowed.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.477
You should have made an appointment.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.520
His Highness is out of the palace
at the moment.

00:20:52.564 --> 00:20:55.984
Please inform him that I wish to see him
regarding my daughter.

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:03.617
I can't stop coughing today.

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:05.869
You should go to the Royal Pharmacy.

00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:10.499
My physician has left to accompany
His Majesty on his hunting trip.

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:14.127
I've had asthma since I was young.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.965
I've lived in your body,

00:21:19.049 --> 00:21:20.467
and there was no lingering illness.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.302
You have a perfectly healthy body.

00:21:22.803 --> 00:21:23.970
It started a few days ago.

00:21:30.727 --> 00:21:32.729
Did you get hurt
in the fight the other day?

00:21:32.813 --> 00:21:34.314
- Let me see.
- I'm not hurt.

00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:35.482
It merely tickles.

00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:37.109
I'm more worried about him.

00:21:37.192 --> 00:21:39.111
If I have a small injury like this,

00:21:39.194 --> 00:21:41.363
he must have nearly died.

00:21:42.155 --> 00:21:43.615
Why did you even fight?

00:21:43.698 --> 00:21:45.784
The only way to deal
with those bent on bullying you

00:21:45.867 --> 00:21:47.369
is to ignore them.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.164
He's so twisted.
I almost feel sorry for him.

00:21:51.915 --> 00:21:54.334
Do you think
that's why he didn't let you go?

00:21:56.294 --> 00:21:57.212
What else could it be?

00:21:57.295 --> 00:21:58.880
You don't want to know.

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:00.757
Shall we go eat?

00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:03.260
All of a sudden?

00:22:03.343 --> 00:22:04.678
You've been working all day.

00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:07.431
You have no patients, no family,

00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:10.142
and no husband.

00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:12.269
I'm sure you have nothing
in your stomach either.

00:22:12.727 --> 00:22:14.563
He knows that my marriage fell through.

00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:19.443
By any chance…

00:22:19.526 --> 00:22:20.777
Your Highness?

00:22:23.155 --> 00:22:24.406
It's really you.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:26.992
What an unexpected place to meet you.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.662
How many other women were you seeing
while you were in my body?

00:22:31.705 --> 00:22:32.664
It wasn't me.

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:36.251
I knew you wouldn't remember me.

00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:39.379
I'm Chief State Councilor
Han Seung-rok's daughter, Ji-yeon.

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:43.216
Right, we've met before, at the palace.

00:22:44.342 --> 00:22:45.218
Yes, Your Highness.

00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:46.761
I've heard that

00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:50.182
Your Highness has rejected
every lady in the capital.

00:22:53.977 --> 00:22:54.853
What brings you here?

00:22:55.687 --> 00:22:57.480
There's a plague going around.

00:22:57.564 --> 00:23:01.151
My father sent me to deliver
some medicinal herbs to the Hyeminseo.

00:23:02.694 --> 00:23:03.987
That's typical of him.

00:23:04.988 --> 00:23:06.072
Please give him my regards.

00:23:07.157 --> 00:23:08.450
Yes, Your Highness.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.418
This thing is full. What's inside?

00:23:19.336 --> 00:23:20.754
Give it back.

00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:22.881
Come on.

00:23:24.674 --> 00:23:26.176
We're going in the same direction.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.346
Maybe I should ask her
to cook the broody hen today.

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:31.056
What?

00:23:32.098 --> 00:23:34.935
Are you going to see my mother?

00:23:35.018 --> 00:23:36.144
Right.

00:23:36.228 --> 00:23:38.396
I called her "Mother" for a while,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.606
in a way, she's my mother.

00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:42.651
About your marriage proposal--

00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:44.152
This isn't the place for that talk.

00:23:44.236 --> 00:23:45.403
Later.

00:23:45.987 --> 00:23:47.280
Let's eat first.

00:23:47.822 --> 00:23:49.074
No.

00:23:49.157 --> 00:23:49.991
Listen to me.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.913
You should be with someone
who befits your title as Grand Prince.

00:23:54.996 --> 00:23:56.873
Why should I, when I have you?

00:23:57.791 --> 00:23:59.125
Someone who?

00:23:59.793 --> 00:24:01.878
Don't act like you don't understand me.

00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:05.173
Someone like
the Chief State Councilor's daughter.

00:24:06.091 --> 00:24:07.300
Are you jealous?

00:24:07.384 --> 00:24:08.218
No, I'm not.

00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:11.263
My mother forced me to meet her.

00:24:11.346 --> 00:24:12.305
And it was only once.

00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:15.308
I didn't ask.

00:24:15.392 --> 00:24:17.394
Could you at least pretend to be curious?

00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:21.064
I'm saying this for your sake.

00:24:21.523 --> 00:24:23.233
If you really want what's good for me,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.985
cook the broody hen for me.

00:24:26.236 --> 00:24:29.030
Why don't you ask the Chief Royal Cook?

00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:31.366
Wait, where are you going?

00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:33.326
You forgot this.

00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:36.621
Keep up this bickering

00:24:36.705 --> 00:24:39.541
and your families won't just be enemies,
they'll be archenemies.

00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:43.878
Well, I guess most people in love
end up enemies.

00:24:43.962 --> 00:24:45.338
That's very natural.

00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:47.966
Is that what you're hoping for?

00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:51.428
Jealous?

00:24:51.511 --> 00:24:53.555
That's nonsense.

00:24:54.889 --> 00:24:57.017
If this is about the broody hen again,
go away.

00:24:58.268 --> 00:24:59.144
I really…

00:24:59.227 --> 00:25:00.270
Goodness gracious!

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.063
Physician Hong, it's me.

00:25:02.147 --> 00:25:03.940
It's you. You scared me.

00:25:04.024 --> 00:25:07.527
I needed the headscarf
to get into the capital.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.779
If anyone recognizes me,
I'll be in trouble.

00:25:13.867 --> 00:25:15.076
Who are you?

00:25:16.828 --> 00:25:18.538
He's someone I know.

00:25:19.414 --> 00:25:20.832
Why are you dressed like a woman?

00:25:22.042 --> 00:25:23.668
Something happened at the leper camp,

00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:27.339
so I came to ask Physician Hong for help.

00:25:30.091 --> 00:25:31.301
Leper camp?

00:25:34.095 --> 00:25:36.723
So, the plague started at the leper camp?

00:25:36.806 --> 00:25:37.640
Plague?

00:25:37.724 --> 00:25:40.101
That's what the physician
from Hwalinseo said

00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:41.436
when he came by yesterday.

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:44.731
Some have been vomiting
and also running high fevers.

00:25:44.814 --> 00:25:45.940
What's the diagnosis?

00:25:46.691 --> 00:25:47.692
We don't know.

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:50.653
So they haven't even been
properly examined.

00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:53.865
The Hwalinseo was established
to deal with plagues and provide relief.

00:25:55.492 --> 00:25:57.744
Most people avoid the leper camp,
even physicians.

00:25:58.286 --> 00:26:00.455
And I'm no different,
even though I have to live there

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:02.457
because of my ill family.

00:26:03.124 --> 00:26:06.461
Physician Hong is the only one
willing to help us.

00:26:07.962 --> 00:26:09.339
Shall we hurry?

00:26:13.676 --> 00:26:15.678
Wait, give us a moment.

00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:22.602
What's the matter?

00:26:24.229 --> 00:26:27.190
This is where we treat patients.
There's a risk of infection.

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:29.442
I'm a physician who treats people,

00:26:29.526 --> 00:26:32.070
and it's my responsibility
to control who enters this place.

00:26:33.446 --> 00:26:34.864
Please follow her advice.

00:26:39.369 --> 00:26:40.203
I'll get going.

00:26:48.461 --> 00:26:49.671
Dae-chu,

00:26:49.754 --> 00:26:53.091
go and find out
which physician came by the leper camp.

00:26:53.174 --> 00:26:54.175
Yes, Your Highness.

00:26:58.471 --> 00:27:02.058
We grouped those
with the same symptoms together.

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:04.436
Let me take a look.

00:27:13.027 --> 00:27:13.862
It's tasty.

00:27:15.488 --> 00:27:16.906
Stop.

00:27:17.323 --> 00:27:18.491
It's dirty.

00:27:19.117 --> 00:27:20.118
Spit it out.

00:27:22.245 --> 00:27:23.788
It's our food.

00:27:25.248 --> 00:27:26.374
Are you hungry too?

00:27:27.083 --> 00:27:28.251
Do you want some?

00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:38.845
I…

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:09.667
I saw the man you came with
on that hill over there.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.171
Thank you.

00:28:29.687 --> 00:28:30.772
To the right.

00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:33.024
- To the right?
- Yes.

00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:34.234
There.

00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:35.985
There are so many here.

00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:37.237
Good.

00:29:13.273 --> 00:29:15.108
Geum-dol, come down.

00:29:19.445 --> 00:29:20.488
How did it go?

00:29:20.572 --> 00:29:21.865
I'll explain on the way.

00:29:22.407 --> 00:29:23.533
I'll be right back.

00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:26.494
Brother, are you coming back too?

00:29:26.578 --> 00:29:27.495
Yes.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.581
"Brother"?

00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:34.836
So, the water
they drew from the valley went bad?

00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:36.462
They drank it without knowing,

00:29:36.546 --> 00:29:39.090
and now they've all come down
with dysentery.

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:40.842
It'll take a while to notify the Hyeminseo

00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:42.260
and secure the necessary herbs.

00:29:45.763 --> 00:29:46.973
My lord.

00:29:49.851 --> 00:29:51.853
It seems you have urgent business
at the Hyeminseo.

00:29:51.936 --> 00:29:53.855
Eun-jo, go ahead.

00:29:54.439 --> 00:29:55.815
In the meantime,

00:29:55.899 --> 00:29:58.401
I'll have a word with this gentleman.

00:30:02.614 --> 00:30:03.823
I won't cause any trouble.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.867
There are patients waiting for you.

00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:09.078
I'll go ahead then.

00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:23.801
I thought I might land a post at court

00:30:23.885 --> 00:30:25.720
through your brother's connections,

00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:28.056
but my father messed it up.

00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:32.602
I can't believe he broke off her marriage
and let her work at the Hyeminseo again.

00:30:33.102 --> 00:30:34.187
She works at the Hyeminseo?

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.941
She must be getting nosy again,
playing physician and all.

00:30:38.024 --> 00:30:40.944
She'd better worry about me
rather than some random people.

00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:43.196
What a wench.

00:30:44.781 --> 00:30:45.698
Isn't it a good thing?

00:30:47.575 --> 00:30:48.618
What?

00:30:49.744 --> 00:30:51.412
Worrying about others.

00:31:04.842 --> 00:31:06.344
My lord, you're back.

00:31:07.637 --> 00:31:08.721
Yes.

00:31:08.805 --> 00:31:10.515
Could you prepare some tea?

00:31:10.598 --> 00:31:11.641
Yes, my lord.

00:31:16.771 --> 00:31:18.314
It'll be ready shortly.

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:21.526
I failed to recognize

00:31:22.443 --> 00:31:25.697
Your Highness the other day,
now that you are fully grown.

00:31:26.155 --> 00:31:28.074
Please forgive my discourtesy.

00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:30.910
You may speak freely.

00:31:40.878 --> 00:31:42.880
MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

00:31:43.506 --> 00:31:46.551
Please stop visiting Eun-jo.

00:31:49.387 --> 00:31:50.680
If it's because of His Majesty--

00:31:50.763 --> 00:31:52.682
Do not try to persuade me.

00:31:52.765 --> 00:31:54.976
I apologize
for what happened with His Majesty.

00:31:55.059 --> 00:31:57.854
- I've been nothing but sincere--
- That's exactly what I don't like.

00:31:58.396 --> 00:32:01.607
Whoever you're with
will be at His Majesty's mercy.

00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:03.359
Your sincerity is

00:32:03.443 --> 00:32:06.404
exactly what makes her useful
to His Majesty.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.489
I will not send Eun-jo

00:32:09.032 --> 00:32:11.993
to the palace
where nothing but death awaits her.

00:32:12.076 --> 00:32:13.995
And especially not

00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:16.164
through marriage.

00:32:18.082 --> 00:32:19.375
If that's the reason,

00:32:20.001 --> 00:32:21.627
I can leave the palace to protect her--

00:32:21.711 --> 00:32:22.920
No.

00:32:23.004 --> 00:32:24.756
Please do nothing.

00:32:25.298 --> 00:32:27.383
That is the only way

00:32:27.467 --> 00:32:28.634
to protect Eun-jo.

00:32:34.474 --> 00:32:35.767
What if I must do it anyway?

00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:40.480
What if I push for it despite everything?

00:32:40.563 --> 00:32:42.482
If you persist, despite everything,

00:32:42.565 --> 00:32:44.942
I will tell Eun-jo

00:32:45.693 --> 00:32:47.028
her marriage would mean my death.

00:32:48.071 --> 00:32:50.698
And if you go so far
as to actually carry out this marriage,

00:32:50.782 --> 00:32:52.992
I will truly take my own life

00:32:53.868 --> 00:32:55.244
to stop it.

00:32:59.415 --> 00:33:04.003
I don't want to hurt Eun-jo either.

00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:07.006
Please, I humbly ask for your help.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.362
You're still here.

00:33:35.576 --> 00:33:36.911
How was it at the leper camp?

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.330
I took care of the urgent cases.

00:33:39.413 --> 00:33:42.166
The Hyeminseo was kind enough
to supply me with plenty of herbs.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.459
That's great to hear.

00:33:44.293 --> 00:33:45.378
The Superintendent said

00:33:45.962 --> 00:33:49.966
the herbs were bestowed
by the Grand Prince,

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:53.302
and that I should thank the royal court.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.346
Thank you.

00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:03.479
By the way,

00:34:04.605 --> 00:34:07.859
what did you talk about with my lord?

00:34:11.445 --> 00:34:12.446
Just exchanged greetings.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.365
He saw me at the palace when I was young,

00:34:14.448 --> 00:34:15.783
although I don't remember it.

00:34:16.742 --> 00:34:19.036
So he knows you're the Grand Prince?

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:22.623
He knew.

00:34:23.916 --> 00:34:26.002
I see.

00:34:27.712 --> 00:34:28.880
Right.

00:34:28.963 --> 00:34:31.382
Geum-dol was looking for you,
calling you "brother."

00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:33.092
What did you do to him?

00:34:35.136 --> 00:34:37.096
I guess my charm slipped out.

00:34:39.015 --> 00:34:41.517
Do you always leave your charm
everywhere you go?

00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:43.603
Yes, just so you can pick it up.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.397
Why don't you pick it up yourself?

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.024
You're the one who left it behind.

00:34:48.107 --> 00:34:49.442
I'm not sure if I could.

00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:50.860
There's just too much charm.

00:34:53.863 --> 00:34:56.282
Where does your confidence come from?

00:34:56.365 --> 00:34:59.035
I learned it.
It's part of the royal education.

00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:01.913
So that self-praise is learned.

00:35:04.081 --> 00:35:04.916
Why are you smiling?

00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:08.711
Why do you keep smiling?

00:35:08.794 --> 00:35:09.921
Nothing.

00:35:10.004 --> 00:35:11.881
I just want to keep smiling with you.

00:35:14.008 --> 00:35:15.927
Today, I'll do it as much as I can.

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:40.284
Young Master, you're here again.

00:35:44.455 --> 00:35:45.373
What is it?

00:35:46.874 --> 00:35:50.169
The First Young Master ordered me
to burn everything in this room.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.381
Leave it.

00:35:55.258 --> 00:35:56.300
It's still

00:35:57.635 --> 00:35:59.220
warm in there.

00:36:00.263 --> 00:36:01.264
Yes, Young Master.

00:36:33.254 --> 00:36:35.172
What? The marriage proposal…

00:36:42.638 --> 00:36:44.390
Where did I drop it?

00:36:44.473 --> 00:36:46.559
I'm so clumsy.

00:36:50.479 --> 00:36:52.356
Did you lose something?

00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:54.900
No, my lord.

00:36:56.444 --> 00:36:57.695
I heard that

00:36:57.778 --> 00:37:01.073
you met the Grand Prince at the Hyeminseo.

00:37:03.284 --> 00:37:05.328
His Highness has a kind heart,

00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:07.455
and has helped me on several occasions.

00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:11.083
He's only fulfilling his duties
as a member of the royal family.

00:37:13.586 --> 00:37:14.587
Yes, my lord.

00:37:15.963 --> 00:37:18.299
Do you remember what you said?

00:37:18.382 --> 00:37:22.428
I wish to live here with you and Mother
for the rest of my life.

00:37:23.346 --> 00:37:25.264
I have never wanted a woman's life.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.808
Do you still feel that way?

00:37:34.732 --> 00:37:35.900
Yes, my lord.

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:39.820
Then do that.

00:37:58.589 --> 00:38:00.132
My lady, I'm coming in.

00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:04.845
A letter from the palace?

00:38:05.346 --> 00:38:06.806
Is it Her Majesty the Queen Consort?

00:38:13.687 --> 00:38:14.647
What?

00:38:15.606 --> 00:38:18.150
The Queen Dowager wishes to see me.

00:38:22.196 --> 00:38:23.197
Where's the Grand Prince?

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.200
We sent a man to his residence,
so he'll soon…

00:38:26.784 --> 00:38:28.828
His Highness is here.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.963
What is it you wish to say?

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:45.136
You look well put together.

00:38:45.219 --> 00:38:46.846
This will suffice.

00:38:49.473 --> 00:38:50.474
Are we expecting someone?

00:38:52.893 --> 00:38:55.312
I'm not in the mood to meet anyone today.

00:38:55.396 --> 00:38:56.981
It's not just anyone.

00:38:57.731 --> 00:39:00.860
It's your impetuous companion
from the other day.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:04.071
Lady Hae-rim of the Shin family is here.

00:39:04.738 --> 00:39:06.073
From now on, remember that name.

00:39:06.157 --> 00:39:09.452
It's the name of the woman
you had a night's fun with.

00:39:13.372 --> 00:39:16.292
Hae-rim of the Shin family is present,
Her Majesty.

00:39:17.543 --> 00:39:19.920
I believe I don't need
to introduce my son to you.

00:39:20.588 --> 00:39:21.589
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:39:23.007 --> 00:39:24.175
Have a seat.

00:39:32.183 --> 00:39:33.809
I apologize for what I'm about to say.

00:39:34.643 --> 00:39:36.770
Your Majesty,
there was a misunderstanding.

00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:39.190
I hear you're the Queen Consort's niece.

00:39:41.358 --> 00:39:42.902
We're in-laws?

00:39:45.863 --> 00:39:47.072
I though Your Highness knew.

00:39:48.657 --> 00:39:49.825
Kids, mind yourselves.

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:55.456
I heard your engagement
fell through recently.

00:39:56.165 --> 00:39:59.668
Was it perhaps
because of the Grand Prince?

00:40:02.505 --> 00:40:04.340
- Pardon?
- No need to answer that.

00:40:05.966 --> 00:40:07.760
That is an improper question.

00:40:07.843 --> 00:40:09.887
Even words of comfort
could be too much for her now.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.388
How could you ask her that?

00:40:11.722 --> 00:40:14.099
What I said the other day
was nothing but a bluff.

00:40:16.393 --> 00:40:18.229
I'm afraid I have dishonored you.

00:40:18.312 --> 00:40:20.356
I will explain in private.
Please stand up.

00:40:24.235 --> 00:40:25.194
Yes, Your Highness.

00:40:26.153 --> 00:40:27.279
Sit down.

00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:28.447
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:40:29.823 --> 00:40:31.325
I'll keep it short.

00:40:31.408 --> 00:40:33.327
You both enjoyed what you were doing,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.287
so no need to talk about who is to blame.

00:40:35.371 --> 00:40:36.205
Just get married.

00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:40.501
It makes us double in-laws,
a great blessing for the royal family.

00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:47.383
I'm saying this now

00:40:48.175 --> 00:40:50.803
only because I don't want you to persist

00:40:51.887 --> 00:40:53.973
in troubling this lady
of the Queen Consort's family.

00:40:55.224 --> 00:40:56.100
I have

00:40:56.684 --> 00:40:58.310
someone I hold dear.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.193
Forget her and move on.

00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:08.320
I can never forget her.

00:41:10.281 --> 00:41:12.241
That is my answer.

00:41:26.547 --> 00:41:29.341
Find out when Hong-si
comes back from sick leave.

00:41:29.425 --> 00:41:31.760
If she's recovered,
send her to me at once.

00:41:40.102 --> 00:41:43.439
When you said
you stained my name the other day,

00:41:45.316 --> 00:41:46.817
is this what you meant?

00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:48.569
Probably.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.197
What happened that day

00:41:53.157 --> 00:41:54.533
and today are my fault.

00:41:54.908 --> 00:41:55.743
I apologize.

00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:03.334
His eyes are on another woman.

00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:05.836
I wonder who she is.

00:42:06.587 --> 00:42:08.339
Who is the woman

00:42:08.422 --> 00:42:10.507
reflected in his shining eyes?

00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:23.646
I'm seeing improvements.

00:42:25.022 --> 00:42:26.315
That's wonderful.

00:42:26.398 --> 00:42:27.816
Thank you for your help.

00:42:29.443 --> 00:42:30.527
Eun-jo!

00:42:33.697 --> 00:42:35.658
What is it?

00:42:36.825 --> 00:42:38.702
Over there!

00:42:40.454 --> 00:42:41.664
What's there?

00:42:42.247 --> 00:42:43.415
What's that?

00:42:49.296 --> 00:42:52.883
The rice grew on our food tree.

00:42:56.261 --> 00:42:58.222
This is enough to feed us
for a whole year.

00:42:58.305 --> 00:43:00.182
Who gave us precious rice?

00:43:02.017 --> 00:43:04.311
FILL THE LEPER CAMP'S GRANARY WITH THIS

00:43:05.562 --> 00:43:07.231
Was it the Grand Prince?

00:43:07.648 --> 00:43:10.067
I'm not sure if we can really take it.

00:43:11.318 --> 00:43:13.070
You need to eat well to regain strength.

00:43:13.153 --> 00:43:15.030
That must be
what whoever sent this hoped for.

00:43:15.114 --> 00:43:17.032
Gil-dong!

00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:19.076
What? Gil-dong?

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.786
It must be him.

00:43:20.869 --> 00:43:23.664
It seems like Gil-dong
is looking after us as well.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.626
They said he stole
thousands of rice sacks, and it was true.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.002
It was true.

00:43:29.086 --> 00:43:33.465
No, you're all completely mistaken.

00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:36.719
Gil-dong was a petty thief
who stole small things.

00:43:38.262 --> 00:43:40.013
And Gil-dong is dead already.

00:43:41.056 --> 00:43:42.641
Hello?

00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:44.852
Can you hear me?

00:43:47.396 --> 00:43:50.983
Eun-jo, did Gil-dong come back to life?

00:43:53.402 --> 00:43:54.903
I'm a physician, and I'm telling you,

00:43:54.987 --> 00:43:56.947
once you're dead, it's over.
You can't come back.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.033
No, Gil-dong never dies.

00:44:01.326 --> 00:44:03.162
Now he's immortal?

00:44:04.204 --> 00:44:05.539
Oh, dear.

00:44:06.123 --> 00:44:07.750
Is this going to start another rumor?

00:44:07.833 --> 00:44:09.084
I thought

00:44:10.085 --> 00:44:12.671
everyone in this world wanted us dead.

00:44:12.755 --> 00:44:14.965
But it seems this person
wants us to keep living.

00:44:16.175 --> 00:44:17.676
Just like you, Physician Hong.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.761
What?

00:44:19.344 --> 00:44:20.596
I didn't do anything.

00:44:34.193 --> 00:44:35.152
Leper camp?

00:44:36.028 --> 00:44:37.654
If we move this leper camp here,

00:44:37.738 --> 00:44:41.158
and make this entire area
a hunting ground, including the forest,

00:44:41.241 --> 00:44:42.868
hardly any homes will be affected.

00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:44.244
I agree.

00:44:44.328 --> 00:44:46.288
Does the king really need
a new hunting ground?

00:44:47.206 --> 00:44:48.916
Every time he goes hunting,

00:44:48.999 --> 00:44:51.627
Father has to accompany him
to the Onyang Royal Villa.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:52.669
And it's a hassle.

00:44:54.129 --> 00:44:56.381
Because it makes it harder for you
to manage the court.

00:44:57.716 --> 00:44:59.635
Look at you, all grown up.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.556
By the way,
why did Hong Min-jik have to appear

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.184
and cause trouble when Father is away?

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.397
He cleared the debt with land.
Where did he get it from?

00:45:12.481 --> 00:45:13.440
It's his cousin's land.

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:17.653
That lowly girl
should have stayed with our family.

00:45:18.487 --> 00:45:19.655
Why is that?

00:45:20.697 --> 00:45:22.616
Father is keeping an eye on Hong Min-jik.

00:45:23.408 --> 00:45:25.536
That girl would've made a hostage,
in a way.

00:45:27.246 --> 00:45:29.206
If it's not our grandfather,
it should be fine.

00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:32.125
What do you mean?

00:45:33.627 --> 00:45:35.337
We can give her what she was expecting.

00:45:36.505 --> 00:45:37.464
What was she expecting?

00:45:39.216 --> 00:45:41.593
That vile girl as my concubine?
Are you crazy?

00:45:45.806 --> 00:45:46.848
Wait.

00:45:47.975 --> 00:45:49.268
If not me,

00:45:50.477 --> 00:45:51.770
what about you?

00:45:55.524 --> 00:45:57.693
You won't be able
to see His Highness for a while.

00:45:57.776 --> 00:46:00.070
He can't leave the palace
because of the Royal School.

00:46:00.821 --> 00:46:03.407
I see.

00:46:05.158 --> 00:46:07.744
His Highness sent rice
to the leper camp, right?

00:46:10.789 --> 00:46:13.625
I came to offer my thanks.
Please pass them along.

00:46:14.293 --> 00:46:15.586
Did you hear that?

00:46:15.669 --> 00:46:18.255
Gil-dong came back to life!

00:46:18.338 --> 00:46:20.299
Did he really come back from the dead?

00:46:20.382 --> 00:46:21.883
He's immortal!

00:46:22.467 --> 00:46:23.635
Wait.

00:46:23.719 --> 00:46:25.012
- Is that rumor true?
- What?

00:46:25.095 --> 00:46:27.139
That he took rice to the leper camp.

00:46:28.223 --> 00:46:31.643
Leper camp?
Eun-jo's been going there a lot lately.

00:46:31.727 --> 00:46:33.186
I wonder if she saw Gil-dong.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:34.771
I told you.

00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:36.773
There is nowhere in Joseon

00:46:36.857 --> 00:46:40.110
that Gil-dong's hands cannot reach!

00:46:40.819 --> 00:46:44.031
Gil-dong is incredible!

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:28.659
I see you came to offer your prayers.

00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:36.375
The lord returned safely,
so I came to offer my prayers of thanks.

00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:40.879
This is my daughter
whom you've always wanted to see.

00:47:44.716 --> 00:47:46.009
I'm Hong Eun-jo.

00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:51.723
Could you give me the names
of your family members?

00:47:51.807 --> 00:47:53.433
I would like to offer prayers for them.

00:47:55.769 --> 00:47:58.063
That is so generous of you.

00:48:05.278 --> 00:48:07.197
HONG MIN-JIK, HONG DAE-IL
HONG EUN-JO, CHUN-SEOM

00:48:15.956 --> 00:48:18.458
I appreciate your kindness.

00:48:19.501 --> 00:48:20.711
They say, before Gyeongo Year,

00:48:20.794 --> 00:48:24.506
Lord Hong's benevolence
reached everyone in the capital.

00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:26.383
I was one of them.

00:48:31.138 --> 00:48:32.389
Do you know

00:48:32.472 --> 00:48:35.892
what kind of person the current king is?

00:48:39.312 --> 00:48:40.605
I do not know much

00:48:40.689 --> 00:48:44.609
about the affairs of those in high places.

00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:47.529
I'm a mere commoner,
struggling to get by every day.

00:48:48.113 --> 00:48:48.989
You should know.

00:48:49.865 --> 00:48:53.201
That man held a blade

00:48:53.285 --> 00:48:54.953
to Lord Hong's throat.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:58.248
A blade?

00:48:59.875 --> 00:49:01.042
That was in the Gyeongo Year,

00:49:02.169 --> 00:49:04.004
the bloody year.

00:49:04.713 --> 00:49:07.174
Punishing them based solely on the appeal

00:49:07.257 --> 00:49:10.051
would bring great misfortune
upon Your Majesty in the future.

00:49:10.886 --> 00:49:14.931
Lord Hong nearly lost his life
for offering frank counsel.

00:49:15.432 --> 00:49:18.101
Punishing immoral writings

00:49:18.727 --> 00:49:20.270
is right and necessary.

00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:23.315
And Im Sa-hyeong,
who was a mere censor at the time,

00:49:23.398 --> 00:49:25.066
saved his life with honeyed words.

00:49:26.318 --> 00:49:28.236
Encouraged by those honeyed words,

00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:31.990
the king ruthlessly purged all officials

00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:33.992
who would not bend to him,

00:49:35.994 --> 00:49:39.331
and oppressed the late king's concubines
and his own half-brother

00:49:39.664 --> 00:49:43.293
under the pretext
that they threatened the throne.

00:49:43.376 --> 00:49:45.629
I will not live in disgrace like this!

00:49:49.216 --> 00:49:50.383
Mother!

00:49:55.764 --> 00:49:56.807
That year,

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.100
the king stained the court with blood

00:50:00.101 --> 00:50:02.354
and filled the court
with his puppet Im Sa-hyeong

00:50:03.605 --> 00:50:07.526
and officials who were his extensions.

00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:10.862
And now,
he's leading Joseon toward its doom.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.533
I knew that

00:50:14.616 --> 00:50:17.202
his frank words had angered His Majesty,

00:50:18.411 --> 00:50:20.831
but I didn't know
he went through all that in the palace.

00:50:21.498 --> 00:50:22.874
There's no way you could've known.

00:50:23.917 --> 00:50:26.419
The royal family
and the court officials covered it up.

00:50:27.963 --> 00:50:30.632
And my lord also…

00:50:39.307 --> 00:50:42.269
Why are you telling me this?

00:50:43.228 --> 00:50:45.146
A child must know

00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:47.482
their father's history.

00:50:53.947 --> 00:50:56.241
Now, Lord Hong is at peace,

00:50:56.324 --> 00:50:58.493
after enduring that ordeal.

00:50:58.577 --> 00:51:01.246
So I'm telling you this story
out of joy and respect.

00:51:04.499 --> 00:51:05.542
I see.

00:51:25.812 --> 00:51:27.731
I met Gil-dong myself.

00:51:29.649 --> 00:51:31.526
CATCH GIL-DONG

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.703
Word is spreading among the people

00:51:41.786 --> 00:51:44.289
that Gil-dong has come back to life.

00:51:49.419 --> 00:51:50.378
HONG EUN-JO

00:51:50.462 --> 00:51:52.589
A godlike hero.

00:51:52.672 --> 00:51:54.174
Perhaps…

00:51:56.009 --> 00:51:57.677
we could use a god.

00:52:00.096 --> 00:52:03.391
Bring me every rumor about Gil-dong.

00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:14.986
It may not be wise
to ask the lord about the Gyeongo Year.

00:52:23.453 --> 00:52:24.496
Let's eat.

00:52:28.792 --> 00:52:29.876
Chicken soup?

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.588
You said you wanted to eat
the broody hen I cook.

00:52:33.672 --> 00:52:34.798
What?

00:52:35.715 --> 00:52:37.342
You scared me.

00:52:38.301 --> 00:52:39.386
What's wrong?

00:52:39.469 --> 00:52:41.680
Because you got only half
after the lord was served?

00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:46.101
It's the broody hen again.

00:52:46.184 --> 00:52:50.146
When did I ask you
to cook the broody hen for me?

00:52:51.022 --> 00:52:53.400
Last time.

00:52:53.483 --> 00:52:55.318
You're talking like a different person.

00:52:55.902 --> 00:52:57.070
It was a different…

00:52:59.447 --> 00:53:00.532
Never mind.

00:53:02.742 --> 00:53:05.412
You've been looking upset.

00:53:05.495 --> 00:53:06.913
Is everything all right?

00:53:08.289 --> 00:53:10.875
I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:53:12.002 --> 00:53:14.170
I know. I won't.

00:53:14.254 --> 00:53:15.755
You told me

00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:17.716
not to worry about you at all.

00:53:18.508 --> 00:53:20.635
Did that person say that? Not to worry?

00:53:21.219 --> 00:53:22.637
What else did you hear?

00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:24.556
That person is you.

00:53:25.473 --> 00:53:26.766
Did you forget?

00:53:28.685 --> 00:53:31.438
You promised
that you would never lift a finger.

00:53:31.521 --> 00:53:33.106
You promised that yourself.

00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:36.443
Did you accept that promise?

00:53:42.449 --> 00:53:45.076
Why are you sitting on the roof
every night these days?

00:53:45.577 --> 00:53:46.953
Because I keep hoping

00:53:47.662 --> 00:53:49.080
it will look smaller from here.

00:53:49.164 --> 00:53:51.958
Why did you lie about the Royal School
just to turn Hong-si away?

00:53:55.253 --> 00:53:56.880
Please do nothing.

00:53:56.963 --> 00:53:58.965
That is the only way

00:53:59.049 --> 00:53:59.883
to protect Eun-jo.

00:53:59.966 --> 00:54:01.426
Do nothing.

00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:03.636
You must protect your mother.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.013
MARRIAGE

00:54:05.096 --> 00:54:08.892
I forgot my place for a moment.

00:54:10.477 --> 00:54:12.729
Are you not going to visit the leper camp?

00:54:18.568 --> 00:54:22.030
I heard that you saw plague
spreading in the leper camp.

00:54:22.113 --> 00:54:23.698
- Is that true?
- Yes.

00:54:24.949 --> 00:54:28.328
So the plague spreading outside
started in the leper camp?

00:54:28.411 --> 00:54:30.955
No, it is hard to say.

00:54:31.331 --> 00:54:32.415
I'm the one to decide.

00:54:35.794 --> 00:54:37.337
A plague.

00:54:38.171 --> 00:54:40.507
It's a good pretext.

00:54:46.513 --> 00:54:48.723
He said
I would never have to lift a finger?

00:54:49.516 --> 00:54:50.517
As if.

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.727
He put all kinds of words in my mouth.

00:55:17.043 --> 00:55:18.211
Eun-jo.

00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:23.133
Did you forget something?

00:55:23.216 --> 00:55:26.010
I thought you should know…

00:55:28.721 --> 00:55:29.639
Well,

00:55:29.722 --> 00:55:33.017
I overheard something while
I was drinking with Hwalinseo's slaves.

00:55:33.685 --> 00:55:34.894
Overheard what?

00:55:36.437 --> 00:55:38.940
They're shutting down
the leper camp tonight.

00:55:39.732 --> 00:55:42.277
The order was
to pull it all down and burn it.

00:55:42.819 --> 00:55:44.237
I feel so bad.

00:55:51.953 --> 00:55:52.787
Physician Hong?

00:55:52.871 --> 00:55:54.289
She said if I asked you for help,

00:55:54.372 --> 00:55:56.958
you would know who to go to.

00:55:57.834 --> 00:55:58.877
All right.

00:56:03.089 --> 00:56:04.716
Everyone, wake up!

00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:06.509
Wake up. Hurry.

00:56:06.593 --> 00:56:07.844
Physician Hong?

00:56:08.303 --> 00:56:10.555
We must get all the patients out now.

00:56:10.638 --> 00:56:13.808
Geum-dol, go outside and wake everyone up.
Tell them they must all leave.

00:56:26.404 --> 00:56:27.906
Should we really do this?

00:56:29.949 --> 00:56:31.659
I'm an animal. Animals don't judge.

00:56:32.035 --> 00:56:33.369
They only follow orders.

00:56:34.037 --> 00:56:35.747
Do you think you can move?

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:36.998
Come with me.

00:56:37.081 --> 00:56:38.499
What is going on?

00:56:38.583 --> 00:56:41.002
I'll explain later.
We must get the patients…

00:56:41.794 --> 00:56:43.546
Sir, your leg…

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:45.381
I got injured while hunting yesterday.

00:56:45.465 --> 00:56:46.424
It's all right.

00:56:50.428 --> 00:56:51.846
The soldiers are here already.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:52.764
Wait here.

00:57:00.897 --> 00:57:01.731
What's going on?

00:57:01.814 --> 00:57:05.401
They've given the order to kill
all the sick here and shut the place down.

00:57:07.862 --> 00:57:09.155
Run!

00:57:21.584 --> 00:57:23.169
Run to the gate in the back!

00:57:41.521 --> 00:57:42.605
Sun-dol!

00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:44.482
Sun-dol!

00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:49.904
- Wait there.
- It's too dangerous!

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:02.000
Finish it.

00:58:29.819 --> 00:58:31.613
- Hold my hand.
- Go!

00:58:31.696 --> 00:58:32.905
Just let my boy live.

00:58:32.989 --> 00:58:34.073
Hold my hand now!

00:58:34.157 --> 00:58:35.908
We could all die!

00:58:36.492 --> 00:58:37.994
Please just go.

00:58:39.078 --> 00:58:40.913
I'll come back. Wait here.

00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:11.569
Physician Hong!

00:59:44.852 --> 00:59:46.104
Hong Eun-jo.

01:00:44.662 --> 01:00:45.496
{\an8}Is this funny?

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:49.292
{\an8}So many people nearly died,
all because of your family's greed.

01:00:49.375 --> 01:00:51.294
{\an8}You know where we are.

01:00:51.377 --> 01:00:52.879
{\an8}How could you do this?

01:00:52.962 --> 01:00:54.297
{\an8}I can't help it.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.883
{\an8}When I'm with you, I become fearless.

01:00:56.966 --> 01:00:58.968
{\an8}Gil-dong is alive.

01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:01.220
{\an8}You go to such lengths to protect him.

01:01:01.304 --> 01:01:04.182
{\an8}Gil-dong must be someone dear to you.

01:01:04.265 --> 01:01:06.726
{\an8}Make sure nothing about Gil-dong
is spoken of.

01:01:06.809 --> 01:01:08.311
{\an8}Please take care of it.

01:01:08.394 --> 01:01:09.479
{\an8}What about Your Highness?

01:01:09.562 --> 01:01:10.563
{\an8}Leave?

01:01:10.646 --> 01:01:11.981
Where?

01:01:12.815 --> 01:01:14.817
