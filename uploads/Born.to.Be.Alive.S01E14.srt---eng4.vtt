[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.130
[Episode 14]

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.289
Even talking about

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.320
solving personal problems.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:46.979
Mom,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.020
you're overthinking it.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.460
I think you're the one overthinking.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.210
Don't bring it up later.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:01:59.720
Eat more.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.510
There's plenty left.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.010
Eat.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.930
Is it good?

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.630
It's delicious.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.950
How is the taste

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410
different from last time?

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.980
There's not much difference.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.740
It's lamb.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.470
I knew you couldn't tell.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.200
Really?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.520
Why are you sitting here?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.030
Shao.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.630
you look like a little old lady.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.120
If you can't speak nicely,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.180
then shut up.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.420
I'm having some alone time here.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.250
How come you two

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.980
came back together?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.470
I went shopping,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.079
didn't I?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.860
I met Han,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.050
and he gave me a ride.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.750
Big Sister.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.280
I'm here to pick up

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.370
Bai Ju and Shao.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.150
Who are you calling Big Sister?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.410
Look at how old you are.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.960
Don't call me that.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.300
What did you go buy?

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.230
Come on, let's talk inside.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.370
Don't pull on my clothes.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.350
If this gets dirty,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.350
it'll be a hassle.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.860
You can't wash it with water.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.320
What kind of clothes can't get wet?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.380
Is it made of paper?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.970
It's cashmere. Do you know what that is?

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.120
Mom, Ju.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.070
Fei is here too.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.620
Han.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.700
Come, perfect timing.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.550
Eat. Sit down.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.210
Director Zhang,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.900
Han.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.190
You're having dumplings?

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.950
I won't eat then.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.310
You guys go ahead.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.780
Eat.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.090
We made vegetarian ones just for you.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.190
Mom made them for you.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.090
Thank you, Director Zhang.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.030
Thank you, Director Zhang.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.760
Give it to me.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.200
You always walk in

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.440
right on time.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.960
You don't do any work at all.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.380
Didn't I go shopping?

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.750
You can't save a penny

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.240
of the money you earn.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.150
This is called investment.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.900
It's for my future success.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.460
It's worth it.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.220
I've made up my mind.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.150
I'll follow Uncle Lin's arrangement

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.930
and go to Tanggula

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.730
to be a road maintenance worker.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.340
The conditions at the maintenance depot

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.870
are very harsh.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.530
You have to think this through.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.430
Well,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.000
I even went to Bolamula.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.130
No matter how hard it is, I can handle it.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.710
That's a different story.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.390
The work at Tanggula is a long haul.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.650
You won't be back
for six months to a year.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.760
The altitude there

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.690
is 5,000 or 6,000 meters.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:12.400
I know.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.030
I've already bought

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.130
everything I need to prepare

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.040
in advance.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:17.720
Look.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.870
Gloves.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.589
These are wool socks.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.680
Knee pads.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.230
And this.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.780
High-altitude protective cream.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.770
Compared to what Guo gave me,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.040
it definitely isn't as great,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.300
but it's still usable.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.980
And this,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.690
Yan insisted I take it.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.250
Rhodiola Rosea

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.050
I've already started taking it.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.310
Don't think that just because Uncle Lin

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.770
arranged this job for you,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.640
you have to go to save face.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.390
It's not about saving face.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.360
I know Uncle Lin

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.390
means well.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.720
I'll stay there,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.690
and stick it out for three months.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.360
After I pass the probation period,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.620
I'll work for another year,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.159
and I might be able

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.460
to transfer to another maintenance depot.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.120
I'll work hard the first year,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.940
and try to get an award.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.500
I swear I'll change

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.390
and be a new man.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.740
Take this back.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.230
Once you're there,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.150
there probably won't be

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.660
any entertainment anyway.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.830
I'm quitting gaming.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.450
Give this to Tashi.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.160
He likes it.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.050
When I get there, I'll just

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.420
read books

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.080
and gain knowledge.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.870
Don't.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.070
The altitude is so high,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.930
you'll get a headache if you read.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.330
He gets a headache reading

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.580
even at low altitudes.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.580
Shao.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.830
I'm not wrong, am I?

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.450
I-I'm bringing

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.310
all of the Four Classic Novels.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.220
I'll just read book

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.150
and study there.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.590
Maybe just take one for now.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.010
Bai Ji.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.740
A gift for starting your job.

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:51.480
Thanks, Shao.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.650
Don't worry.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.570
I'll work hard.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.330
Let's eat.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.700
Stop analyzing me. Eat.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.430
Director, is there dumpling soup?

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.060
Yes.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.260
It's in the pot. Help yourself.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.540
I'll go.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.160
Me too.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.790
What is this?

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.500
What kind of dumpling is this?

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.440
It's lamb.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.140
This isn't grass-fed, is it?

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.159
Just eat what you're given.

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.180
You talk too much.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.460
Danzhou stole my notes

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.830
to do mineral exploration in Bolamula.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.810
What's going on?

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.270
What do you mean by "your notes"?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.010
You were

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.740
using the county's money

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.600
to do this work.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.070
Now it's you

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.070
who refuses to carry out
mineral exploration.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.370
And you didn't submit
the previous reports either.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.600
So if someone else uses these notes

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.660
to carry out the work, is there a problem?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.720
Of course there is.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.330
The area for mineral exploration

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.830
and the Tibetan antelope migration route

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.160
overlap in one section.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.450
Even if you want to do
mineral exploration,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.310
it shouldn't be done in this area.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.090
Since you

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.040
took my notes,

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.390
why didn't you read them carefully?

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.570
Mining in this area

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.480
overlaps with
the Tibetan antelope migration.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.540
Mining in that area

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.740
encroaches on the Tibetan antelope's

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.670
mating grounds.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.830
And another area

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.740
could potentially pollute

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.470
the nearby water sources.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.270
That's right.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.400
Didn't you memorize it all?

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.980
If we follow your notes,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.940
I won't be able to build
this development zone.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.300
Your development zone

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.430
shouldn't be built in the first place.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.720
The superiors haven't approved it yet

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.130
and you're already running
a pilot project,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.900
violating organizational procedures.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.960
I could report you.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.010
Go ahead.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680
[Letter of Report]

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.680
If you think

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.570
replacing me

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.650
is good for Mazhi County

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.950
and good for the people,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.210
then go ahead and do it.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.110
Wait.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.940
Close the door.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.710
Take this.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.260
What are you doing?

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.570
Bribing me?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.390
I really can report you.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.480
Madam Zhu asked me to give this to you.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.870
Did you

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.810
mortgage the pasture?

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.730
Is that true?

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.610
I won't take it.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.600
Let's keep things separate.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.800
Don't be so stubborn.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:23.440
If you keep this up,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:23.980
even if Cairen doesn't scold you,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.930
I will.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.720
Take it.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.980
Thank you.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.050
But I don't want it.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.350
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.530
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.600
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.860
Tell him I don't want it.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.860
It's gas coupons.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.630
County Mayor Lin asked me
to give them to you.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.410
As for the silver mine pilot project,

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.740
I'll have Danzhou find another location.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.250
[Ethnic]

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.260
Twenty-five liters.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:33.920
Just right.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.740
Okay.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.040
Fifty-five yuan.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.340
Bai, pay him.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.770
He Qingyuan is really something.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.320
He even schemed against me.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.200
Next time you say you're out of gas,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200
you can ride a horse back to the team.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.080
Exactly.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.040
What's so urgent?

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.150
Do you have to call here?

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.440
Can't you call back at the station?

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.720
Isn't it good?

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.410
It saves us money.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.240
More sensible than He Qingyuan.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.290
You two have

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.820
a life-and-death bond now.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.600
Why is it that...

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.120
The look in your eyes

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.710
is getting more and more like Duojie?

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.280
Is it?

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.080
Yes.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.530
It is.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.780
I just called the person in charge

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.780
of the paper mill.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.890
About the toilet paper,

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.200
I'm really grateful to them.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.090
They also think

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.650
this is very meaningful.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.630
They want me to write a report

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.490
for publicity.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.070
I think this is...

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.870
Who asked you?

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.630
Get in.

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.230
You're all back.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.940
Not bad.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:04.820
Zhacuo.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.500
You're tough.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.790
You recovered so fast.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.740
I'm nothing.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.460
Look at the guy

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.460
inside the room.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.040
The one in the room?

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.290
Captain, thick or thin noodles?

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.820
I'll eat whatever you make.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.510
Thin ones, then.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.130
Okay.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.000
You're back.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.490
How is it?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.190
Ju, you guys are back.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.000
We're back.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.270
Nice.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.270
Han.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.000
Thick or thin?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.400
The usual. Thick.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.610
Coming right up.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.850
Luckily, your hypothermia wasn't severe.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.450
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be eating this ramen.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.920
Careful, it's hot, Ju.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.490
Let me try it.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.070
It's delicious.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.530
Better than my brother's.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.330
With your skills,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.970
you could open a ramen shop.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.900
I can actually cook other things.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.760
Not just ramen.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:14.770
Really?

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.770
Then make something different next time.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.330
Although the ramen

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.150
is pretty good too.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.950
this is the third time having it.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.360
But here,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.770
you only have these ingredients.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.580
Even if I want to cook something else,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.320
I can't.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.650
One can't make bricks without straw.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.480
I think

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.520
we don't need to pool money

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.860
to buy Zhang Yang a ticket home.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.120
He can make money faster than we can

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.120
by selling ramen.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.000
Deputy Captain, you're just stingy.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.420
Since you're not stingy,
you can contribute more.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:37.990
I...

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.400
Let me tell you,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.480
we still need to pool the money.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.020
I'll pay two-thirds.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:43.650
The rest,

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.940
based on your salaries,

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.890
will be split proportionally.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.080
The newspaper office pays well.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080
I can chip in more.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.080
Then you guys pay for it all.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.520
No, no.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.410
You have to pay.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.100
Can I not leave?

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.880
I don't want to go back to Xunzhong
like this.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.530
I want to stay.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.480
I'll cook and do laundry for you.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.180
I want to go into the mountains with you

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.240
to find my brother.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.130
Aren't you also

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.460
catching gold diggers?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.290
Maybe I can

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.440
provide some clues.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.810
I think that works.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.340
Okay, sure.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.030
Okay.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.160
Thank you, Captain.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.220
I'll get more noodle soup.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:40.710
Duojie.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.310
Duojie.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.720
Duojie.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.130
Why are you here?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.000
What happened?

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.050
Sister-in-law, come and have some noodles.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:14:59.770
I'll tie up the horse.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:00.270
I'll go.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.310
Zhacuo.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.530
Stop feeding the horse.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.800
It'll be stuffed.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:25.980
Horses aren't stupid.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.580
They know when they're full.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.350
Go and have a listen.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.410
If they start fighting,

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.320
we'll go break it up.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.490
Why don't you go?

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.150
Tashi ran away.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.160
Where did he go?

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.300
He went to Zhacuo's house\
to help herd sheep.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.290
He said that

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.300
since you sold the field and sheep,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.960
he wouldn't come back either.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.920
Now both of you

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:02.890
are hiding away.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:03.840
I'll go back

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.240
to Mom's house tomorrow.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.050
Let the livestock run away.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.890
How about this.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.970
I'll go explain it to Basang.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.020
They probably won't

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.980
kick us out

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.540
just for ten thousand yuan.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.680
We're relatives, after all.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.570
You won't even pay back

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.530
your relatives.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.470
It's humiliating if word gets out.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.250
Alright.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.180
Worst case, we sell the livestock.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.650
If we sell them,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.520
what will Tashi and I eat?

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.070
The cattle and sheep for next year,

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.470
how will we deliver them?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.570
I didn't say we'd sell them all.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:43.730
Just half.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.700
We only have

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.060
a few head of livestock.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.170
Other families have herds
of cattle and sheep

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.230
while our family lives like beggars.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.570
And we’re supposed to be officials?

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.230
We’re worse off than beggars.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:54.870
You and your reluctance to sell.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.440
[Reluctance to sell: herdsmen compare herd sizes,
and are reluctant to sell their livestock]

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.100
I've criticized you before.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.980
Don't talk to me

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.030
about ideals.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.410
I just want my pasture.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.100
Without the pasture,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.270
where will we live?

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.790
We built that house with our own hands

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.250
when we first got married.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.089
We even made the furniture ourselves.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.770
You insisted on painting

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.599
the Four Auspicious Signs on the cabinet.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.700
You said for a family,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.630
no matter the conditions,

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.990
the most important thing is
that our hearts are together.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.760
But now?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.790
You just casually

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.880
mortgaged this home to someone else.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.810
Why didn't you ask me?

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.650
Didn't I

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.050
tell you before?

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.050
Our lives will become better

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.220
in the future.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.180
We will have bread.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.200
What about now?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.110
Do you know how hard

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.400
it is for me right now?

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.450
Who isn't having a hard time?

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.390
Every brother in the team

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.120
has it harder at home than we do.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.240
Don't talk to me about hardship.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:19.330
I originally

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.570
supported your work.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.880
You want to do big things,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.070
and protect wildlife,

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.180
that's fine.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.980
But now,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.340
you can't even

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:30.390
protect your own home.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.390
Why should you protect the animals?

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.940
When Tashi was at school,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.960
he got into a fight

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.810
because his classmates

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.140
were talking about you,

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.600
saying that you were eating
Tibetan antelope meat

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.930
in the Uninhabited Zone

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.460
He helped people sell jewelry

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.530
and only got a share of

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.590
over 100 yuan.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:07.820
I sent it all

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.980
to Cisong's family.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.460
Tashi said

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.140
he saved every cent and didn't spend any

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.760
because he wanted to help me.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.430
If only we hadn't taken Tashi

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.500
from my cousin's place

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.900
back home.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.740
What a great photo.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.240
Thanks, brother.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.900
No problem.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.800
Brother,

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.220
keep one for yourself.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.940
How about this one?

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.310
Nice.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.450
Brother.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:26.330
When you go,

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.660
don't just give photos.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.660
I know.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.710
I'll give some small gifts too.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.110
What small gifts?

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.000
I mean...

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.280
What are you two doing?

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.720
Sneaking around here.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:37.510
No, no, no.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.390
Just chatting.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.090
You hang the clothes.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.890
It's nothing.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.290
Bro, go on.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.530
I mean,

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:44.940
don't just give things.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.050
Borrow some.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.530
That way, you'll have another excuse

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.400
to meet again.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.460
Eating together and borrowing books

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.500
are two extremely

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.590
flirtatious acts.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.880
Borrowing and returning,

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.110
inviting and accepting.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.640
That's how a bond is formed.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.050
Yes, yes.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.610
You indeed know your ways.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.090
No, no.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.140
I learned it from "Fortress Besieged".

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.440
I'll give you a copy next time.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.790
No, I'll give you two.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.100
Tuck a love letter inside

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.380
and give it to Wangmu.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.460
Okay.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.430
What's okay about that?

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:13.160
Can Wangmu even understand it?

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.270
The Tibetan part,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.640
I had Sangba polish it.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:16.410
It's fine.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.250
I meant "Fortress Besieged".

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:19.840
Oh, right.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.820
If you ask me,

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.950
you should stop chasing her.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.590
What do you have to offer?

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.130
Even if you do win her over,

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.830
you go into the mountains for days,

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.200
leaving her waiting outside.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.740
Bro, don't listen to her.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:32.770
I say,

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.700
send the photo and letter together.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.480
You've revised it

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.200
so many times anyway.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200
It's more rigorous than my reports.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.180
Bai Ju.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.610
You have to face

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.210
the diversity of this world.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.240
There are plenty of people

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.000
worse off than him.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.410
How do they date?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.810
I don't know about others,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:50.480
but He Qingyuan

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.140
has been bad at chasing girls
since high school.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.090
That class monitor of yours

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.140
rejected you.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.310
You couldn't eat

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.570
for months, could you?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:21:59.920
Six months.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.460
See?

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.000
Well,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.860
you can't stop people from growing.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.680
The point is, how has he grown?

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.290
When you were taking photos of Wangmu,

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.150
didn't you see?

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.900
He just stood there

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.030
like a block of wood.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.090
Even for a photo with Wangmu,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.620
he didn't dare step closer.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.470
That's exactly why he needs encouragement.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.050
What do you know?

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.180
You're just blindly encouraging him.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.320
We are all at the age

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.780
to consider marriage now.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.400
Besides feelings,

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.910
we must consider practical conditions.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.560
With his current situation,

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.570
how can he provide her a stable life?

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.850
Never mind him.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.210
Just look at Han.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.920
Isn't it obvious?

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:36.970
Han had a blind date.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.850
He's pursuing free love.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.160
Can you compare the two?

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.770
I think you are just

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:40.830
enjoying the drama.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.850
Then according to you,

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.570
the Mountain Patrol members

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.370
should all stay single forever.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.130
I didn't say that.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.030
That's what you meant.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:47.640
I... I...

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.610
Stop arguing.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.740
This is not worth arguing over.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:53.460
I'll think about it.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:54.890
Think about it.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:56.660
Thanks.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.480
You must send

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.610
the love letter.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:09.660
Okay, okay.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.680
Is there anything else?

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.280
You went a bit too far just now.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.850
I was stating facts.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.210
I know it's a fact.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.510
But it's also a fact

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.240
that He Qingyuan likes Wangmu.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.050
True love

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:34.950
can overcome

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.360
all external difficulties.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:36.840
First,

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.900
no time to spend together.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.530
Second,

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.140
no financial foundation.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.240
How can this love begin?

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.750
It's not just

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:43.630
well-matched relationships

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.820
that are worth starting.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.880
If He Qingyuan sends the love letter,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.660
at least he won't have regrets.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.640
Don't let He Qingyuan's

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.170
rough appearance fool you.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.810
He's actually very fragile inside.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.900
You can irresponsibly

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.250
egg him on,

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.350
get him all worked up,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.590
and then just walk away.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.310
But I can't.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.370
Love is inherently

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.700
full of uncertainties.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.180
No one can guarantee

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.760
that effort leads to good results.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.010
I know you mean well for him,

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.030
but you must also know,

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:05.580
all love

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.590
is an adventure.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:07.590
One should at least

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.390
be honest about their feelings.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.850
Say something.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.030
Say what?

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.420
Like I'm talking big again

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.750
or something like that.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.240
You should talk less

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.330
about honesty.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.250
Even when making a phone call,

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.050
you don't dare to tell the truth.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.940
When you were in the county,

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.500
you called your workplace,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.510
didn't you?

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.050
Your creative leave

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.050
is long overdue.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.910
The chief editor is rushing you back,
right?

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.270
I didn't call the newspaper office.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.270
I called the paper mill.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.700
The paper mill is in Tianduo.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.400
The area code is 0982.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.680
You dialed 0971.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.710
That's the provincial capital.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.130
Tashi Delek.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.940
Tashi Delek.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.130
You must be tired from the trip.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.290
Tashi Delek.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.710
You came to find your son?

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.440
I heard Cairen mention it.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.290
For the past two days,

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.690
I've caused you trouble.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.130
These past few days,

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.900
he's been staying here.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.520
Riding horses every day,

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.980
herding sheep and cattle,

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.670
and refusing to go to school.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.010
He's just a kid.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.510
Just throwing a tantrum.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.900
Newborn calves don't fear tigers,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.830
but grow horns and they fear sheep.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.130
It's fine.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.620
He'll get over it soon.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:25.830
This little calf

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.190
is very stubborn.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.510
Who does he get

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:30.730
that temper from?

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.580
I heard many rumors

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.220
about the Mountain Patrol.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.970
None of them are positive.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.680
They aren't rumors.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.340
Most of them are true.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.740
Recently,

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:53.710
the Mountain Patrol

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.070
has been through a lot.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.000
Ever since Dongzhiba died,

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:02.510
Zhacuo's mother has been very worried.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.310
This time, Zhacuo

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.710
is in the hospital again.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.360
She doesn't want her son

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.910
to work with you anymore.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.630
It's too dangerous.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.270
What do you think?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.870
You were the one who handed him over

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.890
to me back then,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.200
asking me to discipline him.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.350
Now, Zhacuo's mother and I

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.280
are getting old.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.180
We can't handle the pasture work.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.110
We're short on money and manpower.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.750
We talked it over.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.550
We want Zhacuo to come back

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.570
to help manage the pasture.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:41.700
Right.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.530
I understand.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.460
But regarding this,

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.790
I still need to ask

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.010
what Zhacuo wants.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.050
If he wants to come back,

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.570
I won't stop him.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.530
Alright.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:57.860
Alright.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.290
Here.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.170
What about you?

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.560
Are you going to keep going?

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.140
What do you mean?

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.420
A lot of friends

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.020
don't associate with you anymore.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.820
I heard someone out there

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.660
wants your head.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.260
Worth two million, isn't it?

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:25.970
That much?

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.750
Aren't you short on money?

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.100
I'll just give you my head.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:38.750
Here, drink some tea.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.440
Drink.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:54.090
Hyah!

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.180
I watched you just now.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.380
You ride pretty well,

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.920
even better than me.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.700
Your mother said,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.660
you're feeding

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.010
the horses well too.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.610
Jiongxi's coat

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.450
seems much shinier than before.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.820
You're herding sheep here.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:22.900
Do you not want

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.230
to go to school anymore?

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.520
I'm no good at studying anyway.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.050
I'd rather herd sheep.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.990
You don't even want to come home?

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.400
You don't come home either, do you?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.670
I have work to do.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:39.820
What's your excuse?

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.700
You're at the age for school.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.960
You need to study hard.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.080
I don't want to study.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.570
Then what do you want to do?

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:56.760
I don't know.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.510
Herding sheep is fine.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.450
I actually envy you

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.400
right now.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.520
Not knowing what you want to do.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.220
Not having found that one thing

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.080
you absolutely must accomplish.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.290
Once that thing appears,

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.460
you will spend all your time

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.650
on it.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.180
Everything else

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.530
won't matter anymore.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.810
Family and relatives

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.850
will all be neglected.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.710
Even if

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.640
I had something I wanted to do,

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.900
I wouldn't be like you.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:47.350
You'd better

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.510
not become like me.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:55.860
Let's go.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:57.790
Come home with me.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.300
How about this?

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.570
Let's have a race.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.510
See who gets to the top of that slope
first.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:10.700
If I win,

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.600
you come home with me.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:15.090
Fine.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.200
But I want to ride Jiongxi.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.200
Okay.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.330
Hyah!

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:27.770
Hyah!

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.090
I left Jiongxi there.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.690
You can walk back.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.290
Hyah! Hyah!

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.280
Wangmu.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:11.820
Did the instant noodles arrive?

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.530
They've been selling well lately.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.060
Mom, no instant noodles this time.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.170
We didn't have enough money.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.000
Why wasn't there enough money?

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.160
The accounts from last time

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.510
didn't balance.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.140
It's okay.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:29.550
It's fine.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.660
Pay half first.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:43.850
The rest

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.080
can be paid next time.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.350
Wait.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.290
Take this.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.380
I can't.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.400
This isn't cheap.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.070
It's about to expire.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200
No one will buy it.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.980
You're helping me get rid of it.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:09.580
Just take it.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.570
Thank you.

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.020
I'm always benefiting from your kindness.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.000
It's nothing.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.980
You're the ones helping me.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.390
Go on now.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.040
What's wrong?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.090
The photos from last time

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.330
have been developed.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.520
You made my eyes look so big.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.510
So shiny.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.970
Your eyes

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.460
are naturally beautiful.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:22.800
Wangmu.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.199
I have something for you.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:33.590
Reading?

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.280
How did it go?

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.840
How did what go?

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.300
Did you give it to her?

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:44.400
I did.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.710
Wangmu liked it.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.320
She said you

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.050
made her look good in the photo.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.050
What?

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.000
I meant the love letter.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.980
That goes without saying.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.780
That's right.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.280
You should listen to me.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.500
It would be bad if you listened to Bai Ju.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.190
Wangmu gave this.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.690
Thanks.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.750
I want that Wanziqianhong cream.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:02.880
Did you buy it for me?

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.170
I forgot about it.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:06.030
-I’m sorry.
-You…

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.300
I'll definitely remember next time.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.030
Definitely.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.330
You are unbelievable.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.140
Your head

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.830
is just full of chasing girls.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.000
Next time...

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.500
I'll remember to buy it for you.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.010
Thanks.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.670
It smells good.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.280
Mom's hands

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.280
are so smooth

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.470
like a little lamb

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.980
that you can't hold onto.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.470
Bai Shao, hurry up.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.350
Let's go.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.110
Bai Shao.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.140
Who is that?

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.340
Why are you here?

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:11.820
Nice clothes.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.120
Where did you get them?

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.650
What are you doing here?

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.240
Let's go watch a video.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.480
Watch a video?

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.820
Now?

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.460
Not today.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.470
I have plans with colleagues.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:27.530
We're going to eat.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.230
You can eat anytime.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.150
Bai Shao is busy today.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.650
She can't...

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:33.850
...eat with you guys.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:36.230
Bai Shao, who is this?

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:38.110
I'm her boyfriend.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:39.420
Boyfriend?

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.210
We'll be going then.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.260
Bye, Ju.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.760
Let's go.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:50.640
Go on.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.690
Chingmy Yau is so beautiful.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.130
Her eyes are round.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.790
Her face is round too.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.730
She looks a bit like you.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.210
Really?

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.000
Yeah.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.190
Don't you like buying clothes?

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.160
Next time, you can try

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.560
that pink color she wore.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.970
I didn't notice just now.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.260
And Jacky Cheung running away.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.390
That was hilarious.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:21.730
How did they do that?

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.680
I... today...

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.470
Can't you tell I'm unhappy?

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.960
You're unhappy?

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.210
What do you think?

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.920
I didn't notice.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.580
I was just watching the movie.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.110
If you're unhappy,

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.150
you can tell me.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.480
I'm a person

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.590
who is straightforward.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.800
I can't read minds.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.190
Fine.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.900
I'll be direct.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:47.830
Let's just be friends.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:49.650
Aren't we

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680
dating right now?

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.320
I mean just friends.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.030
We're not a good match.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.170
We have nothing to talk about.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.920
You didn't like

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.260
the movie just now, did you?

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.440
We'll pick another one next time.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.190
Whatever you want to watch.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.840
That opera one.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.190
I'm not talking about the movie.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.390
I'm talking about us.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.520
I think we're great together.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:10.900
Look at us.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.360
Our outfits match so well.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:12.980
And now,

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.590
thanks to you,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.670
I'm really into fashion.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.090
Really.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.490
That's all superficial.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.520
Don't you care quite a lot

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.300
about appearances?

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.100
I care about what's inside, too.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:21.650
Do you know what kind

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.260
of movies I like?

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:22.940
Do you know?

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.940
Do you know why I like them?

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.740
Do you know?

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.020
Just now during the movie,

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:27.920
everyone was laughing.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.630
I was the only one not laughing.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.780
Did you notice?

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.180
It's still about the movie.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.900
No, no.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.580
It's that when I'm with you,

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:42.450
I don't feel like

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:43.580
we're dating at all.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.550
Instead, I feel like

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:45.210
I'm an elder sister

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.190
and you're a little brother.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.360
You are older than me.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:47.920
Can you just let me

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.760
finish?

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.150
Sure.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.020
That's the point.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.010
An older woman and a younger man.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:53.710
This kind of relationship

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.260
really might not suit me.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.340
I already have a brother at home

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.380
who gives me enough

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.240
to worry about.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.280
I don't want to be a big sister

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.740
when I'm dating.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:06.710
Okay.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:09.930
Then let's switch roles.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.760
I'll be the big brother,
you be the little sister.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.880
I have a brother.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.120
I don't need you to be my brother.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.310
Then I'll be your second brother.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.050
Who am I?

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.730
Bai Ju.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.010
I'm a police officer.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.350
Let's go.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:22.970
Sis.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.380
You're back.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.860
Who let you play with the car?

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.790
You'll break it.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:28.710
I won't, Ju.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.030
Han taught me.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.410
He's an amateur too.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.130
Don't play with it anymore.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:33.780
Okay.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:34.980
Put it away.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.590
Okay.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.010
Come on, Tashi.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.990
Let me show you around

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.640
our base.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.480
What's wrong?

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:45.840
What's so good about it?

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.620
I don't want to go.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.960
Fine.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:56.220
Then play in the yard for a while.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:40:59.750
Zhang Yang,

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:01.070
keep him company.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:01.980
Sure.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.780
Where's the Captain? Is he in?

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.320
He went out.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.220
What's wrong?

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.800
That guy.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:15.840
I went through so much trouble

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.040
to bring his son back,

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.380
and he ran off.

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.070
What are you looking for?

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.450
Something to entertain the kid.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:40.190
Well,

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.050
let him play with a gun.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.280
Boys love guns.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:44.320
Sure.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.080
I'll give him the gun,

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.080
lock you two in the room,

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.480
and you can play with him.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.670
Forget I said that.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.340
I wasn't thinking.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.520
Do you like cars?

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.110
All men like cars.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:02.650
I don't.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.510
Grass crushed by cars

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.170
won't grow back the next year.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.830
Then what do you like?

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.800
I like horses.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.080
What's so special about horses?

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:12.470
They're everywhere.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:13.750
I like riding horses.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:14.880
Horses can't talk,

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.130
but being with them

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.590
is more comfortable than
being with people.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:20.570
I'm Zhang Yang.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.800
You can call me Xiaoyang.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.820
Yang as in 'sandstorm'.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.130
Yang as in 'setting sail'.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:26.820
I know.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.280
What's your name?

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:29.960
Tashi.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:32.950
Captain Duojie's son.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:35.770
Captain Duojie is a good man.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:37.450
He's the one

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:38.630
who let me stay here.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.100
His dad drives every day.

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:47.830
He's definitely not

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.220
interested in cars.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.320
What should we do then?

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.170
Send him back?

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.190
You oaf.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:59.570
I can tell you've never done

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.630
any counseling.
