00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:05.880
(Acceptance email from a foreign company)

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.265
What should I tell Sunbae?

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.189
Ian, what are you doing?

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.483
What are you hiding?

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:27.652
Ah...

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.280
It's nothing.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.699
You're acting a bit strange lately.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.788
Trying to gloss it over with cuteness?

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.874
If you noticed, just pretend you didn't.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.087
I can handle things like that well... I'm just worried.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.299
I haven't sorted out my thoughts yet.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.510
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:55.263
Alright. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:02.145
There's still so much I want to do with Sunbae.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:06.775
I want to keep being with him like this...

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.986
Sunbae probably feels the same way...

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.738
What should I do?

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.993
You're okay, right?

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:18.912
Yes, really! I'm fine.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.631
Maybe because my past sins are so great...

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.716
Even if your expression changes slightly, Ian,

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:32.717
I get worried.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.095
You were still worrying about that?

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.971
Of course I am.

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.681
When you were struggling with job hunting,

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.892
instead of comforting you,

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:42.352
I treated you coldly.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.145
Hmm...

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.022
Did you?

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.483
I forgot everything, I don't remember a thing.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.279
That's why

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.282
when you look even a little bit troubled,

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.785
I feel worse and get more concerned.

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.041
Ian?

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:16.845
What do I do? I like you even more now, Hyung.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.013
Then just like me more.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:27.105
It's almost our 1st anniversary. What shall we do?

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.649
Well...

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.110
Isn't there anything you wanted to do?

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.194
Since it's your first relationship.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.824
I told you not to say that.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.826
Your reaction is so cute,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.703
I can't help but want to do it.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.539
Ah, forget it.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:50.962
Since it's your first, I want to make it extra special.

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:54.757
I want you to do everything you've wanted to do.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.390
Mr. Ian?

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.895
Are you asleep?

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:17.488
Goodnight.

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.912
I was also looking forward to a special 1st anniversary with Sunbae...

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.831
Sunbae, should I just not leave?

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.169
Should I just give up everything and stay by your side?

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:11.918
I said I'd wait until you tell me, but...

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:16.130
what kind of worry is it that you can't even speak about it?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:48.746
Was this what you were worried about?

00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:06.014
(Juhyeok Hyung)

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.732
(I finish early today. Want to grab a beer?)

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:41.299
Did he notice?

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.594
Did I make it too obvious?

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:50.266
I haven't even organized what to say yet...

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.520
I used to come here often alone.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.439
Alone?

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.149
Yeah.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.360
When I had a lot on my mind.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.321
Back when I couldn't convey my true feelings to you.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.824
I drank here alone frequently.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.578
Did coming here solve things?

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.206
Didn't you just get drunk?

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.166
Hmm...

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.001
Since I came here out of habit,

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:19.796
it was good for clearing my head.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.008
The day you first asked to meet me,

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.386
I sat here alone and worried about it too.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.014
So we were able to meet thanks to this place.

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:31.808
Right?

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:38.439
Then, today as well...

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.900
did you bring me here to organize my thoughts?

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:46.155
Well, partly that, and...

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:50.118
I was thinking about where you could speak comfortably,

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.994
and this was the result.

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.128
Ian.

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:05.425
Don't you have something to tell me?
