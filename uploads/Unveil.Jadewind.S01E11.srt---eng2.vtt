SONG OF THE WEEPING CHILD

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.545
HANLIANG HALL

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:09.985
Your Ladyship, my stomach hurts so much.

00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:11.985
Her belly swelled overnight.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.185
It looks as though
she's about to give birth.

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:17.225
Your Ladyship,
am I going to give birth soon?

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:18.185
Please save me.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:23.945
Your Ladyship,

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:26.505
back in my hometown, I heard
of a woman with the same condition.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:29.425
She died before the child was born.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:33.025
I have nothing to do with it.

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:35.505
I'm not its mother.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:39.905
Your Ladyship, I don't want to die.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:43.545
Your Ladyship,

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.585
I've also heard
that these things feed off the mother.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:49.785
Is it going to eat me alive?

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:51.345
If you die,

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:53.465
wouldn't whatever
is in your belly die too?

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:57.585
Oh no! It's moving!

00:02:57.665 --> 00:03:00.345
It's moving! It's moving.

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:04.345
Your Ladyship, that needle is so long.

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:07.785
What if you poke whatever is inside
and anger it?

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:08.945
Please don't.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.705
In that case, bear with it for now.

00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:15.625
After noon, when
the yang energy is strongest,

00:03:15.705 --> 00:03:18.185
I'll return
to drive out evil spirits for you.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:27.105
The food is not bad
for such a deserted hall.

00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:31.305
When Lady Wang was still alive,
meals like this were nothing special.

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:34.585
But ever since she suddenly
passed away at the start of the month,

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:37.185
all the other maids
at Hanliang Hall have been dismissed.

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:38.905
Only the two of us remain.

00:03:39.665 --> 00:03:41.825
Our rations have been cut.

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:44.625
Still, there's meat and vegetables.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:45.705
It could be worse.

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:49.425
We just eat whatever
the Imperial Food Service sends.

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:50.945
These past few days,

00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:52.825
the food has suddenly gotten much better.

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:55.265
I couldn't say why.

00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:02.625
Hanliang Hall
and the other nearby quarters

00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:04.225
each have only two or three maids.

00:04:04.305 --> 00:04:06.665
{\an8}The meals are all the same.

00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:11.065
I don't need to read it.

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:14.665
The food wasn't handed directly
to the maids, was it?

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:17.825
That was my oversight.
With so many places to deliver meals to,

00:04:17.905 --> 00:04:19.785
we just left the boxes at the door

00:04:19.865 --> 00:04:21.624
and let the maids collect them.

00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:29.345
Does Your Ladyship suspect

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:31.665
someone may have tampered
with Hanliang Hall's food?

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:37.625
Where are you going?

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.585
Mr. Xiao finishes
his shift at the end of the Si hour.

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:40.985
I'm going to ask him
to help with a ghost hunt.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:43.945
So that's why you said "after noon."

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:47.345
You wanted to see Mr. Xiao.

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:52.425
Things have been quiet in the palace.
I haven't seen Mr. Xiao in a while.

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:54.745
Otherwise, I wouldn't bother him
with something this minor.

00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:59.345
I really am the one who knows you best.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:05.905
Let's go.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:10.145
I was saving that for last!

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:28.505
After you take this,

00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:30.425
the symptoms should subside
within two hours.

00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:31.785
It smells like an herbal soup.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:33.505
It's called the Three-Purity Tonic.

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:34.745
It disperses foul energy,

00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:36.305
repels evil, and calms the spirit,

00:05:36.385 --> 00:05:38.585
protecting one from evil spirits.

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:43.985
HANLIANG HALL

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:46.025
Fangsheng,

00:05:46.105 --> 00:05:48.545
if that thing calls you "Mother,"

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:49.985
it must want something from you.

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:51.665
Did it ever say anything to you?

00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:54.105
No,

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:57.465
it just keeps calling me "Mother."

00:05:58.065 --> 00:05:59.225
I don't know what it wants.

00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:02.745
Forgive my boldness,

00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:04.985
but does Your Ladyship think

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:08.065
we staged the ghostly apparition?

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:10.745
Why would you say that?

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:15.465
Hanliang Hall is secluded.
Only we saw the apparition.

00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:17.865
No one else can vouch for us.

00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:20.265
The shadow was frightening,

00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:23.785
but all these days,
it never truly harmed us.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:26.625
Your Ladyship doesn't believe in ghosts.

00:06:26.705 --> 00:06:28.825
If I'd only heard about this,

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:30.185
I would've thought
it was just a trick too.

00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:32.905
No, we didn't make this up!

00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:35.665
Of course we believe you.

00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:38.465
It's the person behind the apparition
who has an ulterior motive.

00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:43.945
We're just powerless palace maids.

00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:45.985
Why would anyone come after us?

00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:49.425
Think carefully.
Have you ever crossed anyone?

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:55.025
We haven't been in the palace long.
We barely know our way around.

00:06:55.105 --> 00:06:57.865
Since Lady Wang passed,
we've hardly spoken to anyone,

00:06:57.945 --> 00:06:59.625
let alone offended anyone.

00:07:00.385 --> 00:07:02.745
Fangsheng might speak
a bit harshly sometimes,

00:07:02.825 --> 00:07:05.185
but that's hardly enough
for someone to seek revenge like this.

00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:09.465
Was there anything else unusual
before all this happened?

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:12.025
We only came to Hanliang Hall
with Lady Wang

00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:13.145
a few months ago.

00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:15.705
It's always been lonely and quiet here.

00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:18.305
Frankly, it's quite dull.
Nothing strange ever happened before.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.145
The tune you heard that night.

00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:22.265
Had you heard it before?

00:07:23.105 --> 00:07:24.785
I'm no musician,

00:07:25.305 --> 00:07:28.065
but it did sound a bit familiar.

00:07:29.505 --> 00:07:30.545
Right.

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:34.425
Lady Wang often played
her ruan and sang alone.

00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:36.265
Now that I think about it,

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:38.225
the melody that night was rather similar.

00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:43.345
What day did Lady Wang pass away?

00:07:43.425 --> 00:07:45.025
The sixth day of this month.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:47.625
It's been almost half a month now.

00:07:50.705 --> 00:07:53.185
The apparition first appeared on the 12th,

00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:55.065
the seventh night after Lady Wang's death.

00:07:55.665 --> 00:07:57.105
Could Lady Wang have returned?

00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.185
{\an8}HANLIANG HALL

00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:21.865
Mother.

00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:26.785
Mother.

00:08:28.305 --> 00:08:29.865
Mother.

00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:31.545
Who are you?

00:08:38.305 --> 00:08:41.225
Mother. I want Mother.

00:09:29.065 --> 00:09:31.265
That way.
But the person probably got away.

00:09:31.345 --> 00:09:32.305
I'll go after them.

00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:35.825
Your Ladyship!

00:09:41.065 --> 00:09:41.905
Did you find anything?

00:09:57.025 --> 00:09:57.865
I see.

00:09:58.465 --> 00:09:59.345
The simplest method

00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:02.545
and one that leaves the fewest traces
is to use moonlight.

00:10:03.705 --> 00:10:05.985
The alley is cluttered everywhere
except this wall.

00:10:06.065 --> 00:10:07.825
The person used bronze mirrors

00:10:07.905 --> 00:10:10.305
to reflect moonlight onto this north wall.

00:10:18.745 --> 00:10:20.265
Would you like to test your theory?

00:10:22.065 --> 00:10:22.905
Go ahead.

00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:50.585
The shadow's too blurry.

00:10:57.145 --> 00:10:58.505
It's too dark inside.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.265
Maybe the moon has moved,

00:11:02.785 --> 00:11:05.105
so the mirrors can't catch
enough light now.

00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:08.825
It's only been about a ke,
and the sky is clear.

00:11:08.905 --> 00:11:10.265
The brightness hasn't changed much.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.265
Something's missing here.

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:48.265
At the Astronomical Bureau,
we use pinholes to observe eclipses.

00:11:48.345 --> 00:11:51.905
But to get a clear shadow, you need
something like this to focus the light.

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:54.025
Whoever did this is meticulous.

00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:57.545
They only slipped up
because of our sudden appearance.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.865
Let's try again.

00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:24.465
Your Ladyship!

00:12:33.305 --> 00:12:34.825
Mr. Xiao?

00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:37.905
Did you two create
that ghostly shadow just now?

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.145
The culprit used
a polished disc to focus the light

00:12:40.225 --> 00:12:42.385
and tied these paper cutouts
with thin thread.

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:43.545
They moved the apparition

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:45.345
by controlling the cutouts
like shadow puppets.

00:12:45.425 --> 00:12:48.425
And by moving them closer or farther away,
they made the shadow larger or smaller.

00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:50.745
Not only did
they create a ghostly apparition,

00:12:50.825 --> 00:12:53.225
but they also deliberately fed Fangsheng
food that bloated her stomach.

00:12:53.865 --> 00:12:56.585
They went to all this trouble
not for money or murder,

00:12:56.665 --> 00:12:57.665
but just to scare people?

00:13:01.945 --> 00:13:02.785
Exactly.

00:13:04.065 --> 00:13:05.585
If you've already created an apparition,

00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:08.265
why stop at just scaring
a few unlucky maids?

00:13:09.305 --> 00:13:10.305
Why not go after someone's life?

00:13:13.305 --> 00:13:15.825
You're from
the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:18.225
Isn't it a bit improper
to say such things?

00:13:22.185 --> 00:13:24.985
The perpetrator used bronze mirrors
and a polished disc.

00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:26.985
They're both clever and meticulous.

00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:29.425
Now that they've slipped away tonight,
will we ever find them again?

00:13:30.985 --> 00:13:32.865
Mr. Xiao will make the culprit
show themself to us.

00:13:46.065 --> 00:13:47.865
I thought the incense ash in these corners

00:13:47.945 --> 00:13:50.745
was just to comfort the maids,
since it's dark and gloomy here.

00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:52.745
But it seems there was another purpose.

00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:58.145
The steps are light,
and the stride is long.

00:13:58.225 --> 00:13:59.825
These are Her Ladyship's footprints.

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:09.385
These two prints
show more weight on the right side.

00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:10.505
They're yours, Miss Wuren.

00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:14.745
Even I can't recognize my own footprints.

00:14:16.065 --> 00:14:17.985
Because your hand was resting
on your right shoulder,

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:19.425
your weight shifted that way.

00:14:20.385 --> 00:14:21.385
Now look at these.

00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:32.385
The sole isn't made of cotton or leather.

00:14:33.465 --> 00:14:34.385
It's hemp rope.

00:14:34.985 --> 00:14:37.225
Even with brocade socks,
these shoes would rub your feet raw.

00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:39.625
No one of high status in the palace
would wear such shoes.

00:14:43.305 --> 00:14:44.425
Judging by the size,

00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:47.345
they should be about the same height
as Prosecutor Gu.

00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:51.625
But when I fought them,
they seemed about my size.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:53.945
With all the clutter in the alley

00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:55.745
and the ground uneven,

00:14:55.825 --> 00:14:57.305
it's hard to judge.

00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:01.585
A short person with large feet.

00:15:01.665 --> 00:15:04.425
They are probably a man.

00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:07.825
They were certainly strong.

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.785
I struggled quite a bit
when grappling with them.

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:13.105
Wait.

00:15:13.185 --> 00:15:14.985
Their voice sounded like a woman's.

00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:18.105
If someone is skilled at vocal mimicry,

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:22.505
they can imitate a woman's singing
or a baby's cry perfectly.

00:15:23.025 --> 00:15:25.665
So, it is likely they aren't a woman.

00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:27.305
You both make good points.

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:29.585
We both make good points?

00:15:30.185 --> 00:15:32.945
So the person's both male and female?

00:15:34.185 --> 00:15:35.265
Look here.

00:15:36.145 --> 00:15:38.145
The edges of these footprints
aren't clear. Most are quite blurry.

00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:41.785
The toe is especially indistinct,
and there are scrapes at the back.

00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:43.625
Small feet in oversized shoes?

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:48.265
I didn't get a clear look
at their build, but from the shoe prints,

00:15:48.345 --> 00:15:50.825
they can't be taller
than five chi seven cun.

00:15:50.905 --> 00:15:54.545
They're either a tall woman

00:15:54.625 --> 00:15:56.065
or a slight man.

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.585
The left footprints
are deeper than the right ones.

00:16:01.665 --> 00:16:04.105
That means they tend
to lean left when walking.

00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:10.945
So after all this, we still don't know
if it's a man or a woman.

00:16:12.385 --> 00:16:14.785
Are we going to just wait
until tomorrow night to try again?

00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:17.025
We've already alerted them today.

00:16:17.105 --> 00:16:19.385
Even if they want to repeat the trick,
they won't act until next month.

00:16:19.465 --> 00:16:20.625
Next month?

00:16:21.945 --> 00:16:24.145
Past the third quarter moon,
the moonlight won't be this bright.

00:16:27.225 --> 00:16:28.185
Then how do we continue the investigation?

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:34.705
Look into the thread
tied to the paper cutouts.

00:16:37.505 --> 00:16:38.625
This thread…

00:16:40.465 --> 00:16:42.745
It is smooth and slips easily.

00:16:42.825 --> 00:16:44.545
It's thicker than ordinary silk thread,

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:46.985
very tough, and hard to break.

00:16:51.065 --> 00:16:53.705
Look closely. The mark will fade soon.

00:16:59.145 --> 00:17:01.145
This ruan seems unused.

00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:03.065
I suppose so.

00:17:03.665 --> 00:17:05.184
Most of Lady Wang's clothes and belongings

00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:08.025
were burned after the funeral.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:13.065
These were her favorite things
when she was alive.

00:17:13.145 --> 00:17:14.944
Her parents passed away.

00:17:15.464 --> 00:17:19.065
{\an8}It's said she had a cousin
doing business in Huzhou,

00:17:19.145 --> 00:17:20.265
{\an8}but he hasn't arrived
in the Western Capital yet.

00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:23.464
So these belongings of hers
are still here in the palace.

00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:25.985
When was Lady Wang granted her title?

00:17:26.065 --> 00:17:27.065
Why don't I remember it?

00:17:27.745 --> 00:17:29.305
About half a year ago.

00:17:30.145 --> 00:17:33.145
That was
right after Princess Ningyuan passed away.

00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:34.385
You weren't paying attention
to other matters.

00:17:38.305 --> 00:17:39.345
Was Lady Wang ever pregnant?

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.145
No.

00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:48.105
That was her favorite dressing case.

00:17:48.185 --> 00:17:50.225
She never let us near it
when she opened it.

00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:52.465
She would spend ages
playing with the things inside,

00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:54.025
crying and laughing.

00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:57.105
The joints fit so tightly.
They must be mortise-and-tenon joints.

00:17:57.185 --> 00:17:58.905
Without knowing the pattern,

00:17:58.985 --> 00:18:02.145
forcing it open might break the case.

00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:05.185
Let me give it a try.

00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:15.665
You've figured it out?

00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:24.585
These round pieces
that look like flower centers

00:18:24.665 --> 00:18:26.905
can be linked together
to form the Wings mansion.

00:18:26.985 --> 00:18:28.985
A few of the stars were out of place.

00:18:29.065 --> 00:18:32.545
Once they're set in the right order,
the box will open.

00:18:39.145 --> 00:18:39.985
Impressive as always, Astronomer Xiao.

00:18:52.985 --> 00:18:55.185
These are Lady Wang's treasures?

00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:59.465
DU'S MANSION

00:19:01.585 --> 00:19:02.625
Take a guess.

00:19:03.545 --> 00:19:06.265
- At what?
- You need me to spell it out?

00:19:08.825 --> 00:19:10.385
What are you doing here?

00:19:11.465 --> 00:19:12.305
What,

00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:14.465
did you dream of that plump lady again?

00:19:15.225 --> 00:19:16.265
Watch your mouth.

00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:20.025
Don't slander
someone's reputation for no reason.

00:19:22.425 --> 00:19:24.025
Feeling protective already?

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:28.745
I'm retired. Leave me alone.

00:19:30.265 --> 00:19:31.665
I'm not here to make
you taste-test medicine.

00:19:31.745 --> 00:19:34.145
I need your help identifying these items.

00:19:34.745 --> 00:19:37.985
Fine, leave them here and get going.

00:19:40.505 --> 00:19:42.985
When will I get your wedding invitation?

00:19:43.505 --> 00:19:45.665
That'll never happen in your lifetime.

00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:48.185
When are you going to leave?

00:19:49.705 --> 00:19:51.425
Always mentioning my sore spots.

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:56.985
Time to get back to that romantic dream.

00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:06.785
Wuren bought every kind of thread
she could find on the market.

00:20:06.865 --> 00:20:07.945
But to identify the exact type,

00:20:08.025 --> 00:20:10.065
I'll need your help, Mr. Xiao.

00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:15.465
How about this one?

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:27.825
It feels the same.

00:20:29.945 --> 00:20:31.705
It has the same sheen too.
This should be it.

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:34.705
That's it.

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.185
The mark matches as well.

00:20:43.065 --> 00:20:44.905
Are you two reading palms?

00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:47.025
Read mine too.

00:20:48.465 --> 00:20:49.985
We've found the thread.

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:54.625
You figured it out from a palm reading?

00:20:54.705 --> 00:20:55.865
The silk-wrapped string?

00:20:56.945 --> 00:20:57.985
That rings a bell.

00:20:58.065 --> 00:21:01.385
It's called the silk-wrapped string
because it's silk wrapped around silk.

00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:02.505
It's very tough

00:21:02.585 --> 00:21:05.105
and used as strings for instruments
like the pipa and the ruan.

00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:07.145
But commoners
mostly use gut strings instead.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:09.025
Only wealthy families
or the Music Office in the palace

00:21:09.105 --> 00:21:10.385
can afford silk-wrapped strings.

00:21:10.465 --> 00:21:12.945
Lady Wang used to work
at the Music Office.

00:21:34.065 --> 00:21:35.425
Does Your Ladyship like this piece?

00:21:39.065 --> 00:21:39.905
My mother loved it.

00:21:41.585 --> 00:21:45.145
When my father left for war,
she always played it at home.

00:21:55.225 --> 00:21:56.785
It's the incense that's
making my eyes water.

00:22:00.465 --> 00:22:01.465
This version

00:22:01.545 --> 00:22:04.265
was commissioned by His Majesty
for last year's Shangsi Festival.

00:22:04.345 --> 00:22:05.425
Didn't you know about it?

00:22:07.305 --> 00:22:08.465
I truly didn't.

00:22:08.545 --> 00:22:10.785
But when I was a child, I did hear

00:22:11.305 --> 00:22:12.945
the Princess Consort of Duan
was skilled at the pipa.

00:22:14.425 --> 00:22:15.385
Really?

00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:17.545
I had long forgotten.

00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:21.545
Mr. Xiao, let's make a bet.

00:22:21.625 --> 00:22:23.425
We're here to find the truth,

00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:25.145
not to compete.

00:22:26.705 --> 00:22:29.585
Just say it if you're afraid of losing.
At worst, I'll tease you a little.

00:22:31.345 --> 00:22:32.185
What are we betting?

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:34.425
The winner decides.

00:22:37.385 --> 00:22:38.905
Who do you think it is?

00:22:39.545 --> 00:22:41.185
Many musicians here use
silk-wrapped strings,

00:22:41.265 --> 00:22:45.305
but we deduced that the person
was less than five chi seven cun tall,

00:22:45.385 --> 00:22:46.345
had strong hands,

00:22:46.425 --> 00:22:49.265
and leaned left while walking.

00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:52.585
Looking now, since they're all sitting,

00:22:52.665 --> 00:22:56.345
I'd say it's between the pipa player
and the guqin player.

00:22:58.425 --> 00:22:59.265
You first, Your Ladyship.

00:22:59.865 --> 00:23:01.305
I bet on the guqin player.

00:23:01.385 --> 00:23:05.465
The black-clad figure that night
looked similar to her in build.

00:23:05.545 --> 00:23:08.545
All she lacks
is a pair of oversized shoes.

00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:09.785
That's your only reason?

00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:12.905
The key is her hands.

00:23:14.265 --> 00:23:15.585
Her performance involves

00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:17.745
wide finger spans and high speed.

00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:21.145
Her hands are not only nimbler
but also larger than most.

00:23:21.225 --> 00:23:23.745
She must be quite skilled
at manipulating paper cutouts.

00:23:25.465 --> 00:23:29.265
But many of the musicians on stage
could fit the criteria.

00:23:32.105 --> 00:23:34.185
I think it's more likely to be
the pipa player.

00:23:34.265 --> 00:23:36.145
That night, when
you struggled with that person,

00:23:36.225 --> 00:23:37.545
they relied
on their right hand for strength.

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:39.905
A pipa player's left hand is agile
for fingering,

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:42.305
and their right hand
is strong for plucking.

00:23:43.065 --> 00:23:44.225
That matches the black-clad figure.

00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:07.905
JIN AHAO, MUSIC OFFICE MUSICIAN

00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:20.025
Why isn't he singing?

00:24:20.105 --> 00:24:23.625
Your Ladyship, Mr. Jin
only plays the pipa. He never sings.

00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:25.505
What's this piece called?

00:24:25.585 --> 00:24:26.465
"Crossing a Thousand Mountains."

00:24:28.585 --> 00:24:30.865
{\an8}CROSSING A THOUSAND MOUNTAINS

00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:08.185
Everyone else is back there
collecting their reward.

00:25:08.785 --> 00:25:10.025
Where are you sneaking off to?

00:25:10.105 --> 00:25:14.785
A young lady like you
shouldn't be here alone.

00:25:16.705 --> 00:25:17.545
Why not?

00:25:18.145 --> 00:25:19.625
I'm of low status.

00:25:19.705 --> 00:25:20.905
Being seen with me
would sully your reputation.

00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:23.225
You really aren't like other men.

00:25:23.305 --> 00:25:26.225
No wonder the guqin player said
it took luck to meet you.

00:25:26.305 --> 00:25:28.705
I'm not worth your interest, madam.

00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:30.145
I'll take my leave.

00:25:31.985 --> 00:25:32.945
What's the rush?

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.305
Stay and talk to me.

00:25:34.385 --> 00:25:35.705
Please show some restraint, madam.

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.025
‪Oh my.

00:25:41.105 --> 00:25:41.945
Did I hurt you?

00:25:47.385 --> 00:25:48.585
Are you injured?

00:25:49.745 --> 00:25:52.505
It's common for musicians
in the Music Office to have injuries.

00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:54.945
But how did you end up
with bruises from playing the pipa?

00:25:55.585 --> 00:25:57.425
Who did this to you?
I'll get justice for you.

00:25:57.505 --> 00:25:59.265
I've never crossed anyone.

00:25:59.345 --> 00:26:00.625
Thank you for your concern.

00:26:08.385 --> 00:26:09.585
Let go of me!

00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:13.345
We clearly met at Hanliang Hall
on the night of the 17th,

00:26:13.425 --> 00:26:14.785
yet you act like a stranger.

00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:16.105
I'm deeply hurt.

00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:18.785
That night, I was performing
at Lady Su's palace.

00:26:18.865 --> 00:26:19.705
I never saw you.

00:26:22.745 --> 00:26:23.745
I checked.

00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:26.105
You were indeed
at Lady Su's palace that night,

00:26:26.705 --> 00:26:29.505
but you left without collecting
your reward.

00:26:29.585 --> 00:26:31.465
Lady Su's sister hasn't forgotten you.

00:26:31.545 --> 00:26:34.825
She even brought your reward to you today,

00:26:34.905 --> 00:26:36.825
an inlaid rosewood pipa.

00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:38.585
You would've loved it,

00:26:38.665 --> 00:26:42.385
but you left so quickly
that she missed you again.

00:26:43.705 --> 00:26:45.185
When did leaving
without collecting a reward

00:26:45.705 --> 00:26:46.625
become a crime?

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:48.385
It isn't,

00:26:49.385 --> 00:26:52.585
but using tricks to haunt the palace
and deceive people

00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:53.545
is a serious offense.

00:27:25.505 --> 00:27:26.825
JIN

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:42.345
Most people would see only
the mother-of-pearl flowers,

00:27:42.425 --> 00:27:44.825
but these bits of shell actually

00:27:44.905 --> 00:27:46.945
form the Wings mansion,
which governs music.

00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:54.705
Such an exquisite case is rare,

00:27:54.785 --> 00:27:55.985
yet there are two

00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:57.865
in this palace.

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:02.305
You should know where the other one is.

00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:07.065
There's also a polished disc
just like yours

00:28:07.145 --> 00:28:08.385
now with the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:11.145
We found it under a window
at Hanliang Hall.

00:28:11.225 --> 00:28:12.905
If you keep denying it,

00:28:13.945 --> 00:28:15.225
we can compare them directly.

00:28:25.105 --> 00:28:26.225
How careless of you.

00:28:26.305 --> 00:28:28.865
Why didn't you destroy
your ghostly props after using them?

00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:34.745
Still won't talk?

00:28:35.705 --> 00:28:38.545
Then I'll have to arrest you
for disrupting order

00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:39.945
in the inner palace.

00:28:42.305 --> 00:28:45.185
I expected more from you, Your Ladyship.

00:28:45.865 --> 00:28:48.145
But it turns out this is all you've got.

00:28:49.025 --> 00:28:53.105
How else was I supposed to get you,
Lady Wang's good friend, to talk?

00:28:53.825 --> 00:28:54.665
You…

00:28:55.785 --> 00:28:56.905
How did you know?

00:28:58.625 --> 00:28:59.825
Mr. Xiao's divined it.

00:29:19.825 --> 00:29:23.865
Women in the Music Office
are often harassed by nobles.

00:29:24.425 --> 00:29:27.505
To avoid trouble, I always dress as a man.

00:29:29.065 --> 00:29:30.385
Yet you still can't hide your charm.

00:29:30.985 --> 00:29:32.305
Please don't tease me, Your Ladyship.

00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:34.985
It's difficult to get
into the Music Office.

00:29:35.705 --> 00:29:38.825
We musicians take pride in our craft.

00:29:39.345 --> 00:29:42.105
I was chosen
from the commoners to serve here

00:29:42.185 --> 00:29:44.785
and was bullied a lot at first.

00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:47.225
Luckily, I met Yushu.

00:29:47.305 --> 00:29:49.905
You lack skill.
You are unfit for this post.

00:29:49.985 --> 00:29:51.505
If I lacked skill,

00:29:51.585 --> 00:29:52.625
how would I have been chosen
into the palace?

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:57.305
Who knows what you relied on to get in?

00:30:00.305 --> 00:30:02.545
Skill speaks for itself.
Let's compete and find out.

00:30:07.065 --> 00:30:09.505
She performed on the streets.
What about you?

00:30:09.585 --> 00:30:11.345
Background doesn't matter.

00:30:11.865 --> 00:30:14.505
Is it not skill that counts here?

00:30:14.585 --> 00:30:16.425
Since when do we judge by background?

00:30:19.305 --> 00:30:20.345
ETERNAL SUMMITS, CEASELESS STREAMS

00:30:20.425 --> 00:30:22.065
Yushu came from a wealthy family

00:30:22.945 --> 00:30:25.705
and entered the palace to refine her art.

00:30:25.785 --> 00:30:27.865
She was proud

00:30:28.465 --> 00:30:30.945
and despised scheming and currying favor.

00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:35.545
Because of her,
my days here became easier.

00:30:36.785 --> 00:30:38.985
We played and composed,

00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:41.785
and more than three years
passed in a blink.

00:30:42.385 --> 00:30:43.905
I grew up an orphan.

00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:46.745
Her parents had long passed as well.

00:30:47.265 --> 00:30:49.225
We agreed that,
after finishing our service,

00:30:49.305 --> 00:30:50.825
we would leave
the palace and travel together.

00:30:50.905 --> 00:30:52.345
The day was so close,

00:30:53.385 --> 00:30:54.545
but it all changed that night.

00:31:12.705 --> 00:31:13.545
Your Majesty.

00:31:20.625 --> 00:31:24.025
I have heard this piece
many times at the Music Office.

00:31:24.105 --> 00:31:25.865
It was always gentle and restrained.

00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:29.745
But tonight,
you played it boldly and freely.

00:31:29.825 --> 00:31:32.665
It felt wild and full of exhilaration.

00:31:32.745 --> 00:31:34.425
It was something entirely new.

00:31:35.305 --> 00:31:36.465
You played well.

00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:40.385
Yushu reinterpreted the piece.

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:42.345
I merely accompanied her.

00:31:46.025 --> 00:31:48.585
Such grandeur and force

00:31:48.665 --> 00:31:51.905
came from a woman's interpretation?

00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:54.265
Why can't it be a woman?

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:55.185
You…

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:19.985
Miss, prepare yourself

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:22.185
and come with me.

00:32:24.865 --> 00:32:26.145
Please.

00:32:27.465 --> 00:32:30.265
At the time, we didn't know

00:32:30.785 --> 00:32:33.465
what that summons meant.

00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:38.425
Yushu.

00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:41.745
Yushu.

00:32:42.905 --> 00:32:45.425
Yushu, don't ruin your hands.

00:32:46.705 --> 00:32:48.065
You still need to play the ruan.

00:32:48.945 --> 00:32:50.985
- I hate this so much!
- Yushu.

00:32:51.545 --> 00:32:52.425
Yushu!

00:32:56.145 --> 00:32:57.145
Thank you

00:32:58.345 --> 00:33:00.985
for not asking why Yushu cried

00:33:01.745 --> 00:33:02.665
or why she was reluctant.

00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:06.305
- She didn't want to remain in the palace.
- No.

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:08.305
We were going to leave

00:33:09.145 --> 00:33:11.905
and finally live freely.

00:33:13.265 --> 00:33:16.345
We planned to see snow in the eighth month

00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:19.665
and sail a thousand li
in a single day, just like in the poems.

00:33:20.265 --> 00:33:21.905
But after that night,

00:33:23.185 --> 00:33:27.985
she was forever trapped
within the palace as Lady Wang.

00:33:30.265 --> 00:33:32.905
Was Lady Wang's child the Emperor's?

00:33:35.785 --> 00:33:36.625
I don't know.

00:33:37.545 --> 00:33:39.865
Didn't you cause disturbances
at Hanliang Hall

00:33:39.945 --> 00:33:42.065
to make us discover her pregnancy?

00:33:42.905 --> 00:33:43.825
Yes.

00:33:44.545 --> 00:33:45.505
But I was never certain.

00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:47.465
Yushu never told me directly.

00:33:48.505 --> 00:33:51.185
I know that after moving to Hanliang Hall,

00:33:51.265 --> 00:33:52.665
she was never summoned again.

00:33:52.745 --> 00:33:56.185
I saw her become quieter,
pretending to be strong.

00:33:56.265 --> 00:34:00.025
She said she liked the peace,

00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:01.985
and that it gave her
plenty of time to work on music.

00:34:02.745 --> 00:34:05.185
But I knew she was
just trying to make me feel better.

00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:07.345
She did not mind being
neglected by His Majesty,

00:34:07.425 --> 00:34:11.145
but how could she
accept living out her days like that?

00:34:11.824 --> 00:34:12.945
She never talked about it,

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.344
so I kept quiet as well.

00:34:16.425 --> 00:34:18.545
In time, we just got used to it.

00:34:19.705 --> 00:34:21.105
But two months ago,

00:34:22.425 --> 00:34:23.545
she began to change.

00:34:32.145 --> 00:34:33.985
You have been coming less often.

00:34:35.425 --> 00:34:36.385
It's getting hot.

00:34:42.385 --> 00:34:44.145
I wrote something new. Take a look.

00:34:51.705 --> 00:34:53.945
CROSSING A THOUSAND MOUNTAINS

00:35:26.705 --> 00:35:29.145
You seem brighter lately.

00:35:29.785 --> 00:35:31.065
Did something good happen?

00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:39.425
Ahao,

00:35:40.265 --> 00:35:43.185
do you remember we once planned

00:35:43.985 --> 00:35:45.745
to travel the rivers and see the snow?

00:35:46.465 --> 00:35:47.305
Of course.

00:35:47.905 --> 00:35:50.025
In six months, you'll be able
to leave the palace.

00:35:50.865 --> 00:35:52.585
When that day comes,

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:54.945
you must go and do it all.

00:35:58.385 --> 00:35:59.265
I wish

00:36:00.025 --> 00:36:01.225
I could go with you.

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:06.105
I wish I could go with you.

00:36:09.305 --> 00:36:10.345
Actually,

00:36:11.385 --> 00:36:13.825
I sensed something was wrong
with her that day,

00:36:14.665 --> 00:36:16.465
but when I saw
she'd found new hope in life,

00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:17.705
I was happy for her

00:36:18.585 --> 00:36:20.025
and didn't think much of it.

00:36:21.745 --> 00:36:23.665
But when I saw her off…

00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:42.785
Yushu.

00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:45.185
You…

00:36:48.505 --> 00:36:49.785
After that,

00:36:50.505 --> 00:36:51.785
Yushu never came again.

00:36:52.865 --> 00:36:53.985
Musicians from the Music Office

00:36:54.625 --> 00:36:56.825
can only enter
the inner palace when summoned,

00:36:57.505 --> 00:36:59.025
so it was hard for me to see her again.

00:37:00.665 --> 00:37:02.345
The next news I heard of her

00:37:04.025 --> 00:37:05.545
was of her death.

00:37:07.345 --> 00:37:08.825
She was murdered.

00:37:09.425 --> 00:37:10.585
Why are you so certain?

00:37:11.865 --> 00:37:13.345
Yushu was always healthy.

00:37:13.425 --> 00:37:15.585
How could she die of a mere cold?

00:37:15.665 --> 00:37:19.065
Besides, she was pregnant
but didn't dare report it.

00:37:19.785 --> 00:37:20.825
I suspect…

00:37:22.305 --> 00:37:24.225
She must have been killed.

00:37:25.025 --> 00:37:26.265
I have to get justice for her.

00:37:26.345 --> 00:37:29.265
So that's why you caused disturbances
at Hanliang Hall?

00:37:30.905 --> 00:37:33.945
Before entering the palace,
I studied vocal mimicry.

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:36.505
I only meant to create some commotion.

00:37:37.145 --> 00:37:38.905
Even if the Palace Investigation Bureau
didn't react,

00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:40.665
the murderer would surely hear of it.

00:37:41.865 --> 00:37:43.145
As long as they reacted,

00:37:43.665 --> 00:37:45.505
- I could…
- You could what?

00:37:49.305 --> 00:37:52.145
There wasn't much more I could do.

00:37:52.985 --> 00:37:54.545
Did Lady Wang
have any other close friends?

00:37:55.385 --> 00:37:57.225
Back at the Music Office,

00:37:57.305 --> 00:37:58.945
she was always with me

00:37:59.905 --> 00:38:00.945
and never met with others alone.

00:38:01.025 --> 00:38:02.545
As for the situation after her promotion,

00:38:03.505 --> 00:38:04.345
I don't know.

00:38:05.025 --> 00:38:06.705
Do you still have the sachet
you mentioned earlier?

00:38:16.305 --> 00:38:17.425
I was going to give it back to her

00:38:19.225 --> 00:38:22.625
when she came to see me again.

00:38:25.425 --> 00:38:26.345
Here.

00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:38.945
Aside from this plectrum inside,
there's nothing special about the sachet.

00:38:39.025 --> 00:38:39.865
However…

00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:50.785
Let's go.

00:38:51.625 --> 00:38:52.585
Your Ladyship.

00:38:56.905 --> 00:38:57.745
When will you arrest me?

00:39:00.225 --> 00:39:02.825
Mr. Xiao has already driven out
the evil spirits at Hanliang Hall.

00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:04.705
The strange happenings are over.

00:39:04.785 --> 00:39:05.665
Why would I arrest you?

00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:08.825
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:40:39.785 --> 00:40:41.465
MUSIC OFFICE

00:40:41.545 --> 00:40:44.065
How did you realize Ahao was a woman?

00:40:44.625 --> 00:40:47.465
When we fought, I grabbed her wrist
and knew immediately.

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.225
Men and women
have different bone structures.

00:40:49.305 --> 00:40:50.305
That can't be disguised.

00:40:50.825 --> 00:40:53.265
But I knew
you'd figured it out before I did.

00:40:53.345 --> 00:40:55.825
I noticed from the way she stood up.

00:41:00.545 --> 00:41:02.665
So who won, Mr. Xiao?

00:41:03.385 --> 00:41:06.185
You caught her first, so you win.

00:41:06.265 --> 00:41:09.305
But you guessed right first.
I'd say it's your win.

00:41:10.185 --> 00:41:11.185
Let's call it a tie, then.

00:41:18.865 --> 00:41:20.625
Lady Wang's medical records
can't be taken out,

00:41:20.705 --> 00:41:21.545
so I copied them all down.

00:41:24.865 --> 00:41:26.385
SELECTED LADY WANG'S MEDICAL RECORDS

00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:27.865
That's it?

00:41:27.945 --> 00:41:28.945
This single page covers

00:41:29.025 --> 00:41:31.265
all her diagnoses and prescriptions
over the past six months.

00:41:31.905 --> 00:41:33.465
There's no record of pregnancy.

00:41:34.385 --> 00:41:35.585
"Died of a cold"?

00:41:36.985 --> 00:41:38.665
A 20-year-old woman's life,

00:41:38.745 --> 00:41:40.545
summed up in four words.

00:41:41.545 --> 00:41:42.905
What did the Medical Officer
in charge say?

00:41:42.985 --> 00:41:45.105
He returned to his hometown
to visit family ten days ago.

00:41:47.785 --> 00:41:51.385
In that case,
let's go ask Lady Wang herself.

00:42:04.265 --> 00:42:06.825
The dirt was intentional.
It's more convincing this way.

00:42:13.225 --> 00:42:15.105
This is the imperial mausoleum.
No trespassing.

00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:17.945
Do I look like a trespasser to you?

00:42:19.225 --> 00:42:20.185
Your Ladyship.

00:42:22.385 --> 00:42:24.425
This is Lady Wang's cousin.

00:42:24.505 --> 00:42:26.145
Lady Wang died young.

00:42:26.225 --> 00:42:29.185
His Majesty spared no effort
to locate her kin

00:42:29.265 --> 00:42:31.025
and gave him special permission
to pay his respects.

00:42:31.105 --> 00:42:34.585
Lady Wang has already been encoffined
and will be buried soon.

00:42:34.665 --> 00:42:37.585
If you wish to mourn her, Your Ladyship,

00:42:37.665 --> 00:42:40.105
you'll need to present
proof of permission.

00:42:40.185 --> 00:42:41.625
His Majesty is compassionate.

00:42:42.225 --> 00:42:44.345
The presence of Lady Wang's relative
is proof enough.

00:42:59.665 --> 00:43:02.145
{\an8}Wood shavings are highly flammable.
Be careful with the candle.

00:43:02.225 --> 00:43:04.145
{\an8}LATE SELECTED LADY WANG

00:43:04.225 --> 00:43:05.545
These are pine shavings,

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:07.025
used to keep out moisture and odors.

00:43:07.105 --> 00:43:09.425
But in this heat, they aren't much help.

00:43:16.825 --> 00:43:18.465
She suffered greatly before death.

00:43:18.985 --> 00:43:20.385
The contorted expression on her face

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:22.905
shows she died in pain.

00:43:23.705 --> 00:43:24.705
Mr. Xiao, please take notes for me.

00:43:27.385 --> 00:43:28.545
Eyes wide open.

00:43:28.625 --> 00:43:30.305
Jaw tightly clenched.

00:43:30.905 --> 00:43:31.945
Skin bluish.

00:43:33.065 --> 00:43:35.745
It seems the medical records
weren't truthful.

00:43:37.345 --> 00:43:38.385
So she didn't die of a cold?

00:43:40.025 --> 00:43:43.345
If she had,
her complexion would be sallow,

00:43:43.425 --> 00:43:45.265
with her eyes and mouth closed.

00:43:51.705 --> 00:43:55.065
Fortunately, the ice
has slowed down the decay.

00:43:57.225 --> 00:44:00.865
There are no obvious wounds
or signs of impact,

00:44:02.105 --> 00:44:02.945
but…

00:44:07.545 --> 00:44:09.385
the skin is covered with red spots.

00:44:10.905 --> 00:44:11.745
A rash?

00:44:12.585 --> 00:44:13.945
It doesn't look like a surface rash.

00:44:14.705 --> 00:44:16.065
It's more like subcutaneous bleeding.

00:44:29.465 --> 00:44:31.985
So Your Ladyship didn't buy
the flatbreads as offerings.

00:44:34.465 --> 00:44:37.465
If it were only a rash,
heating wouldn't change anything.

00:44:38.065 --> 00:44:39.945
Was it injury or poisoning?

00:44:43.585 --> 00:44:45.585
The underside of the tongue is black.
It was poisoning.

00:44:52.905 --> 00:44:54.785
The body's starting to decompose.
It's hard to tell much by touch.

00:45:08.545 --> 00:45:10.225
So Lady Wang died of poisoning.

00:45:11.385 --> 00:45:13.105
The poison left only subtle traces

00:45:13.185 --> 00:45:15.625
that would've been missed
without an autopsy.

00:45:16.145 --> 00:45:17.785
{\an8}But the two maids said

00:45:17.865 --> 00:45:19.865
{\an8}Lady Wang had no enemies.

00:45:19.945 --> 00:45:21.505
Why would someone poison her?

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:24.345
Hate isn't the only reason people kill.
