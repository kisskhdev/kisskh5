Duanmu Zhi.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.340
This is all your fault.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.739
Xiao Man and I were just about

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.300
to make up when you barged in.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.299
Now look, she's angry again.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.820
You deal with it yourself.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.620
At the time,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.259
I was only trying
to protect Your Majesty.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.659
Did I ask for your protection?

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.660
You...

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.619
The memorials have been sorted.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.100
Please review them.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.020
Give me that memorial.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.100
Xiao Man...

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.020
Xiao Man.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.580
I've already been punished.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.580
I shall take my leave.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.500
What?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.580
I take my leave now!

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.940
Xiao Man.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.900
I have something
very important to explain to you.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.860
Your Majesty did nothing wrong.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.060
You safety concerns the realm.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.019
You couldn't be certain
whether I'd betray you,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.899
so you made preparations in advance.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.260
It was the most prudent plan

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.379
and the most
responsible choice for Great Qian.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.500
Xiao Man...

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.740
What you just said

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.540
was better than all the excuses
I spent all night preparing.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.700
Since you understand me so well,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.540
don't be angry anymore.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.820
I'm not angry with Your Majesty.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.299
Whatever duties Your Majesty assigns,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.380
I'll carry them out
with utmost diligence.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.339
I've never neglected my post
over personal feelings.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.560
And you say you're not angry?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.499
You won't talk to me,
you won't even look at me.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.060
I'm mad at Chu Ying.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.699
I chose to return to your side.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.820
That means
I chose the risks of serving you.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.619
I know

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.539
that to survive
in the palace all these years,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.260
you had to guard against everyone.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.499
But...

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.580
But not against you.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.060
I didn't.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.900
If you don't believe me, look.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.820
No!

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.940
This arrow is made of glutinous rice.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.820
The arrows aimed at you last night
were all like this.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.700
I've been meaning to explain.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.860
I never intended to hurt you.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.140
Rice arrows?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.820
Yes.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.220
Have you forgotten?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.500
I learned this trick that scares
but doesn't harm

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.220
from you three years ago.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.857
(Three years ago,
8th Year of Hongzheng Reign)

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.939
Brother,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.980
am I really that bad with the sword?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.179
Sister,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.379
you might not have the talent

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.540
for refined weapons

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.380
like bows and longswords.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.980
Just tell her the truth.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.700
Use the same words
your mother used on you.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.019
Your swordsmanship

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.699
is so awful it makes me sick.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.619
Keep practising.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.300
Improve, or face military punishment!

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.660
Mujun,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.140
a letter from the young emperor.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.420
Train first.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.540
Yes.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.859
Sister,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.539
for you,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.979
you could try weapons
like a spear or a lance.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.859
For you,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.259
they'd count as agile and manageable.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.420
Pick one.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.179
Sister,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.899
heavy weapons like these

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.140
don't really suit a young lady like you.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.540
Why don't you choose another weapon?

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.459
Uncle,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.580
Brother,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.180
may I read the letter now?

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.700
Alright.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.140
Mu Yu, come.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.779
Come inside with me.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.899
The matter is important.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.860
Alright.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.300
Write a few
pleasing words to the emperor.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.059
Uncle,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.180
have you checked
the contents of the letter?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.460
I have.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.860
Nothing unusual.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.260
Now, to business.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.819
At past Ploughing Ceremonies,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.020
the young emperor was
always guarded closely.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.620
But this year, to avoid crowds

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.059
disrupting the fields,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.820
I've withdrawn the guards.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.300
As for what to do,

00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:14.100
I'm sure you understand.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.620
I do.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.100
We'll use this chance

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.980
to kill the young emperor.

00:06:45.075 --> 00:06:46.195
(Chu Ying...)

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.340
(Are you safe?)

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.860
Xiao Man...

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.020
Are you safe?

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.499
Assassins!

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.380
Rice arrow...

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.380
Quick!

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.540
Stop!

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.459
But,

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.179
Your Majesty...

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.860
I said stop, so stop.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.420
Stand down.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.940
Yes.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.140
Move.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.899
(Do not attend the ceremony.)

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.020
(Danger.)

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.739
Though at the time,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.020
I didn't see your face very clearly,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.940
I was certain

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.340
the masked figure
who passed me that warning

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.900
was you.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.219
And I

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.940
was certain that I could never harm you.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.060
Just aiming an arrow at you

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.420
was enough to make my heart tremble.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.580
Later, I found out

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.219
that at the Ploughing Ceremony,

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.660
the one who tried to kill me

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.020
might've been Jia Yi.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.580
Honestly,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.940
learning that a loved one
tried to kill me

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.140
felt like knives in my heart.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.660
Your godfather has been by your side
since you were six.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.860
Back then, we hadn't even met yet.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.020
That's right.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.820
He was the one
who raised me at his side.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.140
But he's not the same now.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.100
Xiao Man...

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.420
What was Jia Yi's connection

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.900
with the Zhen clan?

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.580
Was he from the Zhen clan?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.940
Do you know

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.420
what it means to have
a whole clan executed?

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.980
An

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.740
entire

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.220
clan

00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.900
executed.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.380
Has His Majesty

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.500
begun to suspect me?

00:10:24.775 --> 00:10:25.895
Uncle,

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.219
Chu Ying has already

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.059
agreed to clear the Zhen clan's name.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.139
Your plan

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.740
can stop here.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.860
Xiao Man...

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.940
That is absolutely impossible.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.219
I won't stop
just because their case is overturned.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.260
Nor will Mu Yu.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.140
However,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.460
I no longer want his life.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.340
What I want...

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.420
is to seize the throne!
