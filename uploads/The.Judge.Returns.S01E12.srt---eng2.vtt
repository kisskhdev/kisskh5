00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:35.056
THE JUDGE RETURNS

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:38.225
EPISODE 12

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:55.451
Please open your arms.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.168
Your phone, please.

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:09.882
Please follow me.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:22.770
Hello, sir.

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:27.942
We've met, haven't we?

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:29.610
Yes.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.031
I heard you'd be taking
Tae-sik's case in court.

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:36.200
That's new to me.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.078
You'll hear about it soon enough.

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.336
The limit is 500 million won per year.

00:01:57.847 --> 00:02:00.808
I'd like you to sentence him
to five years in prison.

00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:05.813
And he'll get the three-and-five sentence
in the appeals trial.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:07.773
A three-year sentence, suspended for five.

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:11.527
That's nothing new, you know?

00:02:13.863 --> 00:02:16.949
Unless you want to check
how I spend every penny of this

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.618
you can give the money to me in cash
after the trial.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:21.036
No need to leave traces.

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:28.085
Have a good day.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:32.673
My phone, please.

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:41.974
I met Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon.

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:44.685
He told me to sentence Tae-sik
to five years in jail

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.188
while handing a credit card
with a 500 million won limit.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.275
He can be so impatient.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.068
Five years in the first trial

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:55.654
and three years in prison
with five years on suspension in the next.

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:57.740
That's the magic formula
for conglomerates.

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:00.034
- So?
- Tae-sik's case involves

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:02.495
a few hundred billion won
with the illicit loans and slush funds.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:05.289
It's not a case to be handled
by a single-judge criminal court.

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:08.709
I didn't answer him,
as I didn't have your permission yet.

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:13.881
Tae-sik will soon be indicted
while in custody.

00:03:15.174 --> 00:03:17.802
A panel of judges will take on the case,
so sort it out there.

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:20.596
Don't worry about the lead judge.

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.765
Conduct a legal review
and finalize the sentencing order.

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.811
Oh, you might as well be promoted
to a Presiding Judge for this.

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:30.648
But I'm not sure

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:33.275
how long his sentence should be.

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:38.197
Sin-jin has no interest
in giving Yong-hyeon what he wants.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.199
Give me an answer,
and that'll be my verdict.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.451
Didn't you hear me?

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.329
I thought I'd already answered you.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:52.044
I'll follow the law.

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:54.088
But wouldn't that cause issues?

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:56.674
Don't look for justice
through questions and debates.

00:03:57.132 --> 00:03:58.467
Show me your justice

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:01.095
the equity and common sense

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:05.224
that everyone knows in their hearts.

00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:10.396
I was going to get rid of them all

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:12.982
once I became the leader of Suojae,
anyway.

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:17.278
You may go.

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:20.406
Yes, sir.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:31.250
Have you decided?

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:39.174
Mr. Jang has more accounts under an alias,
aside from those at Jeongdaun.

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:41.218
I'll give you half of the funds there.

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:43.679
So, 20 billion won. But promise me...

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.852
I'll be safe

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:52.187
after all this.

00:04:54.023 --> 00:04:55.065
Of course.

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:57.610
Tell Yong-hyeon

00:04:58.611 --> 00:05:01.030
exactly what he wants to hear.

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:06.076
Let Tae-sik take the fall
for the slush funds

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.662
but you take care of the illicit loans

00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:10.956
without Tae-sik hearing about them.

00:05:15.544 --> 00:05:18.380
Think of it as being extra loyal.

00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:20.591
Come on.

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.010
Open an account.

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:26.513
I'll give you a bonus.

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:28.474
Sir...

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:33.062
I might lose my license to practice law.

00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:39.109
You don't earn much
with that license, anyway.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.113
I'm your pot of gold, not your license.

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:45.282
Me, Jang Yong-hyeon.

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:47.826
Trust me.

00:05:48.577 --> 00:05:50.537
Judge Lee has been assigned to the case

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.332
and Mr. Kang told him to sentence Tae-sik
to five years in jail.

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:57.211
As he should.

00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:00.172
Make sure your testimony matches

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:02.257
that of the loan officer
at Jeongdaun Savings.

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:06.136
And make sure Tae-sik isn't involved
in the illicit loans.

00:06:06.804 --> 00:06:08.347
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, sir.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.726
You're basically family to S Group now.

00:06:13.978 --> 00:06:14.979
Congratulations.

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:18.023
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.173
We're representing Mr. Jang,
the CEO of S Shopping, in court.

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.510
Han-young will be on the panel of judges.

00:06:49.722 --> 00:06:50.931
He may be an associate judge

00:06:51.015 --> 00:06:54.059
but he'll dictate the verdict.

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:58.230
Make a team and take on Tae-sik's case.

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:01.275
Me?

00:07:02.735 --> 00:07:04.319
- Really?
- Why are you so surprised?

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:06.071
It's about time you get some experience.

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:09.158
Maybe start dressing up, too.

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:14.997
Are you on the panel of judges
for Mr. Jang's trial?

00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:18.417
Haenal Law Firm is really in
on all the secrets.

00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:19.710
Of course.

00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:22.379
Dad wants me to make a team
to represent him.

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:26.717
Eat up. It's on me today.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.470
If this is your bribe for Mr. Jang's case,
I don't want it.

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:34.183
Have you already forgotten about my help
with the Miracle scam?

00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:37.394
You asked for a meal at my house
in return for your help

00:07:37.478 --> 00:07:39.146
which you got.

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:42.191
That means neither of us owes anything
to each other, Ms. Yu.

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:44.318
Fine.

00:07:44.401 --> 00:07:45.736
I get it.

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:48.864
But why do you keep calling me "Ms. Yu"?
It's like we're strangers.

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:50.824
Are you distancing yourself from me?

00:07:53.035 --> 00:07:54.453
Seriously.

00:07:54.536 --> 00:07:55.871
I just want to...

00:07:55.954 --> 00:07:57.915
Gosh, I wish I could just punch you once.

00:07:57.998 --> 00:07:59.124
Just one punch, please?

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:01.919
Why? Was the slap on our first date
not enough?

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:03.712
I should've hit you more then.

00:08:03.796 --> 00:08:05.380
Don't take Tae-sik's case.

00:08:05.464 --> 00:08:07.800
I've already agreed to take it.

00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:11.512
Mr. Kang is behind Han-young joining
the panel of judges.

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:14.139
He's got S Group's back.

00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:16.892
It'll just be
a five-year sentence in prison

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.977
so just don't mess up.

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:20.729
Aren't you sentencing him
to five years in jail?

00:08:22.564 --> 00:08:24.399
We'll bust S Group entirely

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:26.819
starting from Tae-sik
to his father's slush funds.

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:29.530
We're shaking up the whole conglomerate,
so don't get involved.

00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:31.698
Really?

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:38.580
Yes, Lee Han-young speaking.

00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:43.919
I made Yi-seok the Chief Justice,
as you suggested.

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:47.005
Looks like you'll soon have
the Chief Justice as your legal advisor.

00:08:47.548 --> 00:08:48.632
Congratulations.

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:54.054
I once ran

00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:56.557
like there was no tomorrow.

00:08:57.141 --> 00:08:59.852
Are you a professional runner?

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:00.936
No.

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:04.857
If you're not a professional

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:07.526
why are you running so hard?

00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:11.238
What?

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:17.411
I couldn't answer him.

00:09:17.494 --> 00:09:19.705
I didn't know why I was running so hard.

00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:25.294
And I definitely didn't know
when to stop or where I was.

00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:29.548
But I started living a different life

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:34.094
and finally realized
why I had to keep running.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:40.517
I know why I have to keep running now.

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:44.688
To become a better person

00:09:46.732 --> 00:09:48.066
for my family

00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:51.695
and the person I love.

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:54.323
And for myself.

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:07.127
What kind of a life

00:10:09.546 --> 00:10:11.048
did you live before?

00:10:12.966 --> 00:10:14.259
Someone said

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.011
I was garbage.

00:10:16.637 --> 00:10:17.930
"Garbage"?

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:21.308
Come on. There's no way.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.481
Don't take Tae-sik's case.

00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:30.609
Let your brother or sister take it.
Let them be greedy.

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:32.736
Is it

00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:35.322
really that bad of a case?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.745
What do you want to do

00:10:42.663 --> 00:10:44.790
once the law firm becomes yours?

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:51.296
Well...

00:10:55.092 --> 00:10:56.343
That's...

00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:18.073
Why didn't I think of that?

00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:32.462
Let's go.

00:11:32.713 --> 00:11:33.714
Let's run!

We have to turn it on.

CHAIRMAN KANG SUN-CHEOL

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:12.377
- Huh?
- What's wrong?

00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:14.671
The password is "123456."

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.214
It's basically unlocked.

00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:17.758
- Huh?
- What?

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:19.176
Go ahead.

00:12:23.305 --> 00:12:25.182

Mission accomplished.

00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:22.823
Hey, Mr. Park.

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:25.575
I'll send the fraudulent ledgers
from Seonjin to you.

00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:27.369
Okay.

LETTER OF INDICTMENT
YOU ARE INDICTED AS STATED BELOW

00:13:56.398 --> 00:13:57.983
PRINT

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.912
CHIEF PROSECUTOR KANG JI-HWAN

00:14:10.996 --> 00:14:12.497
DETAILS REGARDING THE DEFENDANT

00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:14.791
What's this?

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.169
He takes money from elders
who collect scraps

00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:19.671
and kids who collect every penny they get

00:14:19.754 --> 00:14:21.798
for his drinking parties every night.

00:14:21.882 --> 00:14:24.718
Don't you know
giving non-profits a bad rep like this

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:27.137
makes people stop donating,
even to good charities?

00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:30.474
Think of it as an opportunity cost
for our society and stop here.

00:14:30.557 --> 00:14:31.558
Our society?

00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:34.519
For whom in our society?

00:14:35.854 --> 00:14:38.148
A significant portion
of the donations goes

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:42.694
to a borrowed-name account
of an unidentified person.

00:14:42.777 --> 00:14:44.696
I told you to stop, alright?

00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:02.297
Do you get a share of the donations, too?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.133
Cheol-woo!

00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:11.389
Do you want to get fired right now?

00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:14.017
You want me to leave you
with absolutely nothing?

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.936
Why can't you just say it's not true?

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:18.063
It's not true, you bastard!

00:15:18.563 --> 00:15:19.648
Who gets the money, then?

00:15:22.692 --> 00:15:25.612
Why are you asking me?

00:15:27.572 --> 00:15:29.074
Get this out of my face

00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:31.535
unless you want to get fired right now.

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:45.882
Our country's prosecution is rotten.

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:47.551
Why? Were you told you'd be fired?

00:15:48.969 --> 00:15:51.012
- Did you spy on me?
- I didn't need to.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.931
Here comes another one.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.732
Daejin Daily says

00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:04.901
we can't publish a word about this.

00:16:04.985 --> 00:16:09.322
And the reporters from other agencies ran
the minute I mentioned the foundation.

00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:13.827
They don't want to tackle Seonjin
because Gwang-to is the face.

00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:17.998
Does that make any sense to you?

00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.209
Those who don't know
what Gwang-to is really like think

00:16:21.293 --> 00:16:24.379
he's just a kind, former President
who always thinks of his people.

00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:28.300
Cheer up.
You knew it wasn't going to work.

00:16:28.383 --> 00:16:29.718
- No, I didn't!
- No, I didn't!

00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:31.386
I was sure we could do this.

00:16:31.469 --> 00:16:32.637
We found fraudulent ledgers!

00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:34.347
How can we not investigate it?

00:16:37.809 --> 00:16:40.437
Did you tell us to do this,
knowing we'd fail?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.480
Did you really?

00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:47.777
The corrupt are resilient.
It only hardens under outside pressure.

00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:50.530
To break it, we have to trigger
a fracture from the inside.

00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:53.950
Now that they know
the press and the prosecution are on it

00:16:54.034 --> 00:16:55.493
they'll start to get on it, too.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.287
Then, once they realize

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.372
things aren't going as they'd expected

00:16:59.456 --> 00:17:01.124
they'll start to split up.

00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:04.711
Then, the corrupt will finally break.

00:17:05.754 --> 00:17:07.672
You used us as baits.

00:17:07.756 --> 00:17:09.799
He definitely did.

00:17:09.883 --> 00:17:11.551
I guess I'm the hook.

00:17:11.635 --> 00:17:13.762
Are you the worm?

00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:15.972
- Don't put it like that.
- No, krill.

00:17:16.765 --> 00:17:18.350
I don't know how he got it

00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:19.434
but Prosecutor Park has

00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:22.145
the Seonjin Foundation's
fraudulent ledgers.

00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:24.522
I don't think he's going to stop.

00:17:26.775 --> 00:17:29.944
We should've gotten rid of him
when we got rid of Jeong-tae.

00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:33.823
It'll get messy if he keeps this up.

00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:38.370
Should we get on it now?

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:42.332
I hear Cheol-woo is asking
to investigate the foundation.

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:46.961
If anything happens now,
the whole world will watch them.

00:17:52.092 --> 00:17:53.843
We have no choice

00:17:55.553 --> 00:17:56.888
but to face it.

00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:14.406
We've never met, have we?

00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:17.867
No, but I know who you are.

00:18:29.254 --> 00:18:30.714
There's an opportunity cost

00:18:31.256 --> 00:18:32.841
to establishing justice.

00:18:36.219 --> 00:18:39.347
Does it also cost people's lives?

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.770
That's not nice.

00:18:46.646 --> 00:18:49.232
I didn't know there was a price tag
to achieving justice.

00:18:53.153 --> 00:18:55.155
What's justice to you, Mr. Park?

00:18:55.822 --> 00:18:57.949
Arresting all bad guys, no matter what.

00:18:58.366 --> 00:18:59.743
That's what justice is to me.

00:19:00.952 --> 00:19:02.162
I like how simple it is.

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:06.666
You want to strike the Seonjin Foundation?
I can help you.

00:19:08.752 --> 00:19:11.671
Arrest the Chairman
for embezzlement and breach of trust.

00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:15.550
Would that establish justice for you?

00:19:17.677 --> 00:19:20.972
He's using the Chairman as a sacrifice
for the foundation.

00:19:23.308 --> 00:19:24.434
What do you think?

00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:30.523
Let's accept the sacrifice first,
as Sin-jin wants.

00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:32.192
And then?

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:34.944
We'll sprinkle salt
before the wound heals.

00:19:55.715 --> 00:19:57.926
Kwak Sang-cheol,
the opposition party's hitman.

00:19:58.384 --> 00:19:59.844
He's known as the "crazy dog"

00:19:59.928 --> 00:20:02.555
for all his bluntly honest whistleblowing
and slander.

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:06.768
Mr. Lee Han-young?

00:20:08.144 --> 00:20:09.604
Thank you for coming.

00:20:11.815 --> 00:20:15.652
The future son-in-law of Haenal
wants to discuss party nominations.

00:20:15.735 --> 00:20:17.695
Who would say no to that?

00:20:18.947 --> 00:20:20.573
I'm guessing it's not for free.

00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:23.660
I need you to attack someone.

00:20:25.703 --> 00:20:28.873
I guess Haenal has an enemy?

00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:31.501
No, this has nothing to do
with the law firm.

00:20:31.918 --> 00:20:32.961
The target is

00:20:33.503 --> 00:20:35.171
Park Gwang-to, the former President.

00:20:40.552 --> 00:20:41.928
Are you out of your mind?

00:20:42.011 --> 00:20:44.973
Your ammo is corruption
in the Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

00:20:46.015 --> 00:20:47.475
Mr. Former President isn't a man

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:50.603
who will fall with just one shot.

00:20:50.687 --> 00:20:53.147
But he'll reek of blood
where the bullet hits him.

00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:54.607
And that's enough for me.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.069
Oh, so

00:20:58.736 --> 00:21:01.656
I'll leave him a scar,
and you'll rip it open?

00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:04.409
Okay, I see what you want now.

00:21:04.492 --> 00:21:07.704
How can you guarantee
that my party will nominate me?

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:10.290
You'll be the hitman of the opposition

00:21:10.373 --> 00:21:13.001
who uncovers
the former President's misconduct.

00:21:14.335 --> 00:21:18.089
That'll earn you all the popularity
to become a presidential candidate.

00:21:20.383 --> 00:21:21.509
What?

00:21:22.677 --> 00:21:26.180
So, I have to do all the work
to get what I want?

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.766
But I'll give you all the tools
for the job.

00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:44.032
ACCOUNTING LEDGER

00:21:47.076 --> 00:21:48.328
Wow.

00:21:49.787 --> 00:21:51.164
This is some consistent effort

00:21:52.749 --> 00:21:54.959
involving some big money.

00:21:57.128 --> 00:21:58.421
I know.

00:22:06.262 --> 00:22:07.388
You know

00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:12.852
I always wished I'd gone to school.

00:22:12.936 --> 00:22:15.897
So, I collected scraps and sold them
to save money.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:21.569
I donated that
to the Seonjin Happiness Foundation

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.698
in hopes that it'll help students
who can't afford education.

00:22:26.866 --> 00:22:28.451
But look at this.

00:22:28.534 --> 00:22:29.744
My gosh.

00:22:30.787 --> 00:22:32.246
They took that money

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.375
to drink at hostess bars

00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:38.336
for millions of won a night!

00:22:39.003 --> 00:22:41.881
How can this be real?

00:22:41.965 --> 00:22:43.341
Unbelievable...

00:22:43.424 --> 00:22:45.510
MR. PARK GWANG-TO!
WHAT'S YOUR CONNECTION TO THE FOUNDATION?

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.387
I can't believe it.

00:22:48.012 --> 00:22:50.056
I've been fooled. Unbelievable.

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:52.558
PRESS CONFERENCE FOR KANG YEONG-BEOM,
WHO DONATED TO THE FRAUDULENT NON-PROFIT

00:22:52.642 --> 00:22:55.186
MR. PARK GWANG-TO!
WHAT'S YOUR CONNECTION TO THE FOUNDATION?

00:22:58.523 --> 00:23:00.483
It takes a cart full of scraps

00:23:00.566 --> 00:23:02.568
to make 10,000 won

00:23:03.403 --> 00:23:05.113
at the junkyard.

00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:09.951
Mr. Kang worked tirelessly for that money

00:23:10.702 --> 00:23:14.789
only for all of it to be spent
on the Chairman's night of drinking.

00:23:16.207 --> 00:23:18.292
Not only do I feel enraged

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:21.629
but more than that,
I also feel Mr. Kang's despair and pain.

00:23:22.588 --> 00:23:23.715
Therefore

00:23:24.757 --> 00:23:27.677
I'd like to ask Mr. Park Gwang-to,
the former President.

00:23:28.428 --> 00:23:29.637
Mr. Park

00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:36.019
what's your connection
to the Seonjin Happiness Foundation?

00:23:37.603 --> 00:23:39.856
Each month, 10% of the donations are seen

00:23:39.939 --> 00:23:43.234
getting withdrawn
to a borrowed-name account.

00:23:43.317 --> 00:23:45.194
Does that account belong to you?

00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:47.196
Bang!

00:23:50.408 --> 00:23:52.952
Who owns the borrowed-name account

00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:55.663
that takes 10% of all donations?

00:23:56.164 --> 00:23:58.166
Answer me, Mr. Park.

00:23:58.249 --> 00:24:00.418
To whom does the account belong?

00:24:00.668 --> 00:24:03.629
- Whose account is it?
- Answer us!

00:24:05.214 --> 00:24:06.340
I'm sorry.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.099
Mr. President!

00:24:15.308 --> 00:24:17.185
I'm so deeply sorry...

00:24:17.351 --> 00:24:19.520
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:24.525
I'm sorry. I can't believe what I've done.

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:33.910
Damn you!

00:24:35.036 --> 00:24:36.120
I'm sorry.

00:24:39.373 --> 00:24:41.626
What's your plan?

00:24:41.793 --> 00:24:43.669
The Deputy Prosecutor General is
on our side

00:24:43.753 --> 00:24:45.713
so you won't get an arrest warrant.

00:24:47.632 --> 00:24:48.633
And the press?

00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:50.384
Don't worry.

00:24:50.468 --> 00:24:52.929
Every news agency has
some sort of a lawsuit.

00:24:54.305 --> 00:24:56.516
Sang-cheol, that crazy bastard!

00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:59.227
I should've gotten rid of him sooner!

00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:01.312
When the time is right

00:25:02.063 --> 00:25:05.608
beat him and skin him.

00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:06.984
Yes, sir.

00:25:10.863 --> 00:25:12.657
It's Mr. Do, my assistant.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.575
- Pick it up!
- Yes, sir.

00:25:16.702 --> 00:25:17.745
Hey, it's me.

00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:19.580
What?

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.544
They're doing a search and seizure.

00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:26.003
- A search and seizure?
- Yes, sir.

00:25:26.629 --> 00:25:27.797
Hang up, you bastard!

00:25:30.842 --> 00:25:32.593
Mr. Kang!

00:25:32.677 --> 00:25:35.012
Mr. Kang...

00:25:35.096 --> 00:25:36.931
What's going on?

00:25:37.014 --> 00:25:38.599
Take everything from there.

00:25:38.683 --> 00:25:39.934
There's a second floor, right?

00:25:40.434 --> 00:25:41.894
This is the prosecution.

00:25:41.978 --> 00:25:43.855
We're doing a search and seizure
of the Seonjin Happiness Foundation.

00:25:43.938 --> 00:25:45.148
Please cooperate with us.

00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:46.858
Stay calm and collect everything.

00:25:51.362 --> 00:25:52.947
Please stop.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.199
- This is mine.
- Please stop it.

00:25:56.033 --> 00:25:57.160
What's going on?

00:25:58.035 --> 00:26:01.455
Is the Deputy Prosecutor General crazy?

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:03.332
Call him right now. Hurry.

00:26:03.749 --> 00:26:05.251
It's the Deputy Prosecutor General.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.381
What?

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.638
This morning,
the prosecution did a search and seizure

00:26:17.722 --> 00:26:20.725
of the Seonjin Happiness Foundation
and seven of its facilities

00:26:20.808 --> 00:26:22.810
to investigate alleged corruptions.

00:26:22.894 --> 00:26:25.438
Chairman Kang Sun-cheol
of the foundation is

00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:26.898
- under an arrest warrant
- Are you kidding?

00:26:26.981 --> 00:26:28.900
- breach of trust and embezzlement.
- Pass it.

00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:30.902
According to the prosecution...

00:26:30.985 --> 00:26:33.529
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

00:26:33.821 --> 00:26:36.741
Take back the arrest warrant right now

00:26:36.824 --> 00:26:39.035
and stop the search and seizure
of my foundation!

00:26:40.328 --> 00:26:41.329
What?

00:26:42.038 --> 00:26:43.039
Who?

00:26:44.081 --> 00:26:45.499
The President's order?

00:26:47.627 --> 00:26:51.005
The former President, Park Gwang-to,
is allegedly involved in land speculation.

00:26:51.172 --> 00:26:52.173
This morning

00:26:52.256 --> 00:26:54.217
the prosecution received
government documents

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.178
about Hanyang City's plans
to clear the green belt for development.

00:26:57.511 --> 00:26:59.096
According to the investigation

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.390
the former President got tipped
during his term

00:27:01.474 --> 00:27:02.475
and purchased

00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:04.727
some land in Hanyang in advance.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.020
And a part of the money came

00:27:06.103 --> 00:27:08.606
from the borrowed-name account connected
to Seonjin...

00:27:08.689 --> 00:27:09.941
I'm sorry.

00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:14.278
Why do something you know is wrong?

00:27:18.366 --> 00:27:19.367
Damn it!

00:27:21.577 --> 00:27:24.497
Please forgive me, sir.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.042
Allegations of leaking the documents
regarding Hanyang City's development plans

00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:30.711
have led to questions
of every politician's involvement.

00:27:30.795 --> 00:27:34.006
The prosecution announced its discovery
of 12 lots of land in Hanyang

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.803
purchased by Mr. Park Gwang-to
and his acquaintances.

00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:40.680
Just two months ago

00:27:40.763 --> 00:27:43.099
the government announced
that this area would be...

00:27:43.182 --> 00:27:44.267
Sin-jin

00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:47.645
it's your time to shine now.

00:27:50.106 --> 00:27:53.025
NEW CITY PLANNING FOR HANYANG
AND CLEARING OF THE GREEN BELT IN 2027

00:28:01.075 --> 00:28:02.201
TO THE NEWS DIRECTOR OF KOREA N

00:28:02.285 --> 00:28:03.286
SOCIAL AFFAIRS MOBILE TEAM 2

00:28:06.872 --> 00:28:08.499
- For the Digital News Team.
- Okay.

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:11.085
For the News Division.

00:28:12.295 --> 00:28:13.337
For the Digital News Team.

00:28:13.713 --> 00:28:14.755
TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIGITAL NEWS TEAM

00:28:19.218 --> 00:28:20.511
ALLEGATIONS OF FORMER PRESIDENT PARK
BUYING LAND FOR SPECULATION

00:28:20.845 --> 00:28:22.888
You can chop the tree or set it on fire

00:28:22.972 --> 00:28:25.683
with Gwang-to hanging on
for his dear life.

00:28:26.517 --> 00:28:27.852
Do whatever you want.

00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:38.154
Whatever!

00:28:38.446 --> 00:28:41.240
I can't believe Mr. Park has been summoned
for questioning.

00:28:41.324 --> 00:28:43.367
It can't get crazier than that.

00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:48.039
That's great for Mr. Jang Tae-sik.

00:28:48.122 --> 00:28:50.249
The world will forget about him
and focus on this.

00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:55.004
You sure you won't regret it?

00:28:56.464 --> 00:29:00.384
Yeah, I don't want an easy case
from the start.

00:29:00.468 --> 00:29:01.635
It's boring.

00:29:02.178 --> 00:29:03.179
Right?

00:29:03.888 --> 00:29:06.015
I know you don't like boring stuff.

00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:09.643
Start by going to law school
if you want to take on real cases.

00:29:11.771 --> 00:29:14.607
Jin-gwang, you can form your team
for Mr. Jang's case.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:15.691
Okay!

00:29:15.775 --> 00:29:18.402
We've already talked to Judge Lee,
so no need to talk to him.

00:29:24.325 --> 00:29:25.493
Gosh.

00:29:35.503 --> 00:29:38.381
Nam-yong came to see me.

00:29:39.215 --> 00:29:41.801
He mentioned you and Judge Lee.

00:29:44.804 --> 00:29:45.846
Why did you do that?

00:29:46.806 --> 00:29:49.392
You were the one who suggested me
to nominate Nam-yong

00:29:49.809 --> 00:29:51.227
as the next Chief Justice.

00:29:54.397 --> 00:29:57.483
Our plans were all ruined
by his son turning himself in.

00:29:59.068 --> 00:30:01.362
Had it not been for his son

00:30:01.445 --> 00:30:03.072
he would've become the Chief Justice.

00:30:05.658 --> 00:30:08.953
I won't ask about Judge Lee
and his little revenge.

00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:11.414
But you know

00:30:11.497 --> 00:30:12.498
if, by any chance

00:30:13.082 --> 00:30:15.543
this affects me in any way

00:30:16.168 --> 00:30:18.963
you'll be in trouble, too.

00:30:20.548 --> 00:30:22.425
You're the leader of Suojae.

00:30:23.175 --> 00:30:26.303
Suojae can only survive if you do.

00:30:33.102 --> 00:30:34.603
The Seoul Central District Court.

00:30:35.187 --> 00:30:36.355
Be in charge of it.

00:30:36.439 --> 00:30:38.524
A Senior Presiding Judge won't be enough

00:30:39.108 --> 00:30:41.569
to save me from any trouble.

00:30:49.452 --> 00:30:50.453
Come in.

00:31:13.142 --> 00:31:16.061
Does he look like a traitor to you?

00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:21.275
You've chosen him to be your sidekick.
Trust him.

00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:24.111
He has dark intentions

00:31:24.195 --> 00:31:26.864
just like everyone else
coming in and out of here.

00:31:29.783 --> 00:31:30.784
Okay

00:31:33.412 --> 00:31:34.914
how about this one?

00:31:47.384 --> 00:31:49.094
He doesn't look like the traitor type.

00:31:50.638 --> 00:31:51.680
Hmm?

00:31:59.146 --> 00:32:01.982
Who knew this issue would get so big?

00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:06.529
Didn't expect my chance to come so soon.

00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:11.867
PROSECUTION SERVICE

00:32:48.862 --> 00:32:50.614
You can sit there.

00:32:56.078 --> 00:32:59.123
Sorry, our hands were tied by the press.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.417
Man, this is exhausting.

00:33:09.091 --> 00:33:11.677
It'll take some time.

00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.807
I know that much, too.

00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:22.646
Does 2 a.m. sound good?

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.648
Yes, sir. Once again, I apologize.

00:33:38.537 --> 00:33:40.247
17-8, Jima-ro 38beon-gil

00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:41.790
CHOI DA-EUN, MISSING
OH MIN-SU, DEAD FROM A HEART ATTACK

00:33:48.547 --> 00:33:50.215
Nobody lives there.

00:33:51.967 --> 00:33:55.471
Doesn't Ms. Han Gi-hyeon live here?
The teenager in high school.

00:33:56.096 --> 00:33:58.140
She died last year.

00:33:58.223 --> 00:33:59.308
Got hit by a car.

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:01.060
Sorry?

00:34:03.937 --> 00:34:06.315
Excuse me.

00:34:13.822 --> 00:34:17.284
Why are you going to every empty home?
Aren't you a reporter?

00:34:18.369 --> 00:34:21.997
Doesn't Ms. Han Jong-hui,
the college student, live here?

00:34:22.915 --> 00:34:23.957
College student?

00:34:25.042 --> 00:34:26.251
Right.

00:34:26.877 --> 00:34:30.464
She would've been in college,
had she been alive.

00:34:31.548 --> 00:34:33.592
Are you saying...

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.222
Mr. Lee, Seonjin seems to have used
the names of the dead and missing

00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:40.057
to make borrowed-name accounts.

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.433
So, we were right.

00:34:42.142 --> 00:34:43.185
Good work.

00:34:45.312 --> 00:34:47.231
This is Mr. Park Gwang-to's driver.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.608
Sorry, I'm late.

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:51.860
You ordered for me?

00:34:51.944 --> 00:34:53.570
Thank you!

00:35:04.331 --> 00:35:05.582
Oh, sorry.

00:35:06.125 --> 00:35:08.627
One more extra big soup, please!

00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:09.753
Coming!

00:35:10.587 --> 00:35:14.007
This is a photo of Gwang-to's driver
withdrawing money from a borrowed account.

00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:16.468
But we can't be 100% sure of that.

00:35:16.552 --> 00:35:18.929
Of course, it's probably 100% true.

00:35:19.012 --> 00:35:20.931
Why don't we have news agencies
question it?

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:23.684
That'll be good.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.524
Right on.

00:35:34.319 --> 00:35:36.405
Yes, there we go.

00:35:37.114 --> 00:35:38.115
Go!

00:35:40.617 --> 00:35:42.077
Oh, no.

00:35:42.161 --> 00:35:43.162
Man!

00:35:43.996 --> 00:35:44.997
I guess it's over.

00:35:52.713 --> 00:35:53.714
What time is it?

00:35:54.089 --> 00:35:55.132
It's 1:20 a.m.

00:35:55.215 --> 00:35:56.800
Do I have to stay here until 2 a.m.?

00:35:59.887 --> 00:36:00.929
Let's just go.

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:07.102
Sorry.

00:36:07.686 --> 00:36:09.480
You'll have to stay a bit longer.

00:36:10.481 --> 00:36:11.523
What?

00:36:11.899 --> 00:36:12.941
Ridiculous.

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:14.735
Get out of my way.

00:36:15.027 --> 00:36:16.195
Come on. Get out.

00:36:17.613 --> 00:36:20.282
You've just gone
from a witness to a suspect.

00:36:20.824 --> 00:36:22.367
An arrest warrant has been filed

00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:24.244
for allegations of you being the owner

00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:26.413
of Seonjin's borrowed-name accounts.

00:36:26.997 --> 00:36:27.998
Huh?

00:36:51.855 --> 00:36:54.858
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a voicemail...

00:37:04.743 --> 00:37:07.454
The National Court Administration
nominated someone

00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:09.790
for the Chief Judge position that I left.

00:37:10.624 --> 00:37:12.376
It must be Sin-jin.

00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:13.502
That's right.

00:37:14.419 --> 00:37:15.921
What are your thoughts?

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.343
Appoint him.

00:37:21.426 --> 00:37:22.845
And why should I do that?

00:37:23.095 --> 00:37:25.138
Gwang-to must've nominated Sin-jin
as the Chief Judge

00:37:25.222 --> 00:37:27.266
so he could save him.

00:37:27.975 --> 00:37:30.269
But Sin-jin won't use the new power

00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:31.478
to save Gwang-to.

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:34.064
Instead, he'll use it for himself.

00:37:38.443 --> 00:37:39.444
Oh

00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:41.613
and did you say

00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:43.907
Gwang-to is taking shelter at Suojae?

00:37:44.324 --> 00:37:45.367
Yes, sir.

00:37:45.701 --> 00:37:48.453
Sin-jin wants to be the new leader there.

00:37:49.538 --> 00:37:51.957
This fight will definitely kill

00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:55.419
one or the other.

00:37:58.338 --> 00:38:00.674
Regardless of who survives

00:38:01.466 --> 00:38:03.510
he'll walk away with a deep scar.

00:38:14.229 --> 00:38:17.107
CHIEF JUDGE KANG SIN-JIN

00:38:22.946 --> 00:38:25.115
There will be a meeting at Suojae today.

00:38:26.158 --> 00:38:27.284
Both of you must come.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.161
Yes, sir.

00:39:05.364 --> 00:39:07.366
Mr. President is incapacitated.

00:39:09.076 --> 00:39:11.078
We need to take action right now.

00:39:14.164 --> 00:39:16.249
And so, I've invited
the Deputy Chief Prosecutor

00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:18.251
who's acting
as the Deputy Prosecutor General.

00:39:31.098 --> 00:39:33.517
I've also asked Mr. Woo Gyo-hun,
the Chair of the Judiciary Committee

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.935
for help.

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:44.277
Congratulations on becoming
the Chief Judge.

00:39:57.541 --> 00:39:59.042
Any support from To's Club?

00:39:59.126 --> 00:40:03.046
They're providing monetary support
through borrowed-name accounts.

00:40:04.297 --> 00:40:06.258
We need some help from corporations, too.

00:40:08.176 --> 00:40:10.137
I'll find a way.

00:40:11.596 --> 00:40:14.182
The opposition will demand
an independent counsel for Mr. President.

00:40:14.266 --> 00:40:15.267
Beat them to it

00:40:15.684 --> 00:40:17.394
and create an independent counsel

00:40:17.477 --> 00:40:19.521
to make a narrative
to counter their counsel.

00:40:19.604 --> 00:40:21.857
Yes, sir.

00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:26.737
We must stop them

00:40:27.654 --> 00:40:29.448
from making an independent counsel.

00:40:29.531 --> 00:40:31.700
Yes, we'll do that.

00:40:39.624 --> 00:40:42.461
Sin-jin looks like someone
we can really count on, doesn't he?

00:40:43.045 --> 00:40:46.298
The way he quickly finds solutions
and that intelligence!

00:40:47.174 --> 00:40:48.759
You're right.

00:40:49.885 --> 00:40:54.639
But shouldn't we also consider
the worst-case scenario?

00:40:56.767 --> 00:40:58.101
What do you mean?

00:40:58.185 --> 00:40:59.478
Mr. President will return

00:41:00.145 --> 00:41:01.772
no matter what.

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:03.315
Of course.

00:41:03.398 --> 00:41:07.652
But we have to think of all possibilities.

00:41:07.736 --> 00:41:11.907
We have to prepare for the worst
at all times.

00:41:12.991 --> 00:41:13.992
Don't you agree?

00:41:14.743 --> 00:41:16.745
Man...

00:41:19.664 --> 00:41:20.874
Let's grab a drink.

00:41:22.876 --> 00:41:24.795
Bring the files.

00:41:26.213 --> 00:41:28.507
Whether it be about my slush funds
or illicit loans

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.425
I'll tell you everything.

00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:34.888
I hear you guys have to fight
for the biggest cases

00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:37.390
for promotions and success, too.

00:41:38.141 --> 00:41:39.893
You could've just told me that

00:41:39.976 --> 00:41:42.270
if that was what you wanted.

00:41:42.354 --> 00:41:44.439
We wouldn't have had to waste
so much time, then.

00:41:46.858 --> 00:41:47.901
What do you say?

00:41:48.193 --> 00:41:51.530
Why don't you join my side now?

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.490
Watch your mouth.

00:41:54.032 --> 00:41:55.909
This is the last chance I'm giving you

00:41:56.493 --> 00:41:58.912
Ms. Pretty Prosecutor.

00:41:58.995 --> 00:42:00.413
The last chance?

00:42:03.708 --> 00:42:04.835
For whom?

00:42:07.337 --> 00:42:10.590
No need to give me such a scary look.
It's intimidating.

00:42:11.424 --> 00:42:13.093
So, you don't want to take my offer?

00:42:15.345 --> 00:42:16.346
Sure, then.

00:42:17.389 --> 00:42:19.182
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

00:42:24.104 --> 00:42:25.147
Jerk.

00:42:50.672 --> 00:42:53.133
TAE-SIK HAS BEEN DETAINED

00:42:58.013 --> 00:42:59.222
Tae-sik has been

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.016
detained.

00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:04.686
Han-young, join the panel of judges.

00:43:06.104 --> 00:43:08.648
And immediately get promoted
to a Presiding Judge.

00:43:09.482 --> 00:43:10.483
Thank you, sir.

00:43:11.818 --> 00:43:13.361
Oh, and the chair I was using

00:43:13.445 --> 00:43:15.572
in my old office is uncomfortable.

00:43:15.655 --> 00:43:16.990
I'll get you a new one.

00:43:19.242 --> 00:43:20.577
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

00:43:24.122 --> 00:43:25.207
Updates on Tae-sik?

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.209
I went to the detention center

00:43:27.292 --> 00:43:28.710
and he admitted to the charges.

00:43:28.793 --> 00:43:30.003
As you said

00:43:30.086 --> 00:43:31.922
it seems
that his father is sacrificing him.

00:43:32.422 --> 00:43:33.798
Anything else?

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.718
Just nonsense, you know.

00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:39.721
He offered me the last chance for me
to join his side or whatever.

00:43:40.472 --> 00:43:42.641
I was so close to throwing a punch at him.

00:43:42.724 --> 00:43:44.142
I regret having held back.

00:43:44.559 --> 00:43:46.645
Where are you? I'm almost there.

00:43:46.728 --> 00:43:47.729
Me too.

00:43:48.521 --> 00:43:50.357
- See you soon.
- Okay.

00:43:55.862 --> 00:43:57.614
I thought Tae-sik would use that week

00:43:59.282 --> 00:44:02.160
to harm Prosecutor Kim.

00:44:02.244 --> 00:44:03.286
Is it decaf?

00:44:05.872 --> 00:44:06.873
Okay?

00:44:11.878 --> 00:44:13.588
He's at the driving range all day.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.383
It's like he wants to go pro
before he goes to jail.

00:44:17.259 --> 00:44:20.470
But Tae-sik didn't do anything
in that one week.

00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:24.140
Why did he need a week, then?

00:44:29.854 --> 00:44:31.189
Just nonsense, you know.

00:44:31.273 --> 00:44:34.109
He offered me the last chance for me
to join his side or whatever.

00:44:34.526 --> 00:44:35.527
A chance?

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.696
I was so close to throwing a punch at him.

00:44:37.779 --> 00:44:39.030
I regret having held back.

00:44:43.326 --> 00:44:44.619
The last chance?

00:44:47.497 --> 00:44:49.833
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A
AT THE CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:44:49.916 --> 00:44:52.502
PROSECUTOR KIM JIN-A
JUDGE LEE HAN-YOUNG

00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:55.630
The last chance... That means

00:44:56.715 --> 00:44:58.341
Tae-sik just needed a week

00:44:58.425 --> 00:45:00.427
to plot Ms. Kim's murder.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.553
That means

00:45:03.138 --> 00:45:05.015
Tae-sik is at the detention center

00:45:05.098 --> 00:45:07.142
waiting for Ms. Kim to die.

00:45:07.642 --> 00:45:09.227
Someone to send

00:45:09.311 --> 00:45:12.272
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a far, far away.

00:45:12.981 --> 00:45:17.902
And as a farewell...

00:45:20.155 --> 00:45:21.197
No.

00:45:25.327 --> 00:45:26.328
Oh, my phone.

00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:55.065
Shh!

00:45:58.651 --> 00:45:59.861
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

00:45:59.944 --> 00:46:01.488
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

00:46:15.877 --> 00:46:18.713
Did Tae-sik tell you to kill me now?

00:46:20.632 --> 00:46:22.092
That's too bad.

00:46:22.175 --> 00:46:23.551
I can't die yet.

00:46:57.127 --> 00:46:58.128
Are you okay?

00:46:58.211 --> 00:46:59.254
Oh, gosh.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:01.172
I'm fine.

00:47:01.423 --> 00:47:02.590
Are you?

00:47:03.633 --> 00:47:04.634
Oh.

00:47:07.303 --> 00:47:08.680
I definitely broke

00:47:09.431 --> 00:47:10.932
Tae-sik's back.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.565
You okay?

00:47:25.655 --> 00:47:26.865
Thank you.

00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:32.829
Jin-a!

00:47:33.746 --> 00:47:35.582
- What's wrong with him?
- Hey!

00:47:35.665 --> 00:47:36.833
Mr. Park...

00:47:39.711 --> 00:47:40.712
What's with you?

00:47:41.671 --> 00:47:42.797
That bastard!

00:47:45.049 --> 00:47:46.050
Are you alright?

00:47:46.593 --> 00:47:47.594
Yeah.

00:47:49.262 --> 00:47:50.263
Are you hurt?

00:47:50.722 --> 00:47:52.599
Don't be so dramatic.

00:47:53.516 --> 00:47:55.059
I'm fine!

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.396
Let's head in.

00:48:01.316 --> 00:48:02.650
What took you guys so long?

00:48:03.485 --> 00:48:05.111
You were the last one to come!

00:48:06.905 --> 00:48:08.072
Let's just go.

00:48:08.698 --> 00:48:09.741
What a weirdo.

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:14.996
Thank goodness the scar isn't so deep.

00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:16.164
I guess so.

00:48:21.544 --> 00:48:23.671
I get why he kept yapping
about my last chance.

00:48:24.672 --> 00:48:26.549
So, he needed a week before detainment

00:48:26.633 --> 00:48:28.468
to find an assassin?

00:48:29.844 --> 00:48:32.430
Suojae is starting to fall apart
after Gwang-to's arrest.

00:48:33.348 --> 00:48:34.766
Sin-jin will jump at this chance

00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:36.434
and try to take over Suojae.

00:48:37.227 --> 00:48:39.479
I guess
the real power struggle begins now.

00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:43.858
The internal conflict will be
a great chance for us.

00:48:49.405 --> 00:48:50.907
Can we kill them?

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.367
- No.
- Fine.

00:48:59.874 --> 00:49:01.626
I'm Byeon Jae-yeong

00:49:01.709 --> 00:49:04.546
Mr. Jang Tae-sik's assistant and attorney
at S Shopping.

00:49:04.629 --> 00:49:05.838
The reason

00:49:09.842 --> 00:49:12.595
I'm here today is...

00:49:16.099 --> 00:49:18.893
I'm here today, because...

00:49:33.283 --> 00:49:34.617
You're sure

00:49:35.159 --> 00:49:36.411
I'll be safe, right?

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.666
Mr. Kang, the Chief Judge

00:49:41.749 --> 00:49:44.544
directly promised to keep me safe.
You know that, right?

00:49:58.516 --> 00:50:00.101
You bitch. You've lived for too long.

00:50:08.192 --> 00:50:10.111
My eyes opened at the crack of dawn.

00:50:11.029 --> 00:50:12.697
I couldn't wait to see you.

00:50:13.448 --> 00:50:15.116
Defendant Jang Tae-sik

00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:16.618
used a paper company

00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:19.746
to get an illicit loan of 120 billion won

00:50:20.496 --> 00:50:23.833
and hid 50 billion won in slush funds

00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:25.209
at Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.920
Hey, didn't Byeon say he'd take the blame

00:50:28.004 --> 00:50:29.672
for the illicit loans?

00:50:29.756 --> 00:50:30.757
Why isn't he here?

00:50:31.257 --> 00:50:32.383
I'm sure he's on his way.

00:50:33.259 --> 00:50:35.720
What's taking him so damn long?

00:50:37.055 --> 00:50:39.265
The Defendant came clean to me

00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:41.809
regarding his slush funds.

00:50:43.519 --> 00:50:46.105
Does the Defendant agree?

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:49.651
Yes, he vows to provide full restitution

00:50:49.734 --> 00:50:51.736
for the illegally-acquired profits.

00:50:52.654 --> 00:50:54.614
Yeah, I promise, alright?

00:50:54.697 --> 00:50:57.533
Just give me five years in jail
so I can move on to the appeals.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.037
Where's Byeon, this bastard?

00:51:01.871 --> 00:51:02.955
Your Honor

00:51:03.748 --> 00:51:06.084
the Defendant is entirely denying

00:51:06.167 --> 00:51:08.252
all allegations
regarding the illicit loans.

00:51:09.671 --> 00:51:13.216
Accordingly, I'd like to move to call
an additional witness

00:51:13.716 --> 00:51:16.386
to prove the counts of the indictment.

00:51:19.764 --> 00:51:23.101
I object, as we did not agree
on this witness prior to the trial.

00:51:24.644 --> 00:51:26.771
What should we do about the witness?

00:51:27.897 --> 00:51:28.898
It is mandatory

00:51:29.607 --> 00:51:34.696
for the prosecutor to discuss and settle
all relevant evidence and witnesses

00:51:34.779 --> 00:51:37.281
with the Defendant and his attorney
in advance.

00:51:39.409 --> 00:51:43.037
However, the Court may assess and agree
on evidence and witnesses

00:51:43.121 --> 00:51:45.998
in necessary and urgent circumstances.

00:51:47.709 --> 00:51:48.918
Your Honor!

00:51:49.001 --> 00:51:51.379
Will the prosecutor tell me more
about the witness?

00:51:51.462 --> 00:51:55.425
He's a witness of the Defendant's loan
of 120 billion won, taken out illegally.

00:51:58.094 --> 00:51:59.762
That means

00:52:00.138 --> 00:52:02.682
the witness is necessary
and urgently needed.

00:52:03.015 --> 00:52:04.308
Your Honor!

00:52:04.392 --> 00:52:06.060
The request for the witness is granted.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.063
What's going on?

00:52:09.147 --> 00:52:10.773
Isn't he on our side?

00:52:11.774 --> 00:52:13.735
The witness won't come to speak
in court today.

00:52:14.444 --> 00:52:15.445
However...

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:22.869
LOCATION TRACKING

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.922
- What?
- I'm Byeon Jae-yeong

00:52:35.006 --> 00:52:36.132
- What is he doing there?
- Mr. Jang Tae-sik's assistant

00:52:36.215 --> 00:52:38.426
and attorney at S Shopping.

00:52:38.509 --> 00:52:39.886
What the hell is going on?

00:52:42.847 --> 00:52:45.183
A new witness will come forward
in Tae-sik's trial.

00:52:46.893 --> 00:52:48.352
I've talked to the prosecution

00:52:48.436 --> 00:52:50.188
so grant the request for the witness.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:54.066
I've come to clarify

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.736
that Mr. Jang Tae-sik ordered me
to get the illicit loans

00:52:56.819 --> 00:52:58.780
at Jeongdaun Savings Bank.

00:52:59.822 --> 00:53:03.326
However, something sits heavy in my heart,
and I'd like to make a confession here.

00:53:04.327 --> 00:53:07.246
Dad probably has some slush funds
at Jeongdaun, right?

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.081
He wants to sacrifice me

00:53:09.165 --> 00:53:11.417
because he doesn't want anyone
to mess with that.

00:53:11.501 --> 00:53:15.463
I can't let anyone take that money.

00:53:15.546 --> 00:53:17.215
That'll all be mine one day.

00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:21.427
Fine. I'll take one for the team.

00:53:23.137 --> 00:53:24.263
Hey, Dad.

00:53:24.472 --> 00:53:26.224
What are you doing? Stop them!

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:27.809
Make her turn that off!

00:53:29.393 --> 00:53:30.686
It's too late.

00:53:31.479 --> 00:53:34.482
This is where you need to listen up.

00:53:34.565 --> 00:53:35.900
That bastard!

00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:39.987
- Hey, Byeon.
- Yes?

00:53:40.446 --> 00:53:41.906
Find someone.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.616
What for?

00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:45.326
Someone to send

00:53:45.409 --> 00:53:48.663
Prosecutor Kim Jin-a far, far away.

00:53:52.083 --> 00:53:57.088
And as a farewell...

00:53:58.256 --> 00:54:00.174
Goodbye, you crazy bitch.

00:54:29.787 --> 00:54:32.874
Please sentence the Defendant
to 20 years in jail

00:54:32.957 --> 00:54:35.251
and a fine of 20 billion won.

00:54:36.252 --> 00:54:39.255
Please also order
a forfeiture of 170 billion won.

00:54:39.338 --> 00:54:41.465
JUDGE

00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:43.801
DEFENDANT

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.470
And in a few days

00:54:54.562 --> 00:54:58.190
he'll be detained once again
for instigating the murder

00:54:59.442 --> 00:55:01.485
of the prosecutor who detained him.

00:55:14.332 --> 00:55:15.791
All of this is a lie!

00:55:15.875 --> 00:55:18.210
That prosecutor bitch is lying
about everything!

00:55:18.586 --> 00:55:20.087
What the hell are you doing?

00:55:20.171 --> 00:55:22.506
You're a lawyer, too!

00:55:24.634 --> 00:55:27.178
He's the same man from the past life.

00:55:27.261 --> 00:55:28.679
Let go!

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.433
GOODBYE, YOU CRAZY BASTARD

00:55:34.518 --> 00:55:35.937
Ms. Kim hasn't changed, either.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.481
What? Did you just cuss at me?

00:55:38.564 --> 00:55:39.607
Huh? Hey!

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:42.485
Lawyer! That bitch just cussed at me!

00:55:42.568 --> 00:55:44.820
I'll sue you for assault!

00:55:44.904 --> 00:55:46.322
What did you say, you bastard?

00:55:46.405 --> 00:55:47.406
Let go!

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:48.908
Let go of me right now!

00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:51.827
That bitch is lying about everything!

00:55:51.911 --> 00:55:52.912
Let go!

00:55:59.919 --> 00:56:05.841
LIBERTY MOTEL PARKING LOT

00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:19.832
Mr. Kang

00:57:22.543 --> 00:57:23.753
there's been an issue.

00:57:44.523 --> 00:57:47.985
THE PRONOUNCEMENT DATE
FOR JANG TAE-SIK

00:57:54.867 --> 00:57:56.077
DEFENDANT

00:57:58.829 --> 00:58:00.664
Your Honor, please read the final verdict.

00:58:09.965 --> 00:58:11.592
The court will pronounce the judgment.

00:58:16.138 --> 00:58:17.181
The verdict is ready.

00:58:17.681 --> 00:58:18.682
The verdict is ready.

00:58:19.058 --> 00:58:20.559
The court sentences the Defendant

00:58:27.108 --> 00:58:29.819
to ten years in prison and 24 billion won.

00:58:29.902 --> 00:58:33.823
to 20 years in prison and 20 billion won.

00:58:43.499 --> 00:58:44.667
The court also orders

00:58:45.751 --> 00:58:47.962
a forfeiture of 170 billion won.

00:58:54.426 --> 00:58:58.389
DEFENDANT

00:59:23.831 --> 00:59:26.041
Great work, Ms. Kim.

00:59:42.933 --> 00:59:46.061
COURT

00:59:59.074 --> 01:00:00.117
Dad

01:00:01.994 --> 01:00:03.746
I put Tae-sik in jail today.

01:00:06.832 --> 01:00:07.917
Aren't you proud?

01:00:13.714 --> 01:00:15.466
Meanwhile, the prosecution found

01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:18.802
slush funds of Jang Yong-hyeon,
the Chairman of S Group

01:00:18.886 --> 01:00:23.057
in its investigation of Jeongdaun Savings
for Mr. Jang Tae-sik's slush funds.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.433
The prosecution is focused

01:00:24.516 --> 01:00:27.061
on the possibility of Chairman Jang

01:00:27.144 --> 01:00:30.522
hiding huge wealth using
borrowed-name accounts and affiliates.

01:00:30.606 --> 01:00:32.608
The prosecution may extend
the investigation

01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:35.694
to the whole Jang family.

01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:39.031
Things are looking pretty terrible
right now.

01:00:39.114 --> 01:00:41.659
You need to give us more time.

01:00:54.296 --> 01:00:55.547
This is the prosecution.

01:01:04.556 --> 01:01:05.808
Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon

01:01:07.268 --> 01:01:08.852
you're under emergency arrest

01:01:08.936 --> 01:01:11.814
on charges of creating slush funds,
tax evasion, bribery

01:01:11.897 --> 01:01:13.482
and violations of the Political Fund Act.

01:01:36.463 --> 01:01:38.048
Here comes Mr. Jang Yong-hyeon.

01:01:40.843 --> 01:01:43.804
The enemies will start striking back now.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.444
Okay, got it.

01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:05.200
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

01:02:05.284 --> 01:02:06.535
Who's behind this?

01:02:07.077 --> 01:02:08.203
Why does that matter?

01:02:09.538 --> 01:02:11.957
You thought you'd be fine
after messing with S Group?

01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:14.043
If you don't want to get fired, go.

01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:16.420
- Right now.
- On it.

01:02:21.842 --> 01:02:23.802
EMPLOYEE PASS FOR KIM JIN-A
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

01:02:38.317 --> 01:02:39.318
Come in.

01:02:42.112 --> 01:02:43.113
May I?

01:02:50.287 --> 01:02:51.705
No need to pity me.

01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:53.248
I'm excited to leave.

01:02:53.332 --> 01:02:55.459
I know. But where are you going?

01:02:56.085 --> 01:02:57.544
Hyenam or something.

01:02:59.046 --> 01:03:01.048
Maybe it's a vacation for doing so well.

01:03:04.343 --> 01:03:05.886
I won't wait long, okay?

01:03:06.512 --> 01:03:08.806
We still have a lot to get done.

01:03:14.061 --> 01:03:16.021
- You need help?
- I'd appreciate it.

01:03:16.897 --> 01:03:18.148
Please pack this.

01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:28.700
Is it for leaking case files?

01:03:29.743 --> 01:03:31.537
Can you not always get it right?

01:03:31.954 --> 01:03:33.914
I saw it coming the moment I gave Ms. Song

01:03:33.997 --> 01:03:35.791
the photo
from the security camera footage.

01:03:35.874 --> 01:03:37.960
No need to feel sorry... Why...

01:03:38.043 --> 01:03:39.753
- Here...
- Come on.

01:03:40.879 --> 01:03:42.506
It's okay. It looks cute.

01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:45.092
I can't believe I look like a panda.

01:03:46.677 --> 01:03:47.678
Where are you off to?

01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:50.055
I thought you knew everything.

01:03:50.139 --> 01:03:52.433
I hear Ms. Kim is going to Hyenam.
You, too?

01:03:53.183 --> 01:03:54.685
They both hate us, so no.

01:03:55.352 --> 01:03:57.771
I'm not telling you where I'm going.
Don't call me, okay?

01:03:58.772 --> 01:04:01.650
You're not going to tell me? Okay.

01:04:02.651 --> 01:04:05.737
You're just leaving now?
That's just disappointing.

01:04:05.821 --> 01:04:08.782
Wherever you're going,
you'll be back soon, anyway.

01:04:08.866 --> 01:04:10.951
- Huh?
- See you soon.

01:04:13.954 --> 01:04:15.164
But I...

01:04:15.247 --> 01:04:18.417
So, if I'm coming back...

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.668
I...

01:04:21.795 --> 01:04:23.172
Gosh.

01:05:20.062 --> 01:05:21.188
Good work.

01:05:21.939 --> 01:05:23.815
Didn't I tell you

01:05:23.899 --> 01:05:26.026
I'd bring you back to Suojae
as soon as possible?

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:29.571
Alright.

01:05:32.991 --> 01:05:33.992
Congratulations

01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:37.287
on your safe return, Mr. President.

01:05:42.793 --> 01:05:46.421
THE JUDGE RETURNS

01:06:25.294 --> 01:06:27.588
Sin-jin's rebellion has begun.

01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:29.172
Call a meeting at Suojae tonight.

01:06:29.256 --> 01:06:31.258
We'll get rid of it
if it looks problematic.

01:06:31.717 --> 01:06:33.302
I never trusted you from the start.

01:06:33.552 --> 01:06:34.928
You don't have anywhere to run.

01:06:35.012 --> 01:06:38.432
So, we'll have to give what Sin-jin wants.

01:06:38.682 --> 01:06:40.434
He killed a man!

01:06:40.517 --> 01:06:43.061
So, you approached me for me.

01:06:43.145 --> 01:06:44.646
I think I'm getting blamed.

01:06:45.022 --> 01:06:46.607
This is the last chance.

01:06:47.274 --> 01:06:48.483
It won't take long.

01:06:48.567 --> 01:06:50.777
I was ready to go all the way
when I started, anyway.

01:06:55.032 --> 01:06:57.034
