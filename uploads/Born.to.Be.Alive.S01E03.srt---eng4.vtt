[Episode 3]

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.710
Haven't you finished reading yet?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.890
I brought a yak

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.860
from home.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.460
I'm busy.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.440
You make lunch.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.360
There's no one else at the base.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.150
Don't make too much.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.210
We can't finish it.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.910
Okay.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.360
I also brought milk.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.020
I'll heat a bowl for you later.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.000
Okay.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.870
Make way! Make way!

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.690
Make way! Make way!

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.120
Make way! Watch out!

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.930
Make way! Watch out!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.530
Get out of the car!

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.120
Okay.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.560
Tell me.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.580
What's wrong now?

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.240
It can't climb slopes.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.300
Rev it too much and it starts gasping.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.630
Stop flooring it here.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.530
You're making a mess with all that smoke.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.120
Have you fallen off before?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.810
No, no.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.920
I ride just fine.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.220
You must have broken it when you fixed it.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.860
This kid.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.380
Even when you go see a doctor,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.220
you can't guarantee

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.860
they'll cure you in one visit.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.950
Am I right?

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.830
Well, this time,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.920
you can't charge me again.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.710
Last time you took

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.330
50 yuan from me.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.590
You can't ask for more!

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.180
Leave it here.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.970
Let me check it again.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.490
I'm telling you,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.330
if there are no parts that need replacing,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.040
it's fine if I don't charge you.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.430
I'll come pick it up tomorrow.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.870
Okay.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.210
Let's go.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.440
I'm leaving too.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.380
What do you want?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.920
Money.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.220
Money.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.490
How did you get out?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.430
Is it just you?

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.220
After the Mountain Patrol left,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.840
I followed the tire tracks

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.100
for 2 days

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.900
and hitched a ride back

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.780
on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.520
You walked out yourself?

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.150
You're really something.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.230
Go home first.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.560
You need

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.280
to give me the money

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.740
we agreed on.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.170
What money?

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.830
My wages.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.330
Wages?

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.860
The wages were all settled.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.970
The people who went in with you

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.650
were out

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.180
by the 3rd day.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.730
The wages were all settled.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.190
Guo Shun!

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.670
Are you trying to stiff me?

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.470
I skinned 30 Tibetan antelopes!

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.270
Keep shouting

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.270
and you'll get the police here!

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.360
This Bolamula

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.790
really toughens people.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.630
You even dared

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.070
to pull a weapon on me.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.390
Didn't we agree before you set off?

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.200
Seven yuan per pelt.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.140
I need to wait for the...

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.320
I need to wait for the boss

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320
to give me a number

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.700
before I can pay you.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.710
But the boss isn't out yet.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.590
So if you say

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.500
you skinned 30,000 Tibetan antelopes,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.950
should I just

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.300
pay you for that?

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.260
Am I stupid?

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.810
Guo.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.250
Mr. Guo.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.750
This has blown up too big.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.640
People got killed.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.520
Guo.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.360
I'm begging you.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.740
Please.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.100
Just give me some money,

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.420
and I can run away.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.860
I'm begging you, Guo.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.730
Please.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.320
What's the rush?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.260
I didn't say I wouldn't pay you.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.500
Once the boss is out,

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.830
I'll give you the money.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.480
How long will that take?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.650
You have to let the boss

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.930
lie low for a while.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.860
Bai Ji.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.180
How come you fell asleep?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.170
Come on. Go home.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.100
Go home to sleep.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:59.530
I'm hungry.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.600
Is there any food?

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.700
This isn't enough.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.090
I still need two pieces.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.760
Oh, Guo Shun.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.000
You're like a big pot

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.910
trying to fit everything

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.720
in your mouth.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.190
Don't be too greedy.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.040
Be careful—
you might die before you spend it.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.890
I know, I know.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.000
You guys asked for this in a hurry.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.560
This is a rush fee.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.640
Back then we...

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.260
What are you doing?

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.540
Is it done?

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.740
He wants more money.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.240
How much more?

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.260
How will you explain this to the boss?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.330
Explain what?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.030
There's only

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.390
a woman there in Meiseng Village.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.260
If this gets held up

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.210
over 200 yuan,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.430
you can explain it to the boss yourself.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.830
Move!

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.400
Hurry up.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.370
That's more like it.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.170
Here.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.220
This little bit?

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:04.960
Is it enough?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.600
This stuff is powerful.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.870
We use it to blast mines.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.180
It's enough to blow up a building.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.050
Bai Ji?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.970
Where have you been running wild
this time?

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.630
You're filthy, like a marmot.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.140
Bai Ji!

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.930
Where have you been these days?

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.380
Stop! Stop!

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:41.960
I was just about to look for you.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.620
Stop! Stop!

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.340
Get off!

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.830
Get off!

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.010
Bai Ji!

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.500
Bai Ji!

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.240
Be nice to Meiduo!

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.980
Don't let her get hurt!

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.580
What's wrong with Bai Ji?

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.470
I don't know.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.210
Who is Meiduo?

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.550
My motorcycle.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.050
Why is there not a single vegetable?

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.980
What's so good about eating grass?

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.240
Well, watch the pot.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.480
I'll go see what vegetables I can find.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.220
Why haven't you left?

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:08.680
Why are you back?

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.410
We eat

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.640
so we won't be hungry.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.580
We drink milk to stay strong and healthy.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.820
We wear clothes to keep warm.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.390
We chant prayers

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.190
for good fortune and happiness.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.830
Bai, what do you think

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.450
people live for?

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.000
To beat you up.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.300
Don't learn from Zhacuo.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.130
Say it or don't.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.930
Whatever.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.690
I had a dream.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.440
What did you dream about?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.710
I dreamed

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.140
I got a permanent position

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.140
and was working for the government.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.680
Sounds like a dream you'd have.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.120
If you want a permanent position,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.180
going home and sleeping

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.710
would get you there faster.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.410
And in the dream,

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.100
I was wearing a police uniform too.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.170
You dreamed you were a cop?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.050
No.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.290
In the dream,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.050
the Economic Development Zone
was established,

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.710
and I was the deputy director.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.020
Then why were you wearing
a police uniform?

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.360
I don't know.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:17.790
Maybe it's because

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.390
I always see you wearing one.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.390
I just feel like
people with government jobs

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.720
all have a uniform.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.810
Just like how every Tibetan

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.960
has a knife

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.030
of their own.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.600
I can't really explain it.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.730
You know what I mean.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.480
I don't.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.300
Having a permanent position
means wearing a uniform?

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.300
The Captain doesn't have a uniform.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.660
I also dreamed of Dongzhiba.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.550
He was wearing a police uniform too,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.200
and he looked really happy.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:04.870
Ju!

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.890
Ju!

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.070
Bai Ju!

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.650
Ju!

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.870
Ju!

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.280
Bai Ju!

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.010
Do you think

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.470
the Captain would agree
to let me come back?

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.560
Do you think

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.910
he'd agree to let me
go into the mountains?

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.360
I get what you mean.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.280
Looks like I don't stand a chance.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.940
What I mean is,

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.100
there's no point talking about this

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.100
between the two of us.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.100
You might as well
wait for the Captain to come back

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.300
and ask him yourself.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.530
Besides,

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.670
how can you be so sure

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.700
I can't get into the mountains?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.200
If he were going to let you go,

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.150
you would've gone in

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.600
with He Qingyuan and the others this time.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.620
They were going to look for your brother.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.680
You must be more worried than anyone.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.440
I feel like...

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.450
I'm worried sick.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.920
What's wrong?

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.670
I think I hear

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:17.980
Bai Ji calling me,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.430
calling me "Ju" over and over.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.550
Maybe he's missing you

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.880
somewhere in Bolamula.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.250
The voice in his heart

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.220
crossed the snow mountains

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.360
and reached you.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.150
Really?

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.360
It sounds like

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.070
he's shouting for me to run.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.330
He's even calling me by my full name.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.380
That's strange.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.450
Why can I hear

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.540
Bai Ji's voice too?

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.130
Is he missing me too?

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.510
Ju!

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.290
Ju!

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:58.930
Bai Ji?

00:14:58.950 --> 00:14:59.620
Run!

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.520
Bai Ji!

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.210
Run!

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.310
Someone's going to blow up
the Mountain Patrol!

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.310
They're going to blow you up!

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.440
Bai Ji!

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.030
You bastard!

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.480
Where have you been these past few days?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:20.960
Hurry!

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.550
Hurry!

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.290
Run!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.600
There's...

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.500
What did you say?

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.630
Danger!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.130
Ju!

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.170
Ju!

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.370
Ju!

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.520
Bai Ji!

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:43.740
Ju?

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.560
Don't come over!

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.790
Don't come over!

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.220
Someone blew up the warehouse!

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.350
It must be poachers!

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.280
Don't come over!

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:50.830
Let's go!

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.330
Mountain Patrol!

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:00.850
Go! Go!

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.990
Hurry up and load it!

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.710
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:09.850
Where's your gun?

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.250
They took it into the mountains!

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.750
The Captain's gun should still be here.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:14.580
Let's go!

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.130
Hurry! Hurry!

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.480
Hurry! Hurry!

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.380
What's happening?

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.370
What's going on?

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.550
They're here to steal the pelts!

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.750
And they have guns!

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.500
Got it. Got it.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.620
Watch out, everyone! Get down!

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.470
Get down!

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080
What should we do?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.400
Wait a second.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.740
Come here! Come here!

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.080
Pick some stones! Pick some stones!

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.600
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.050
On the roof! On the roof!

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.580
Got it!

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.510
One, two, three!

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.810
Come on!

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.680
Load it up! Hurry! Let's move out.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.380
Got it!

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.070
Take two more bundles!

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.810
Bastards!

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:18.480
Sangba!

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.350
Hurry up!

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.300
Give it to me!

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.720
Brothers!

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.540
Come on!

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.030
Bai Ji, come here!

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.290
Come with me to the Public Security Bureau

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.150
and explain everything clearly!

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.290
Ju!

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.940
I... I...

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.330
I didn't kill anyone!

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:12.750
I know you didn't kill anyone!

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.120
Come back with me first!

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.070
I—I'm not going back!

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.640
I didn't kill anyone!

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.200
I won't go back!

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.580
Stop!

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.320
I didn't kill anyone!

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.030
Come back!

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.550
Bai Ji!

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.980
Bai Ji! Bai Ji!

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.500
Come back!

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.920
Hello?

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:56.770
Sangba?

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.390
You're back.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.640
I just got back.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.840
Tell Bai Ju to drive

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.900
to Wangmu's place.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.890
I bought some food for the team.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.510
Captain, I'm afraid she can't do that.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:06.490
The warehouse just got blown up.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.890
And we caught two people.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.530
What?

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.530
The warehouse got blown up?

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:10.990
Hello?

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.660
Why did you lock up
that stupid gun of yours?

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.820
All you do is lock it!

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.660
Always locking it!

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.010
Don't you know
how to maintain it properly?

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.050
The magazine's all rusty!

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.120
It was so hard to use!

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.500
There were just a few lousy bullets—

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.160
why hide them

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.010
under your pillow?

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.010
Isn't it uncomfortable to sleep on?

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.750
Duojie, Sangba,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.450
we brought over the wood

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.490
to repair the house.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.600
Okay, thank you.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.540
Thanks.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.330
You're welcome. We're leaving now.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.930
Thank you.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.930
No problem. Bye.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.690
You haven't used a bow in a while,

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.660
have you?

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.830
Your aim is terrible.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.890
You even let one escape.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.900
No matter how fast an arrow is,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.560
it's not faster than a bullet.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.950
Next time in the mountains,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.080
everyone gets a gun—

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.990
just you with a bow. Fine.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.460
Okay,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.170
no problem.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.310
I used to be first place

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.770
in archery competitions.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.470
Captain,

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.400
it was all thanks to Bai this time.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.770
My shooting's not bad,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.490
but it can't compare to hers.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.920
Really?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.260
Really.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.670
One piece of gold

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.750
is worth more than a pile of iron.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.340
If Bai goes into the mountains,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.870
she'll be worth 10 Zhacuos.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.830
One Zhacuo

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.450
is already enough trouble.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:46.590
I'm talking about

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.750
her accuracy.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.850
She never misses.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.590
In that case,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.300
she'd be better at poaching.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.150
I'm a police officer.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.750
Back in the police academy,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.750
my shooting scores were excellent.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.980
Okay, okay. I got it.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.150
You're a police officer—

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.440
pretty impressive.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.510
Easy, easy.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.590
Feeling the pain now?

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.160
Bear with it.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:20.960
Get in the car.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:21.690
Come here!

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.770
Get in.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.040
Aren't you coming?

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:38.690
You go.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.070
Going back to the bureau like this

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.270
is too embarrassing.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.000
If you go into the mountains,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.100
you'll only get dirtier

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.070
and look even worse.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.140
That's different.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:49.640
Let's go.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.130
You can take a shower at the bureau.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.260
How long has it been
since the last time you took a shower?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.130
Ten days or twenty days

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.350
makes no difference.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.540
Bai Ju.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.670
Are you still not going to

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.550
tell Director Zhang about Bai Ji?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.180
Before, it was fine
not to tell her because you were afraid

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.050
she'd worry.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:18.140
But now that

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.520
Bai Ji has come out of
the Uninhabited Zone,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.650
it wouldn't be right to keep it secret.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:22.840
Your mother should know

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.120
what happened to him,

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:29.020
and also about your situation.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.780
It would be a good chance
to talk about it with her.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.230
You can ask her

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:37.050
whether she agrees
to you going into the mountains.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.090
Nima.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.410
Nima.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.310
Don't be angry anymore.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.380
Given the situation back then,

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.070
I really had no choice.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.420
I could only leave it there.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:52.880
You...

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.060
I was wrong, okay?

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:56.030
Don't be angry.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:57.470
Meiduo isn't lost.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:57.980
Look,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.630
her mirror is right here.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.920
She's in Meiseng Village now,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.840
safe and sound.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:02.700
My sister will definitely

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.830
take good care of it.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:04.850
If you don't believe me,

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.390
you can go pick it up anytime.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.320
I promise.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.590
Why don't you go yourself?

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.070
I...

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.880
Seriously.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.660
I can go.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.130
But my sister...

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.490
is really angry right now.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:18.290
If I go there now,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.220
she'll definitely beat me up.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:19.750
Alright.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.790
Stop waving that mirror around.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.590
The reflection

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.250
could melt the snow mountain.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.470
The sacred mountain
will get angry, understand?

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.670
Don't wave it around.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.680
Then let me smear some cow dung on it.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.640
Don't joke around.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.240
Bai Ji!

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.130
Don't break it.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.330
It's okay.
Let me smear some cow dung on it.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.150
Give it to me. Give it to me.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:34.850
Don't break it.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.970
Let me smear some cow dung on it.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:36.700
Give it to me!

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.730
If you promise not to be mad,
I'll give it to you.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.350
Come on. Give it to me.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.050
I'll give it to you when you're not mad.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:39.760
Give it to me. Don't break it.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.890
I'll give it to you when you're not mad.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.240
I'm going away for a while.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.640
I don't know

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.880
when I'll be back.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:48.670
I'm leaving Meiduo in your care,

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.180
bro.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.020
Where are you going?

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.290
To herd sheep for someone?

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.220
I'm going to plant trees.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.260
Does our county...

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.560
even have that kind of work?

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.560
Not in our county.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.200
I'm going to Gansu to plant trees.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.750
Gansu?

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.910
So far away?

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.610
To do something big,

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.400
you have to travel far, far away.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.270
Got it, bro?

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.570
How are you getting there?

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.700
I'm not going alone.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.570
There's a vehicle taking us.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:21.830
First we go to Tianduo,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.680
then take a long-distance bus
from there to the provincial capital,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.720
and finally a train to Gansu.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.690
That's not even the destination.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:30.850
After arriving in Gansu,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.110
we still need to take a long-distance bus

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:34.290
to...

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:35.960
Yuzhong County.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.550
I heard the altitude there

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.360
is much lower than Mazhi,

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.150
and the oxygen there
is so rich it could make you dizzy.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.020
I don't know what that feels like.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.850
It's probably like

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.470
drinking Mom's barley wine.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.180
I want to get drunk once too.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.230
Gansu?

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.740
Count me in.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.010
Bai Shao.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:37.970
Hello, beautiful.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Hello, sir.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:39.630
How

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.830
may I help you?

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.430
I'm making a deposit. Thanks.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.170
Okay.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:06.810
Hurry, hurry.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.000
I told you

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:11.810
you need to wear

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.130
a cotton jacket here.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.260
This is already

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.440
my thickest coat.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.390
Shao.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:19.940
What?

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:29.740
Shao.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.840
What do you want?

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:32.930
I'm working.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.440
If my boss finds out,

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.770
he'll dock my pay again.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.120
What are you looking at?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:37.920
Look at that fool.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.820
Isn't he cold?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.740
I don't think you're cold either.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.490
I'm going back if you have nothing to say.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:43.600
Shao, come with me.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.380
Shao.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:52.390
There's something

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:53.500
I need to tell you.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.300
Mom doesn't know it yet.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:58.210
But...

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:58.870
but I...

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.830
don't know how to bring it up to her.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.180
I can't keep quiet...

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:04.960
about this.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.640
I can't...

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.860
just hide it forever.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.590
But I don't want Mom to worry.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:13.830
Even though

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.140
Mom is more open-minded

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.140
than most people,

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:18.750
this...

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.940
this thing...

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.200
It...

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.610
It's a matter of principle.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.400
I...

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.620
How far along are you?

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.460
Bai Ju, don't be scared.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.460
Tell me the truth.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.050
Is that guy

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.580
from your Mountain Patrol?

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.170
Bai Shao!

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.420
What have you been thinking about

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.310
all day?

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.400
You're disgusting!

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:45.610
That's not it?

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.590
No!

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.950
Then what is it?

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.470
You scared me.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.790
That brat Bai Ji

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.920
is way too reckless!

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.620
Risking his life for money!

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.610
And you're just as bold,

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:05.290
keeping something this serious

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.310
from Mom.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.770
I was afraid she'd worry.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.270
Even if she'd known back then,

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.570
all she could've done was worry.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:12.180
Of course,

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.240
you've got all the excuses.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:16.210
And after Bai Ji came out,

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:17.340
he didn't come home.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.080
We can't let him keep running wild.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.340
He got lucky this time.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.200
Next time, who knows

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200
what will happen?

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.090
Shao,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.360
what about Mom?

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.570
What do you think?

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.370
I'll tell her when I get home from work.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:38.780
It's better for you to tell her.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.420
No one ever comes to me with good news.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:44.780
Wait for me here.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.770
Based on the on-site investigation,

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:52.700
the explosion was caused by

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.430
ammonium nitrate explosives.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.690
The main structure
of the building remains intact,

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.010
with only a two-by-two-meter breach

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.500
in the exterior wall.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.880
According to the suspect

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.420
brought back by Deputy County Mayor Duo,

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.030
it was retaliation by a poaching gang

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.740
against the Mountain Patrol,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.210
attempting to seize their pelts back.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.850
We found a walking tractor

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.570
driven by the fugitive suspect

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.010
on a rural road

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.920
3 kilometers

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.050
from Meiseng Village

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:15.920
and are currently conducting a search

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.320
in the surrounding area.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:17.920
Also,

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.480
Guo Shun, the auto repair shop owner

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.140
who supplied the explosives—

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.920
when we went to arrest him,

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.980
the shop was closed

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.330
and he had already fled.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.260
The bureau

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.150
has circulated his description

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.200
to checkpoints

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.150
along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.680
Fortunately,

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.220
the explosion didn't cause

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.610
any casualties.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.200
What about the follow-up work?

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.330
County Mayor Lin?

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.550
I've already applied to the Finance Bureau

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.180
for funds

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:42.610
to repair the warehouse.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.760
It's not much.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.140
In just a few days,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.200
we've had

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.380
a Mountain Patrol member killed

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.780
and a warehouse blown up.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.460
The security situation is very grim.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.410
Secretary Chen,

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:54.650
County Mayor Lin,

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.200
I request that the entire Mountain Patrol

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.830
be equipped

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:58.850
with semi-automatic rifles

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.180
and 7.62mm ammunition.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.610
I remember

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.420
that you seized

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.270
firearms and ammunition.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.690
Most of the weapons and ammo we seized

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:09.880
were turned in.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:11.780
Every time we go into the mountains,

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.980
we have to count them.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.700
If it weren't for

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.740
the officer stationed at the base

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.850
with good marksmanship this time,

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.580
the consequences
would have been unimaginable.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:21.250
I'm requesting

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.550
full usage rights

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.570
over the seized

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.140
firearms and ammunition.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.130
Comrade Duojie's request

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.590
deserves serious consideration.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.720
What are your views?

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.290
Regarding the full usage rights

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.770
for the guns and ammunition,

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.770
I am in agreement.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:36.310
However,

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.620
after this incident,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:38.940
I personally feel

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.330
that having a female officer
in the Mountain Patrol

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.080
may not be appropriate.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.030
Could we deploy

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.200
a male officer

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.430
to guide the work
of the Mountain Patrol instead?

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:52.950
How about this?

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.310
I'll look into it

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.090
and send a male officer over.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.250
If Deputy County Mayor Duojie needs it,

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:59.850
I can assign one from my side.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.780
That won't be necessary.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.400
I can't afford to keep him.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.440
As for whether
the female officer stays or goes,

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.570
I believe we should respect

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:09.030
Bai Ju's personal wishes.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.850
I can't make that decision for her.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:15.940
Duojie.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.380
About the firearms and ammunition,

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.100
I'll find a way

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.230
to get you a bit more.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.180
Shi is stingy.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.920
I'll keep pushing him for you.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.730
Okay.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.160
On behalf of the boys,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.760
thank you, County Mayor Lin.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.050
Why are you running?

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.310
I'm not asking you for a report.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.840
Why are you walking so fast?

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.440
You're not rushing me on the report?

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.800
Then what do you want with me?

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.190
It's about Bai Ju.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.210
Whether she stays or goes,

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.090
and whether
she goes into the mountains or not—

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.350
you're her direct superior.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.280
You bear the main responsibility.

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.440
Anyway, in principle,

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.160
everything is for

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.270
the Mountain Patrol's mineral exploration.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:52.880
Lin.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:55.650
You know I hate meetings.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.150
I just finished one,

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.870
and now you want a private one.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.540
Just say what you want to say.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.090
We all know

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.320
Bai Ju's background.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.920
I agree she can stay

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.250
in the Mountain Patrol,

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.260
but my personal opinion is that

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.940
she shouldn't go into the mountains.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.870
Grass moves to attract the wind.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.140
Flowers bloom to spread seeds.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.960
Can you control

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.360
which way the wind blows?

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.910
So you're saying we should just...

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.850
Anyway,

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.170
as long as you've thought it through.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.540
Take this medicine.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:37.920
Director.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.010
Take it twice a day.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.700
Once in the morning and once at night.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.230
Ms. Kang.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.240
Take it 15 minutes after meals.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:43.520
Drink lukewarm water.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.070
Don't drink unboiled water anymore.

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.470
Yanzi.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:45.980
Come home with me

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.710
and help me pick up some things.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.000
What things?

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.610
Yangjin's 2 kids

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.620
didn't bring enough clothes.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.950
I'll find some for them.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.380
Okay.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.350
Here.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.300
You kept

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.390
all their clothes?

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.450
These belong to Bai Chun and Bai Ji.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:06.850
There's a box

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.960
for Bai Shao and her sister.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.940
A couple of years ago,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.000
I gave it away.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.710
Isn't this too big?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.699
Yangjin's kids

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.530
can't wear it.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.880
It doesn't matter.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:18.300
Let them take it back.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.280
Kids grow fast.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.590
Okay.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.679
This one.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:23.980
Here.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:28.860
Ma'am,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.210
your sewing is amazing.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.340
This is as good as a sewing machine.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.340
I got this from the operating table.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.300
When someone's belly is cut open,

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.650
I can stitch it back up.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:38.199
This is nothing.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.440
Okay.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.870
And...

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.639
This one is too worn out.

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:48.639
Look at this.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:49.610
This is Bai Ji's.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.630
He was always fighting when he was little,

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.219
but he could never win.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.860
He didn't dare come to me.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.030
So he always asked his brother

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.090
to stand up for him.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:59.940
By the look of it,

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.070
he lost a lot.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.130
Some of them were my doing.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:04.980
You...

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.050
No wonder he didn't dare come to you.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.260
You spanked him every time?

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.610
It's from New Year's firecrackers.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:11.960
Burnt by the sparks.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.110
Look here.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.560
It looks scorched.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.950
This one is too tattered.
Let's not take it.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.690
When he was little,

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.340
he was a little rascal.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.740
Now he's a big rascal.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.630
He's just adventurous.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:30.140
Give it to me.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.960
Is it heavy?

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.460
Let me.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.920
No need.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.780
I can handle it.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.380
Get up!

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:18.380
Get up!

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.980
-What's wrong?
-This road doesn't look right.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.570
What's wrong with it?

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:23.940
This road

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.540
isn't going to Tianduo City.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.110
If we keep going,

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.260
it'll take us straight into

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:28.950
Bolamula.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.010
No way.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.360
Why do they want

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:31.950
to take us there?

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.320
In there,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.780
there isn't a single soul.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.210
Maybe they're taking a shortcut?

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.270
Shortcut?

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.450
I know this road.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.120
This goes to Bolamula.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.150
Something's wrong with this ride.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.080
Bolamula is the Uninhabited Zone.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:44.730
You sound like

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.840
you've been there.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.300
I...

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:46.950
I...

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:48.940
Bro,

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.020
do you really know this road?

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:52.650
Yes.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.450
This is definitely
going to the Uninhabited Zone.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:56.090
Right.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.450
His sister is a police officer.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.050
She's in charge of Bolamula.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:01.890
Of course he knows this road.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.790
Right.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.130
My sister is a police officer.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.330
I've been here with her.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:05.960
If you don't believe me,

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.880
you should believe the police.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.690
What do we do now?

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:08.690
What should we do?

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:09.380
Now, we...

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:10.070
Stop thinking!

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:10.880
Run!

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.570
What's that noise?

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.230
What's happening back there?

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.130
Someone jumped off the truck!

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.840
Stop!

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.170
Stop!

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.460
Nima!

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.280
Bro!

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.190
Don't move!

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.420
Go back! Hurry!

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:54.980
Bai Ji!

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:57.910
Bai Ji!

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.760
Run!

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.120
Run!

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.000
Run!

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.300
Go back!

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.720
Run!

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.240
Run!

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:14.710
Go to the pharmacy

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.730
and prescribe some more painkillers

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:16.210
and anti-inflammatories.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:16.540
Okay.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.210
And I'll go over there

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.270
and check their temperatures again.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:22.910
Director Zhang!

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:23.640
Nima?

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.020
Who did you fight with?

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.940
I'm looking for Director Zhang!

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.750
Director Zhang is busy.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:28.420
Tell me first.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.150
Where did you get hurt?

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.900
It's not me.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:31.940
Bai Ji.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.090
Bai Ji?

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.420
Bai Ji was taken!

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:36.820
What happened to Bai Ji?

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:37.840
Isn't Bai Ji

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.340
just out of the Uninhabited Zone?

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.710
How did he get abducted by traffickers?

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:42.510
He went to the Uninhabited Zone?

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.340
Your brother was doing dirty work,

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.600
and you didn't tell me?

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.400
Well, I planned to tell you

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.190
after I got back from work.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.280
Who knew he'd get in trouble again?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.160
Call the police, now.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:50.390
We must get them back!

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.230
There's a car following us.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.030
Drive faster.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.150
Ju!

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.400
Ju!

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.610
-I'm here!
-Police!

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:02.960
Help!

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.440
Help!

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.140
Help!

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.820
Police!

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:46.920
Turn off the engine and get out of the car

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.760
for inspection!

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.300
Get out!

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.460
She's a police officer.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.390
She has a gun too.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.270
Hurry up!

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.240
And you!

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.230
Come here now!

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:04.400
Hurry up!

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.450
Stand still!

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:15.500
Officer,

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.600
did we overload

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:17.460
or overspeed?

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.780
Someone reported

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.640
that you're trafficking people.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.410
It's a misunderstanding.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.040
We work at the cement plant.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.070
These are workers

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.170
who ran away from the plant.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.650
They all signed contracts.

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.510
We wouldn't do anything illegal.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.460
Squat down!

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.350
Go over there!

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.250
Over there!

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:38.360
Officer,

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.010
help us!

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.950
-Stop yelling!
-Help us!

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.970
Get up!

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.170
Go over there!

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.180
Officer!

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.440
Come on, untie me, Ju!
