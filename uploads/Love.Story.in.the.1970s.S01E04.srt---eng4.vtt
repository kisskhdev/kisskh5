=Love Story in the 1970s=

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.940
=Episode 4=

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.540
Fang Muyang.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.000
Sometimes, I think

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.530
you must've gone mad

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.020
when you joined the production team.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.660
Why?

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.460
If you're not mad,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.420
why would you let Ling Yi
take your place in university?

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:20.071
I guess it makes sense, though.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.210
She's your girlfriend.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.250
It's only natural.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.890
But if it were me,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.860
I wouldn't do that.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.982
No worries. You can take my place.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.170
You think

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.670
university slots

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.090
are as common as corn kernels,

00:02:37.137 --> 00:02:38.760
and you can pick them off the ground?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.410
Still, why were you chosen, though?

00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:44.440
Is there some sort of trick?

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.648
Are you okay?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.500
That hurts.

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:53.537
By the way, what's your name?

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.590
I'm Ling Yi.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.000
And you?

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.130
I'm Ye Feng.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.360
Are you from this school?

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.900
Yes.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.170
You remember Ling Yi?

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:03.970
She visited me in the hospital.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.110
Ling Yi!

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.780
Fei Ni, what a coincidence.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.070
You're here to watch
our basketball match?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.900
You know each other?

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.900
Of course.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.970
Fei Ni works in
Jiangcheng No. 1 Textile Factory,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.870
and I'm in the factory's
basketball team.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.810
And this is?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.810
He's Fang Muyang,

00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:39.737
the hero who saved lives
in the thunderstorm.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.090
Hello, Fang Muyang.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.150
I'm Ye Feng.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.910
I'm the captain of Jiangcheng No. 1
Textile Factory's basketball team.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.150
Hello.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.570
I'm Fang Muyang.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.490
You look tall

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.500
and strong.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.137
You'd be a great addition to our team.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.900
Want to join?

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.650
Ye Feng.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.200
Fei Ni is here for me.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.150
You can go now.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.115
Fei Ni will take me
to the infirmary.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.880
No worries.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.880
I'm free, so let's go together.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.690
Ye Feng, Ling Yi and I have
something private to discuss.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.460
Fair enough.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.190
Go ahead.

00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:15.315
The boys are waiting for me
at the court, anyway.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.140
I'm off.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.840
Bye.

00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:18.050
Consider my offer.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.360
Is your hand okay?

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.440
I'm okay.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.010
So, let's talk.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.660
The way he draws

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.090
still looks the same.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.693
He doesn't look like
he's lost his memories.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.540
He hasn't remembered the past,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.310
but he's learned a lot of life skills.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.030
In principle,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.640
other than forgetting the past,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.860
he's totally normal.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.570
Not exactly.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.240
The way he looks at me

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.890
feels so distant.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.310
If you can visit him more often,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.980
perhaps he'd get better.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.890
Fei Ni.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.500
I know you look down on me.

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:20.890
But you don't know
what I've been through.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.210
You have no right to lecture me.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.300
I'm not looking down on you.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.680
I think you have the right
to pursue your own happiness.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.210
But this isn't the time

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.610
to leave Fang Muyang alone.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.570
What do you want me to do?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.450
I'm not a doctor.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.660
I can't cure him.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.070
But you're his girlfriend.

00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:38.510
You've been working together,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.330
and have been dating for so many years.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.310
You know him best.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.960
Dr. Liang also said

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.860
that if you can help him
recall the past,

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.620
it can help him recover his memory.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.490
That's why I'm here

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.050
to ask you to help him.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.026
I'm not his girlfriend.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.110
I can't help him.

00:05:54.004 --> 00:05:55.840
Those words came from your own mouth.

00:06:04.382 --> 00:06:05.248
Fei Ni.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.920
You're noble and selfless.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.540
You can sacrifice yourself
to take care of him.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.515
That's your own choice.

00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:12.915
You can't demand me to do the same.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.240
Let me repeat this.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.770
I'm not his girlfriend.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.860
Don't talk to me again.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.540
What is this place?

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.620
It's pretty.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.850
Pretty, right?

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.860
Yeah.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.670
My brother and I
often came here to play as kids.

00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:13.620
I still come here when I feel down.

00:07:23.404 --> 00:07:24.370
What are you doing?

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.940
Back in the hospital,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.560
the girl from the next room
cheers up

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.480
when her dad does this.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.740
Don't you try that on me.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.210
Fang Muyang.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.750
If you can never remember

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.770
the past,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.190
what should we do?

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.810
The past?

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:49.700
Is it important?

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.915
I think there's nothing wrong
with the present.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.520
If I can't remember the past,

00:07:55.093 --> 00:07:56.450
it means it's not that important.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.700
If I forget my old friends,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.890
I'll just make new ones.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.600
Actually, I don't understand

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.110
why everyone

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.570
wants me to remember the past.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.690
Even if I can't remember,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.330
I'm still me.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.300
I won't become someone else.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.450
Don't you feel like
there's a burden on your chest?

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.270
A little, at first.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.710
But not anymore.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.770
Because you're around.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.937
Do you remember where you used to live?

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.680
Kangnan Road.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.020
When we were young,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.460
you brought us to your house.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:49.380
Come on.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.180
(44 Kangnan Road)

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.730
Do you remember?

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.970
You used to live here.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.550
Can you remember anything?

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.520
This place probably looks different

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:43.960
from when you were around.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.210
It's okay.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.020
Let's look around.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.180
Come on.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.600
Go, brother!

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.880
Go, brother!

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.760
Go, brother!

00:10:13.248 --> 00:10:14.600
(You're climbing trees again?)

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.100
(Get down!)

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.570
Yang!

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.210
Yang, you're climbing trees again?

00:10:25.315 --> 00:10:27.070
You'll be squealing in pain
when you fall!

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.290
Get down!

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.690
(I bought ice cream today.)

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.400
(- Happy birthday to you...)
(- Get down!)

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.590
(I bought ice cream today.)

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.090
Hao!

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.380
Why are you climbing trees again?

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.180
Get down!

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.380
Why you...

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.550
You naughty boy!

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.090
If not for him,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.220
you'd have broken your leg!

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.970
Thank you, comrade.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.560
Thank you.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.180
- You're welcome.
- Go home!

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:52.980
Go!

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.070
I'll tell your father

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.200
what you've been up to.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.100
If you climb trees again,

00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:58.300
I'll beat your legs up!

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.330
You may have lost your memories,

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.490
but your heroic spirit is still there.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.440
Fei Ni.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.990
Yes?

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.810
Let's go.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.430
Don't you want to go up?

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.850
I want some ice cream.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:21.740
Thank you.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.690
You're welcome.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.970
You've been doing great today,

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.626
so here's some ice cream as a reward.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.560
That's not ice cream.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.300
This is ice cream.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.730
It's not.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.650
What do you mean?

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.810
It is ice cream.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.570
This is what ice cream looks like.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.180
Yours isn't.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.690
All you can think of is food, huh?

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.640
I can't afford that expensive stuff.

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:18.700
All I have is popsicles.

00:12:18.782 --> 00:12:19.770
Take it or leave it.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.330
Yummy.

00:12:59.826 --> 00:13:01.330
I'll buy you ice cream next time.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.900
Say.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.390
If you didn't tell anyone you're sick,

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.830
who'd have thought you are?

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.610
Fang Muyang.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.380
Can I ask for a favor?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.260
Ice cream.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.380
(Saving Lives,
Serving Workers and Peasants)

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.090
Fang Muyang.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.010
I've written a short account

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.060
of your parents and sister.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.690
It's not complete, but it's enough.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.690
I also made some stories about your time

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.420
in the production team.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.000
Ms. Xu wouldn't know, anyway.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.170
I think we can get by.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.610
Most importantly, you need to remember

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.940
this part.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.800
"When I was saving them,
my mind was blank.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.910
That's because to me,
saving lives is an instinct.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.400
It doesn't require preparation.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.580
If I must think of something,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.020
the only conviction I had

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.720
was to stay determined,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.830
sacrifice myself

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.530
to overcome hurdles and succeed."

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.140
Are you listening?

00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:46.610
You want me to pretend
that I've recovered

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.180
to deceive your superior?

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.090
You...

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.490
Don't say that.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.750
I know it's bad.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.610
I've been struggling inside for a while,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.570
and I've run out of options.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.020
After all,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.010
I've been taking care of you
for so many days,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.860
so help me, please.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.510
If you can help me,

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.730
I'll buy you ice cream.

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:22.810
What kind of face is that?

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.660
Is that

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.070
a no, or you can't memorize that?

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.520
Yeah, you're still ill.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:31.900
It's pretty tough.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.050
I'll make it shorter.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.390
"When I was saving them,
my mind was blank.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.300
That's because to me,
saving lives is an instinct.

00:15:42.648 --> 00:15:44.120
It doesn't require preparation.

sacrifice myself

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:55.850
to overcome hurdles

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.380
and succeed."

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.260
Fang Muyang.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.360
You're amazing!

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.210
Fei Ni.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.330
Buy me an ice cream.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.850
It's a deal!

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.330
This is great news!

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.730
I heard from Fei Ni

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.940
that you've recovered your full memory?

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.260
This is great news!

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.080
Hello, Ms. Xu.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.100
I've made a full recovery.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.560
You may rest assured.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.180
Now that you've recovered,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.940
you look much more energetic!

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.020
Feng Lin.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.280
Pour some tea.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:36.560
Ms. Xu, have a seat.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.300
Sit down.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.400
Fang Muyang.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.570
Have you really remembered everything?

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:03.260
Yes.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.200
He's remembered basically everything.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.530
But his brain was injured,

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.100
so some parts of his memory
might be fuzzy.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.380
But the doctor said

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.770
he can live and learn normally,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.820
so you could say he was fully recovered.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.210
Right?

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:18.860
Fang Muyang?

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.180
Comrade?

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.290
Yes.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.970
Yes.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.710
Wonderful. How nice.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.340
Allow me to introduce

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.200
Ms. Wang from our Publicity Division.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.820
I got her here

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.690
to write an article about you.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.110
I'm going to make
everyone in the factory

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.870
learn from your noble qualities.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.010
Hello, Ms. Wang.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.290
Hello, Fang Muyang.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.900
Why don't you start with

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.070
what you thought

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.250
when you were saving lives?

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:47.700
Yeah.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.600
(Thank goodness I prepared for this.)

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.490
Ms. Xu.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.110
When I was saving them,
my mind was blank.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.130
That's because to me,
saving lives is an instinct.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.419
It doesn't require preparation.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.650
If I must think of something...

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.880
If...

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.160
If I...

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.660
If what?

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.690
What were you thinking?

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.820
Fei Ni.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.680
I thought he's fully recovered?

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:30.400
He...

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.620
Maybe...

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.100
Maybe he's nervous.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.140
Fang Muyang.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.660
If you must think...

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.090
If I must think,

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.030
I want to say

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.900
that the past few weeks

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.340
were the happiest time I had

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.140
since I could remember.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.490
Fei Ni often says that I'm a hero,

00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:02.537
and that she should learn from me.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.820
But she

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.660
deserves my full admiration.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.280
To take care of me, a stranger,

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.900
she sacrificed her own time,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:13.970
not asking for anything in return.

00:19:15.826 --> 00:19:17.860
She taught me everything,
from brushing my teeth.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.850
She was patient with me,

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.630
and never gave up on me.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.730
I'm lucky

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.350
to have met her just when

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.920
I needed help.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.450
She helped me stand up again

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.920
and face life.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.660
She is our true role model.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.090
Today, I'm able to stand here

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:40.040
healthy and well

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:41.940
because of her.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.530
Marvelous!

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.400
Wonderful!

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.580
A round of applause!

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.530
Wonderful.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.470
Fei Ni.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.050
You did a great job!

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.480
You have gloriously completed

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.970
a gargantuan task assigned to you!

00:20:11.182 --> 00:20:13.530
Tomorrow, I'll put in a good word
with the factory leaders.

00:20:13.537 --> 00:20:14.870
An excellent worker like you

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.010
ought to be

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.940
a role model

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.880
and a university student!

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.580
Thank you, Ms. Xu!

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.450
I won't disappoint you and the factory!

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.250
How wonderful.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.690
Fang Muyang.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.680
Let's take a photo.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.300
- Yes.
- Sure.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:36.850
Come on.

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:55.140
Why are you staring at me?

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.180
Why didn't you follow my draft?

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.190
You scared me when you said that.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.250
I already forgot about what you wrote.

00:21:04.026 --> 00:21:05.380
Besides, I didn't want to lie.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.420
You were still lying.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.450
What's with

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.730
"the happiest time you had
since you could remember"?

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:12.770
That's true.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.340
Impossible.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.840
As an amnesiac,

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.400
whatever I could remember

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.900
starts from the moment
I woke up in the hospital, right?

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.810
Besides, I meant it

00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:26.093
when I said it was
the happiest time I had.

00:21:31.026 --> 00:21:32.050
You did a great job.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.210
I'll buy you an ice cream.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.140
Dig in.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.660
This is real ice cream.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:43.570
Dig in.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.440
But this isn't what I wanted to eat.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.340
That's enough.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.450
Don't draw.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.970
I know what you're thinking.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.640
I can't afford that.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.270
Only the fancy restaurants sell those.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:57.730
Try this.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.510
It's delicious.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:10.450
Yummy, right?

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:11.920
I wasn't lying.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.450
You know,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.970
in the past, the only time
my parents would buy this for me

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.648
was when I scored first place in exams.

00:22:19.515 --> 00:22:20.950
Do you often score first place?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.030
Not often.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.290
Every time.

00:22:25.471 --> 00:22:27.770
If university intakes are still
based on academic merit,

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.050
I'd have secured a place.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.590
Unlike now,
where I have to resort to tricks.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.690
So, you took care of me

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.340
to go to university?

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.580
Of course not.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.770
Did I say that?

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.780
Your brain is still injured.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.020
Maybe you heard wrongly.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.290
That's what you said.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.690
You had to resort to tricks
to go to university.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.700
What I said was,

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.290
I took care of you
out of pure goodness from my heart.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.380
So, you had an ulterior motive.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.590
Isn't that normal?

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.680
You needed someone to nurse you,
and I wanted to go to university.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.160
We're just satisfying
each others' needs.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.300
Would you say that in front of Ms. Xu?

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.260
I wouldn't, and you can't, either.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.450
Now, we're on the same boat.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.530
Telling her

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.140
won't do you any good.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.730
Not necessarily.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.170
I'm ill.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.110
If I'm in a bad mood,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.740
or I don't get to eat what I want,

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.600
I might just blabber.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.210
Fine.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.010
I'll buy you that thing
in your sketchbook.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:57.820
What's wrong?

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.530
I can't afford a piano!

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:11.780
(Jiangcheng Vintage Store)

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.940
Go on.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.730
I can't remember.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.110
You'll remember when you play.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.290
Your grandma had a piano, too.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.648
I'm sure you know how to play.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.270
I'll teach you.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.970
Your grandma donated her piano
to the school.

00:24:53.604 --> 00:24:55.450
That's how I learned to play the piano.

Can you remember anything?

I can remember

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.680
that I used to play the piano.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.340
What else?

Nothing.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.180
It's okay.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.140
It's a good start.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.290
I'm sure

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.330
you'll remember everything soon.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.050
I'll make sure to get you
nutritious food.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.150
Who knows, you'll recover tomorrow.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:01.370
Yeah.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.180
Let's play.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.620
Ms. Xu.

00:27:20.915 --> 00:27:23.340
Here's your speech draft
for the meeting two days later.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:24.640
Is there anything

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.630
you want me to change?

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.210
You're getting better at writing.

00:27:32.426 --> 00:27:35.026
The last time I attended
a campaign meeting in the city,

00:27:35.182 --> 00:27:36.400
my speech was highly praised

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.890
by the city-level leaders.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.390
You're the one

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.480
in this factory
who understands me the most.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.180
Given your ability,

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.900
writing speeches for me

00:27:48.182 --> 00:27:49.310
is a waste of your talent.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.780
No, Ms. Xu.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.270
You took me under your wing.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:55.970
I got to enter the university

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.500
because you recommended me.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.330
I'm just doing my part.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.380
Besides,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.770
nothing else helps me improve faster

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:03.900
than learning from you.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.010
Ms. Xu.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.450
The Publicity Board has been updated.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.210
Got it.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.080
Let's see it.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.100
Feng.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.260
What do you think of this edition?

00:28:30.493 --> 00:28:31.280
It looks energetic.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.580
It's also neat

00:28:32.582 --> 00:28:33.730
and beautifully written.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.239
The new university graduates recruited

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.110
by Publicity Division
this time are impressive.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.140
Ms. Xu.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.560
Are you really going to recommend
Fei Ni for the university slot?

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:49.520
What's wrong?

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.790
You think she's not good enough?

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.210
No.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.490
I was just thinking

00:28:55.782 --> 00:28:57.290
that the factory has already chosen

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.340
our candidates this year.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.871
Maybe she can wait till next year.

00:28:59.915 --> 00:29:00.537
Perfect timing.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.810
I was about to ask

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.820
for your opinion on this matter.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:05.910
I was planning

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.520
to let Wang Defa
join next year's intake.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.650
After all, he was chosen
without proper consideration,

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.170
so we ought to observe him further.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.800
Besides, Fei Ni

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.070
has made a significant contribution.

00:29:19.248 --> 00:29:21.804
No one would question
if we bend the rules for her this time.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.210
But, Ms. Xu.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.660
- This is...
- Feng.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.290
Are you in a relationship

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.050
with Wang Defa?

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.250
It's okay to date,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.204
but you're part of the factory's
core management team.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.620
If you insist on
referring him to university,

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.180
it might cause some misunderstanding.

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.480
That's why I'm doing this

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:48.790
for your own good.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.940
He's going to university,

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.290
just later.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.370
You don't need to rush.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.250
I understand.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.720
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.280
Another reminder.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.240
You're not married yet.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:05.050
Be mindful of what you do.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.170
If word of this gets out,

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.770
people might assume

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.750
improper things about the factory.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.650
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:39.860
(Hongxing Supply
and Marketing Cooperative)

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.600
Here, take this.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.140
Lin Mei.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.660
You look like you have good news.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:11.190
How should I put it?

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.290
The person standing before you

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.590
is not the usual Fei Ni,

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.750
but a future student of
the Worker-Peasant-Soldier University.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.140
Really?

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.820
Keep it down.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.220
Keep it down.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.260
Ms. Chen.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.210
Mind the counter for me.
I'll be right back.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.490
Let's talk outside.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.070
Come on.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.180
What's the story?

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.610
Don't put your hands behind.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.050
Come on.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.210
Here.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.782
Your factory is letting you
go to university?

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.360
They haven't announced it yet,

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.580
but Ms. Xu said

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.770
my slot is guaranteed.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.970
I'm sure they'll announce it

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.026
when my brother returns.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:51.820
Phooey.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.470
Touch wood.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:55.250
Why?

00:31:55.626 --> 00:31:56.820
When your brother returns,

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.860
it'd probably be years later.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.840
What's wrong?

00:32:02.026 --> 00:32:04.137
Hasn't he submitted
his application to return?

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.240
Of course not.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.450
Back in autumn,
he said after the autumn harvest.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.620
In winter, he said
that the mountain roads are closed.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.110
Now that it's spring,

00:32:13.204 --> 00:32:14.671
he said he's planting new crops.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.210
I don't get it.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:18.620
Is he the only worker

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.470
in Great Northern Wilderness?

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.180
It's not like everyone
in Great Northern Wilderness

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.310
would starve without him.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.380
I think

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.826
he's not even planning to come back.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.420
Impossible.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.040
Who wouldn't want to come home?

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.100
I'll ask him

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.420
the next time I call him.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.290
Forget it, stay out of this.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.110
Just focus on your plans.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.900
This is his only chance to return.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.180
I'll kidnap him if I have to.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.730
You don't need my help?

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:45.320
No.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.010
I know how to handle

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.380
your brother.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.260
Fine.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.770
Come on, I need to buy some meat.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.730
Someone's splurging today.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.570
I'm cooking for Fang Muyang.

00:32:59.537 --> 00:33:00.730
I think there's meat in stock.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.180
Come on.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.730
Lin Mei.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:08.450
Ms. Feng.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.840
Meat available
at the cooperative tomorrow?

00:33:09.848 --> 00:33:10.293
Yes.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.530
Come early tomorrow.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:12.210
Okay.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.300
(Mrs. Lin)
Your favorite egg soup.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.050
Here.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:19.760
Open your mouth.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.080
Yummy?

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.740
(Lin Jianshe)

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.430
Mom.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.010
I'm back.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.180
You're back.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.010
Here, Jianshe.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.360
Finish this in the kitchen.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.420
Be careful.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.690
Don't spill it.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.730
You don't have to make him hide.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.530
I wouldn't

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.200
steal food from a kid.

00:33:35.782 --> 00:33:37.071
Here, this month's meat coupons.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.050
Meat coupons?

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.900
How many days have you been keeping it?

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.871
Seriously.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:51.940
Go cook dinner.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.915
Your dad and brother
are getting off work soon.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.970
Aihong is working night shift,
isn't she?

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.140
Why isn't she cooking?

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.340
She's working night shift,

00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.770
so she needs to rest during the day,

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.300
or else she won't have energy to work.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.130
I've been standing all day too.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:04.050
I'm tired as well.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.240
Why are you complaining?

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.010
What's wrong with doing some chores?

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:08.900
Think about it.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.010
Your sister-in-law

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.050
let you take over her job
in the cooperative.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.071
That's why she's working
in the mechanical factory,

00:34:14.071 --> 00:34:15.300
working irregular shifts.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.490
How exhausting.

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:18.730
She let me take over her job?

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.604
It was your job before you retired,
so I took over.

00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:21.620
That's perfectly normal.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.280
Your daughter is worth less

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.700
than your daughter-in-law now?

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.900
Once you get married,
you won't be part of the family anymore.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.270
Your dad and I will have to rely on
Aihong and your brother

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.040
to take care of us.

00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.340
Be grateful.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.380
So many educated youths
are jobless once they return.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.130
They can't even afford to buy a bed.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.740
Why do you keep sulking

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.450
when I ask you to do some chores?

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.610
Mom.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.340
Stop lecturing Lin Mei.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.900
Cooking dinner, is it?

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:47.740
I'll do it.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.650
Why you...

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:10.248
I'll do it.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.100
If I make you work,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.340
I'd be a sinner.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.900
Be nice to your sister-in-law!

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.960
(Fang Aihong)
Is it so difficult to cook dinner?

00:35:18.004 --> 00:35:19.070
Ungrateful!

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.220
Mom, don't be mad.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.170
What are you making?

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.660
Making a scarf for my grandson.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.490
Nice color, isn't it?

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:28.570
Yes, it looks pretty.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:30.860
Dinner?

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.250
Huh?

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.100
No dinner.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:45.970
Comrade.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.440
I'd like to make a long-distance call.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.860
Hello?

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:06.740
Lin Mei?

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.248
Have you prepared
your return application?

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:12.810
Lin Mei.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.970
Don't be angry.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.090
Listen to me.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.260
I really can't go back now.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.160
There's only one slot,

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:27.230
and you finally stand a chance.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.120
If you don't submit it, it's gone.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.450
Fei Ting.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.320
I'm telling you.

00:36:34.071 --> 00:36:37.160
I don't want to stay with
my family any longer, even for a day.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.870
Come back quickly.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.230
Otherwise, I...

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:47.120
Or else...

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.820
Even if I go back,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.190
we have no place to stay.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:53.450
Lin Mei.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.420
You know my family.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.630
There are only two rooms.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.010
If we get married,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.780
we'd have to kick Ni out.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:03.700
You...

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.780
Is this why you don't want to come back?

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.760
Why would I kick Fei Ni out?

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:15.440
But...

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.470
But if you keep putting it off...

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:19.820
I...

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:22.780
What should I do?

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.480
My parents are already
arranging blind dates for me.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:28.650
Fei Ting.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.450
You need to be considerate of me.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.010
Lin Mei, I...

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:44.030
I'm sorry.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.280
If you can find someone better,

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.080
I...

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:52.490
I wish you well.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.740
(Application to Return)

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.900
(Inpatient Department)

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.440
Wait.

00:39:14.626 --> 00:39:16.250
How do you know he hasn't recovered yet?

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.840
He didn't recognize me

00:39:17.915 --> 00:39:19.070
when he saw me in the office.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.220
Something's off.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.490
Go, test him.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.120
What if he recognizes me?

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:28.820
Come on.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.170
If he's regained his memories,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.200
he'd remember you anyway.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.370
But if he doesn't recognize you,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.650
it means he hasn't
recovered his memories.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.820
That means Fei Ni deceived Ms. Xu.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.220
Then, you'd still
get to go to university.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.860
Anyway, it's your choice.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.570
Whatever.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:49.740
I'll go.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.150
My leg.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.300
My leg!

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.470
My leg has been crushed!

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:09.530
- Comrade.
- My leg!

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:10.610
- Help!
- Are you okay?

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.050
- My leg has been crushed!
- Let me help you get up.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.480
Here.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.010
Are you okay?

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.220
I'm fine.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:19.820
Thank you, Comrade.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.260
My leg

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.340
was injured.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.430
It was

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:24.590
crushed by

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.190
a tree.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:27.970
A tree?

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.630
Yes.

00:40:29.737 --> 00:40:31.120
Want me to take you to a doctor?

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.010
No need.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.010
It's just a trivial issue.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.230
Be careful, then.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.400
Sure, thank you.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.290
Thank you.

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.820
No worries.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.010
He didn't recognize me.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.060
He looked at me as if I were a stranger.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.200
Fei Ni.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:02.660
Let's see how you'll keep
this facade up.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.430
(Strict, Serious)

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.130
What?

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.440
Fang Muyang hasn't fully recovered?

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.050
I went to visit Fang Muyang today

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.640
while representing the factory

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:15.610
to thank the hospital.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.680
But Dr. Liang told me

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.050
that he's not aware
of Fang Muyang's recovery.

00:41:20.337 --> 00:41:21.520
So, I investigated further.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.740
I talked to Fang Muyang's nurse

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.280
and other patients who talked to him.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.520
Everyone said

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.340
that Fang Muyang hasn't recovered yet.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.440
Feng.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:36.970
Mind you,

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.480
you're accusing the hero of lying.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.320
Be careful.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.480
Do you have evidence?

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:48.600
Ms. Xu.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.950
You know me best.

00:41:50.137 --> 00:41:51.220
If I didn't have evidence,

00:41:51.248 --> 00:41:52.550
I wouldn't make such accusations.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.900
Look, Ms. Xu.

00:41:55.115 --> 00:41:56.910
This is the hospital's diagnosis report.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.550
Of course,

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.004
(Diagnosis Report)
I trust Fang Muyang is a decent man.

00:42:01.048 --> 00:42:01.820
(Diagnosis: Amnesia caused by
external trauma, blood clot remains)

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:02.700
I'm just worried

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.137
that he's been manipulated.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.720
Ms. Tu.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.320
Do you know why Ms. Xu wants to see me?

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.550
I don't know.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.560
Wait here.

00:42:49.093 --> 00:42:49.950
Hello, Ms. Xu.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:50.410
Hello.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.200
Hello, Ms. Xu.
