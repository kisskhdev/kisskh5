[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.800
[Episode 7]

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.530
Installing something?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.460
There you are. Take a seat.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.810
Do you think it's a bit narrow?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.560
It'll trap one's head, won't it?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.759
Hold it. I'll test it.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.350
Let me see. I'll sit here.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.520
Move a bit forward.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.240
Gosh. It's not working.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.650
It's like torturing myself, isn't it?

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.030
This won't do.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.740
There's too little space.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.520
I need to widen it.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.840
What's with you?

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.880
Are you upset?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.810
No, I'm not.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.360
Well, c-can you lend me 300 yuan?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.090
How much?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.420
Three hundred.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.240
I lost my deskmate Li Ao's

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.690
Walkman.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.120
My goodness.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120
What can be worth 300 yuan?

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.310
Just a Walkman.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.010
I'll see if I have that much.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.640
Three hundred yuan for a Walkman...

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.890
Is there enough money?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.990
I doubt it.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.680
Let's see if there's enough money.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.030
Large bills first.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.090
A fifty, and a one hundred.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.310
Here's 150.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.240
How much is this?

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.680
Forty-five.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.030
Fifty.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.040
Two hundred.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.560
One, two, three...

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.910
Okay, this is enough.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.079
T-Thirty. I'll take that.

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:22.800
This will do. I...

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.150
Take more.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.150
T-This is enough.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.910
Keep some for yourself.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.870
I mean it. Take more.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.190
Y-You keep some for yourself.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.079
Take it back.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:28.680
Keep it for yourself.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.000
I-I'll go home and get some more.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.590
Is it enough?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.630
Yes, it is.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.520
Let me know if you need more.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.800
I-I'll figure something out for you.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.860
I saved up a little.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.260
I-I'll give Li Ao the money tomorrow.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.000
B-But...

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.150
I can't

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.910
pay you back anytime soon.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.400
I-I-I'm afraid

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.400
that will take a while.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.329
What's the rush?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360
Treat me to some meals at your home,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360
and we'll be even.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.680
Just take the money.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.150
Okay.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.560
I'll get going then.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.320
I'll pay you back later.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.240
Is everything's fine?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.710
Yes.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.840
What could go wrong?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.630
But you seem a bit down today.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.770
Off you go!

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.190
Da,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.800
I've got you all the issues

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.560
of Shenzhen Special Zone Daily

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.400
from the past few weeks.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.150
Take a look.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.560
By the way,

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.960
someone has taken over this place.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.220
I'll probably leave with Nana next week.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.269
So soon?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120
Let's have dinner

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.310
s-s-somewhere sometime

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.310
in the following days.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.480
Don't delay it.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.560
Let's make it today.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.480
Just come over. My treat.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.920
Okay.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.270
Xiaoman! Xiaoman!

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.680
Xia Lei is missing.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.870
Missing?

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.159
That can't be true.
He just borrowed money from us.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.159
It's all my fault.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.120
He helped me cheat in the mock exam,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.510
so his score was invalidated.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.630
He has lost his spot
for guaranteed admission.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.510
Do you think he might...

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.040
His score was invalidated?

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.320
In this case,
he must've run away from home.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.190
What should we do then?

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.270
Let's go find him for sure.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.140
To the train station, now!

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.920
We have to go.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.000
See you later.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.610
Bye bye!

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.950
Nana,

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.490
bring the helmets over.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.300
What are you doing?

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.890
Give it to Zhigang.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.000
Why?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.750
Lei's 18 years old now.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.680
Why worry about him?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.020
Can't you just cut the crap?

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.350
Lei's parents work for the factory,
don't they?

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.080
Get a move on.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.360
I hate this.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.830
Xiang! Xiang!

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.040
My child! Xiang!

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.560
[Entry]

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.950
Xiang! My son!

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.120
Xiang!

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.680
W-Where have you been?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680
Where have you been?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.600
Where on earth have you been?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680
Mom...

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.310
Didn't I tell you

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.960
not to wander off at the train station?

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.920
Where would that leave me

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.720
if you really got lost?

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.270
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.270
I won't wander off again.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.159
Ma'am, he was just being naughty.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.240
No, I wasn't!

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.130
I was looking for my train ticket!

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.800
Son,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.870
Mom can always

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.270
buy you a replacement ticket.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.130
But if you get lost,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.680
Mom can never buy a replacement for you.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.120
Let's go.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.090
Sir, pull up.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.120
Pull up right here.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.000
-Anything wrong?
-Sir.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.800
Just pull up, sir.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.310
Look, you two go to the train station,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.630
while I look for Lei

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.620
along the river.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.510
If we can't find him

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.240
at the train station,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.040
I'll go home to make a call.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.510
Okay. You two go ahead.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.450
Where should we go?

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.600
Down there!

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.950
Wait for me! Wait!

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.310
Do you remember where we used to play
as kids—

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.909
that place under the bridge?

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.310
Let's see if he's hanging out there.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.270
What made you think so?

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.270
I just had a feeling

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.070
that he probably went there.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.720
We're about to arrive.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.850
Let's go take a look.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.870
Is someone standing there?

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.560
Xia Lei?

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:58.220
He's running away!

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.920
Xia Lei!

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.000
Wait for me! Wait!

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.270
Xia Lei!

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.270
Xia Lei!

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.900
Where is he?

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.410
Where is Xia Lei?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.360
Could he have jumped into the river?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.480
Xia Lei?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.830
Help!

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.920
Help!

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.480
Anyone there? Help...

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.600
-Help!
-What are you doing?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.480
What drove you to this state, Xia Lei?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.680
I can't believe this.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.360
Xia Lei!

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.310
Help! Help!

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.510
Xia Lei!

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.510
Help!

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.830
Why commit suicide? Who taught you this?

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.120
Xia Lei!

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.680
Grab my arm now!

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.750
Xia Lei!

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.240
Come a bit closer! I dare not go further.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.680
Come this way, Xia Lei!

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.100
-Are you okay?
-Come help her.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.310
Keep your head up.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.840
Okay. This is alright.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.870
You're fine now.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.650
What's wrong with you?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.850
Why did you attempt suicide
during the short time we were away?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.000
I was trying to save a life.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.510
How was that a suicide attempt?

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.160
What happened?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.920
Why did you have to

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.600
get in the river?

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.270
I'm afraid of water.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.400
Don't you know that?

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.290
A life was in danger.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.760
What else could I do?

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.280
Wait.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.040
Where did you meet her?

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.920
Who's this girl?

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.920
Why did you try to take your own life?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.390
How about

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.790
telling us what happened to you?

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.390
We're basically strangers.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.530
Why not tell us your story?

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.540
It's none of your business.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.240
How could you say that?
We're concerned about you.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.240
The three of us tried so hard to save you.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.160
How is it none of our business?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.880
Why the yelling? You're scaring her.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.270
I'm not...

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.789
She was just saved from the river.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.549
I was only defending you.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.480
Don't mind them.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.150
They're just worried about you.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.960
W-Where

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.120
i-is your home?

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.720
Do your parents work in our factory?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.960
What's your name?

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.840
Your ears still work, don't they?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.770
Is it the time to have a smart mouth?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.720
No, I mean well. I-I am

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.630
Zhang Xiaoman.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.180
She's Yan Xiaodan.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.040
Call me Xiaodan.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.630
And this suicidal guy is Xia Lei.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.910
I'm not suicidal.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.180
What's your name?

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.630
Ye Chunchun.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.750
Ye Chunchun!

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.690
My ears aren't working.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.480
There must be water in your ears.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.280
Do a few jumps.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.990
"Ye Chunchun..."

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.920
Sounds like an out-of-towner's name.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.020
You have a beautiful name.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.260
Look what a fuss it has become.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.980
I see. Just because your dad
raised a hand at you,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.110
you came here for...

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.720
It wasn't worth it, really.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.060
What kid hasn't been disciplined
by their parents?

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.670
Lei here will surely be spanked
when he gets home today.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.600
I'm telling you,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.010
we've all been beaten.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.510
I got a spanking every day
when I was a kid.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.510
Every single day.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.240
What did your dad beat you with?

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.840
My dad used his electrician's tool belt.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.610
That hurt a lot.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.550
It got so intense
that I ran all over the house,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.550
looking for a place to hide.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.480
Then my father became smart. He...

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.000
He locked me in a room while he hit me.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.060
I couldn't run off,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.730
so I had to endure it.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.840
But later, nobody beat me again.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.200
My dad is not around anymore.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.440
But if my dad came back now

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.750
and tried to get rough with me,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.010
I assure you I would...

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.680
You would have to endure it the same.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.100
What else could you do?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.480
I was planning to run away from home
today.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.480
But after I saved you from the river,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.720
I started thinking...

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.360
that no problem in life

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.890
couldn't be solved. Right?

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.550
Don't worry. I'm fine.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.200
You guys should go.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.410
Not before we watch you leave.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.880
Do you have a place to go?

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.580
I guess I'll go to a relative's,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.480
and... head home tomorrow.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.900
How do you get there? Is it far?

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.720
Well, look...

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.900
I have some money on me.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.810
T-Though it's wet.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.080
Take it.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.470
Go home now.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.370
Even I'm not scared.
What do you have to fear?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.300
She's not afraid of death,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.580
yet money's a problem for her?

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.070
How generous of you.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.390
Thanks.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.720
Just go home.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.790
Live your life.
D-Don't hurt yourself again.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.750
What's the point?

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.610
But if one day, you really feel...

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.510
that...

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.750
you can't go on with your life,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.120
do pay him back first.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.460
That's all the money he has.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.520
He hasn't another penny to his name.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.210
And he borrowed it all from me.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.540
That won't happen.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.000
I'm leaving now.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.630
Take care.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.670
Well...

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.450
Take your jacket back.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.000
No, keep it on. You must feel cold.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.200
It's your school uniform.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.320
I can't take it.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.270
Thank you all.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.390
Why stare at me? You're acting crazy.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.590
Am I not allowed to...

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.650
What's wrong with her?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.750
We shouldn't have saved you.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.750
We even gave you money for a ride home.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.960
Who's the crazy one now?

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.820
Do I look crazy?

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.750
Y-Y-You're not crazy.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.010
You're just annoying.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:58.910
How am I annoying?

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.200
I was just trying to amuse her, wasn't I?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.960
S-She was attempting suicide.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.780
How could I...

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.220
She quickly gave the jacket back to you,
though.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.650
About the money...

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.030
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.750
What? I already promised to pay you back.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.000
Why did you hit me?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
You borrowed money from me

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.120
so you could run away from home, huh?

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.320
Did you mean to cause me trouble?

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.200
I didn't really plan to run away.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.910
I just wanted
to hide at my grandpa's place

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.200
in Harbin for a few days.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.510
Hide for a few days...

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.210
Why didn't you do it then?

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.790
When I was waiting to get on the train,

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.200
I saw a mother spanking her son.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.670
So...

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.200
You fancied a spanking?

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.930
You should've said it.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.670
Either of us could make that happen
for you.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.360
Xia Lei,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.270
I'm sorry.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.120
I dragged you down.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.580
Don't say that.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.390
It was my idea.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.500
I handed you the ruler myself.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.550
P-Perhaps I am the one

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.790
who dragged you down.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.480
Come on. You're both in trouble now.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.410
Does it matter who takes the blame?

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.260
You should go home right away.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.090
Don't make me part of this mess.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.460
Your parents are looking for you
like crazy.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.120
W-Well then, I'll head home now, alright?

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.030
Get a move on.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.010
You two should go home too.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.600
Don't fall into the river again!

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.120
Got it!

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.710
Don't worry.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.610
He's a big boy now.
What could possibly happen?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.950
Maybe he has gone to his grandfather's.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.630
He's back.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.980
Xia Lei! Where have you been?

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.220
What did you do?

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.000
Look how worried your mom is.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.130
Where have you been?

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.300
Mom, I'm sorry I did wrong. I'm sorry!

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.030
Stop it, Mom.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.080
I apologize, Mom. I'm sorry!

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.790
You're a pain in the neck!

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.390
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.390
Were you trying to terrify me to death?

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.120
What happened to your clothes?

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.390
Mom, I'm sorry...

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.200
-We'll talk upstairs.
-Don't hit me.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.750
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.750
I know I did wrong.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.640
Go home now.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.820
Don't let our neighbors see this.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.490
Why did you take that box out?

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.710
Aren't you keeping her away

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.710
from those magazines?

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.800
The exams are over.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.800
She can read these as she likes.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.810
When she gets home,

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.350
don't bring up that cheating incident.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.030
Why would I mention it?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.030
Kids always act like kids,

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:16.930
honestly.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.580
What if Xiaodan follows Xia Lei's example

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.110
and runs away?

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:23.910
I wonder if Xia Lei

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.310
will be found by tonight.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.320
Don't you worry.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.330
Xiaodan doesn't have the guts for that.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.240
Here's a metaphor.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.260
Have you seen those springs
in the factory?

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.790
With pressure on them all the time,

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.250
they'll lose elasticity.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.150
So every now and then,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.680
you need to relax them a bit.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.390
And then what?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.880
Then, apply pressure again.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.960
Sweetie, why are your clothes all wet?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.240
Hurry to the bathroom.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.500
Go to the bathroom now.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.170
Take off your clothes.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.080
You go turn on the water heater.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.670
What were you doing?

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.050
You're soaking wet.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.770
Go turn on the water heater!

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.750
Take off your clothes, Sweetie.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.880
You need warm water.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.000
Xiaoman. Xiaoman!

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.080
-What are you doing here?
-My brother...

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.550
My brother...

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.290
Well, your brother...

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.240
He has gone to Tiecheng
to look for Xia Lei.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.140
He should be back soon.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.070
No. He was taken by the police.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.550
For what?

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.720
He went to Tiecheng with Zhigang

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.290
and met Mr. Li on the way.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.390
And then?

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.790
Then they were besieged
by Mr. Li and his men.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.790
My brother... started p-putting up

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.440
a fight.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.220
Is Da okay?

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:41.930
I-I don't know.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.550
I want you to go to the police station
with me

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.840
and explain what happened

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.150
at the pool hall last time.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.600
I know

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.170
Mr. Li has been dying
to mess with my brother.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.410
Let's go then.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:51.950
I-I...

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.300
I-I'll ride a bike.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.330
-There's no bus now.
-Make it quick!

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.380
Where do I put this?

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.200
Right there. That spot.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840
The stool in front.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.360
Xiaoman, I'll put this in your room.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.690
Leave it on my brick bed.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:15.810
Oh right, Xiaoman.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.850
My brother said...

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.570
he'd like you to have all his boxing gear.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.590
Me?

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:23.270
He said you have a real gift

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.200
and should practice more.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.120
The key to the motorcycle is on it.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.510
My brother trusts you with it.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.550
If you feel like riding it,

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.790
then get a license.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.030
Understood. I...

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.690
I'll keep it safe.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.960
Well...

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.120
What will happen to Da?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.940
M-M-My brother said he would be fine
in jail.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.240
He'll be out in a year or two.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.220
He'll even be released early

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.470
if he behaves well.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.430
He told you guys not to worry.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.080
I'm sorry.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.700
This wouldn't have happened

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.540
if he hadn't gone out to look for me.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.070
Don't beat yourself up.
My brother told you not to overthink it.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.119
He would've done so for any other kid
connected to the factory.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.250
Don't think too much about it, Xia Lei.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.030
Dongdong...

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.349
Well, while Da is away from home,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.930
think of me as your brother.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.790
Let me know if you need anything.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.920
I-I'll be there for you.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.720
Yes. Let us know if you need help.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.829
Okay. I'm leaving then.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.590
By the way, my brother... told us to never

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.340
follow in his footsteps.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:34.640
Bye.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.240
Take care!

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.850
The road's slippery.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.520
Sir, can I have a bag?

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.310
Sure.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.070
How's the fish today?

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:53.470
Very fresh. Buy some.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.600
How much for the eggplants?

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600
Take a look first.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.510
Holding a grudge, isn't she?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.240
Freshly harvested this morning.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.480
Good thing you're not buying this.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:02.960
Now I can

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.420
take my time with the pick.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.590
Such nice fish.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.520
Hey, do you not know that incident?

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.810
No. What incident?

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.030
Her son failed the mock exam

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.310
and ran away from home.

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.830
Really?

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:13.400
Really.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.590
Is her son back now?

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.110
Yes.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.390
Haven't you noticed how upset

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.000
-he is in recent days?
-This one's good.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.720
Take this.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.140
It's not very spicy.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.340
Hey, Guizhen. Guizhen!

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.700
Look at the fish today.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.400
It's really good.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.070
So fresh.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.750
Come on, buy a fish for Xia Lei.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.310
Hurry. Take your pick.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.470
What's this for, Wang Chunhua?

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.790
Nothing, Guizhen.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.000
I heard about your kid.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.680
Just be glad that he's back now.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.960
Don't let it get to you.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:47.920
Well...

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.350
Come on, pick a fish for your son.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.480
He needs nutrition.

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.360
I believe he'll do better
in the next exam.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.740
That's right. Take your pick.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.270
Go ahead.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.140
I'll round down the price for you.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.270
Seriously,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.120
I don't think

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.420
guaranteed admission

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.190
is necessarily a good thing.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.610
Students don't get to choose

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:09.980
the majors they like that way, right?

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.570
Right.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.500
Besides,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.000
your son Xia Lei is an overachiever.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.700
He'll definitely get into
a better university, won't he?

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.500
He missed a chance,
but a bright future awaits him.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.550
Right?

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:21.900
Yes, exactly.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.320
Listen,

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.750
I think you made a good point.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.480
I did, right?

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.550
My son Xia Lei is usually

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.880
quiet and timid.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.880
But by running off,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.390
he did give me quite a fright.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.590
Such a handful, isn't he?

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.510
Yes, I agree.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.410
Alright, just take a breather.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.000
Well, tell me.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.660
Am I being too strict with him?

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.840
You see, a kid his age would run wild

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.110
without discipline, right?

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.830
Right.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.040
Look, disciplining him is one thing,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.640
but keeping his nutrition up is another,
isn't it?

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.920
Come on, pick a fish.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.900
I'll be straight with you two.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.580
You're bound to receive
a disciplinary action.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.210
But this might not affect your Gaokao.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.410
Based on your performance here

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.590
this year,

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.590
the school

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.820
will decide whether to put it
on your records or not.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.120
-Thank you, Ms. Tong.
-Thank you, Ms. Tong.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.050
We promise we won't do wrong again.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.110
Xia Lei,

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.250
I know losing the spot
for guaranteed admission

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.910
is a huge blow to you.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.000
But when you leave school, you'll realize

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.200
that all setbacks in life are temporary

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.910
and they never last long.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.510
Thank you, Ms. Tong.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.110
I... I'll keep working hard.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.290
Alright. Go attend classes.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.370
Goodbye, Ms. Tong.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:44.830
Here it comes.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.920
Hurry.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.310
It's been a long wait.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.600
This is a major dish.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.420
Hairy crabs are not to be missed
in Shanghai.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.590
You ordered so many dishes.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.720
What a feast.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.470
Dig in. All the dishes are here.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.920
-Start eating.
-Yan.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.070
You and your family rarely

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.790
come back to Shanghai.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.330
I should be the one hosting,

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.640
yet you're the one paying.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.970
What's the difference?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.400
This is just a family gathering, isn't it?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.440
Come on, come on.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.130
A drink first.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.130
Cheers.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.110
I-I'll switch it to liquor.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.350
Guoqing, you know what?

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.350
Years ago,
Uncle Yan should've been assigned

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.930
to the Light Industry Council,

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.310
yet he was determined
to devote his prime years
to the development

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.310
of the Northeast.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.920
So he recommended
the school choose me instead.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.460
Otherwise,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.410
God knows where you would have been born.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.280
Propose a toast to Uncle Yan now.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.350
-Uncle Yan.
-H-Hold it.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.510
You should hear my side of the story

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.510
and ignore your father's nonsense.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.540
I merely made a recommendation.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.000
He got chosen
mainly because of his good grades,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.160
which also made him famous at school.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.440
Yan, back then, it was known to all
that people of approved social classes

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.440
got to work in the Third Front Plant,

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.200
while those who were not could only end up

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.330
making paper boxes.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.890
Young people like I was,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.350
stuck in the middle,

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.960
couldn't have landed a job

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.640
in a government office
under normal circumstances, right?

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.440
That was true.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.960
Therefore, Yan,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.030
I've always remembered

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.750
how kind you were to me.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.460
Thank you.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.350
Don't mention it.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.790
Listen,

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.790
that was all in the past.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.920
Stop dwelling on it.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.480
How can I forget it?

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.860
Now, I'd like to make a promise.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.950
In the future, Yan, if you ever need help,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.440
just let me know.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.300
I won't hesitate to lend you
a helping hand.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.750
I was waiting for you to say that.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.480
Come on. Time for a drink.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.550
Cheers, guys.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:37.960
Sure.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.800
Clink our glasses once more.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.720
Sweetie,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.830
take a pause on the eating.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.240
Propose a toast to Guoqing's parents.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.440
It's okay.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.350
Dig in.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.610
To Mr. Chen and Mrs. Chen.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.810
Thanks, Xiaodan.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.490
Be seated, Xiaodan.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.640
It has been many years
since we last met Xiaodan,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.310
hasn't it?

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.000
I remember she wasn't even

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.860
as tall as this table at that time.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.240
Look at her now.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.010
She has grown into a beautiful young lady.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.680
We shouldn't have spoiled her.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.680
She's nothing like a Shanghai girl.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.640
Guoqing is much better in comparison.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.240
What an overachieving

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.620
handsome fella he is.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.460
He'll be a big-shot translator

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.590
in two years after graduation, right?

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.040
I'm flattered, Auntie.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.960
I think Xiaodan is great too.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.750
She's so composed

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.880
and pretty.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.240
Alright. Stop with the compliments.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.400
They're both wonderful kids.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.110
-They really are.
-Yes.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.160
Xiaodan, learn from Guoqing,

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.920
will you?

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.590
Come on, Xiaodan.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.420
A piece of braised pork for you.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.960
Your family

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.890
don't often get to enjoy this dish.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.630
Doesn't it taste good, Sweetie?

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.930
What's wrong?
It doesn't agree with you, does it?

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160
It's too sweet.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:54.760
You don't get it.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.620
Let me tell you, sweetness

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.310
is a major feature of Shanghai cuisine.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.310
You call this sweet?

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.720
Isn't the sweet and sour fried pork
in the Northeast sweeter than this?

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.920
That agrees with you quite well.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.750
That's different.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.750
The dishes for ladies in the Northeast
are very tasty.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:10.830
Look at her.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.510
Yan, you've got a fine Shanghai girl

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.750
hooked on what—

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.920
Northeast food, right?

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I'm telling you, it's not just that.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.680
Now, this lady is—

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.160
to put it in our local dialect—

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.920
a flat-out

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.650
wild thing from the Northeast.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.310
"Flat-out..."

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.270
Sounds interesting.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.440
-What does it mean?
-Venture a guess.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.110
It means

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.110
"completely" in the Northeast.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.640
-I've learned something new.
-Come on.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.880
Time for a drink.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.340
Cheers.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.840
The liquor's good.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.720
We each drank about 250 grams of liquor.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.830
It happens when the two of us gather,

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:52.350
right?

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.000
Exactly.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
It's been so long.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.310
Well...

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.850
I'm counting on you for the transfer.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.830
Don't worry.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.510
I'll handle it.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.440
Great. That's all I needed to hear.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.710
Oh well...

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.360
Did you give your number to Guoqing?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.510
Good.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.080
Thank you, Mrs. Chen.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.260
You're welcome.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.440
-Let’s shake hands.
-You young people

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.880
-should keep in touch.
-Good luck in everything.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.070
-Thanks.
-Wish you every success.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.480
Guoqing,

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.830
you young people must stay in contact.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:17.400
Sure thing.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.270
Let's go.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.310
You didn't drive here, did you?

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.350
-No.
-G-Get a taxi then.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.030
Let's go.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.540
Zhang Xiaoman.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.700
Who are you?

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.200
Don't you remember?

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.240
You are...

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.740
Say it,
or I won't give you the money back.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.440
Y-You owe me about 200 yuan, right?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.400
I remember.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.160
You are that girl!

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:56.680
Who exactly?

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.160
You are...

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:57.620
Who am I?

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:58.690
Your name is...

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.330
C-Chunchun, right?

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.960
Bingo. You remembered me
at the mention of money, huh?

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.960
Yeah. W-Why did you come to my place?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.070
To give you your money back,

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.910
as I was saying.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.240
I asked about you on my way here.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.750
Why does everyone here
know your home address?

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.750
Are you famous or what?

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.380
In this neighborhood—I'm not kidding—

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.970
everyone knows about me, Zhang Xiaoman.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.830
Just so you know, I've eaten

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.880
in every household
connected to the factory.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.920
What does that say about me?

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.480
You're a freeloader.
That's what says about you.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.440
What freeloader?

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.240
I just...

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.880
What do you want?

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.930
To pay you back.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.400
Listen,

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:28.420
I've counted it.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.340
It's the exact amount you lent me.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.280
My debt's cleared now.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.240
I don't owe you anything anymore.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.370
I'm putting it here.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.330
Such a courteous lady, aren't you?

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.000
Not a penny less?

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.640
Okay. Thanks.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.550
No problem.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.830
I'm leaving then.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.400
Remember to tell your friends

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.600
that I said thank you.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.630
You came here only to pay me back?

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.640
It was a long journey. Don't leave yet.
Well...

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.480
I'll treat you to dinner
after all this washing.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.370
So I can tag along with you

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.900
and be a freeloader as well?

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.010
Won't that be nice?

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.000
I'd rather not.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:57.980
Wash your clothes.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.070
I'm leaving.
Let me hold it down with this.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.180
-Okay.
-So the money won't be blown away.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:01.830
-Okay.
-I'll be on my way.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.480
Thank you!

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.110
Bye bye!

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:04.580
Take care!

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.640
Stay away from the river!

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.070
I got it.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.860
Alright. She's nice.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.170
Who's there?

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:20.480
Xiaoman!

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.130
It's me, Zhuang Sen.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.740
What are you doing here?

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.160
I'm not being followed, right?

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.360
You're not. Sit down.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.650
What's going on?

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.830
I'm hiding from my dad.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.010
My dad asked me to take over his job

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.040
in the nitric acid unit. Did you know?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:38.770
No, I didn't.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.240
I wore his uniform for a day,
and that was enough for me.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.130
I didn't dare to look in the mirror.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.260
The man in it wasn't my true self at all.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.440
I, Zhuang Sen,

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.960
cannot shine unless I stand

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.510
in the spotlight.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.700
So I've decided

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.500
to seek my fortune in Beijing.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:56.200
My goodness.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.800
You're going to Beijing too.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.760
It's so far away.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.270
You've got real guts.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.350
Who else is going?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.310
Xiaodan. She said she would go to Beijing

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.960
to attend some exam.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.390
Tell her

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.290
she'll have a contact in Beijing.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.480
Have her call me when she's there.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.240
For real?

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:11.820
For real.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.530
Then make something of yourself there
quickly.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.120
We'll meet again in Beijing.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.720
"We"?

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.070
You're going with her?

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.400
I'll just get her there.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.000
I see.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.140
You're into her.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.070
Nonsense. Beijing is far away.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.480
Shouldn't I protect her on the way?

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.080
Xiaodan is quite a nice girl.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:28.360
Smart and pretty.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.880
She's got class, too.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.200
But, Xiaoman, you need to show
your talent and potential.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.680
Otherwise, when she goes to college
and you go to a technical school,

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.480
will you stand a chance with her?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.620
Since when have you become a snob?

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.470
In fact,
you've been like this all the time.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.610
Try to win her heart.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.140
I'll build a career in Beijing first.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.340
Then the two of you can count on me there.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.240
Dreams are not to be put on hold.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.350
They are meant to be achieved.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.640
Of course,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.270
it's a virtue to help others
realize their dreams.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:04.430
Are you...

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.640
in need of money?

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.460
What do you say?

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.460
Will you help me realize my dream?

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.960
So this is what you were building up to.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.680
The factory gives me a monthly subsidy
of 100 yuan.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.160
Here's the subsidy.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.880
And here's my pocket money.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.970
Take it all.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.270
This is your investment then.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.200
You will have a share
of my every future achievement.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.400
Just don't forget me.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.170
Keep the guitar.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.180
Why?

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.070
Take it.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.240
It's a bad deal for you, isn't it?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.390
You're giving me your guitar
for this little money?

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.390
Keep this in mind:

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.910
the show must go on.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:56.740
Okay.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.550
Look at your luggage.
Let me give you a ride.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.070
No need.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.250
I shall tread this path alone.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.530
No need to see me off.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.160
Goodbye.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.110
Remember this:

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.830
victory must be our destination.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.830
Take care

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.100
when you're in Beijing.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.330
You take care too. Pursue your dream.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.750
Use the door, not the window again!

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.720
Don't worry. It's faster this way!

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.320
That's a rough path at night.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.110
See? I told you so.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.350
Did you fall?

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:40.900
Into the ditch?

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.450
"Reminding me not to give up
even when I fall!"

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.400
Not bad. Two loads exactly.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.970
When you and your grandma

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.800
first set up this newsstand,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.240
I truly envied you,

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.070
for being surrounded by books and such.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.270
I felt like I could be with them forever.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.310
So what? Nobody buys any of these now.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.590
This business just sucks away

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.790
my time, without earning a penny for me.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.290
Then what do you want to do?

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.930
I've asked Zhigang and the guys
to get me a job.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.940
It's to deliver gas tanks.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.240
Do you know... who owns

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.830
that gas filling station?

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:27.880
Who?

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.160
Feng Xiaobo's uncle.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.960
He's working there too.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.160
Has he stopped messing with you?

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.070
It's been so long.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.620
Why would he mess with me again?

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.250
Besides, I'm working for his family now.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.070
Right?

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.260
He's kind of my supervisor.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.460
That makes him happy.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.200
I-I'll pack these books
and take them away,

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:49.920
alright?

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:50.770
Take them all.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.700
Pick whatever you like and keep it.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.350
Have you picked some for Xiaodan?

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.680
Yes, I did that long ago.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.330
She'll have them when she comes back.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:00.550
Come on out.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.400
Tidy up a bit.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.860
Then I'll close the stand.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.780
Let go.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.070
Alright.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.550
It's all cleaned up.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.490
Will you take this board?

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.430
Just leave it be.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.350
Weren't these books sold to you
at 30% of the price

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.610
from the factory library a few years ago?

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.590
Now you're selling them back to us
at a higher price?

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.520
No. These only take up a small part.

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.240
I bought most of the others for my stand
not long ago.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.970
Those are brand new books. See?

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.790
I subscribed the magazines

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:17.350
on a yearly basis.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.880
The first half of the year is just over.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.440
When the issues for the second half
arrive,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.590
I'll give them to you for free.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.830
Sir, I'm actually helping the factory

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.360
by bringing in new reading materials.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.890
Why else am I selling these?

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:28.860
The reading room...

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:29.720
Think about it.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.480
When was the last time
you visited the reading room?

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.310
People stopped coming here long ago.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.640
Alright, take them back.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.920
Look, do you know
why people stopped coming here?

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.830
Because my newsstand
used to be in the way.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.270
Everyone went there to read.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.880
Now with my stand closed
and my books sold,

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.240
people will come back here, right?

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.270
The problem is nobody reads these now.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.270
There isn't a place for these books.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.880
Just be honest with me
if you want a lower price.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.920
If a 50% discount doesn't work,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.640
then...

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.190
I can't raise it to 80%, can I?

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:56.640
An 80% discount?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.310
Look at these books. Look.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.960
They're all in mint condition.
An 80% discount?

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.270
I will buy as many as there are,

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.240
if I have that discount.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.070
Exactly.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.550
Right? I'm selling below cost.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.160
Really.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.160
Really?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.409
An 80% discount?

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.760
I would take as many as he sells.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.920
Wang. Wang!

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.780
Stop with that.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.810
I'm not selling those books to you.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.000
They'll buy the old books
at 20% of the original price.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.710
No, no, Mr. Xu. It's not like that.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.190
I'm talking about these books here.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:24.000
I'm here to sell,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.150
not to buy.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.170
Where would I store those old books?

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.170
Then sell yours to Wang.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:39.400
So you're selling these books

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.920
and newspapers to Wang by the catty?

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.320
Don't get me started.
It's a favor already.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.090
Nobody else would buy my books.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.440
Look at the factory library,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.550
running out of fundings all of a sudden.
How can that be?

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.960
The same is happening everywhere.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.710
Take my injections as an example.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.570
I used to receive two every month,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.780
but now it's one every two months.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.260
Why are you saying this to a kid?

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.670
What else should I say?

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.320
Isn't the factory trying to cut costs now?

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.650
The quarterly bonus hasn't been paid yet.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.280
Xiaoman, I got you a jar of the pickles

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.410
you liked last time.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.280
Bring it home.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.470
Perfect. I just finished mine.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.280
I can't have a meal without these.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.150
Easy on marinated food, though.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.670
Got it.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.710
You scared me. What are you doing?

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.280
Take a second out of studying
to eat some pear soup.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.930
When I do other things, you always tell me

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.110
t-to go study instead.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.360
While I'm doing exercises now,

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.150
you're asking me to take a break.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.080
Is it wrong for me to care about you?

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.000
Isn't this the way people show care?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.230
When you focus on your studies,
Mom wants to remind you

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.710
of paying attention

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.070
to your health, and such.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.330
But you're interrupting my studies now.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.440
Why does that voice sound so familiar?

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.240
It's Xiaoman.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:52.480
No way. Xiaoman's voice sounds lovely.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:55.480
It really is him.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.140
Does anyone need a gas refill?

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.370
Does anyone need a gas refill?

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.280
Xiaoman!

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.110
Come up here. I just made pear soup.
Come on!

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:05.820
No, but thanks, Auntie!

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.940
I'm working now.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.540
Do your homework, Lei!

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.170
Look at that.
I'll get him a bowl of pear soup.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:11.700
Hurry!

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.120
Hey, a gas refill here!

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.110
Yes!

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.880
Stop making noise! Lose that loudspeaker.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.880
My kid's asleep.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.190
Sorry. I got it.

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.310
Come on, Xiaoman.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.280
-Have some pear soup.
-Auntie.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.070
Thanks, Auntie.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.200
Your voice is wretched from shouting.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.440
You sound like a crow now. How come?

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.000
Tank refill service can't earn me
much money.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
I have to keep my voice up
for business opportunities.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:58.210
-Eat up.
-Xiaoman.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.040
-Xiaoman?
-I-Is it too hot?

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.950
Hey, Xiaoman.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.630
Take this tape recorder.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.360
No way.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.410
How many tanks do I have to refill
to pay for this thing?

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.110
Your voice can't take all this shouting.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.000
Just record your gas refill pitch with it

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
and hit "replay."

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.360
It's better than shouting.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:11.840
That's right.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.760
All that shouting will crush your throat,
won't it?

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.880
-Yeah.
-I don't need this.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.540
All is fine.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.670
It's a gift for you.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.510
Just take it.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.710
I have a double-deck recorder now.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.470
Nobody uses this old one anymore.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.150
Really?

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.920
Really.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.320
-Just take it.
-Okay then.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.400
-Give me the bowl.
-Let me check it out.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.200
How does it...

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.290
A tape's inside.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.070
Got it.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.000
Xiaoman!

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.360
A gas refill here!

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.020
Sure thing!

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.050
Alright. I'm sending up a tank.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:36.730
Be careful.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.960
Off it goes!

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.560
I'll put the recorder on your cart.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.400
Honestly,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.150
Xiaoman's not having an easy life.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.280
Look at you.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.480
All you need to do is study
and nothing else.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.940
Make him your godson then.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.540
You have no idea how blessed you are.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.360
Mr. Zhao, washing your car again?

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.360
What a hard worker you are, Xiaoman.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.710
Keep up the good work!

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.090
Ma'am, open up, please!

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.650
Good for you, Xiaoman.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.360
You quickly deliver multiple tanks
at a time.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.310
I'm really getting my money's worth.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:22.890
I'm working this hard only because
you're connected to the factory.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:23.640
Xiaoman!

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.270
Work hard for me.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.710
I can't guarantee anything,

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.840
but I assure you that you will
fare well in these few years.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.920
No doubt.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.950
I'm hardly an adequate student.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.290
Labor work is all I can do.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.640
Neither was I an adequate student.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.250
But look, I'm driving a Santana now.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.140
Impressive, Mr. Zhao.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.220
I'll put them here.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:43.900
Okay.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.300
Are those refilled?

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.900
-Yes.
-I'll take those then.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.000
You're truly strong.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.320
There you are.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.170
What are you doing here?

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:59.140
What are you looking at?

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.280
Does it matter to you where I am?

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.070
Have you...

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.110
inhaled too much gas in there?

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.550
Is that why you're so grumpy?

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.670
Cut that crap.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.800
Listen,

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.710
mind your tongue here.
No taboo words allowed.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:10.960
Fine. I'm done talking to you.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.820
You do your job.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.280
I'm leaving.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.400
Xiaoman.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.150
I'll settle the bill with you in a bit.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.590
Okay!

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.000
This is your wage for the week.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.920
Got it. Bye!

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.880
Bye bye!

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:28.280
Xiaoman!

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.760
I'm here.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:30.780
Come in!

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.550
Why did you make a mess

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.610
of these dumbbells?

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.210
You should've put them away.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.160
Aren't I tidying up my place now?

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.280
This is it.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:39.510
Nice and clean.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.740
You call this "clean"?

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.360
Well...

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.840
Why leave out this spot?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.920
Where are we supposed to eat?

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.710
Right here.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.110
Put these items away.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.440
Toss them aside.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.450
All done.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.190
Look what delicacies I brought here.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.280
What's in it?

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.560
What's this? Blueberry yam?

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.550
Yes.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.320
What do you think?

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.960
Not bad. It's all good stuff.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.290
But aren't these... too sweet?

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.230
Cloying, right?

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:16.610
Xiaodan has just returned from Shanghai.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:17.480
She has Shanghai origins.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.070
I bet she has a sweet tooth.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.230
Could a short stay
turn her into a Shanghai girl already?

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.880
I looked it up.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.510
Shanghai people enjoy sweet food.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.360
These dishes are spot on.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.640
I'll go get some plates.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.170
Get what?

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.280
Plates!

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.960
You can't leave the food
in the plastic boxes, right?

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.710
Right.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.510
Arrange the plates.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.240
But what about the chopsticks?

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.480
Xiaoman!

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.210
Coming right up!

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.320
Here I am.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.460
Come on in.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.080
Let me carry these.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.000
Get in the house.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.600
Go inside.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.630
Xia Lei.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.530
You're back.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:48.710
Sit on the brick bed.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:49.670
The food's ready.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:50.800
What a spread.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.400
You bet it is.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.060
Take a look.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.250
We're having a real feast today.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.980
Yeah. It's a reception for you.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.450
Let me see.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.230
What do you think?

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.480
Sautéed pork pieces?

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.920
Blueberry yam.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.820
Candied sweet potato.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.850
Do you like them?

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.550
Is this sweet and sour fried pork?

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.380
Yes.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.690
Wouldn't you say it's amazing?

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.110
It sure is.
Three out of these four dishes...

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.840
are sweet.
Are you trying to put me in a sugar coma?

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.670
Didn't you just come back from Shanghai?

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.510
So we got you some sweet food,

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.360
thinking that you'd love it.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.630
I-I'm just back from Shanghai.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.880
All I want now is pickled vegetables
and such.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.000
I'm fed up with sweet food.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.360
I ate enough of that in Shanghai.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.230
It's fine. He is just

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.150
pretending to have class.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.360
He said you'd love sweet food
as a Shanghai girl,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.280
and this would help with your transition.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.710
What's the point of this?

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.630
Now that I'm home,
I certainly want to taste local cooking.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.920
Okay. What would you like to eat?

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.510
Pickled cabbage.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.280
Pickled cabbage, and such, huh?

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.010
That's easy.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.250
Pickled cabbage...

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.550
I'm sure
one of the neighbors is cooking that.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:45.880
I'll go door to door, sniff,

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.110
and ask for some from whoever has it.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:47.760
-Okay.
-You wait here.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.550
Then I... I'll go with you!

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:51.010
You go get some cucumbers.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.480
One more case?

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:58.250
Let me help.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.230
No, I'm all good.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.840
There are more downstairs.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.920
You go get them.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.800
Come on, let me carry it.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.490
Gosh.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.130
My goodness.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:15.150
Why did you buy these many?

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.380
Another case?

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.190
When our son goes to college,

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.360
the expenses will be huge.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.960
That means we should save more money

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.250
instead of wasting it on this stuff.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.180
What do you know?

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.550
To foot the bills,
we need to stock more royal jelly.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.280
We can earn rebates from sales.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.810
Get me two boxes.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.070
Two boxes.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.630
I'll give these to Li Lei.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.440
Where are you going?

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.170
I'm sending these to Auntie Li.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.190
Dad, where should I put these?

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.250
Stack them up here.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:55.910
So many cases.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.510
Will these sell?

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.640
I'm also concerned.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.940
Leave it to your mom.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:01.740
I'll go cook.
