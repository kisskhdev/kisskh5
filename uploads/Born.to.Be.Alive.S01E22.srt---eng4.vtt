[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.060
[Episode 22]

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.900
No matter what others think of you

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.360
or what the outcome may be,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.640
speak up about

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.420
your expectations

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.750
when you want them most.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.690
What are you doing?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.870
What are you doing?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.590
You bumped into me,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.650
and now you're asking what I'm doing?

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.669
We really have no rapport.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.860
Yunfei, you're here?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.260
Hurry.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.020
Come on in.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.250
No, thanks.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.460
I was walking your sister home.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.300
Now that she's home, I'm leaving.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.880
Stay a bit.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.650
No, really.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.590
I have a deadline.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.920
I won't see you out then.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.400
Bye.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.980
You were pretty forward, huh?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.579
Come on.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.360
How is your shop coming along?

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.750
We're painting the walls.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.710
Nima and Yan are helping me.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.440
Almost done.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.560
It's going pretty smoothly?

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:45.770
In what sense?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.970
What do you think?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.230
Yan...

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.400
agreed

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.380
to give it a try with me.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.630
Who asked about that?

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.660
I was asking about the renovation.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.340
I really should have

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.210
taken a picture

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.760
of you just now.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.860
Even with a lame leg,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.650
you didn't...

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.510
Hold me steady.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.070
You talk too much.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.250
You took the initiative

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.960
to kiss him.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.130
Say that again and I'll slap you.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.900
And you actually stood on your tiptoes

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.580
to kiss him.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.260
Stop it!

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.830
Mom.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.230
What are you writing?

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.329
A self-criticism.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.500
You're done?

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.380
Is it serious enough?

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.970
Very.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.360
Should I read it to you?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.860
Okay.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.070
I'll sign it for you.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.620
Mom.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.970
Let me give you a massage.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.840
No, don't.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.579
I won't survive

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.460
your massage.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.650
I've learned it.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.400
It's good for your legs.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.840
I used to massage your dad's legs

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.220
just like this.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.050
I don't deserve such treatment.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.360
Mom.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.120
You're being so gentle all of a sudden.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.210
It's scary.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.910
You're not afraid of the Uninhabited Zone,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.240
but you're afraid of me?

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.870
Here.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.690
I'll be gentle.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.450
Listen.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.810
Since you started mountain patrolling,

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.270
how many times
have you gone to the hospital?

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.940
Look at your face.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.190
It's almost rougher than my hands.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.520
Do you have to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.490
go this far in your work?

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.710
Didn't you always say

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.250
women should have

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.310
their own careers?

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.920
You were alone before,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.470
but now you have Shao.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.120
If you have a family in the future,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.750
are you going to keep

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.360
running off like this?

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.240
Why are you talking about

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.920
having a family?

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.370
We haven't gotten

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.870
to that stage yet.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.570
But you'll get there

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.700
sooner or later.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.220
And you need to consider

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.610
where you're going to start this family.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.300
Shao isn't forcing you

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.950
to make a decision right now.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.860
He's accommodating you,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.060
But that doesn't mean

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.870
he can wait forever.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.760
Mom.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.920
Do you think

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.390
I should go to the provincial capital?

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.820
Whether a marriage is happy

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.680
doesn't depend on where you live.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.510
There are divorces in provincial capitals,

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.190
and lifelong loving couples

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.880
in the counties.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.120
The key is

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.070
whether you two will

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.770
never get tired of each other.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.030
If you don't want
to go to the provincial capital,

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.200
maybe

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920
Shao is willing to accommodate you.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.490
You mean...

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.100
asking him to move here?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.260
Would he be willing to do that?

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.860
Shao Yunfei

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.370
is ambitious

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.590
and has his own ideas.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.930
Even if he stays here

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.920
because of me,

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.920
can our county satisfy him?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.760
That's not the point.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.450
The point is

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.460
you must believe in yourself.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.680
Believe in what?

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.020
Believe that you are worthy
of being loved.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.260
Believe in your choices.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.220
Believe that

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.960
even if you miss this one,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.370
it doesn't matter.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.540
Don't compromise yourself.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.250
Mom, do you believe in me?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.600
If I didn't believe in you,

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.690
I wouldn't have agreed
to let you go into the mountains.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.450
Captain.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.760
What's the situation?

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.400
We found this on the truck.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.280
It's much shorter than sheep wool—

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.280
definitely Tibetan antelope wool.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.520
Poaching,

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.930
illegal gold mining,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.130
unlawful detention—

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.980
I wonder what else

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.310
these people have done.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.310
The trucks all have reinforced

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.440
steel suspensions.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.460
They load cargo every time
without overloading.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.830
It must be preparation

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.920
for unpaved roads.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.870
Most suspiciously,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.470
every week

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.100
2 trucks leave at midnight

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.070
carrying gasoline, timber,

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.880
and flour.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.320
Transporting timber
to the Uninhabited Zone?

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.720
Very suspicious indeed.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.740
He.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.250
What about your end?

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.100
We once tailed

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.480
a logistics company truck

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.150
all the way into the Uninhabited Zone,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.750
but we didn't bring supplies

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.220
and didn't know how long

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.020
or how far we'd have to go,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.330
so we stopped following.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.480
How much grain and fuel do

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.630
they transport each time?

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.560
We couldn't get into their office,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.659
so we couldn't find

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:52.060
the detailed manifests.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.720
These are figures estimated

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.830
by visual inspection.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.500
Take a look.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.120
That much?

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.130
At two jin of rations per person

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:02.810
per day,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.870
there have to be
at least 100 people inside.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.330
However,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.770
they cover their tracks well.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.010
They never transport weapons

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.570
or ammunition on this route,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.120
so

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.660
we can't tell

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.250
how many guns they actually have.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.210
Should we report this

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.300
to the police

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.450
and ask for backup?

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.540
The police

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.830
don't have experience operating

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.230
in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.580
If they go in rashly

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.070
and alert those people,

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.420
they'll scatter and run away like pikas.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.740
Why don't we just

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.880
set up a roadblock on the highway,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.850
stop their trucks,

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.080
and ask them?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.429
On what grounds?

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:33.460
Grain and fuel

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.169
aren't contraband.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.210
Just beat them up.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.010
I bet we can make them talk.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.880
Don't bring Bai with us.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:42.700
Forget I said it.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.340
Once the support funding and equipment

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.460
are in place,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.880
we'll follow them in ourselves first,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.510
figure out

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.420
the gold mining sites and headcount,

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.650
and then report
to the county and the police.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.200
He,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.460
get the supplies
for going into the mountains

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.890
ready.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.940
For how many days?

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.450
Prepare for the maximum.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.470
Bring all the guns and ammunition.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.530
If things turn violent,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.940
we can't be at a disadvantage.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.630
Why did you come back with two vehicles?

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.740
The county didn't allocate the funds.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.770
County Mayor Lin said

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.200
he'd give us an extra vehicle instead.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.030
What about the guns and ammo?

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.750
In the back.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.020
That's it?

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.590
It's way too little.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.460
Weren't we promised support?

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.060
What kind of support is this?

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:40.970
They gave us a car.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.480
Chief Shi said

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.080
the report has been submitted.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.580
The semi-automatic rifles

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.450
and 7.62mm ammunition

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.170
won't arrive
until next month at the earliest.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.310
This is the maximum support

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.780
he can offer for now.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.550
Captain.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.250
How many months' salaries

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.510
are we behind on?

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.440
Four months.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.210
Make it up.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.150
There's no other way.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.330
We can only use the dead sheep

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.300
to save the living ones.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.290
Mom,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.200
the girl I met last time

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.130
was really nice,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.910
but it seems

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.470
she's not interested in me.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.680
Yes.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.590
The results are out.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.590
I got first place.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.290
What's so nice about her?

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.350
I still didn't make the cutoff score.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.490
There's nothing I can do.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.820
I'll just take it again.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.120
Mom, stop crying.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.550
I can barely hear

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.680
what you're saying.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.190
You cry every time we talk.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.640
I know I'm

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.160
your only son.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.500
Worst case,

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.320
you can always have another one.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.530
Come here.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.670
Let me measure you

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.900
for a new Tibetan robe.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.760
I don't need it.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:10.870
I have clothes to wear.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.740
You do?

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.000
It's been years

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.900
since I made you a new Tibetan robe.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.470
We have to make one this year.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.800
That old one is worn out.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.270
I hardly

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.580
wear that one anyway.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.650
Why spend the money on it?

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.480
We still haven't paid back the money

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.710
we owe Basang's family.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.160
Don't worry about that.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.590
I'll make sure it's paid off this year.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.170
Fine.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.390
You handle the household finances now,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.990
so we'll go with what you say.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:36.950
No need to measure.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.820
Just take the old one

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.100
and use it for size.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.070
Do you know how much weight

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.930
you've lost in the last two years?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.640
My wife

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.460
is not only more capable than me,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.790
but also more generous.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.340
I'm generous?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.260
One year,

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.370
when you came back
from a meeting in Tianduo,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.050
you bought me

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.710
a pair of turquoise earrings,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.930
saying the thing you fear least

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.060
was spending money.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.250
Weren't we

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.650
dating back then?

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.910
I told Tashi

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.010
that his dad is very generous,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.410
but he didn't believe me.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:14.820
He said,

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.580
"If Dad is really that generous,

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.670
I want him to take us

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.580
on a trip."

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.520
Where does he want to go?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.240
Gansu.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.250
I thought

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.730
he wanted to go to Beijing.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.750
He said
when he gets into college in Beijing,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.950
he'll have plenty of time to explore it.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.830
But right now,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.980
he wants to go to Gansu the most.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.420
He wants to visit Yang's hometown.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.490
A couple of days ago,

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.220
I took Mom to

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.150
see Director Zhang

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.200
for a checkup.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.530
And I also bought you some

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.590
stomach medicine.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840
When you go into the mountains this time,

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.270
don't forget to take it with you.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.530
What's wrong with Mom?

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.590
Same as always.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.030
Her rheumatism

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.530
has been acting up lately.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.720
I'll go see her when I'm free.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.270
I don't have time today.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.320
I have to get back to the team.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:02.750
Okay.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.380
I've already chopped up the lamb.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.470
Cook it tomorrow.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.240
Okay.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.270
And earlier this afternoon,

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.760
I patched up the hole in the tent

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.860
that the cow poked.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.860
Next time you milk the cow,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.460
be careful

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.700
and tie it up tightly.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.550
I'm off.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.770
Ride slowly.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:22.690
You are

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.010
not a child anymore.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.860
What are you laughing at?

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.750
Last time you said

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.940
I was a child.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.460
Thank you.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.260
When I come back this time,

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.090
let's go travel

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.850
to Gansu.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.420
Let's relax a bit.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.200
I almost forgot.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.910
You're in charge of the money now.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.320
I need your approval.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.580
Come back soon.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.240
Bye!

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:08.880
Ride slowly!

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.940
Be careful on the road!

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.440
Okay!

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:10.980
Hyah!

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:12.380
Hyah!

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:29.830
♪ We gather here today ♪

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:38.980
♪ I hope we will never be apart ♪

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.090

♪ I wish you eternal good health ♪

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.460
Here comes the meat.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.590
The mutton is ready.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.210
Here comes the meat!

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.910
Here comes the mutton!

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:56.940
Time to eat!

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:01.750
Come on!

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.110
Let's raise our cups!

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.550
Thanks to Captain

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.620
for the mutton,

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.200
and thanks to

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.730
Reporter Shao for the wine.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.810
Tashi Delek!

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.690
Tashi Delek!

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.170
Tashi Delek!

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.360
Tashi Delek!

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.910
Come on.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.200
Let's divide the meat.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.790
Let's divide the meat.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.980
Shao.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.910
This wine is pretty good.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.430
This wine is so strong.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.410
Thank you.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.300
Captain is thanking you.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.330
He's saying thanks.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.410
Thanks.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.850
Meat is here.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.950
You're welcome.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.940
Knife, knife.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.460
Do you know how to cut meat?

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.350
Why are you so clumsy?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.060
Here, let me teach you.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.710
No, no, no.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:16:59.820
I'm a local.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.550
How could I not know how to cut meat?

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.680
Why is this knife...

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.240
not working well?

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.900
A bad workman always blames his tools.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.300
Give it to me.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:06.829
You do it.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.190
Give it to me.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.020
Watch this.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.400
I saw that.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.050
So?

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.510
I told you it doesn't work well.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.280
It really doesn't.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:20.010
Here.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.420
Use mine.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.680
See?

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.030
It was the knife's fault.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.850
This knife works well.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:31.240
Yes.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.060
Give it to me.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.570
Why do you want everything?

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.550
That's Captain's knife.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.080
It's none of your business.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:40.990
This knife of mine killed a bear.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.340
Really?

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.290
Since I was a teenager,

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.310
I've been hunting in the mountains.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.210
I killed many wild animals—

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.920
Tibetan foxes, blue sheep, argali,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.320
and white-lipped deer.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:07.910
Once,

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.270
I even killed 3 bears.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.650
One of them

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.450
was stabbed to death with this knife.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.070
Back then,

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.600
hunting wasn't forbidden.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.840
I even thought I was a hero.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.080
What I'm doing now

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.770
is my way of atoning for my sins.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.430
Do you still want this knife?

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:49.770
I don’t dare want it anymore.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.200
Take it back.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.730
I want it.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.580
I want it.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.810
Why do you want everything?

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.700
That's Captain's knife.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.920
It's so meaningful.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.710
A knife that killed a bear.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:58.810
Give it back to Captain.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:18:59.310
No, no.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.000
Wait. Let me...

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.570
Let me cut the meat first.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.290
Let me finish eating the meat first.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.460
Give it back to Captain later.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.060
We'll see.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.500
Here.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.160
No, no.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.660
Here.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.620
Like this.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:11.570
How is it?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.360
How is what?

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.930
The letter was sent,

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:15.960
and then?

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.510
I didn't send it.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.910
Didn't you say you sent it?

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.770
Yes, I wanted to send it.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.080
But I didn't.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.010
Why?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.400
Because I thought it through.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.240
Even if I had sent it,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.240
I wouldn't have known

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.030
how we would have gotten along

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.030
afterward.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.730
Every time I go into the mountains,
I stay there for so long.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.190
Why should she wait for me?

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.930
I just can't give her

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.380
a stable life.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.480
I can't even give her

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.260
a promise.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:54.350
Isn't...

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.680
Isn't this your theory?

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.430
Yes.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.300
I did say things like that.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.560
But Shao Yunfei

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.640
criticized me.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.200
Back then,

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.730
I had never even been in a relationship.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.460
Why did you have to listen to me?

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:13.610
I just felt

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.660
what you said made sense.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.900
So I took it to heart.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Yeah, it makes sense.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.420
Exactly.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.280
No, it doesn't.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.270
I did say your situation isn't ideal

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.970
and that there were lots of issues.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.600
But

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.960
what relationship

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.290
doesn't face problems?

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.290
Some are about location,

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.110
and some about money.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.160
Finding a perfect match

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.020
is as rare as hitting the jackpot.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.300
If you stop at every hurdle,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.400
you'll really

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.700
stay single forever.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.390
Shao Yunfei, what do you think?

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.920
Are these really problems?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.480
I guess so.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.070
Wrong answer.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:51.310
Try again.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:52.710
No.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.680
Not problems.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.250
They're definitely not problems.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.270
See?

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:56.590
See?

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.050
Not a problem, right?

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:57.680
See?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.180
Tibetans' love

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.520
is simpler

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.510
than you think.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.010
We don't care about diplomas

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.600
or bride prices.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.150
As long as two people
truly love each other,

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.950
everyone will bless them.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:17.550
Sangba,

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.940
you've changed.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.250
He.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.190
You need to show the courage

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.620
your Tibetan dad had

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.880
when he was pursuing your Han mom

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.490
back then.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:30.940
Be brave.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:32.890
Okay.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.490
Duo,

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.610
don't dodge your responsibility.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.500
Now that you're not
running the development company anymore,

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.400
once the nature reserve

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.330
is established,

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.460
you should at least

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.750
help them secure

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.280
a few permanent positions.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.250
Sure.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.820
I'll fight for it with the county.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.940
Once the reserve is set up,

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.430
you'll be

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.760
the first batch of rangers.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.560
That's right.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.530
There will be bread,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.370
and there will be permanent positions.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.300
Come on! Cheers!

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.140
Here!

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:05.470

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.650
Sangba has changed.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.560
Actually, I've changed too.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:16.740

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.270
Wangmu!

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:00.540

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.720

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.480

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.080
Wait for me to come back!

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.800
♪ The wind blows ♪

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.260

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:54.740
That's them.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:59.390
Get in the car.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.990
They just passed by.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.340
We're too close.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.350
Let's wait a bit before chasing.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.810
Okay.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.280
Let's rest here for five minutes.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:15.870
Okay!

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.690
Okay.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.670
If we're following just by tire tracks

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.590
from this far back,

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.720
what if we lose them?

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.410
There's no choice.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.570
This is the only way.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:26.660
Look.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.550
You can see them for miles.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.210
What's wrong?

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.410
Is your back hurting?

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.610
It's too comfortable.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.030
I'm not used to it.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.200
When you get back,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.700
thank your mother for me.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:43.960
When we get back,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.680
I'll find a tailor

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.750
and have a few more made

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.030
so everyone can have one.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.630
That'll cost a lot, won't it?

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.730
You only care about money.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.020
Don't make one for me.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.880
I don't want it.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.230
You're not paying for it.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.310
What's going on?

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:16.920
Lack of oxygen.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.440
Engine stalled.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.140
It can't get the power up.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.520
Come on.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.320
Give me a hand.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:19.920
Okay!

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.820
Come on!

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.700
One, two, three!

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.470
One, two, three!

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:29.060
Come on!

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.120
One, two, three!

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:31.960
Come on!

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.020
How is it?

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.430
Looks like a fuel line problem.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.840
Then that's serious.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:00.880
Did you bring spare parts?

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.380
Yes.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.330
Captain,

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.970
you go on ahead with them later.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.570
I'll fix the car and catch up.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.670
Leave it there.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.790
You guys go first.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.490
We can't split up.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:15.480
It's too dangerous.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.370
We can't wait.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.040
We're already

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.200
an hour behind them.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.570
If it starts raining

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.370
and the tire tracks disappear,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.300
it'll be even harder to chase them.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:24.880
Still no.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:26.840
You help her fix the car.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.420
You three,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.420
start a fire and make some noodles.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:28.900
Okay.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.850
Let's rest here.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:30.290
Okay.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.720
Should I...

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.720
Just go help them.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.240
Okay.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.220
Go.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:41.570
Okay.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:09.790
Move over a bit.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:16.490
Captain, take a break.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.440
Have some noodles.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:17.870
Okay.

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:20.100
It's hot.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.870
Take a break.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:26.840
Have some noodles.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.470
I'm not hungry.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.600
Give it to Han first.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.290
Here.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.030
Okay.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:40.670
Captain,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.730
you try it.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:54.910
It's fixed!

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.600
Let's go!

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:56.850
Bravo!

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.090
Why are you smiling so goofily?

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.050
Why is my girlfriend

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.330
so cool?

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.940
Get moving.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.050
Oh no.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.240
What's that bright thing

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.170
in the distance?

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.330
Something's wrong.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.090
How...

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.970
How can there be a river here?

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.830
It snowed a few days ago.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.920
The sun's been strong.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.430
The meltwater from the mountains
rushed down

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.690
and carved out a river.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.340
I told you to go on ahead.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.850
Don't you know

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.840
what Bolamula is like

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.900
in summer?

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.260
They had just driven through

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:14.930
not long ago

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.240
when the water came down.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.900
Could it be the Mountain God
is protecting them?

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.770
Can you just shut up?

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.270
It's fine.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:22.980
It's fine.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.510
We've chased them this far.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.370
There has to be another way

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.830
to figure out their route.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.100
I'll drive across.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.960
I've done it before!

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.080
No!

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:33.270
It's different this time!

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.900
If you get stuck,

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.110
we won't have time to pull you out.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.720
Stop!

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.160
We'll detour and try to catch up.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.270
Okay.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:41.160
Let's go.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.170
Tomorrow we'll have to
cross a mountain pass.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.180
The altitude will be higher

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.440
and the wind stronger.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.610
The tire tracks

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.330
they leave

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:06.980
may disappear

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.050
in just a few hours.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.650
That's not the only problem.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.860
At higher altitude,
fuel consumption shoots up.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.590
Engine power will be affected,

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.670
and we won't have enough torque.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.360
I'm afraid

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.110
the gap between us

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.050
will only grow.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.449
If there's no road,

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.730
then we don't go.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.040
We turn back and do regular patrols.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.420
Next time they go into the mountains,

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.630
we'll follow them in a different way.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.710
If there were a better way,

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.960
we would've thought of it already.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.889
We wouldn't have waited until now.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.179
Next time, we'll only face

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.300
the same difficulties as this time.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.150
If you ask me,

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.050
we've been in here for almost 2 days.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.370
We can't be far

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.760
from their destination.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.420
Why don't we

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.100
try to estimate their direction

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.100
and keep chasing?

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.570
Give me the map.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:01.760
This is the place

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.160
where Zhang Yang was caught
the first time.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.940
This is where Zhang Yang and Tashi

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.200
were caught together.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:10.840
And here

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.280
is where we rescued them

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.010
by the river.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.900
The three locations are far apart,

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.170
each near a large river.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.410
If we follow the rivers,

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.110
they lead to
completely different directions.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.930
Let's split into teams and search.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.300
Not a good idea.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:32.470
Even if we find them,

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.600
we won't be able to contact each other.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.570
It's too risky.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.330
This is the map Dolma used

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.610
with her classmates when they

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.010
went into the mountains.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.850
They marked all the gold belts

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:47.180
they found

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.050
and any that

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.590
might exist.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.010
There are some differences

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.880
from the gold spots along the river

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.210
where fossickers work.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.730
We can see if there are

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:56.860
any possibilities.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.580
Where are we right now?

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.990
Around...

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:02.900
here.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:03.800
The two gold belts

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.690
closest to us

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.230
are Duolong Mountain

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.510
and...

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.130
Mount Qimar.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:14.830
One is to the north,

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.330
and the other is to the south.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.710
Two completely different directions.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.770
If we choose wrong,

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.530
we'll definitely lose them.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.070
Bai Ju,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:41.880
what's your choice?

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.630
When we saved Zhang Yang and Tashi,

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.320
we confiscated their trucks.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.270
How much gas did we find in it?

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.390
Sixty liters.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.030
Sixty liters...

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:05.690
plus what was left in the tank.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:07.880
With one large

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.010
and one small truck,

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.020
their range

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:12.850
wouldn't exceed 90 kilometers.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.420
One to one million.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.800
90 kilometers

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:19.830
is 9 centimeters.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.360
He Qingyuan,

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.390
give me a piece of string.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.120
Will this do?

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.090
Yes.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.990
[Mount Qimar]

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.240
Let's go to Mount Qimar.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.170
Don't rush.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.010
Drive slowly.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.630
Okay.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:03.800
Drive slowly.

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.290
There's a reflection!

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.810
One o'clock!

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.150
Drive over there.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.650
Okay.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.590
It's wood.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:29.790
It must be them.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:32.640
It's the reflection from a tin can.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.320
Bastards!

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.050
Captain!

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.950
There are tire tracks here!

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.630
Got it?

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:43.290
Got it.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.050
They opened a door?

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.510
Is there something

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.040
between the wooden stakes?

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.050
Barbed wire.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.830
It's almost invisible.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.900
You wouldn't notice it

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.100
unless you get close.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.210
And this area isn't part

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.210
of the Tibetan antelope's habitat.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.440
We've never patrolled here before.

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.920
We'll need to expand our patrol zones

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.210
in the future.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.070
Look over there.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.510
It looks like

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.710
a dried-up riverbed.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.500
It's very clear on the map.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.580
Look.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.570
Where does the Manri River

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.340
lead?

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.750
Manri River

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.520
flows from west to east

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.650
and runs all the way

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.070
through

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.420
Quduo and Gela.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:03.440
The two townships

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.100
that lost their water source?

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.040
Yes.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.990
We found the reason.
