00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.380
I ran out of ink.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.020
Are you alright?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.100
I'm fine.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.139
(This won't do.)

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.460
(We must talk it through.)

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.220
Xiao Man.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.659
Xiao Man.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.900
I want some water.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.260
Xiao Man.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.660
I want some water.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.660
Xiao Man...

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.900
You...

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.540
I...

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.660
(Why is her face so pale?)

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.140
(No.)

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.620
(I must check on her.)

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.220
Xiao Man.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.860
Xiao Man.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.099
You're burning up.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.300
You have a fever.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.579
Does Your Majesty want water again?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.459
No.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.020
I didn't know you were hurt this badly.
Let me see.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.780
Blood...

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.380
You're coughing up blood.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.779
Someone!

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.900
Someone, help!

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.940
Xiao Man!

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.460
Someone, help!

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.140
Your Majesty,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.420
this sudden illness

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.900
will trouble him for a few days.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.260
However,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.619
he'll recover soon

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.420
so long as he takes
his medicine on time.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.420
There's no need to worry.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.940
Understood.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.380
Then...

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.140
I will take my leave.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.940
Thank you.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.660
We should summon the Imperial Physician.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.259
Never mind.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.140
He's already examined me.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.460
Don't blame yourself.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.140
It wasn't because of you.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.060
After one night's rest,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.020
I'll be fine.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.980
It's nothing.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.620
Take your medicine.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.460
Xiao Man...

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.740
I didn't mean it.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.205
I didn't know you'd be standing there.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.740
It had nothing to do with you.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.180
I'd like to rest now.

00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:32.845
Xiao Man...

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.260
I thought after you returned,
we'd be just like we were as children.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.940
Why is this happening?

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.820
