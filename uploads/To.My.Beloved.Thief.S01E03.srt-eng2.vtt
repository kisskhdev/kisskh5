WEBVTT

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:51.573
There you are.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.408
Lady Flower.

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:56.661
He's not here for Gil-dong.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.873
But how? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:02.876
The notice board.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:10.258
Should you be this man, or know of him,
please come forward to Physician Hong.

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:15.638
How he came here doesn't matter now.

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:17.682
Let's stay composed.

00:01:18.308 --> 00:01:20.018
That man is an aide.

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:21.686
I'm only making myself look suspicious.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:23.897
You look quite embarrassed from the back.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.315
Or am I just imagining it?

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:31.237
Oh, dear!

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:33.615
It is you!

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.659
That's why your voice sounded familiar.

00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:38.202
For someone who didn't recognize me,

00:01:38.286 --> 00:01:40.455
you turned around pretty fast.

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:41.831
What?

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:42.874
No way. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.251
I wouldn't have recognized you
and then pretended not to.

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:47.837
It's quite dark tonight, so…

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.797
It's bright.

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:51.132
The moon is shining brightly.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.637
Exactly.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.056
A strange man barged in
under the bright moonlight,

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.266
so I naturally took a step back.

00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:04.187
This is a time when a man and a woman
should keep their distance.

00:02:04.437 --> 00:02:05.396
I see.

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:08.024
So now you want to keep your distance.

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:11.402
What about the other night?

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:20.495
About the other night…

00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:26.042
-Well--
-Say little.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:27.669
Yet convince me.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.964
Unexpected feelings?

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.258
I'm fine with that too.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.725
As you can see,

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:45.228
I lied about my class,

00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:47.814
and there's no excuse.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.066
So I have

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:53.444
no explanation that could convince you

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:56.614
to excuse my rudeness toward a nobleman.

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.244
But most of all,

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:03.287
about leading you on--

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.580
Lead me on?

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:07.208
I know that

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:10.336
just an apology

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.380
cannot excuse that behavior.

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:16.175
A mistress and a slave, my foot.

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:19.846
Does this mean you ran away that night
because you knew my class?

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:21.305
Not at all.

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.976
I was wearing silk clothes too
when we first met at the market.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.436
-Why?
-What?

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.896
Why? What are you getting at?

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:32.734
Well…

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:40.199
It's like a complicated

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:41.743
and somewhat impulsive--

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:42.910
Mistake?

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.039
Yes, that's the right word.

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:48.750
Don't you think that's exactly
what it shouldn't have been?

00:03:50.877 --> 00:03:52.003
I apologize.

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:55.298
Whatever the punishment may be,

00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:56.924
I will accept it without complaint.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.343
Too bad.

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:01.763
Punishment was never my concern.

00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:07.018
So you want me to take the initiative
and go to the constabulary.

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:08.227
Yes. Are you still here?

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:10.480
I'm on my way.

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:14.859
Though it was a misunderstanding,

00:04:14.942 --> 00:04:17.362
you saved the life
of the dullard slave boy.

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:19.322
Let this repay what you did that day.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.202
To be fair, that was my carelessness too.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:28.414
What happened to your arm?
Did you get hurt?

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.749
It's not a big deal.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.042
Let me take a look.

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.670
You said you would only look.

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:38.257
Just looking won't do.

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:51.687
Stopping the bleeding is enough.

00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:53.564
That's what I came here for after all.

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:59.529
Isn't it because you saw the notice?

00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:00.738
What notice?

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:01.781
Nothing.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.370
Does that mean

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:09.455
this is a coincidence too?

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:10.540
Well,

00:05:10.623 --> 00:05:13.334
a coincidence means
an unexpected encounter,

00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:15.795
but I had too many expectations.

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.965
And my plea was heard.

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:38.234
What do you mean?

00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:41.946
If you were in my place,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.323
wouldn't you have been desperate
to catch you too,

00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:45.825
after you ran away like that?

00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:47.368
I see.

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:54.125
It's a stab wound. How did you get it?

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:56.043
I was grazed by an arrow.

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:01.924
An arrow, at this late hour?
What happened?

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.261
I was helping someone escape.

00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:09.015
Helping someone escape?

00:06:09.098 --> 00:06:12.143
Things went awry,
and I ended up putting someone on the run.

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:15.730
In any case,
it is still quiet out tonight.

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:17.607
It probably means
that person escaped safely.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.776
Just stay within

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.986
what I can handle.

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:24.822
Was I mistaken?

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:25.948
Stop!

00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:29.285
Could he have said that
to the officers, not Gil-dong?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.455
If that's the case, he got this wound

00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:35.041
because of me.

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:37.335
What's the matter?

00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:39.253
What? What do you mean?

00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:40.922
You keep staring at it.

00:06:42.173 --> 00:06:44.091
Because I couldn't see the wound well.

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:45.343
Please move this way.

00:06:48.888 --> 00:06:50.640
In any case,

00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:52.225
I don't know the whole story,

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:54.852
but the person you helped

00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:57.021
must surely be grateful.

00:06:57.772 --> 00:06:58.898
I don't think so.

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:03.069
He must be feeling bitter, thinking,
"This wretch fooled me."

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:06.697
I'm sure it wouldn't last long.

00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:07.782
No.

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:09.909
I can hear him faintly,

00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:12.578
cursing at me.

00:07:12.662 --> 00:07:14.830
No way! I would never…

00:07:15.414 --> 00:07:16.707
think he would do that.

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.128
I mean, I wouldn't if I were him.

00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:24.840
There's no need to comfort me.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.468
He was hit by an arrow?

00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:28.469
Did you see it?

00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:31.764
No, one of the soldiers slipped
and loosed his bow.

00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:33.140
This is a grave matter.

00:07:33.224 --> 00:07:35.476
-Find the Grand Prince at once!
-Yes, sir!

00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:41.649
The wound isn't that deep,
but it might leave a scar.

00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:44.860
When it becomes light,
make sure to go to a private physician.

00:07:45.278 --> 00:07:48.197
Here, at the Hyeminseo,
we don't have enough herbs

00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:50.533
to dress the wound properly.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.327
How much are you lacking?

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:56.622
We never have enough herbs

00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:59.250
for the flood of patients we see each day.

00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:02.878
Is that so?

00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:13.472
You look like you're treating
a gravely ill patient.

00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:18.185
Treating your wound with care
is the least I can do.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:19.729
Well,

00:08:19.812 --> 00:08:22.690
I'm taking it just as seriously.

00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:24.609
It may be best that you do not.

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:27.695
For a second,
I wished my injury was worse.

00:08:31.198 --> 00:08:32.241
Worse?

00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:34.785
You cannot make that kind of joke
in the Hyeminseo.

00:08:35.786 --> 00:08:37.747
I mean it. I always have.

00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:39.915
Even that night,

00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:42.460
when I was waiting for someone.
It was not like me.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.799
You seemed confused.

00:08:52.762 --> 00:08:54.680
And it intrigued me.

00:08:54.764 --> 00:08:55.931
I thought

00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:58.309
I could share in that confusion too.

00:09:03.648 --> 00:09:06.525
All that, not knowing
it was a mere mistake.

00:09:16.535 --> 00:09:18.245
About what happened that night,

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:19.330
let me apologize again--

00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:20.373
Don't bother.

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:21.749
You must be upset--

00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:23.042
I'm not upset.

00:09:23.584 --> 00:09:24.752
But you look really upset.

00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:25.920
I'm really not…

00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:33.094
Your apology is what upsets me.

00:09:35.763 --> 00:09:37.139
No need to come outside.

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:39.934
It seems like our coincidence ends today.

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:49.652
He looks upset even from the back.

00:09:51.737 --> 00:09:53.739
Was there something wrong with my apology?

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.868
Where could she possibly be?

00:10:00.663 --> 00:10:01.622
Your Highness.

00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:03.916
I still haven't found this woman.

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:05.126
I apologize.

00:10:07.336 --> 00:10:08.754
What do you mean by that?

00:10:08.838 --> 00:10:11.507
I'm offering my apologies.
I'll find her tomorrow at all costs.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.675
Exactly.

00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:15.344
You made a mistake,
so you had to apologize twice.

00:10:16.095 --> 00:10:17.972
Would you like me
to apologize three times?

00:10:18.055 --> 00:10:20.474
No. And no more apologies from now on.

00:10:22.017 --> 00:10:23.394
You are here, Your Highness!

00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:25.688
How is your injury?

00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:27.189
It's all right, as you can see.

00:10:27.273 --> 00:10:28.524
Have you injured yourself?

00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:30.735
-Who did this?
-Put it back.

00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:32.486
What happened to Gil-dong?

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.572
He ran away without even looking back.

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:36.574
How cold of him.

00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:42.163
I can't believe we met again.

00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:44.498
I may actually grow fond of him.

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.209
Eun-jo!

00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:48.210
Come quickly.

00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:52.173
What are you doing here?
It's cold outside.

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:53.132
Earlier today,

00:10:53.257 --> 00:10:55.468
I was questioned at the constabulary
about Gil-dong.

00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:57.136
What? Let me see. Are you all right?

00:10:57.219 --> 00:10:58.429
I'm all right.

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:00.014
That's not the problem.

00:11:01.682 --> 00:11:02.641
Come with me.

00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:07.062
Are you saying

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.524
the aide at the constabulary
sent all these?

00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:11.692
Yes.

00:11:12.693 --> 00:11:15.196
What did the aide look like?

00:11:15.821 --> 00:11:18.991
He has a face as fair as the first snow,

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:22.119
his eyes as clear as crystal.

00:11:22.203 --> 00:11:24.788
Truly a man of remarkable beauty.

00:11:26.707 --> 00:11:28.209
I see.

00:11:29.335 --> 00:11:31.128
Are we really talking
about the same person?

00:11:31.212 --> 00:11:32.963
What did you say?

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:34.924
Nothing.

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:37.259
He sounds like a nice person,

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:39.011
showing you such kindness.

00:11:40.846 --> 00:11:42.556
Oh, dear.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:48.354
I'm glad

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:51.357
that it was a misunderstanding.

00:11:56.529 --> 00:11:57.571
What?

00:11:58.113 --> 00:12:00.449
This is what His Majesty said.

00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:04.578
"The censors' remonstrances are becoming
more and more flattering."

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:07.081
"They're all lies."

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.666
Are you saying

00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:10.376
our remonstrances to His Majesty

00:12:10.459 --> 00:12:13.295
must first be approved by you
because of that?

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.924
That is utter madness!

00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:22.096
Flattery too

00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.557
requires wit.

00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:29.812
Here. Have a look.

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:32.940
Look at your greed.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.657
The tributes you extorted from the people.

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:43.909
Please give us more time!

00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:46.328
The land you seized from the people.

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:50.833
The slaves you beat to death.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.168
Every one of them

00:12:53.252 --> 00:12:55.713
represents your greed.

00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:57.881
I did hear

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.050
of your vile habit

00:13:00.134 --> 00:13:02.928
of gathering ammunition
against the officials.

00:13:03.554 --> 00:13:05.389
So this confirms it.

00:13:05.973 --> 00:13:10.185
Last time, I had no chance to show you
this because of Grand Prince Dowol.

00:13:10.603 --> 00:13:11.604
Are you blackmailing me?

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.861
Let us call it camaraderie.

00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:22.531
Because I want you
to remain in that position

00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:25.326
more than anyone else.

00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:28.996
What?

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:30.331
Did you really take

00:13:30.414 --> 00:13:33.125
all the wedding gifts
back to Chief Secretary Im's house?

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:34.418
With this back carrier?

00:13:35.127 --> 00:13:38.589
Why did you do that?
That's what they paid for Eun-jo!

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.758
Have you no shame?

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.259
Think of Eun-jo.

00:13:42.885 --> 00:13:46.096
She set out again at dawn today
to tend to ailing women.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.098
My lord, please stop.

00:13:48.182 --> 00:13:49.433
I wish

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:52.019
Eun-jo had been born
the eldest son of this household.

00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:54.480
A fool like me
should have been born a slave!

00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:56.482
Please stop, Young Master.

00:13:57.483 --> 00:13:59.401
The exam results were announced today.

00:13:59.485 --> 00:14:00.861
And I failed, of course.

00:14:00.944 --> 00:14:04.239
I know shame,
so I will not ask for comfort.

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:19.546
Did you get the red pass?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.883
Please, no congratulations.

00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:28.555
First place?

00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:32.393
You sly one.

00:14:32.685 --> 00:14:34.687
So you weren't just idling all this time.

00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:41.777
What's that?

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.905
Lord Hong Min-jik
sent back the wedding gifts.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.535
That old geezer Hong
just can't let go of his pride.

00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:51.870
What?

00:14:53.247 --> 00:14:54.790
You were abroad studying before,

00:14:54.873 --> 00:14:56.375
so you must not know Lord Hong.

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:59.336
He acts all righteous,
as if he's better than everyone else.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.880
Father looks out for him
because they're friends,

00:15:01.964 --> 00:15:03.257
but that man disgusts me.

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.634
I will make his daughter's life miserable

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.679
the moment she sets foot in this house.

00:15:09.388 --> 00:15:11.724
You don't need to be so harsh
with your concubine.

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:15.102
As if.

00:15:15.978 --> 00:15:18.564
She's being sold
as our grandfather's concubine, not mine.

00:15:19.023 --> 00:15:20.190
She will be a caretaker.

00:15:21.734 --> 00:15:22.568
What?

00:15:22.651 --> 00:15:27.364
Apparently, that girl begged
to keep this information from Lord Hong.

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:36.582
You stood in a nobleman's way.

00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:38.167
Forgive me, my lord!

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.461
Please forgive me, my lord!

00:15:40.544 --> 00:15:42.713
Please forgive me!

00:15:43.172 --> 00:15:46.467
Please forgive me, my lord!

00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:09.156
All of you, show your respects.

00:16:24.338 --> 00:16:25.464
What's all this?

00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:28.550
The royal court has sent us
medicinal herbs.

00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:30.761
Who in the royal court sent them?

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.888
Grand Prince Dowol.

00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:36.183
That should cover a year's worth
of the Hyeminseo's herb supply.

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:38.727
How generous.

00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:43.649
The physician of the royal court said
His Highness is exceptionally handsome.

00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:48.070
It must be nice to work in the court.
You can see His Highness there.

00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:52.616
This is all great,

00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:55.244
but isn't this a bit random?

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:04.753
Her Majesty does not wish
to receive visitors.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.260
Please tell Her Majesty
I'll return tomorrow.

00:17:18.642 --> 00:17:20.185
To continue where we left off,

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:23.230
all the medicinal herbs you sent
to the Hyeminseo were for their patients?

00:17:23.564 --> 00:17:24.648
Yes.

00:17:25.107 --> 00:17:29.069
She said they never have enough herbs
for all the patients.

00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:30.529
So I had to do it.

00:17:30.612 --> 00:17:32.781
-This is great.
-What do you mean?

00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:36.451
The physician who treated you
must be in shock by now.

00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:37.911
-Why?
-"Oh!"

00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:40.956
"The man I treated a few days ago
was the Grand Prince!"

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.291
Like this.

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:45.002
I told you to donate anonymously.

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:46.753
Were they bestowed under my name?

00:17:46.837 --> 00:17:49.506
Yes. There are unsavory rumors
about Your Highness.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.049
This should be made known.

00:17:51.133 --> 00:17:52.009
They're my rumors.

00:17:52.092 --> 00:17:55.470
Now that they know, why not visit
and encourage them in person?

00:17:58.432 --> 00:17:59.600
There's no need.

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:03.312
It may help soothe
the Queen Dowager's anger.

00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:06.023
I like that pretext.

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:10.152
Now, bring me the finest-looking horse
from the Royal Stables.

00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:11.069
Now?

00:18:11.153 --> 00:18:12.404
And on your way back,

00:18:12.487 --> 00:18:14.656
stop by the Office of Royal Attire
and pick up the vest

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.116
made with silk from the Ming.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.242
Is that necessary?

00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:19.286
You keep answering with questions.

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:20.746
I apologize…

00:18:24.082 --> 00:18:26.210
Right. I'm not allowed to apologize.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.712
That was just me talking to myself.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:33.175
Move!

00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:44.937
You're going to be married soon.
You don't need ribbons.

00:18:45.812 --> 00:18:47.481
You should be looking at hairpins.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.235
You need one to pin up your hair
the morning after the wedding night.

00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:53.487
Are you making fun of me?

00:18:54.071 --> 00:18:55.072
What's wrong?

00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:57.950
You even read the erotic book to study.

00:18:59.868 --> 00:19:02.287
I was merely trying to understand.

00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:05.123
I wanted to understand it,
so I could hate it less.

00:19:07.084 --> 00:19:08.919
It's the lord.

00:19:09.002 --> 00:19:10.462
What? Where?

00:19:10.545 --> 00:19:12.589
Once he finds out
we came out without permission,

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:13.799
we'll be in serious trouble.

00:19:13.882 --> 00:19:16.301
Get on your knees.
We must confess our wrongdoing and--

00:19:16.385 --> 00:19:17.344
Run!

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:19.054
Run? Run where?

00:19:19.805 --> 00:19:21.431
Where to?

00:19:35.612 --> 00:19:36.780
Halt.

00:19:38.949 --> 00:19:40.617
-Let's take another route.
-Yes, my lord.

00:19:55.215 --> 00:19:56.341
Did I get caught?

00:19:57.134 --> 00:19:58.510
I'm so in trouble.

00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:04.349
Wait, he's from…

00:20:10.772 --> 00:20:11.940
Excuse me.

00:20:17.362 --> 00:20:18.822
Please help me.

00:20:32.252 --> 00:20:35.630
I don't know whose daughter she is,
she must be the bane of the family.

00:20:45.932 --> 00:20:48.518
I believe you're out of mortal danger now.

00:20:55.984 --> 00:20:57.152
I'm alive.

00:20:59.863 --> 00:21:01.490
Is he the Grim Reaper or something?

00:21:01.573 --> 00:21:04.201
He's my brother.

00:21:04.284 --> 00:21:07.120
He believes it is dangerous
for women to go outside.

00:21:07.913 --> 00:21:09.790
I appreciate your help today.

00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:16.004
Take care.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.672
Dae-chu.

00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:30.352
My lady.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.397
Kkot-sim,

00:21:34.022 --> 00:21:35.482
am I the invisible type?

00:21:36.733 --> 00:21:37.734
Pardon?

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.947
If he doesn't remember me,

00:21:43.073 --> 00:21:44.866
I must not have made

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.910
much of an impression, right?

00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:58.088
Hello? Anybody in there?

00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:04.177
So, I must wait in that line
to be treated?

00:22:04.886 --> 00:22:06.346
That will not be necessary,

00:22:07.097 --> 00:22:08.682
if you say you're the Grand Prince.

00:22:08.765 --> 00:22:09.975
Be quiet.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.602
Are you not here for an inspection?

00:22:12.686 --> 00:22:15.063
There will be no inspection.
It'll only cause disruption.

00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:17.774
Look! Are you okay?

00:22:20.735 --> 00:22:22.487
Look here! Wake up!

00:22:25.365 --> 00:22:26.324
Sir.

00:22:26.408 --> 00:22:27.409
Eun-jo.

00:22:28.827 --> 00:22:29.744
Let's carry her.

00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:31.371
No, we must calm her down first.

00:22:31.454 --> 00:22:33.331
If we move her now,
it will worsen her seizure.

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:35.417
-Please bring a physician.
-I will.

00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:36.877
Ma'am.

00:22:38.503 --> 00:22:40.005
Can you hear me?

00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:43.884
Don't try to fight back, relax.

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:46.761
Relax your body and just lean on me…

00:22:54.936 --> 00:22:57.105
We just need to stay with her
until a physician comes?

00:23:01.067 --> 00:23:02.277
Ma'am.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.905
Breath with me. Follow me.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.907
One.

00:23:07.824 --> 00:23:09.159
One.

00:23:10.118 --> 00:23:11.578
You're doing great.

00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:13.663
Again. One.

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:17.667
One.

00:23:19.878 --> 00:23:21.046
One.

00:23:24.007 --> 00:23:25.634
-One.
-What happened?

00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:29.346
She had a seizure. It has just subsided.

00:23:29.429 --> 00:23:31.181
-Move her inside.
-Yes, sir.

00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:38.188
Let's go.

00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:01.294
Did he leave?

00:24:11.054 --> 00:24:12.430
Are you looking for me?

00:24:14.474 --> 00:24:16.184
Thanks for helping me with the patient.

00:24:19.562 --> 00:24:21.773
I brushed off the dirt and dust.

00:24:21.856 --> 00:24:24.067
But the fine fabric has been ruined.

00:24:24.442 --> 00:24:26.236
If you need compensation…

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:27.696
I need no compensation.

00:24:28.989 --> 00:24:30.448
But this is troubling me again.

00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:33.827
I know.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.663
Your hands are not
for tying knots on your robe.

00:24:55.682 --> 00:24:57.559
What are you doing? I just tied it.

00:25:02.605 --> 00:25:03.690
Leave it.

00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:08.153
My hands can bind up a wound though.

00:25:08.653 --> 00:25:09.696
Later.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.489
I'll do it later.

00:25:14.284 --> 00:25:17.203
You treated my wound the other day
so now we're even.

00:25:18.288 --> 00:25:20.749
My position does not allow me
to live indebted to others.

00:25:24.127 --> 00:25:26.254
Sure. Now we're even then.

00:25:27.297 --> 00:25:28.798
You didn't even realize you got hurt.

00:25:29.966 --> 00:25:31.259
Are you always this dull?

00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:34.846
You saw how chaotic it was.

00:25:35.347 --> 00:25:38.475
I can feel the pain only once I'm relaxed.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.101
What is your name?

00:25:40.185 --> 00:25:41.686
Eun-jo, of the Hong family.

00:25:42.437 --> 00:25:43.438
Sir.

00:25:44.939 --> 00:25:46.149
Why do you ask?

00:25:47.192 --> 00:25:48.068
Because I'm curious.

00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:51.780
Why did you come here?

00:25:55.617 --> 00:25:57.327
I wish I knew that too.

00:25:58.495 --> 00:26:00.622
Are you here for another apology--

00:26:00.705 --> 00:26:01.748
No.

00:26:02.624 --> 00:26:05.460
I said I was not interested
in your impulses anymore.

00:26:05.877 --> 00:26:07.003
I see.

00:26:08.671 --> 00:26:10.465
It seems to be fine silk.

00:26:10.965 --> 00:26:12.717
I will return it later.

00:26:15.637 --> 00:26:16.638
What's that?

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.809
We received some medicinal herbs
from Grand Prince Dowol.

00:26:20.892 --> 00:26:22.685
So I was making a list of them.

00:26:22.769 --> 00:26:24.020
I see.

00:26:24.604 --> 00:26:25.855
Grand Prince Dowol.

00:26:28.316 --> 00:26:29.859
Actually, that's why I'm here.

00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:42.497
Dig up every bit of dirt on Im Sa-hyeong.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.706
Yes, my lord.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.476
What on earth made you so angry
that you made this mess?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.354
Do you know how much these are worth?

00:27:06.438 --> 00:27:08.189
Answer me!

00:27:11.276 --> 00:27:12.861
I'm still talking.

00:27:13.403 --> 00:27:15.447
Where are you going?

00:27:17.323 --> 00:27:19.200
-My head hurts.
-My lady.

00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:22.787
-Clean that up.
-Yes, my lady.

00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:40.638
Everything from here to there
was sent by Grand Prince Dowol.

00:27:41.723 --> 00:27:44.225
I'll make sure His Highness knows
they arrived safely.

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:46.269
Continue what you were doing.

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:51.024
You must be close to the Grand Prince.

00:27:51.107 --> 00:27:54.027
You're even carrying out
a secret inspection for His Highness.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.778
We are very close.

00:27:56.529 --> 00:27:58.656
I hear he's handsome.

00:27:59.782 --> 00:28:00.992
What do you think?

00:28:01.075 --> 00:28:02.118
What?

00:28:02.744 --> 00:28:04.245
Those rumors are accurate.

00:28:05.455 --> 00:28:07.790
What else did you hear?
Tell me everything.

00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:11.085
That he's an idler
who's always roaming about,

00:28:11.169 --> 00:28:12.212
and that he's a scoundrel.

00:28:14.297 --> 00:28:17.383
That must be to explore the world
and broaden his horizons.

00:28:17.467 --> 00:28:18.801
What else…

00:28:19.719 --> 00:28:22.222
I heard he was a philanderer
who changes women every other day.

00:28:22.305 --> 00:28:23.806
Now that's completely untrue.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.016
It's his first!

00:28:27.936 --> 00:28:29.270
First?

00:28:31.523 --> 00:28:33.608
Am I making excuses for him?

00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:39.072
That was inconsiderate of me.

00:28:39.447 --> 00:28:41.491
I should have watched my words.

00:28:42.116 --> 00:28:45.745
That I'm making excuses
means that I'm bothered.

00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:48.456
You're close to him.
Of course you're bothered.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.541
No.

00:28:49.958 --> 00:28:51.835
I wasn't until now.

00:28:52.752 --> 00:28:54.045
No matter what others say.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:56.673
Pardon?

00:28:57.423 --> 00:28:58.383
What does this mean?

00:29:00.927 --> 00:29:02.345
Is everything sorted now?

00:29:04.222 --> 00:29:06.891
These herbs are a token
of the Grand Prince's kind heart.

00:29:06.975 --> 00:29:08.977
They shall not be wasted.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.603
Yes, sir.

00:29:10.687 --> 00:29:13.314
Superintendent, you've seen through
the Grand Prince's goodwill.

00:29:16.401 --> 00:29:17.694
Grim Reaper?

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.196
Who are you?

00:29:21.447 --> 00:29:23.241
He is…

00:29:23.324 --> 00:29:24.367
Never mind.

00:29:25.118 --> 00:29:27.078
I have no wish to exchange greetings

00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:29.873
with a philanderer who keeps
someone's precious daughter at his side

00:29:29.956 --> 00:29:31.708
in broad daylight.

00:29:35.003 --> 00:29:37.171
Philanderer?

00:29:39.132 --> 00:29:40.633
You may not understand,

00:29:40.717 --> 00:29:43.386
but there's something hidden
in that picture

00:29:43.469 --> 00:29:44.762
that you must never find out.

00:29:44.846 --> 00:29:46.556
In other words, it's a misunderstanding.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.516
What is a misunderstanding?

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.143
The lady wouldn't have hidden her face

00:29:50.226 --> 00:29:52.896
if there were nothing to be ashamed of.

00:29:52.979 --> 00:29:54.939
I don't care if you misunderstand me,

00:29:55.023 --> 00:29:56.316
but there's nothing between us.

00:29:57.317 --> 00:29:58.359
I see.

00:29:59.402 --> 00:30:01.362
I know the face. I've seen it.

00:30:01.446 --> 00:30:02.697
You don't believe me.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.742
That's not important right now.

00:30:05.825 --> 00:30:07.744
It is now.

00:30:09.495 --> 00:30:10.580
What?

00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:17.086
I don't know anything
about his private life.

00:30:17.754 --> 00:30:20.632
Please do not judge him
solely by what you see.

00:30:20.715 --> 00:30:23.343
He even helped me just a while ago.

00:30:23.426 --> 00:30:27.096
And aside from that,
he serves at the constabulary.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.307
So that speaks to his integrity.

00:30:32.602 --> 00:30:34.354
I was wondering where you went.

00:30:37.106 --> 00:30:39.776
If you've seen one, you've seen them all.

00:30:41.694 --> 00:30:43.363
I forbid you

00:30:43.446 --> 00:30:44.822
from entering my Hyeminseo.

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:49.118
Forbid me?

00:30:55.249 --> 00:30:56.084
He forbade me.

00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:59.212
How did you stand me all this time?

00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:01.089
I can't stand this though.

00:31:01.798 --> 00:31:04.968
I will tell him the truth
and hold him accountable.

00:31:05.301 --> 00:31:06.511
Just leave it.

00:31:07.345 --> 00:31:08.930
-Pardon?
-We can't say it now.

00:31:09.013 --> 00:31:11.224
It'll only prove that I'm a philanderer.

00:31:12.141 --> 00:31:12.976
Yes, Your Highness.

00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:19.440
By the way,
the female physician from earlier,

00:31:19.857 --> 00:31:21.567
she seemed somewhat familiar.

00:31:24.696 --> 00:31:26.489
He serves at the constabulary.

00:31:27.782 --> 00:31:29.951
Have I ever mentioned the constabulary?

00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:40.169
The realgar antidote
we've received from the envoy

00:31:40.253 --> 00:31:41.963
should take effect.

00:31:50.054 --> 00:31:53.558
Your skin affliction
never seems to improve.

00:31:55.768 --> 00:31:57.228
I'm tired.

00:32:24.338 --> 00:32:25.882
It'll relieve the pain.

00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:29.886
Get some sleep.

00:33:04.796 --> 00:33:06.047
When did you get here?

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.050
I came straight from the Hyeminseo.

00:33:09.842 --> 00:33:12.553
The lady urgently requested the tonic.

00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:17.475
What's all this?

00:33:17.558 --> 00:33:20.144
The lord had a fit of temper.

00:33:20.228 --> 00:33:22.563
So I picked out the things
that could still be put to use.

00:33:25.858 --> 00:33:27.985
What are you going to use
the burnt book for?

00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:30.530
For the privy.

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:33.157
Like this.

00:33:53.261 --> 00:33:56.305
This was in his room?

00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:57.807
I was told

00:33:58.391 --> 00:34:00.768
that you donated medicinal herbs
to the Hyeminseo.

00:34:00.852 --> 00:34:02.436
Yes, it just happened that way.

00:34:02.895 --> 00:34:04.689
Just as with Gil-dong.

00:34:05.898 --> 00:34:09.193
I see now
that you care deeply for the people.

00:34:10.778 --> 00:34:11.821
For the people?

00:34:12.196 --> 00:34:14.073
Do you think I did it for the people?

00:34:14.657 --> 00:34:15.783
Then what was it for?

00:34:15.867 --> 00:34:18.244
It makes me look cool.

00:34:20.705 --> 00:34:22.206
I must get going.

00:34:23.124 --> 00:34:25.418
Playing constable is getting boring now.

00:34:25.793 --> 00:34:27.920
I might start hanging around
the Ministry of Taxation.

00:34:28.462 --> 00:34:31.174
Aren't you tired of always roaming around?

00:34:31.966 --> 00:34:34.468
Those who are idle
are always the busiest, after all.

00:34:34.802 --> 00:34:36.470
Your Highness. I remember now.

00:34:36.554 --> 00:34:38.014
The female physician from earlier,

00:34:38.097 --> 00:34:39.974
she's the one
you were waiting for that night.

00:34:40.057 --> 00:34:41.142
The bandit.

00:34:41.517 --> 00:34:42.810
You realize that now?

00:34:44.103 --> 00:34:45.563
That said, I have a question.

00:34:45.646 --> 00:34:47.940
I keep making excuses--

00:34:55.198 --> 00:34:57.283
Please wait here. I'll take a look.

00:35:04.749 --> 00:35:06.167
A cotton-tipped arrow?

00:35:07.752 --> 00:35:08.920
Gil-dong.

00:35:14.175 --> 00:35:16.427
So, you want to talk to me in private.

00:35:33.277 --> 00:35:34.737
Is this the Chief Censor's…

00:35:35.154 --> 00:35:37.323
This was in his room?

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:39.825
It was burning in the brazier,
so I took it out.

00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:48.918
How could this be?

00:35:51.254 --> 00:35:54.465
If this comes to light,
can I bear the consequences?

00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:57.468
It could put everyone in danger.

00:35:57.843 --> 00:36:00.179
Why? What does it say?

00:36:01.931 --> 00:36:04.100
It's perfect for privies.

00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:16.654
I will allow you
to look after your neighbors your way.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:22.952
Actually, I've always wanted
to read this book.

00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:24.537
Can I have it?

00:36:25.913 --> 00:36:28.666
All the corrupt acts he has committed

00:36:28.749 --> 00:36:31.127
since serving as the governor
of Pyongan Province

00:36:32.795 --> 00:36:34.046
are recorded in great detail.

00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:39.427
I understand why you gave this to me.

00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:41.721
But didn't I tell you

00:36:42.346 --> 00:36:43.723
that I will not support your theft

00:36:43.806 --> 00:36:47.059
nor will I blame Joseon
for ignoring corrupt officials?

00:36:47.143 --> 00:36:48.602
And by that, I meant…

00:36:50.062 --> 00:36:51.939
I would do nothing.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.526
If you thought I was a good man
after seeing one kind act,

00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:56.736
you are mistaken.

00:36:56.819 --> 00:36:59.905
I'm not the kind of person
who makes a show of justice.

00:37:00.364 --> 00:37:02.199
If you do not wish
to die before your time,

00:37:02.283 --> 00:37:05.244
stick to your petty theft
for your neighbors, nothing more.

00:37:05.328 --> 00:37:08.122
Bringing down a single corrupt official
will not change this country.

00:37:10.082 --> 00:37:11.167
Who's there?

00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:16.547
Let him go.

00:37:17.423 --> 00:37:18.799
Who was it?

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.718
It was Gil-dong.

00:37:26.515 --> 00:37:28.934
Is this note from Gil-dong?

00:37:33.105 --> 00:37:34.815
It seems like it's a message for you.

00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:38.027
"Thank you for last night."

00:37:38.652 --> 00:37:41.447
"I came across this book by chance."

00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:55.503
I suppose I made too much
of one random kind act.

00:37:56.837 --> 00:37:58.589
"I believe it will be of more use to you

00:37:58.672 --> 00:38:01.092
than to me, a mere thief."

00:38:03.594 --> 00:38:05.304
"A mere thief"?

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.390
What's the matter?

00:38:08.474 --> 00:38:10.351
He's a mere thief, he says.

00:38:10.768 --> 00:38:11.936
Pardon?

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:13.646
Why so eager?

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.982
Why always step forward
as if it were your problem?

00:38:17.066 --> 00:38:18.734
You're a mere thief.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:20.986
How annoying.

00:38:27.118 --> 00:38:28.119
What is that?

00:38:30.121 --> 00:38:31.247
I need to meet him.

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:33.791
Why that look?

00:38:33.874 --> 00:38:35.584
Whom do you wish to meet?

00:38:36.293 --> 00:38:37.294
My brother.

00:38:53.018 --> 00:38:55.062
I pay my respects, Your Majesty.

00:38:55.146 --> 00:38:57.231
It's good to see you, my brother.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.197
How long has it been?

00:39:05.656 --> 00:39:07.867
The night of the Gyeongo Year
was the last time.

00:39:10.453 --> 00:39:12.496
It feels like yesterday

00:39:12.997 --> 00:39:14.373
when you pointed

00:39:14.457 --> 00:39:16.041
your sword at me that night.

00:39:21.672 --> 00:39:22.673
Very well.

00:39:24.508 --> 00:39:26.510
Whom will you point at today?

00:39:50.451 --> 00:39:51.911
It's handwritten.

00:39:52.161 --> 00:39:54.788
I came across it
while I was at the constabulary.

00:39:54.872 --> 00:39:57.791
And the crimes listed there have been
confirmed to be true by the aides.

00:39:59.168 --> 00:40:01.253
You could've handled it
within the constabulary.

00:40:01.795 --> 00:40:04.381
If I submit a petition,
the Chief Censor will move to stop it

00:40:04.465 --> 00:40:06.300
before it goes public.

00:40:07.092 --> 00:40:09.678
So you wish me to punish him
before the eyes of all.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.226
What if I choose not to act as you wish?

00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:16.393
I have no particular wish.

00:40:17.436 --> 00:40:18.437
And I shall not.

00:40:19.813 --> 00:40:21.106
Your Majesty knows this well.

00:40:23.359 --> 00:40:25.027
How heartless of you.

00:40:25.528 --> 00:40:28.030
You once discussed marriage
with this family.

00:40:28.113 --> 00:40:30.533
Having a greedy father-in-law

00:40:30.616 --> 00:40:31.867
will bring me down anyway.

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.038
I know you would call it justice,

00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:41.377
but what's your real intention?

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.046
Blast.

00:40:45.256 --> 00:40:46.757
I don't want to be ashamed of myself

00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:48.717
in front of this man

00:40:49.134 --> 00:40:50.219
who is nobody.

00:40:52.805 --> 00:40:53.722
What?

00:40:53.806 --> 00:40:54.974
That's right.

00:40:55.057 --> 00:40:56.433
I know it's childish,

00:40:56.517 --> 00:40:58.227
but he hurt my pride.

00:41:09.321 --> 00:41:11.198
Why did you meet His Majesty?

00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:19.039
I suppose I must go to His Majesty
if I wish to see you

00:41:19.123 --> 00:41:21.333
because you never allow me
into your chamber.

00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:23.544
How could you…

00:41:25.754 --> 00:41:27.006
Tell me.

00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:29.383
What did His Majesty say?

00:41:29.925 --> 00:41:31.510
Tell me!

00:41:31.594 --> 00:41:33.971
Can't you see your mother is worried sick?

00:41:51.697 --> 00:41:53.449
This is why

00:41:53.532 --> 00:41:55.326
I must be idle even more.

00:42:03.375 --> 00:42:05.711
He said he's ashamed of himself.

00:42:07.546 --> 00:42:10.758
At least I can spare my younger brother
what little pride he has left.

00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:13.761
For the sake of my dignity,
as his brother.

00:42:16.347 --> 00:42:17.598
Eun-jo!

00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:22.311
No one here knows how to read.

00:42:22.394 --> 00:42:23.562
She's here.

00:42:27.191 --> 00:42:28.317
Give me a moment.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.573
What does it say?

00:42:35.658 --> 00:42:36.700
Come on.

00:42:36.784 --> 00:42:38.327
Read it out for us.

00:42:40.913 --> 00:42:41.997
Sure.

00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:47.920
"Chief Censor Kim Deok-han

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.383
extorted the property of the people,

00:42:52.466 --> 00:42:55.010
already impoverished
by the continued famine…"

00:42:55.803 --> 00:42:57.262
What is all this about?

00:43:04.603 --> 00:43:08.399
"…seized their land
through ruthless usury,

00:43:08.482 --> 00:43:10.859
eventually driving them to destitution."

00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:15.280
"This truly goes against
basic human morality."

00:43:17.366 --> 00:43:19.993
"The seized land

00:43:20.911 --> 00:43:24.498
shall be returned to the peasants
to right the wrongs."

00:43:25.624 --> 00:43:27.668
"His office and property
shall be confiscated,

00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:29.920
and he is sentenced to exile
pursuant to the law."

00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:34.508
"This is to punish

00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:36.885
-a corrupt official…
-…a corrupt official

00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:39.054
for plundering the people's granary."

00:43:40.264 --> 00:43:41.682
My word!

00:43:42.391 --> 00:43:45.102
It's like sweet rain after a long drought!

00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:48.772
The world
has not entirely turned against us!

00:44:02.161 --> 00:44:03.328
What is this?

00:44:04.246 --> 00:44:07.040
Maybe it wasn't
just one act of kindness after all.

00:44:24.433 --> 00:44:26.477
STATE TRIBUNAL

00:44:27.394 --> 00:44:29.188
How dare you?

00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:32.775
I asked how the Grand Prince
obtained the book.

00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:36.779
You betrayed me,
and now you lay the blame on me?

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.493
So the Chief Censor did not
hand the ledger to the Grand Prince?

00:44:44.328 --> 00:44:47.748
The Chief Censor may be foolish,
but he would not have destroyed himself.

00:44:48.624 --> 00:44:49.666
But no one

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.544
is aware of the ledger,
save you and me, Father.

00:44:52.628 --> 00:44:55.172
You should quietly sound out
how much His Highness knows.

00:44:56.423 --> 00:45:00.052
His Highness does not yet know
the ledger was mine.

00:45:00.135 --> 00:45:01.220
Had he known,

00:45:01.303 --> 00:45:04.389
it would not have been
only the Chief Censor who was dismissed.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.727
Put a man on the Grand Prince.

00:45:09.603 --> 00:45:11.939
Find out whom he meets and where he goes.

00:45:12.022 --> 00:45:13.941
Observe his every move.

00:45:20.155 --> 00:45:21.865
So, this is it!

00:45:22.157 --> 00:45:23.992
Oh, dear. It smells delightful.

00:45:24.076 --> 00:45:26.036
Seok-sam, hurry over.

00:45:26.119 --> 00:45:29.665
Seok-sam is here!

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.708
Chil-seok, what are you doing? Come here.

00:45:31.792 --> 00:45:33.043
-Come here.
-Come quickly.

00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:36.171
Take this, Seok-sam.

00:45:36.547 --> 00:45:38.382
I'll drink from the bottle.

00:45:38.465 --> 00:45:40.926
-Come on. Let's drink together.
-Let's drink.

00:45:43.303 --> 00:45:45.389
Please at least go
and share a drink with them.

00:45:45.472 --> 00:45:48.600
They think you're an aide
and wish to show their gratitude

00:45:48.684 --> 00:45:51.562
with the food they've made
despite their humble circumstances.

00:45:52.187 --> 00:45:55.399
I usually make sure
to take credit for what I do,

00:45:56.858 --> 00:45:58.151
but I'll be busy tonight.

00:46:04.283 --> 00:46:06.410
-Dae-chu, you go in my stead.
-Me?

00:46:06.493 --> 00:46:08.870
Meet me around 8:00 in the evening
at the gate.

00:46:08.954 --> 00:46:10.247
And you,

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.541
from tomorrow,
keep watch on Gil-dong's movements.

00:46:12.624 --> 00:46:13.667
May I ask why?

00:46:14.042 --> 00:46:16.420
The Chief Censor's crimes
listed in the ledger

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.548
are not something
a petty thief could have gathered.

00:46:20.257 --> 00:46:22.593
Do you think someone is behind Gil-dong?

00:46:22.676 --> 00:46:24.303
Whether someone stands behind him

00:46:24.386 --> 00:46:26.597
or he came upon it by chance, as he wrote,

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.889
I must find out.

00:46:27.973 --> 00:46:29.057
Yes, Your Highness.

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:32.269
And now I am curious

00:46:33.895 --> 00:46:35.314
to see his face.

00:47:03.717 --> 00:47:05.719
She's being sold
as our grandfather's concubine.

00:47:05.802 --> 00:47:07.638
She will be a caretaker.

00:47:11.391 --> 00:47:12.643
Does life treat you well?

00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:18.857
I apologize

00:47:19.483 --> 00:47:22.361
for my rudeness the other day.
I didn't know you were their second son.

00:47:22.444 --> 00:47:23.654
Please forgive me.

00:47:28.784 --> 00:47:30.535
I will make his daughter's life miserable

00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:33.246
the moment she sets foot in this house.

00:47:36.124 --> 00:47:37.334
I will consider

00:47:37.417 --> 00:47:38.752
my apology accepted.

00:47:38.835 --> 00:47:39.920
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:47:42.005 --> 00:47:43.298
Call off the wedding.

00:47:44.925 --> 00:47:46.301
My wedding?

00:47:50.555 --> 00:47:51.515
May I ask why?

00:47:51.598 --> 00:47:53.517
I cannot stomach

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.686
living in this house with those animals.

00:47:58.939 --> 00:48:00.190
I will keep it in mind.

00:48:03.527 --> 00:48:06.196
In Joseon, carrying a concubine's blood
means you're flawed.

00:48:06.279 --> 00:48:07.197
And that means

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.200
someone like you will be treated
like an animal in this family.

00:48:10.742 --> 00:48:13.370
I do know that much.

00:48:13.453 --> 00:48:14.663
No.

00:48:15.038 --> 00:48:16.248
You don't know.

00:48:16.957 --> 00:48:18.291
Remember this humiliation.

00:48:19.126 --> 00:48:22.129
Once you set foot in this family,
you will feel it tenfold.

00:48:23.046 --> 00:48:26.675
My brother has a temper like none other.

00:48:29.469 --> 00:48:30.470
Is this a warning?

00:48:31.346 --> 00:48:32.681
Call it charity.

00:48:33.098 --> 00:48:35.016
Sometimes, I can act like a good man too.

00:48:36.017 --> 00:48:37.185
Why are you doing this to me?

00:48:37.269 --> 00:48:39.771
Lord Hong sent back all the wedding gifts.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.607
He seems to genuinely care
for someone as lowly as you.

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:46.778
My lord did that?

00:48:48.321 --> 00:48:50.907
You really care for each other,
like a real father and daughter.

00:48:50.991 --> 00:48:52.451
What a pitiful family.

00:48:55.162 --> 00:48:57.289
I must see my lord!

00:48:58.331 --> 00:48:59.416
Eun-jo.

00:48:59.666 --> 00:49:01.209
Not you as well.

00:49:01.543 --> 00:49:03.003
Young Master is right.

00:49:03.086 --> 00:49:04.713
We could have taken everything.

00:49:04.796 --> 00:49:06.965
So what if we lack a bit of shame?

00:49:07.048 --> 00:49:09.634
It would have made your life
much more comfortable.

00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:11.178
Was it so hard for you?

00:49:15.098 --> 00:49:17.851
He said he wouldn't let you
take any more burden.

00:49:19.019 --> 00:49:21.938
He said retrieving my slave register

00:49:22.731 --> 00:49:24.524
and keeping this house

00:49:25.567 --> 00:49:27.611
were burdens you're already bearing,

00:49:28.445 --> 00:49:30.822
so he would pay them all back,
little by little.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.075
That's what he said to Chief Secretary Im.

00:49:36.995 --> 00:49:38.538
Don't say anything.

00:49:39.247 --> 00:49:41.082
If anything, blame me

00:49:42.083 --> 00:49:44.252
for being carried away
by the wedding gifts.

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:48.089
It's getting late.
I must go prepare dinner.

00:49:53.804 --> 00:49:55.931
I cannot believe this.

00:49:59.476 --> 00:50:01.895
How am I supposed to get married now?

00:50:27.629 --> 00:50:28.547
Is anyone here?

00:50:41.434 --> 00:50:42.769
Where is she?

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.629
What are you doing there?

00:51:11.882 --> 00:51:13.258
How did you get here?

00:51:14.175 --> 00:51:15.760
I was just passing by.

00:51:16.261 --> 00:51:18.054
The moon is shining brightly,

00:51:18.138 --> 00:51:19.264
and

00:51:20.348 --> 00:51:21.516
I have something to reclaim.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.019
Right, the tie.

00:51:24.936 --> 00:51:26.438
I washed it and kept it at home.

00:51:27.105 --> 00:51:28.815
Give me a second. I'll be right there.

00:51:28.899 --> 00:51:30.025
No.

00:51:30.108 --> 00:51:31.401
Stay there.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:40.702
What were you looking at?

00:51:40.785 --> 00:51:43.079
Nothing. The night.

00:51:44.331 --> 00:51:45.957
I hate the night.

00:51:46.041 --> 00:51:49.878
It's calm and still,
as if nothing has happened.

00:51:51.504 --> 00:51:53.381
That's why I like about the night.

00:51:57.344 --> 00:52:01.139
Especially when I see it
from the roof like this.

00:52:02.474 --> 00:52:03.808
From here,

00:52:03.892 --> 00:52:07.520
people seem small, houses seem small,

00:52:08.855 --> 00:52:10.982
even the palace seems small.

00:52:12.108 --> 00:52:14.361
It makes my worries seem small as well.

00:52:16.404 --> 00:52:17.739
What are your worries?

00:52:17.822 --> 00:52:20.158
I can be kind and be supportive.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.578
No, thank you.

00:52:24.454 --> 00:52:26.289
If someone actually showed support,

00:52:26.873 --> 00:52:29.292
I would want to give up everything.

00:52:29.834 --> 00:52:31.169
Then give it up.

00:52:31.753 --> 00:52:32.963
Whatever it is,

00:52:33.046 --> 00:52:35.048
you can give it up just this once.

00:52:38.635 --> 00:52:40.887
If you want, I can help you give it up.

00:52:46.893 --> 00:52:50.105
You're talking
as if you know what it's about.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.441
I don't need to know.

00:52:53.525 --> 00:52:56.653
Whatever it is,
I have the power to do that.

00:53:04.244 --> 00:53:08.039
Does that mean
I have some solid backing now?

00:53:10.417 --> 00:53:14.045
I feel relieved, this much.

00:53:14.754 --> 00:53:15.839
Only that much?

00:53:16.256 --> 00:53:18.717
It should be bigger than just this much.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:24.931
Right.

00:53:26.307 --> 00:53:27.726
I happened to overhear

00:53:28.518 --> 00:53:30.603
that the Chief Censor's case

00:53:31.312 --> 00:53:33.481
was investigated by the constabulary.

00:53:35.734 --> 00:53:37.694
Actually, I've been wondering about this.

00:53:38.194 --> 00:53:40.488
How did you know
I was at the constabulary?

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:44.409
I don't remember saying it.

00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:52.834
Well…

00:53:57.047 --> 00:53:58.757
It tastes delightful.

00:53:59.883 --> 00:54:00.925
What's this about?

00:54:01.009 --> 00:54:03.094
You said you wouldn't see us
till you pass the exam.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.263
Congratulations.

00:54:05.346 --> 00:54:07.474
Let's forget the other day and move on.

00:54:08.975 --> 00:54:10.727
Nothing happened at home?

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:11.811
What do you mean?

00:54:11.895 --> 00:54:12.937
Your lowly sister.

00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:15.482
Don't talk about that girl.

00:54:15.565 --> 00:54:16.441
It kills my appetite.

00:54:16.524 --> 00:54:17.901
What?

00:54:17.984 --> 00:54:21.738
What happened to all that praise for her?

00:54:23.406 --> 00:54:25.158
What's wrong? You don't look well.

00:54:30.288 --> 00:54:31.748
Almost all the patients

00:54:31.831 --> 00:54:35.043
who come to the Hyeminseo
after being struck by arrows at night

00:54:36.461 --> 00:54:38.922
are patrol officers from the constabulary.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:40.924
That makes sense.

00:54:41.007 --> 00:54:43.843
So I assumed you were
from the constabulary too.

00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:50.100
I heard about the rice
you sent Lady Dong-ju as well.

00:54:50.183 --> 00:54:51.684
You know the widow too?

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.019
How?

00:54:53.103 --> 00:54:55.688
The Chief Censor
often laid hands on others.

00:54:55.772 --> 00:54:59.317
So his slaves frequented the Hyeminseo.

00:55:00.819 --> 00:55:02.695
I'm not surprised.

00:55:05.156 --> 00:55:06.157
Thank you.

00:55:07.784 --> 00:55:08.743
Why would you say that?

00:55:09.994 --> 00:55:11.079
Because

00:55:11.162 --> 00:55:13.206
I know them pretty well too.

00:55:15.875 --> 00:55:18.878
An idler like me
doesn't deserve any thanks.

00:55:18.962 --> 00:55:20.463
You should thank someone else.

00:55:21.798 --> 00:55:22.966
Who?

00:55:23.049 --> 00:55:24.092
You don't know him.

00:55:24.968 --> 00:55:27.387
There's this man
who is just as nosy as you.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.598
He's talking about Gil-dong.

00:55:30.682 --> 00:55:33.852
All I did was make sure
his heart came across.

00:55:36.771 --> 00:55:41.025
Your wish for his heart to come across

00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:42.527
shows your own heart.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.070
I told you, that's not it.

00:55:45.947 --> 00:55:48.074
To me, you seem like a good person.

00:55:48.158 --> 00:55:50.326
You must not know yourself very well.

00:55:51.578 --> 00:55:52.787
Or are you just pretending?

00:55:55.832 --> 00:55:57.917
You haven't known me
long enough to say that.

00:55:58.626 --> 00:56:02.172
I can tell
from years of dealing with people.

00:56:04.465 --> 00:56:05.967
In any case,

00:56:06.551 --> 00:56:08.970
I'm so glad that you solved this case.

00:56:09.053 --> 00:56:10.597
How fortunate.

00:56:11.472 --> 00:56:12.557
"Fortunate"?

00:56:13.558 --> 00:56:14.809
What do you mean by that?

00:56:16.144 --> 00:56:17.270
I mean

00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:20.982
you're so smart

00:56:21.065 --> 00:56:23.401
and everything went well. That's all.

00:56:23.484 --> 00:56:25.320
Don't say that so easily.

00:56:25.653 --> 00:56:26.487
Pardon?

00:56:26.571 --> 00:56:28.239
Poverty, misery,

00:56:28.323 --> 00:56:29.657
sadness and tears.

00:56:30.116 --> 00:56:32.493
It sounds like I might be
one of the few fortunate things

00:56:33.119 --> 00:56:34.996
among all that misfortune you have.

00:56:42.086 --> 00:56:43.671
All I said was that it was fortunate.

00:56:44.756 --> 00:56:45.798
Follow me.

00:56:46.174 --> 00:56:49.385
I don't have the tie, but I will
change the cloth around your wound.

00:56:50.637 --> 00:56:52.597
Come, before the Superintendent
kicks you out.

00:56:54.182 --> 00:56:55.725
No one's getting kicked out.

00:56:58.728 --> 00:56:59.812
Jae-i.

00:57:00.396 --> 00:57:03.066
Let's have one more drink.

00:57:05.526 --> 00:57:06.527
Let go.

00:57:14.452 --> 00:57:15.703
It's the Hyeminseo.

00:57:17.664 --> 00:57:18.790
All right.

00:57:19.249 --> 00:57:23.086
I will teach the wench a lesson today!

00:57:30.718 --> 00:57:31.970
As I said many times,

00:57:32.053 --> 00:57:34.514
bans, orders, permissions, aid,

00:57:34.597 --> 00:57:36.224
those are things that only I can do.

00:57:36.307 --> 00:57:37.809
I was just joking.

00:57:37.892 --> 00:57:40.353
You won't be kicked out, so don't worry.

00:57:41.229 --> 00:57:42.522
I have no such worry.

00:57:43.398 --> 00:57:45.942
If the Superintendent finds out
who he banned from entering,

00:57:46.025 --> 00:57:47.527
he will be devastated.

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:48.945
That's what I worry about.

00:57:49.862 --> 00:57:51.406
You keep saying that.

00:57:52.198 --> 00:57:54.659
So you're from a family
with that much power?

00:57:54.742 --> 00:57:56.369
One of the most powerful in Joseon.

00:57:56.452 --> 00:57:57.954
That's all you need to know for now.

00:57:58.037 --> 00:58:01.457
And I'm keeping this from you
so you don't get too shocked.

00:58:02.333 --> 00:58:05.712
So I treated someone so great
like a dullard.

00:58:05.795 --> 00:58:07.171
It must have felt really unfair.

00:58:08.131 --> 00:58:09.048
It felt unfamiliar.

00:58:11.718 --> 00:58:14.053
It felt unfamiliar
to see a woman less than half my size

00:58:14.887 --> 00:58:16.931
standing in front of me to protect me.

00:58:17.015 --> 00:58:20.018
This madman doesn't know what he is doing.

00:58:20.101 --> 00:58:22.145
Please show the generosity of a nobleman.

00:58:23.354 --> 00:58:25.189
So I was intrigued.

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.863
And ever since then…

00:58:38.244 --> 00:58:39.412
This is nonsense.

00:58:40.538 --> 00:58:41.748
There really is such a thing?

00:58:43.958 --> 00:58:45.168
What do you mean?

00:58:55.762 --> 00:58:58.598
Why are you looking at me like that?
You're embarrassing me.

00:58:58.681 --> 00:58:59.932
I feel the same.

00:59:00.016 --> 00:59:01.643
I'm embarrassed as well.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.061
Pardon?

00:59:04.395 --> 00:59:06.689
What I'm about to say
is even more embarrassing.

00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:09.484
Is there a man you hold dear?

00:59:13.321 --> 00:59:14.405
Why do you ask?

00:59:14.489 --> 00:59:15.823
I don't care if you do.

00:59:16.157 --> 00:59:17.367
Are you free tomorrow?

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:18.534
Make some time for me.

00:59:19.243 --> 00:59:21.245
What are you doing?

00:59:21.329 --> 00:59:22.330
I'm courting you.

00:59:27.251 --> 00:59:28.711
From now on,

00:59:29.295 --> 00:59:30.838
I want to do it more properly.

00:59:39.889 --> 00:59:41.099
Well…

00:59:46.229 --> 00:59:48.147
I'm getting married soon…

00:59:55.113 --> 00:59:56.155
How did you…

01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:06.541
What is this?

01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:08.835
A man and a woman

01:00:09.794 --> 01:00:10.628
at this late hour?

01:00:13.381 --> 01:00:14.507
Who is that man?

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:15.967
Introduce yourself first.

01:00:22.348 --> 01:00:23.599
Give me a moment.

01:00:26.644 --> 01:00:27.854
What's the matter?

01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:33.067
You seem flustered.

01:00:33.609 --> 01:00:34.694
This is interesting.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.699
Am I seeing what I'm not supposed to see?

01:00:41.325 --> 01:00:42.326
Pardon?

01:00:44.996 --> 01:00:47.540
This is clearly a tryst.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.376
And an uninvited guest
has arrived at just the right time.

01:00:53.129 --> 01:00:54.714
Does he know that

01:00:55.214 --> 01:00:57.633
you're marrying a man in his 70s?

01:01:07.935 --> 01:01:10.354
Your face is getting
more and more interesting.

01:01:12.106 --> 01:01:14.817
It will be even more interesting
if he finds out.

01:01:17.653 --> 01:01:18.613
Hey.

01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:32.001
You tell me.

01:01:33.044 --> 01:01:34.253
Who do you think

01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:36.380
I am?

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:36.649
I hope this is the last time we meet.

01:02:36.732 --> 01:02:37.775
Should I steal her?

01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:39.151
I'm the Grand Prince.

01:02:39.235 --> 01:02:40.945
I can steal whatever I want.

01:02:41.028 --> 01:02:43.489
Broken heart? Is it really that hard?

01:02:43.573 --> 01:02:44.866
Call off the wedding.

01:02:44.949 --> 01:02:46.325
Do you want to be sold that badly?

01:02:46.409 --> 01:02:48.870
A fight for survival,

01:02:49.495 --> 01:02:51.873
like you said, for a lowly girl like me.

01:02:51.956 --> 01:02:53.374
Be honest with me.

01:02:53.457 --> 01:02:55.293
You're avoiding me now.

01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:56.711
You haven't known me that long.

01:02:56.794 --> 01:02:58.296
How much longer do you need

01:02:58.379 --> 01:02:59.630
to understand me?

01:02:59.755 --> 01:03:01.257
I just need you to say one thing.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:03.175
That it's all right.

01:03:03.259 --> 01:03:05.261
