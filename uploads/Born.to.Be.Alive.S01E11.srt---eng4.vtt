[Episode 11]

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.340
Hurry.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.680
Mr. Ding is waiting.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.420
Hi, Miss.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.289
Hello?

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.310
I just want to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.930
ask,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.300
is Bai Shao in today?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.590
Shao's off today.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.230
Could you

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.210
do me a favor?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.479
Sure.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.210
Please pass her a message.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.230
I'll.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.990
I'll.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.790
I might.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.870
May I borrow a pen

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.790
and paper?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.240
Thanks.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.060
Please give

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.430
this to her yourself.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.870
Thanks for your time.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.620
Shao,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.650
he's gone.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.320
He left this.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.750
Dad and I are off to Xinjiang.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.240
They say

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.450
there are new mines.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.079
Not sure how long,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.770
but please believe

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.800
I will come back.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.690
I heard

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.659
Chairman Ding left.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:01.910
What about Heman?

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.300
He went with his Dad

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.780
to Xinjiang to keep prospecting.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.160
They go wherever

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.120
there are mines.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.000
We can't tell

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.150
what it's worth.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.330
Why not

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.800
just ask?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.360
Wait.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.310
How to ask?

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.250
At what price?

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.380
Do you have this?

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.540
No.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.040
My Mom has a

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.260
valuable bead

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.780
necklace.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.540
It was her dowry.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.370
Worth dozens of yaks.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.430
But this is red coral.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.750
I'm not sure.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.390
Come.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.600
Pool our

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.870
money.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.200
How much?

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.160
I have

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.360
12.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.100
12?

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.330
I have 200.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.300
Plus this change,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.860
and your 12.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.350
Ask if he'll

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.830
take 300.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.180
Too little.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.940
We have no more.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.360
Just try.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.630
Try it.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.390
Brother.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.060
300 yuan, okay?

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.800
Okay.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.410
He agreed.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.830
Did he steal it?

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.300
Brother,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.510
is this necklace yours?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.270
Yes.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.060
He says it's his.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.100
Pay him.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.810
That's cheap.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.820
[Recycling]

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720
This isn't

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.430
worth much.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.270
Not worth much?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.040
How much, then?

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.540
Just 1000.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:39.810
1000.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.620
Can't go higher.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.120
1000.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.500
Well,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.220
someone offered 2000.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.380
Not selling here.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.020
Where else?

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.010
This is the only shop here.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.630
There are

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.000
carts and stalls.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.640
No.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.920
No.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.159
No.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:58.570
What?

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.680
Wait.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.820
Listen. How about

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.510
this?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.560
1000 stays.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.550
That won't do.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.190
I'll add

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.010
some extra.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.070
Why such a hurry?

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.570
What should I add?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.160
Here.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.920
Take a gold

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.860
piece.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.270
Ring.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.720
Right here.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.930
Pick one of my

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.300

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.680
Take it

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.350
as a gift.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.490
That works.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.440
I want

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.280
this.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.670
Disobedient child.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.270
You're a student.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.200
What did school teach?

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.440
You're an

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.770
cadre's kid.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.600
Your Dad taught you this?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.740
Scam kids

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.870
with crooks?

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.740
Point out

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.620
the crook.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.840
Who is Bai Ji? Step out!

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.250
Who is Bai Ji?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.220
Who is Bai Ji?

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.240
Who is Bai Ji? Step out!

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.990

Who is Bai Ji? Step out!

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.710
Get it back.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.000
Sold.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.830
Sold?

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:41.800
Yes.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.710
For how much?

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.460
1000.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.070
1000 yuan.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.620
Sold Grandma's

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.050
necklace for that?

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.550
I wouldn't sell it

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.410
for 100 yaks!

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.470
Ah Ke.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.770
You brat, you dare speak?

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.060
We didn't know

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.000
it was worth that much.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.150
He said he wanted to sell it.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.240
I told you to speak. Speak up.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.410
Speak!

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.460
Brother.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.550
Sorry.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.650
I want to see

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.650
my Sister

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.080
in Beijing.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.770
I told you

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.630
the fare is 300 yuan.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.640
But don't sell

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.820
Great-Grandma's

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.460
necklace.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.390
Where is it?

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.360
Go get it back!

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.550
Go

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.440
find it.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:36.890
Go.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:37.980
Go.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.440
Bai Ji.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.240
What?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.440
I gave it to you.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.000
Take it.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.410
Stop.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.470
I won't sell.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.550
Take it.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:59.080
Hey,

00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.670
how can I

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.460
red coral?

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.170
I sold it.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.590
You sell it so fast?

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.870
Who bought it?

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.320
I don't know.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.970
Outsiders.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.380
Ms. Kang.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.050
No money.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.780
No money.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.490
Take the red coral as a gift.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.100
No.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.930
Take it.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.630
It's valuable.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.160
Ms. Kang.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.930
If I took your

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.460
money, I'd lose face.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:19.830
No.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.820
I can't take

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.570
your money for a necklace.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:22.880
No.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.400
They'd laugh.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:23.830
Repine.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.510
No, Repine.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.620
He's a child.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.550
This isn't enough.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.070
Repine.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.050
Repine.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.600
Open it, Repine.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.580
I can't

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.430
take it.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.850
Ms. Kang, stop pushing.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.760
Stop.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.440
Okay.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.580
I won't push.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.120
You're really something.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.710
I

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.220
didn't know it's so

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.550
valuable.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.700
Think you sold it

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.200
cheap?

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.080
Mom.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.690
Why stop?

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.800
Would hitting help?

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.000
Bai Ji.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.890
Can't you settle down?

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.250
Mom, am I not stable?

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.480
I come here early,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.430
finishing the

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.190
work in half a day.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.360
People say

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.720
time is money.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.030
But my time

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.550
earns me nothing.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.750
I still rely on you and Sister

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.510
for food.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:43.790
Mom.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.200
I have no degree

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.600
or skills.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.330
I must

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.230
help myself.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.400
I got 500

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.670
from that money

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.500
to get a shower basin

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.820
for the dorm and blackout

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.700
curtains

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.030
for your window.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.200
But.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.440
I know

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.960
you meant well.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.640
But herdsmen's

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.240
jewelry has religious

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.880
and

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.530
cultural meaning.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.890
You risked

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.420
trouble.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:32.960
Bai Ji.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.070
Think of a

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.190
steady job.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.510
Return the money and

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.210
apologize.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.510
Starting this

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.870
month, take 100

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:52.800
from your pay

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.340
for two years

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.380
to repay Repine.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.690
Okay.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.360
Go.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.370
Sent men after

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.930
the necklace buyer.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.980
Outsider.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.050
Don't know where.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.530
How much?

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.420
Let him say it.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.860
300.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.430
Bastard!

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.590
Bastard!

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.340
Enough.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.440
I scolded him.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.530
Stop hitting.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.650
You always hit him.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.330
Why can't I now?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.050
It's

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.050
wrong to hit him.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.480
He deserves it.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:48.700
A cadre's

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.000
child. Doing this

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.290
shames your dad.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.860
I don't.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.910
I'm not Sister.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.990
Just send

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.000
me back where

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.170
you found me.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.120
Nonsense.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.460
Your Dad told me

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.000
since Sister

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.980
couldn't hit you

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.830
since Sister left.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.820
He works away.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.840
Disciplining

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.600
you is my job.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.800
You did wrong,

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.450
I can't face anyone.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.870
Apologize now.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.200
Tashi.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.150
I never hit him.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.400
It's my fault,

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.620
not yours.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.540
He'll understand

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.090
later.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:47.720
Party Secretary.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.270
Lin.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.550
Meeting.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.110
Go.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.130
Ten minutes.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.750
I wanted to quickly share my

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.980
thoughts first.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.550
Sure. Sit.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.160
Look.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.670
Mazhi County has 5

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:04.000
townships, 1 town,

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.160
20 villages,

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.040
and the Bolamula region,

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.310
which covers over 80,000 sq km.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.780
It's comparable in size to Zhejiang

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.460
or Jiangsu.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.640
Yet our GDP barely

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.150
matches

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.540
a

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.000
village.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.240
For years,

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.050
I've thought that

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.400
besides

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.510
nature,

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.790
transport,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:28.840
population,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.800
education

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:31.940
and other objective

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.670
factors,

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.250
the problem is

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.400
the people,

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.490
us cadres.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:39.700
Southern

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.180
Tour talks were years

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.070
ago, yet some

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.120
cadres don't

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.530
get "Development

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.130
is the absolute

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.980
principle."

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.900
Manager Zhao's

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.920
words

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.660
struck me.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.070
He said

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.660
one success story

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.310
is better than ten reports.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.090
Rambling.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.350
You just want

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.220
approval

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.070
for that pilot project, right?

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.440
A thousand-mile

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.360
journey starts with one step.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.280
This first step

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.070
can't wait.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.460
We must take it now.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.070
I recently

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.000
met my

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.570
junior, Huang, in the city.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.310
Remember?

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.180
The Provincial National Management Bureau?

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.110
Yes, him.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.280
Didn't he go

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.330
south to study?

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.240
We discussed

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.720
why the South

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.040
developed so fast.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.110
It's because

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.500
they act decisively on

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.350
what benefits the region and

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.830
people, without debate

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.950
or hesitation.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.250
We can fix problems

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.880
as they arise.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.700
We can

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.260
self-correct.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.290
Comrade Duojie's concerns

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.530
must also be considered.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.790
Secretary Chen.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.550
County Mayor Lin.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.400
All's here.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.090
Got it.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.500
The Central

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.240
Government

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:52.870
set the

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.740
direction.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.770
Maintain "two-handed"

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.720
approach.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.240
Focus on reform and

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.830
opening

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.960
up, crack down on all crime.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.880
Both

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.200
must be firm.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.270
Lin,

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.080
you're

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.420
too good for

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.510
Mazhi County.

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:08.690
Teasing me again.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.330
[The 15th patrol builds a Natural Protection Station]

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.270
Okay.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.380
He.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.000
We

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.240
need a flagpole here.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.530
The

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.040
flag will deter distant

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.610
poachers.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.330
Great.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.590
Make it high.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.120
I'll try.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:54.650
Okay.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:03.090
Have water.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:04.170
Okay, thanks.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.160
The station

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:06.890
plan.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:07.830
See.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.290
These red dots?

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.250
Eight.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.150
It

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.720
factors in Tibetan antelope

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.560
migration,

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:26.680
poacher routes,

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.640
and gold

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.770
hunters' main

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.760
areas.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.850
Also,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.540
travel

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.690
between stations

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.250
must be under half a day,

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.890
so if one is hit

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.810
by a siege

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.960
or extreme

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.640
weather like blizzards,

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.710
and sandstorms,

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.740
others can quickly

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.500
support it

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.500
before failure.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.250
Officer Bai,

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:53.690
can we get

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.750
a helicopter?

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.480
Too costly.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.510
Know the cost?

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.240
This station nearly

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.460
used Chairman

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.460
Ding's 100,000.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.550
Eight?

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.670
Staffing

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.910
aside, construction

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.490
alone would

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.580
scare our

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.830
comrades.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.260
The county urged us

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.590
for this plan.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.370
So the detail is good.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:17.790
Besides,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.610
we don't

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.710
need to rush.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.650
Take our time.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.140
What was that saying?

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.660
What?

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.740
Shao Yunfei.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.290
What was Lu Xun's

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.110
quote about

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.420
tearing down the roof?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.490
Hold on.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.140
High altitude

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.060
slows my brain.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.510
Can you do it?

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.730
How does it go?

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.330
It goes that

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.100
if you say

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.000
this room is too dark

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.170
and needs a window,

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.620
they'll refuse.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.850
But if you propose

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.070
tearing down

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.270
the roof, they will agree

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.940
to the window.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.900
From Lu Xun's

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.460
"The Silent China".

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.320
Right, that's it.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.850
Ask high, bargain

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.960
down later.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.180
I missed that.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.510
Did you?

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.510
Got it.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.660
She means

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.130
building a house here.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.150
Exactly.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.000
Terrible.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.030
This isn't a deal.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.500
We can't bargain.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.790
Never

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:30.940
mind.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.770
Unload.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.530
Go check.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.920
Han.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.740
Call him here.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.600
Okay.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.900
Back.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:49.920
Back.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.900
Okay.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.430
Okay.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:51.790
Okay.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:52.220
Good.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:54.880
Okay.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.980
Lend a hand.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.020
Thanks.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:22:59.640
Okay.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.640
Thanks.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.200
It's so thin.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.280
Is it sturdy?

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.180
Listen to this sound.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.520
It's steel

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:12.620
with a foam core.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.990
Sturdy and insulated.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.590
Oh?

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.250
Yeah.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.320
Don't worry.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.020
Easy.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.200
Done.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:18.780
Give me.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:19.340
Captain.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.270
Where from?

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.310
Baosteel

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.090
brand.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.720
Baosteel?

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.300
Shanghai.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.440
Shanghai rarely sees

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.250
sub-zero temperatures

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.440
Is this

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.440
insulated?

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.800
If it fails,

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.690
we'll burn dung.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.800
I can stand cold.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.480
I can

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.330
stay alone.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.400
Come on.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:44.710
No

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.850
one watches you.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:46.520
Give me.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.220
Seriously?

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:47.910
Give me.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.760
It beats a tent,

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.810
even uninsulated.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:53.780
Easy.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:54.630
Beggars can't

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.660
be choosers.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.210
Okay.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.160
Let go.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:57.800
Go.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.270
Thanks to Reporter Shao.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.540
His mainland

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:01.610
factory contact

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:02.480
got us this

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.310
good

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.480
material cheaply.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.670
Here.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.220
Thank Reporter Shao.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.350
Thanks, Reporter Shao.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.980
It was nothing.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Thanks.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.260
You're welcome.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:14.880
Here.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.080
Here.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.000
80, 90, 100.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:21.670
Count it.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.770
No need. Go.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.640
Okay.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.700
Drive safe.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:31.750
Shao,

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:33.550
you're cultured.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.220
Name

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.140
our first

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.330
station.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.700
I'm not that cultured.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.240
But I think we

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.660
should name the

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.820
station after the

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:48.290
biggest contributor.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.480
I propose

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.140
Duojie Station.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:51.980
Thoughts?

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.810
No.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.810
Don't use my name.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.270
Then, Chairman

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.460
Ding Station.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.290
He funded it.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.380
No him, no station.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.000
Zhacuo.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.620
Chairman Ding's first name?

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.510
No idea.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.150
Why not Shao Yunfei

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:11.810
Station?

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.010
He got the color steel.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:14.890
No him,

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.010
no station.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.750
I agree.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.480
Shao Yunfei Station.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.630
You live here now.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.480
We'll bring

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.590
cow dung monthly.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.180
Just dung,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.260
no food?

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.750
Any left?

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.810
No.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.810
It was the last.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.430
Follow.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:48.230
Go.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.320
No room. Stay.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.590
So much energy.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:13.180
Here.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.150
Hands up, squat.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.240
Mountain Patrol.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.550
Freeze.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.740
Hands up, squat.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.780
Out and squat.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.870
Squat down.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:19.460
Freeze.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:19.830
Down.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.430
Hands up.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.220
Squat.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.060
Move.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.920
No guns, no pelts.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.560
We're for

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:34.170
mines.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.810
Squat.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.230
Squat.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:35.900
Check.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.940
Nothing there.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.170
No guns.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.700
What?

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.220
Down,

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.800
or shoot.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.330
Don't.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.270
I have ID.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.410
I have ID.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.440
Freeze.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.930
Gun down first.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.240
You're explorers?

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.550
Yes.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.020
From

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.420
Chengdu Tengda Mining Company.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:15.850
For

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.820
mineral exploration in Bolamula.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.010
We didn't bring much.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.360
How much do you want?

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.640
Who sent?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.940
Government.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.980
Liar.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.690
I'm Mazhi County's

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.490
Deputy Mayor.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.810
I didn't know.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.600
This is illegal

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.010
mining.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:38.870
It's true.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.720
A cadre

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.680
brought us.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.540
Really.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.660
Where?

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.140
He was just here.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:46.360
The cadre.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.940
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.200
There he is.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.830
There he is.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.820
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.540
[Documents of the People's Government of Mazhi County]

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.250
Pilot project?

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.690
Exactly.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.380
Why this spot?

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.510
You know.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.040
Silver mines here,

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.700
high-grade ore.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:21.870
Then you know

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.900
Gailacuo, two km south, is

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.660
one of four freshwater

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.790
lakes here?

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.620
Every May to July,

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.310
Tibetan antelopes come

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.700
here to give birth.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.610
I didn't know.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.100
How'd you find it?

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.460
Well.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.650
Our exploration

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.270
team did a lot of work.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.310
My notebook

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.250
lost pages.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.130
Lost.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.730
Go find them.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.910
You went in my room.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.000
You took them?

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.740
Don't blame me.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.170
Your room's open.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.250
And

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.160
the government picked

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:03.460
this spot.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.290
Didn't you say the

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:05.850
team

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.850
did a lot of work?

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.840
Zhacuo, stop!

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.180
What?

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.900
Swear on

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.690
the mountain you

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.970
didn't take the note.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.520
Stay for dinner.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.820
Check Comrade Zhu's

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.720
cooking.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.180
Fruit.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.480
- Stop.
- Stop.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.380
Ma'am, please.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.920
Eat.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.140
No need for tea.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.640
It's not great tea.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.440
First time

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:57.130
seeing

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.750
Bai Shao in uniform.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.480
You

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.440
look grown up.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:02.790
She always

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.640
says she hates uniforms.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.960
Who says?

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.640
My Brother

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.450
looks

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.480
best in uniform.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.920
That's true.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.530
Last time

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.880
Bai Chun was back,

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:14.700
he

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.520
reminded me

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.680
of Bai.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.350
Thanks.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.450
My Lin

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.660
loves Bai Chun,

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.770
always

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.840
praising him.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:22.950
Zhang

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.000
raised him well.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.000
Not at all.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.730
Ma'am raised him well.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:30.960
Zhang,

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.460
since you're

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.390
here, speak your mind.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.950
It's not a big deal.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.660
Our hospital

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.780
applied

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.420
for funds.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.680
Hope you could

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:46.610
speed it up.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.440
Hospital

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.570
is a priority.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:50.770
Next

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.650
week,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.070
finance meets downtown

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.880
to finish.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.330
Good.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.490
That eases my mind.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.310
Here.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.550
Uncle Lin.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:06.650
Auntie Zhu.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.570
My Mom came today

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.180
for a favor.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.560
she needs your help.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.740
Is it

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.330
about Bai Ji?

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.590
Lin,

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.110
how did you know?

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.080
Even if

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.180
you hadn't come,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.220
I would.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.510
Bai Ji has grown.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.540
Time for

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.500
a proper job.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.810
No diploma, but he's

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.410
a martyr's child.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.790
By rule,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.270
he gets preference.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.440
I was finding

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.520
him a post.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.240
Thank you.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.860
I thank you for Bai.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.070
Ms. Zhang,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.780
you're too polite.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.400
Making this serious.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:50.640
When you walked in

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.800
with that bottle,

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.230
you startled me.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.990
I worry for Bai Ji.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.160
Nonsense.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.330
We

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.790
watched Bai Ji grow.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.700
Good kid.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:02.590
Very brave.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:03.770
Needs to settle.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.090
Yes.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.610
I noted this.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:06.920
Don't worry.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.090
Uncle Lin.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.870
Sorry for the trouble.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:11.940
No.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.220
trouble.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.110
Have Bai Ji

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.700
bring ID, registration,

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:16.920
and Bai's

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.700
Martyr ID,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.910
then come to me.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:20.960
That's all?

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:22.810
Aside

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.240
from my ties to Bai,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.110
for the martyr lost on

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.900
the plateau,

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:27.710
his child

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.110
deserves care.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.920
Have him see me.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.510
Okay.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.770
But you must agree

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.240
one condition.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.920
Take that.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.830
I can't.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:45.310
Well.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.180
Uncle Lin,

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.290
this isn't

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.530
a thank-you gift.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.130
Our thanks

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.460
can't be put into this.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.440
Just

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.570
consider it

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.170
your niece earning money

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.930
to honor you.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.170
Buying

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.520
lamb is enough.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.740
It's

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.520
fine.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.480
120 over 70.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:06.920
I should've

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.640
brought the monitor.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.420
I was focused on Bai Ji.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.590
Any recent

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.350
heart

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.290
issues?

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.510
Feeling okay recently.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:18.840
Your medicine works.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.690
Worry less. Don't

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.180
get angry.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.850
I can't help worrying.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.940
You're lucky.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.270
Kids are doing well.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.660
Not really.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.800
Bai Ji

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:32.660
worries me sick.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:33.340
I went

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.180
to Lin.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.110
Bai Ji is young.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.250
He'll settle.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.070
I saw Bai Shao yesterday, grew

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.090
fonder of her.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:43.740
After

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.110
she left, I kept talking

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.730
to Lin about her.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.350
If so, take her

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.770
as your daughter.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:52.090
Really?

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.700
I'll take her then.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.720
Jianshe isn't here.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.690
Need anything or anyone

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.040
to run errands,

00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.850
call her.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.960
Okay.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.660
Is Bai Shao seeing anyone?

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:08.699
Before,

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.500
someone pursued her,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.800
but she didn't say.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.260
I pretended not to know.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.360
Look.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.980
Whose letter?

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.800
Take a look.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.880
Jianshe?

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.030
Yes.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.670
Back from the provincial capital tomorrow.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:39.449
I wondered why

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.280
you came

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.300
to my office.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.000
You came for this.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.469
No more talk.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.630
Look at him first.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:48.630
Of course, he looks good.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.900
He's grown so tall.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:52.690
Look at this one.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:53.929
A bit like Lin.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:55.230
Look.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:56.300
Jianshe

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.770
is much more stylish

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:58.950
than young Lin.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.490
Look here.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.130
Basketball match.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.350
He is the Captain.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.480
This is from

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.530
a debate. He was

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.430
first speaker,

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.850
took second

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.140
provincially.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.780
Here he is with teammates.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:17.680
This was last summer.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:30.710
Han.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.080
Over here.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.000
Stop directing,

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:37.260
come help.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.340
Is that okay?

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:44.950
Almost.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.530
Just needed.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.250
Nice writing.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.230
It shows character.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.400
Then it is average

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:12.530
[Bolamula Nature]

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.860
It's not bad.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.280
How is it?

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:23.470
No fever.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.090
Stomach?

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:26.190
It hurts.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:28.580
You

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.820
are too weak to come

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.940
here so soon.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.990
Old issue, I'm fine.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.310
How long?

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.580
Done within

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.390
an hour.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.220
Good. Hurry.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.100
We're leaving today.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.340
Okay.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.030
We didn't fire a shot

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:47.900
in this trip.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.940
That's rare.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.620
Out of water?

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.920
I'll get

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:55.640
hot water.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.460
Shao Yunfei.

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.130
Stop.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.190
Come get water.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.750
Wait, coming.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:17.440
Hurry.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.370
I'll go.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.420
Zhacuo.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.250
Fix it.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.570
I'm sorry.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.300
What?

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.020
I said I'm sorry.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.110
When the Captain fell, I

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.100
drove you away.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.860
It was my fault.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.830
I apologize.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:10.360
Is that it?

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.530
In the Uninhabited Zone, I

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.240
nearly kill Duanzhi.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.050
That's a crime.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.090
I was wrong.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.960
What else?

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.590
And?

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.030
You

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.230
wanted to watch

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.280
Duanzhi alone.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:38.000
I didn't stay

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.050
with you.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.010
I'm mostly to blame

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.490
for their escape.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:44.230
My mistake

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.280
is the biggest.

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:48.290
I was a traitor.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.920
If anyone leaves,

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.270
it's me.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:52.880
Enough.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.900
Stop.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.200
Sound

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.400
like a villain.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.090
Almost.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.840
Actually,

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.920
I owe you an apology.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:09.800
What?

00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:13.530
You weren't the only one

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.090
angry.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.120
I won't mention

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.180
it, neither

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:24.810
should you.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:27.260
Okay.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.040
From now on,

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.210
stay calm at work,

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.540
and be firm

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.340
when needed.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:36.280
Okay?

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:37.880
Okay.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.310
In relationships,

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.230
too.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.010
Stop going off-topic

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.700
when we talk business.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.170
Don't

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.310
mention it again.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:51.940
Hey.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.360
What?

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.220
Is that Danzhou?

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:08.990
No.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.820
Hauling pelts.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.910
Poachers.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.360
Hide.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.280
Hurry.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:18.550
Your uniform.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.760
Hide.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.120
Cover your head.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.180
Cover up.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:46.320
Freshwater?

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.460
Freshwater.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:56.690
Yes

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:57.550
Fresh.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.210
Your wife?

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.330
My Sister.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.430
She has a fever.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:04.570
What here?

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.110
Mining gold.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.960
Didn't get much,

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.770
leaving.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.490
It's freezing.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.260
Can you find gold?

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.820
Hunting's good.

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:17.570
The colder, the

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.240
thicker the wool.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:22.980
Do you hunt sheep?

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.900
Impressive.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.110
How many sheep

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.510
this trip?

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.760
200.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.700
200.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.100
That's a lot.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.580
That truck's huge,

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.730
easy to spot.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.890
Highway 109 has checkpoints.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.660
Someone

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:49.200
picks up here.

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.500
Quick. We must go.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.450
Someone.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:54.960
What?

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.260
What?

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.280
What?

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:57.840
Freeze.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.380
What are you doing?

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.850
Check his back. Cuffs.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.950
What?

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:03.760
What?

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:04.230
Up.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:04.770
What?

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.510
Stand up.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:06.800
Stand up!

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:11.780
I found this.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:33.960
He!

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:39.360
He!

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.760
Let go.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.950
Let go!

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.340
Let go, He!

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:45.860
Let go, quick!

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:52.280
He.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:53.410
You okay?

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:08.990
Bad luck.
