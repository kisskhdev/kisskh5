WEBVTT

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:49.571
{\an8}Fortunately, you have no major injuries.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.491
{\an8}It's just some minor bruising.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.912
{\an8}- This way!
- Okay.

00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:59.956
{\an8}If this had landed just a bit off,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.667
{\an8}it could've been much worse.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.293
{\an8}You really were quite lucky.

00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:11.009
{\an8}Maybe it's because
you were doing a good deed.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.346
{\an8}I guess Heaven was watching over you.

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.306
{\an8}Right, yes.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.432
{\an8}But…

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.186
{\an8}they say the universe has no compassion.

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:25.816
{\an8}You never know
if you'll be this lucky again.

00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:28.819
Pardon?

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:32.406
I'm just saying you should be careful.

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:34.741
I see.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:39.913
Thank you.

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:45.460
Doctor?

00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:47.838
What…

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:52.551
What are you doing? My gosh!

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:54.845
I thought you were in here.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.639
No, I'm just coming back from outside.

00:01:57.723 --> 00:02:00.767
What? But that man just finished
a checkup with you.

00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:02.853
- Si-yeol!
- Where are you going?

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.146
Si-yeol!

00:02:06.982 --> 00:02:08.275
Si-yeol!

00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:13.697
Where is Si-yeol?

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:17.701
You looking for me?

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:22.622
People will think I'm actually dead.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.584
Why are you calling out for me like that?
I'm right here.

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.211
I seriously thought you were dead.

00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:30.130
Were you scared?

00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:34.426
Eun-ho.

00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:37.512
You told me to worry.

00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:40.140
You said I should worry about you!

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.560
I'm really okay, I swear.

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:47.230
Since when do you actually
listen to what I say?

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:01.578
If you had died,
I would've killed you myself!

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.293
You take worrying to a whole new level.

00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:11.588
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:15.717
They said I was lucky.
Just a small scratch here.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.470
You really scared me.

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:21.306
You should've been right there
with me when I woke up.

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.226
Man, that really hurts.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:26.102
Where were you?

00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:29.147
I was getting the test results.

00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:30.565
We're both perfectly fine.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:34.027
Really? That's a relief.

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:38.406
Let's go.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:40.909
Where to?

00:03:40.992 --> 00:03:43.620
Where do you think? Home.

00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:55.924
EPISODE 7
THE REVENGE OF MEMORY

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.275
What's with the mood?

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.987
This is so awkward. Why is he so quiet?

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:49.144
Oh… it's just that

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:53.064
you had a leaf on your head.

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:54.399
I see.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.276
Okay.

00:04:59.404 --> 00:05:02.032
What the hell? What's wrong with me?

00:05:02.115 --> 00:05:04.284
Why am I so self-conscious?

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:07.162
He's just a human kid,
still wet behind the ears.

00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:21.885
Did you always look like this?

00:05:24.804 --> 00:05:25.805
What?

00:05:43.073 --> 00:05:45.700
Watch where you're going.

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.208
What… was that for?

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:56.378
- There was this bike behind you--
- Si-yeol!

00:05:57.837 --> 00:05:58.838
You.

00:06:00.048 --> 00:06:01.841
Don't walk so close to me anymore.

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:05.428
- Why?
- Because…

00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:11.768
Do I really have to spell it out?

00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:15.105
Yes.

00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:16.356
Well…

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:20.568
That's because…

00:06:20.652 --> 00:06:22.195
Hey, check them out.

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:32.747
See? We're getting all these looks
because of you.

00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:36.584
Are you saying that's because of me?

00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:37.669
Of course.

00:06:38.378 --> 00:06:42.757
I feel bad that you ended up
looking like that after saving me,

00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:46.344
but you literally look like a beggar,
minus the tin cup.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.138
A beggar?

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.473
Hey, I almost died back there!

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:53.268
I'm saying that's how bad
you look right now,

00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:56.104
so don't walk so close to me.

00:06:57.772 --> 00:06:59.774
That's not going to make any difference.

00:07:00.525 --> 00:07:01.526
What?

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:06.614
I'm saying you don't look
any better than I do.

00:07:06.698 --> 00:07:09.951
Are you saying I look like that too?

00:07:10.035 --> 00:07:13.079
I wasn't the only one in there.
Obviously, you look just as bad as I do.

00:07:13.163 --> 00:07:15.081
Oh no.

00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:16.750
I barely have any clothes as it is.

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:20.754
I can't exactly walk around downtown
in hiking gear either.

00:07:22.047 --> 00:07:23.631
Given how things are,

00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:26.718
let's go buy some clothes
before we head home.

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:28.428
- Really?
- Sure.

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:30.722
We don't know
how long we'll be stuck like this,

00:07:30.805 --> 00:07:32.390
so you're going to need some clothes.

00:07:32.474 --> 00:07:33.558
Right.

00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:35.769
I was actually thinking about it anyway.

00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:37.228
Then,

00:07:37.812 --> 00:07:40.857
can I grab a few other things
while we're there?

00:07:42.192 --> 00:07:45.070
- Yeah, sure.
- Great, let's go!

00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:01.961
Do you even know
how much all this would cost?

00:08:02.045 --> 00:08:03.838
We got your wallet back.

00:08:03.922 --> 00:08:05.799
Yeah, but still.

00:08:05.882 --> 00:08:08.426
I'm not even sure
about my financial situation.

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:11.304
You said you were buying.
Why are you backing out now?

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:14.474
I meant a few basic T-shirts
and some jeans.

00:08:14.557 --> 00:08:17.644
- Not all this high-end stuff--
- Once we're back, we'll both be rich.

00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:20.522
Don't be cheap. Just swipe the card.

00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:22.565
But…

00:08:29.447 --> 00:08:33.451
This feels more like it.
Why was I acting so weird?

00:08:35.662 --> 00:08:37.747
He's just the same old Si-yeol.

00:08:58.643 --> 00:09:01.646
Silk pajamas? At a time like this?

00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:04.315
Just get a tracksuit
you can wear to the store

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.276
and around the house.

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.862
Don't you know
the importance of sleep quality?

00:09:08.945 --> 00:09:11.114
What if I'm too tired
to do anything right?

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:14.284
Don't you want your life back?

00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:19.914
You're right.
Sleep quality is very important.

00:09:27.505 --> 00:09:29.507
Can't you just use cheap cucumber soap?

00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:30.758
That smells good too.

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:33.386
- What?
- Nothing.

00:09:34.053 --> 00:09:35.847
Why am I even bothering?

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.683
You bought bath bombs
when we don't even own a tub.

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:41.769
Fine, buy all you want.

00:09:41.853 --> 00:09:42.729
There!

00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:48.610
- A phone?
- It's a pain not having one.

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:50.737
Mine's still stuck
at Myohyangsan Mountain.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.656
You don't even have anyone to call.

00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:57.702
I'm going to be calling you.

00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:03.249
Perfect. Let's get this one.

00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:06.753
What? You want to buy this?

00:10:06.836 --> 00:10:09.756
Why do we need
such a giant TV for that tiny house?

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.217
I can't stand small screens.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.428
Haven't you heard?
The bigger the TV, the better.

00:10:16.512 --> 00:10:19.307
How can a nine-tailed fox
be so materialistic?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.936
Like you said, who knows
how long we'll be stuck like this?

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:24.145
Just swipe the card.

00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:37.075
Excuse me, sir.
It says you have insufficient funds.

00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:40.411
See? I told you we're broke.

00:10:40.954 --> 00:10:43.331
Let's just get a refund for everything.

00:10:44.123 --> 00:10:45.792
Hey. Wait!

00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:48.378
Damn it.

00:10:50.713 --> 00:10:53.508
Hey, are you crazy?

00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:54.592
Unbelievable.

00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:01.933
What? Did you say something?

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:07.063
Oh no. Look at that. The tag fell off.

00:11:09.524 --> 00:11:10.483
Hello.

00:11:10.566 --> 00:11:11.985
HYEON WOO-SEOK SIGNING EVENT
ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD

00:11:13.152 --> 00:11:15.071
Thank you. You're so handsome.

00:11:15.154 --> 00:11:16.864
- Can I get a photo?
- Sure.

00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:20.535
- You're so cool.
- One second, please.

00:11:20.618 --> 00:11:22.495
This is for you.

00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:26.207
Thank you.

00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:30.169
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.257
Hi. What's your name?

00:11:42.265 --> 00:11:45.143
What's this? Why do you carry
something like this around?

00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:48.980
Lee Yoon.

00:11:51.816 --> 00:11:53.609
My given name is one syllable.

00:11:53.693 --> 00:11:56.362
Last name Lee, first name Yoon.

00:11:59.032 --> 00:12:01.159
My given name is one syllable.

00:12:01.868 --> 00:12:03.161
Last name Lee,

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:05.788
first name Yoon.

00:12:14.756 --> 00:12:15.923
You.

00:12:19.469 --> 00:12:22.096
So, you remember me?

00:12:22.722 --> 00:12:24.891
That was so long ago.
You must have a good memory.

00:12:24.974 --> 00:12:26.309
You bastard!

00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:29.395
Hey, Woo-seok. Woo-seok!

00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:31.105
Whoa… hey!

00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:34.776
- Damn it!
- Oh my gosh!

00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:37.820
That hurts!

00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:46.287
This is more like it.

00:12:46.371 --> 00:12:48.915
- Unbelievable.
- Home sweet home.

00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:51.084
If you can even call this a home.

00:12:51.793 --> 00:12:53.628
How did I get stuck with someone like her?

00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:57.006
I only bought the essentials.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:01.427
Seriously, what are we going to do
now that we're out of money?

00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:03.054
Do you even have a plan?

00:13:04.764 --> 00:13:06.391
We can always make more money.

00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:08.684
- Who? You?
- Yes, me.

00:13:08.768 --> 00:13:11.938
All you know is soccer.
Do you have any other skills?

00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:13.773
Are you serious?

00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:17.985
I've lived for centuries.
Do you think I've wasted that time?

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:20.738
I've got plenty of skills.

00:13:20.822 --> 00:13:23.991
I'm good at everything I do,
so don't you worry.

00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:26.911
Can I really count on you?

00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:28.121
Of course.

00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:30.957
Ever heard of the term "hobby-rich"?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.043
I've tried every single thing
that looked even remotely fun.

00:13:34.836 --> 00:13:37.880
You probably didn't know,
but I even speak English.

00:13:38.506 --> 00:13:39.841
Wait, you speak English?

00:13:39.924 --> 00:13:42.260
I graduated from Yejeong Academy.

00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:43.803
And that's not all.

00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:47.515
From woodworking and coffee making
to baking and knitting,

00:13:47.598 --> 00:13:49.100
I've learned it all.

00:13:49.851 --> 00:13:52.228
Supporting you would be a piece of cake.

00:13:53.604 --> 00:13:55.565
I really want to believe you.

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:59.110
But I can't for some reason.

00:14:03.114 --> 00:14:07.493
Anyway, even if your fate has changed,
why are you so broke?

00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:11.664
It's insane that one shopping trip
emptied your entire account.

00:14:13.624 --> 00:14:15.042
Yeah, you're right about that.

00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:18.880
I may only be in the fourth division,
but I've still been earning for a while.

00:14:18.963 --> 00:14:22.967
It's not like I have a car
or even a nice house.

00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:27.096
Do I have a separate
savings account somewhere?

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.473
I should look into it.

00:14:28.556 --> 00:14:33.144
Trust me, squeeze someone hard enough,
and they'll come up with the money.

00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:34.312
There's always a way out.

00:14:36.272 --> 00:14:38.232
I should just stop talking to you.

00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:42.111
Anyway, tell me
what the plan is from here.

00:14:42.195 --> 00:14:43.196
What?

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:47.408
Don't tell me you're going to pull
that false kindness stunt again.

00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:50.119
What happened this time
was just a total coincidence,

00:14:50.203 --> 00:14:51.579
so we got to save those kids.

00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:54.165
But we can't rely on flukes like that.

00:14:55.374 --> 00:14:58.503
It wasn't a coincidence. It was fate.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.798
I guess the ones above
actually have a conscience.

00:15:02.882 --> 00:15:05.259
Seeing how they're finally
cooperating with us.

00:15:06.802 --> 00:15:08.513
What are you talking about?

00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:11.349
I'm saying everything is going well,
so stop worrying.

00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:15.478
How many young lives
did we save today?

00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:17.480
It had to be at least ten, right?

00:15:17.563 --> 00:15:19.482
Yeah, I guess so.

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:23.611
The merit of saving just one life
is beyond measure.

00:15:24.278 --> 00:15:27.782
But saving that many children
with their whole lives ahead of them

00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:30.159
on the very first day
we started doing good deeds?

00:15:31.077 --> 00:15:33.871
It means Heaven is determined to help us.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.456
You think so?

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.166
I'm sure of it.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.253
We must have gained
decades' worth of spiritual power today.

00:15:41.003 --> 00:15:44.173
I bet she got the shock of her life
while she was eating her greens

00:15:44.257 --> 00:15:45.967
up on the mountain.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.510
I don't think so.

00:15:47.593 --> 00:15:48.886
- You scared me!
- Jeez!

00:15:49.971 --> 00:15:52.306
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:58.312
It's different when it happens to me.
I'll never get used to this.

00:16:00.314 --> 00:16:03.276
Next time, knock before you come in.

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:06.153
Don't just pop up out of nowhere, okay?

00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:08.322
- Okay.
- Wait.

00:16:08.406 --> 00:16:11.367
What do you mean, you don't think so?

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.787
Right, I just don't think things
are going very well right now.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.290
And I don't think Heaven
is helping you at all.

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:19.292
What?

00:16:28.634 --> 00:16:31.721
We haven't gained
one bit of spiritual power.

00:16:32.513 --> 00:16:34.849
That makes no sense.
Are you sure about that?

00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:40.855
It's exactly the same as yesterday.

00:16:41.355 --> 00:16:43.858
Are you sure you're doing this right?

00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:47.069
Why? What's the problem?

00:16:48.404 --> 00:16:51.532
I don't know what's going on.

00:16:51.616 --> 00:16:52.617
What?

00:16:53.242 --> 00:16:55.036
Something's not right.

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:57.788
I don't know why,
but this shouldn't be happening.

00:16:59.874 --> 00:17:03.377
What do we do now, Si-yeol?

00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:14.055
Man, I can taste blood.

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:18.309
Here.

00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:22.897
Are you okay?
Maybe you should go to the hospital.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.357
I'm fine.

00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:30.237
Hey, apologize to him right now
before things get worse.

00:17:31.364 --> 00:17:34.200
Apologize?
Dad, don't you remember this guy?

00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:36.744
Don't you remember
what happened to my life because…

00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:41.582
What about your life?

00:17:44.752 --> 00:17:46.462
Do you two know each other?

00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:52.051
Well, you could say that.

00:17:53.844 --> 00:17:57.807
It seems we're more
deeply entangled than I thought.

00:17:58.557 --> 00:18:01.560
Seeing how you reacted
to that business card earlier.

00:18:01.644 --> 00:18:03.437
I think we should talk in private.

00:18:04.689 --> 00:18:06.482
Could you give us a moment?

00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:09.777
I really should--

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.278
Dad.

00:18:11.362 --> 00:18:13.155
Just step outside for a minute.

00:18:32.007 --> 00:18:33.259
Jeez.

00:18:33.342 --> 00:18:35.428
If looks could kill, man.

00:18:37.263 --> 00:18:39.849
You've seen this before, haven't you?

00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:42.560
This right here.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.066
Your face tells me everything.

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:55.281
But this is just a fake I whipped up.

00:18:56.782 --> 00:18:58.701
I was just curious to see your reaction.

00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:06.917
What are you trying to say?

00:19:07.001 --> 00:19:08.043
Just that…

00:19:09.462 --> 00:19:11.172
if you're a client
of that nine-tailed fox,

00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:12.673
I have a favor to ask.

00:19:14.258 --> 00:19:15.176
A favor?

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.766
You see, I've had
a bit of a misunderstanding with her.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.061
I can't keep avoiding her forever,
so I want to talk things out.

00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:29.774
I'd like you to act
as a messenger between us.

00:19:30.524 --> 00:19:33.319
Of course, I'll make it worth your while.

00:19:38.908 --> 00:19:40.326
Why on earth would I do that?

00:19:40.409 --> 00:19:44.163
I want to see your life ruined
more than anyone.

00:19:44.872 --> 00:19:46.248
Kang Si-yeol.

00:19:46.916 --> 00:19:48.918
He must be a very close friend of yours.

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:51.212
I mean, think about it.

00:19:51.295 --> 00:19:54.965
I didn't hit you,
and I didn't ruin your life.

00:19:55.049 --> 00:19:59.553
And you're still getting this emotional.
Don't you think that's a bit much?

00:20:00.221 --> 00:20:02.097
Watch your damn mouth.

00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:04.517
You weren't actually doing this for me.

00:20:05.935 --> 00:20:07.019
You just couldn't go back?

00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:13.651
- Are you afraid I might get in the way?
- You tell me.

00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:15.319
I think you're fully capable of that.

00:20:16.779 --> 00:20:18.739
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.620
What are you doing?

00:20:24.703 --> 00:20:25.913
This memory…

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.332
I found a way!

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:29.834
I don't think it's mine.

00:20:30.376 --> 00:20:31.669
Why does this keep happening?

00:20:32.878 --> 00:20:35.130
What memory?

00:20:36.715 --> 00:20:37.883
You just couldn't go back?

00:20:39.426 --> 00:20:41.220
Couldn't go back to what?

00:20:41.303 --> 00:20:43.472
Are you afraid I might get in the way?

00:20:44.223 --> 00:20:46.350
I might get in the way of something?

00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:50.771
Did the nine-tailed fox
mess with your memories?

00:20:52.857 --> 00:20:53.941
Erase it.

00:20:54.024 --> 00:20:55.276
No, wait--

00:20:57.194 --> 00:20:58.237
I think so.

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:00.322
Why?

00:21:00.406 --> 00:21:02.658
You're the client,
and she erased your memory?

00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:10.583
I don't know.

00:21:12.543 --> 00:21:16.463
I think I found something out,
and she thought I'd get in the way.

00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:19.675
You found something out?

00:21:22.928 --> 00:21:24.847
You mean like a weakness?

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.348
I don't know. I can't remember!

00:21:26.432 --> 00:21:27.933
Okay, I get it. Calm down.

00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:30.227
Then, if I help you recover
those memories,

00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:33.272
will you tell me
what it was you found out?

00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:41.989
I happen to know someone
who can help with this.

00:21:44.033 --> 00:21:45.576
I'm really curious.

00:21:46.118 --> 00:21:49.914
What did you find out that she had to

00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:52.374
go as far as erasing your memories?

00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:09.892
What if I stay human
and just die of old age?

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.937
Why isn't the power building up?

00:22:17.107 --> 00:22:19.610
I've been thinking.

00:22:19.693 --> 00:22:20.819
Yeah?

00:22:21.528 --> 00:22:23.280
Maybe…

00:22:25.074 --> 00:22:26.784
…the problem is your attitude.

00:22:28.577 --> 00:22:29.662
What?

00:22:29.745 --> 00:22:31.705
Think about it.

00:22:32.247 --> 00:22:33.666
Going by what you said,

00:22:33.749 --> 00:22:36.794
you must do good deeds
to gain spiritual power.

00:22:36.877 --> 00:22:40.005
But you tried to wait for someone to jump
so you could save them.

00:22:40.089 --> 00:22:41.507
You also tried to start a fire.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.886
That kind of thinking shouldn't be
the basis for doing good deeds.

00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:55.229
You're starting to sound
just as picky and petty as the ones above,

00:22:55.312 --> 00:22:57.731
but this is different.

00:22:57.815 --> 00:23:00.526
We saved children
who were in actual danger.

00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:02.569
Well, in hindsight, sure.

00:23:02.653 --> 00:23:05.698
But I'm saying your mindset
was wrong from the start.

00:23:05.781 --> 00:23:08.075
So what's your point?

00:23:12.162 --> 00:23:13.580
For starters,

00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:17.418
how about we try
doing good deeds by the book?

00:23:18.752 --> 00:23:20.295
Do you know how long that will take?

00:23:20.379 --> 00:23:22.631
It could take a hundred,
even two hundred years.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.802
Yet you expect me to waste my time
picking up trash in some neighborhood?

00:23:26.885 --> 00:23:28.470
That's not what I meant,

00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:31.265
but we need to find out for sure

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.810
whether doing good deeds
actually builds spiritual power or not

00:23:34.893 --> 00:23:38.105
and if you can really
build up that power for her.

00:23:38.188 --> 00:23:39.440
Once we confirm that,

00:23:39.523 --> 00:23:42.151
then we can find another way,
be it fake or not.

00:23:42.234 --> 00:23:44.236
Doesn't that make sense to you?

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.363
I guess.

00:23:46.947 --> 00:23:49.283
Something undeniable.

00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:54.038
Something we can do
sincerely without cutting corners.

00:23:54.121 --> 00:23:55.914
You know, that kind of good deed.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.333
Like volunteer work, for example.

00:23:59.793 --> 00:24:01.336
Volunteer work?

00:24:03.756 --> 00:24:05.507
What would be good?

00:24:08.677 --> 00:24:10.971
Right, something like that.

00:24:16.282 --> 00:24:21.148
FOREVER CARE NURSING HOME

00:24:24.485 --> 00:24:27.071
Are you here to do some volunteer work?

00:24:27.946 --> 00:24:30.365
What, do you think I'm here
to be looked after?

00:24:30.949 --> 00:24:32.534
There's that attitude again. Watch it!

00:24:34.536 --> 00:24:36.371
What kind of volunteer work are you--

00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:39.249
You know, the hard stuff.

00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:41.168
Ideally, something physical.

00:24:41.752 --> 00:24:43.545
Hi, it's been a while.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.965
I'm sorry, do I know you?

00:24:47.466 --> 00:24:49.510
Please come this way.

00:24:50.135 --> 00:24:51.720
Do you know her?

00:24:52.387 --> 00:24:54.306
No, I've never seen her before.

00:24:55.557 --> 00:24:57.142
Whatever, let's just go.

00:25:13.325 --> 00:25:17.412
It's just cloth, for crying out loud!
How is it so heavy?

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.624
Because it's wet.

00:25:20.707 --> 00:25:22.084
I know that.

00:25:22.167 --> 00:25:24.336
Stop complaining
and put some effort into it.

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:27.256
That's the only way
all this work will mean anything.

00:25:29.591 --> 00:25:30.634
Here.

00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:32.845
Hey, wait.

00:25:36.056 --> 00:25:38.934
So? Do you feel
the spiritual power building up?

00:25:39.518 --> 00:25:40.727
I don't know.

00:25:41.979 --> 00:25:46.316
What if I work myself to the bone
and leave empty-handed again?

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.318
Let's just wait and see.

00:25:49.361 --> 00:25:52.072
Try to have a better attitude, okay?

00:25:52.156 --> 00:25:54.032
I'm trying.

00:25:55.534 --> 00:25:59.371
Why are these clothes so uncomfortable?

00:25:59.454 --> 00:26:02.833
For how expensive they are,
they're more trouble than they're worth.

00:26:04.126 --> 00:26:06.003
It's not the clothes' fault.

00:26:06.753 --> 00:26:09.381
Who wears something like that
to a place like this?

00:26:10.716 --> 00:26:13.677
It's because
I only have clothes like these.

00:26:15.929 --> 00:26:17.472
I have a lot to say about that,

00:26:17.556 --> 00:26:20.559
but it won't do any good,
so I'll just keep it to myself.

00:26:38.327 --> 00:26:42.664
Still, in this day and age,
at least we have these machines.

00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:46.376
You wouldn't know, but back in the day,

00:26:46.877 --> 00:26:51.006
we washed laundry at the creek
and dried it in the sun.

00:26:51.089 --> 00:26:52.466
That's how everyone lived.

00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:55.219
So many years lived,

00:26:55.302 --> 00:26:59.056
yet still so immature, Ms. Kim Ok-sun.

00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:00.849
What?

00:27:01.642 --> 00:27:02.851
Nothing.

00:27:02.935 --> 00:27:05.520
Anyway, you should appreciate
how easy life is now.

00:27:05.604 --> 00:27:08.607
If I had to wash and dry these
like the old days,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.318
there's no way
you could've made me do this.

00:27:17.282 --> 00:27:19.159
What's wrong all of a sudden?

00:27:36.843 --> 00:27:39.388
Talk about terrible timing.

00:27:39.471 --> 00:27:42.057
Why did the dryer have to break
today of all days,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.476
when I'm working here?

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:46.812
Better than the washer breaking,
don't you think?

00:27:46.895 --> 00:27:48.522
Man, if that had happened,

00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:50.899
we'd be in one of those red tubs
like in some drama,

00:27:50.983 --> 00:27:53.151
stomping on blankets together.

00:27:56.863 --> 00:28:00.367
What, do you want to get in the tub
with me or something?

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.451
What?

00:28:01.535 --> 00:28:04.830
I thought you were doing that again.
You know, flirting.

00:28:06.248 --> 00:28:09.584
Jeez, where do you learn
all this weird stuff?

00:28:09.668 --> 00:28:11.837
Stop describing everything as flirting.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.382
No need to be so serious.
Just help me shake out this blanket.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.152
How are those humans
still so into each other

00:28:35.235 --> 00:28:37.195
when they're already so old?

00:28:38.405 --> 00:28:40.699
They look happy together.

00:28:41.658 --> 00:28:44.619
What's it like?
That "dating" thing humans do.

00:28:46.038 --> 00:28:47.247
What?

00:28:47.331 --> 00:28:50.250
Don't tell me
you've never dated anyone either?

00:28:50.876 --> 00:28:52.878
Don't be ridiculous.

00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:56.006
I'm Kang Si-yeol.
Do you think that'd even be possible?

00:28:56.089 --> 00:28:58.550
I didn't ask who you were.

00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:00.552
What I'm wondering is

00:29:00.635 --> 00:29:04.306
how someone can love
another person for that long?

00:29:05.682 --> 00:29:07.893
No matter how great a human is,

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.772
you can always find flaws.

00:29:11.855 --> 00:29:14.608
You're also bound to get tired
of each other eventually.

00:29:16.443 --> 00:29:17.903
I wouldn't know.

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:22.532
I've never really dated anyone
for that long, actually.

00:29:22.616 --> 00:29:25.952
See? I told you humans get boring.

00:29:26.036 --> 00:29:27.371
No, that's not it.

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:33.710
You might find this very hard to believe,

00:29:33.794 --> 00:29:37.631
but I'm always the one
who gets dumped.

00:29:39.174 --> 00:29:40.217
What?

00:29:40.717 --> 00:29:43.220
After all that bragging?

00:29:44.137 --> 00:29:45.222
Why?

00:29:45.305 --> 00:29:48.892
I don't know. It's always the same reason.

00:29:48.975 --> 00:29:51.937
They ask how I can
prioritize soccer over them.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.564
But what can I do?
I'm a professional athlete.

00:29:54.648 --> 00:29:56.191
Soccer has to come first.

00:29:56.817 --> 00:30:00.320
Oh, forget it.
I'm the idiot for even asking you.

00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:17.212
But you said you've done everything
in the human world.

00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:19.756
How come you've never dated?

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:21.925
Because I knew a fox

00:30:22.008 --> 00:30:24.970
who totally ruined her life
by falling in love with a human.

00:30:28.014 --> 00:30:29.975
I made myself a promise after seeing that.

00:30:30.058 --> 00:30:32.894
I'll never love a human,

00:30:32.978 --> 00:30:34.896
and I'll never become one.

00:30:35.814 --> 00:30:38.108
I vowed to never live like her.

00:30:41.695 --> 00:30:44.489
Not that any of that matters.
Look at me now.

00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:56.251
Oh, that's cold.

00:30:57.127 --> 00:30:58.128
What was that for?

00:30:59.004 --> 00:31:00.297
Don't act like it's all over.

00:31:01.923 --> 00:31:03.758
I mean, the game isn't over yet.

00:31:03.842 --> 00:31:06.261
Even if you're down two goals
in the first half,

00:31:06.344 --> 00:31:09.139
you just have to score three
in the second half to win.

00:31:09.764 --> 00:31:11.641
We may be struggling right now,

00:31:11.725 --> 00:31:14.978
but we'll find a way
and get back to how we were.

00:31:17.689 --> 00:31:18.940
I never said we wouldn't.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.694
I'm just saying because you look so down.

00:31:23.528 --> 00:31:25.947
Come on.
Let's finish hanging these blankets.

00:31:37.167 --> 00:31:38.710
What was that for?

00:31:38.793 --> 00:31:41.922
I'm older than you.
Don't try to lecture me.

00:31:42.005 --> 00:31:44.299
I'm not lecturing you. Stop it!

00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:46.009
- Stop what?
- Stop!

00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:47.302
I'm serious!

00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:51.181
Hey, you're getting the blankets wet!

00:31:51.264 --> 00:31:52.849
So stay right there!

00:31:55.352 --> 00:31:56.520
Wait!

00:32:21.586 --> 00:32:24.047
Damn, what is…

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.800
What's with this place?

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:28.677
Is this really

00:32:29.594 --> 00:32:31.555
Jang Do-cheol's house?

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.139
Yes, sir.

00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:36.685
How can anyone live in a place like this?

00:32:36.768 --> 00:32:37.978
This place is creepy.

00:32:39.604 --> 00:32:44.150
- Are you sure this is the right place?
- This is the last address on record, sir.

00:32:44.693 --> 00:32:47.112
He doesn't really leave any traces behind.

00:32:47.195 --> 00:32:49.281
What about his number?
Doesn't he have a phone?

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.533
No, sir.

00:32:52.325 --> 00:32:56.705
Seriously, where the hell is he hiding?

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.666
I finally found a lead, and now this.

00:33:04.588 --> 00:33:06.172
Hey, wait for me!

00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:24.774
Unbelievable.

00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:28.987
Does anyone
in the neighborhood know anything?

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.864
Well, I asked around.

00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:33.658
Apparently, he moved here
about ten years ago

00:33:33.742 --> 00:33:36.328
and lived with his family for a while.

00:33:37.412 --> 00:33:39.039
Family?

00:33:39.706 --> 00:33:41.249
He had a family?

00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:46.504
Yes, but apparently
not long after they moved in,

00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:49.591
his wife and daughter both died.

00:33:49.674 --> 00:33:50.884
From what I heard,

00:33:52.052 --> 00:33:53.678
they met a horrific end.

00:33:57.766 --> 00:33:58.933
Really?

00:33:59.017 --> 00:34:01.019
According to the neighbors,

00:34:01.102 --> 00:34:03.647
his whole family was cursed

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:08.777
because he tried to refuse
the shamanic calling.

00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:12.238
Anyway, they said
he's been a bit crazy ever since.

00:34:13.573 --> 00:34:16.743
What was that? What is it?

00:34:18.995 --> 00:34:22.624
Damn you. Seriously.

00:34:22.707 --> 00:34:24.459
Forget that crap.

00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:26.711
Just find out where that bastard is.

00:34:27.337 --> 00:34:28.880
I need him right now.

00:34:30.799 --> 00:34:33.093
- Let's get out of here.
- Mr. Lee.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.222
My goodness! What happened?

00:34:37.305 --> 00:34:39.099
I'm sorry.

00:34:39.182 --> 00:34:42.310
I told you to dry the laundry,
not soak it all over again.

00:34:42.977 --> 00:34:44.479
What am I supposed to do now?

00:34:45.188 --> 00:34:47.607
It's sunny out. It'll dry in no time.

00:34:48.274 --> 00:34:49.859
- Hey!
- What?

00:34:51.986 --> 00:34:54.114
Anyway, good job today.

00:34:54.197 --> 00:34:56.408
Go get something to eat. Unbelievable.

00:34:56.491 --> 00:34:59.577
Okay. I'm so sorry.

00:35:01.663 --> 00:35:04.374
Man, I told you to stop messing around.

00:35:04.457 --> 00:35:06.459
Who told you to hide behind the blankets?

00:35:06.543 --> 00:35:08.795
I didn't think
you'd spray water there too.

00:35:08.878 --> 00:35:11.464
Whatever. I'm starving, so let's go eat.

00:35:11.548 --> 00:35:13.717
Hold on a second.

00:35:30.191 --> 00:35:32.610
Have I gone crazy since becoming human?

00:35:35.947 --> 00:35:38.658
I thought I was fine.
Why is this happening again?

00:35:39.701 --> 00:35:43.163
What do you think you're doing?

00:35:43.246 --> 00:35:44.998
I can't go eat like this.

00:35:45.707 --> 00:35:48.543
There's too much water to just shake off.

00:36:16.613 --> 00:36:19.157
Wait, what's with my body?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.158
What?

00:36:20.742 --> 00:36:23.119
My body wasn't like this before.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.289
How badly did I take care of myself?

00:36:26.372 --> 00:36:28.249
Did I not work out properly?

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:31.252
Why? It looks good.

00:36:33.338 --> 00:36:34.255
What?

00:36:34.339 --> 00:36:35.256
Nothing.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.968
Just put your shirt back on.
Have some decency.

00:36:39.052 --> 00:36:41.721
Wait. Let me just wring out the water.

00:36:41.805 --> 00:36:43.431
I said put it back on already!

00:36:43.515 --> 00:36:46.476
- What's wrong with you?
- Put it on!

00:37:00.615 --> 00:37:01.699
Si-yeol?

00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:16.464
What… was he doing?

00:37:16.548 --> 00:37:20.677
Me? I didn't do anything!

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.512
Si-yeol, we're in a nursing home.

00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:24.931
Are you crazy?
There are old people everywhere!

00:37:25.014 --> 00:37:29.394
I know how this might look,
but it's not like that.

00:37:29.477 --> 00:37:31.896
See? I told you to put your shirt back on!

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.607
How shameless could you be,
stripping down in public?

00:37:35.358 --> 00:37:38.194
Don't you guys get any ideas.
It's not like that!

00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:54.460
Hey, what are you guys looking at?

00:37:55.587 --> 00:37:58.089
Come on. Aren't you going to introduce us?

00:37:58.172 --> 00:38:00.216
What do you mean?

00:38:05.054 --> 00:38:06.598
Fine, whatever.

00:38:06.681 --> 00:38:07.724
She's my girlfriend.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:09.851
What?

00:38:12.061 --> 00:38:13.438
What?

00:38:13.521 --> 00:38:15.064
How else should I explain it to them?

00:38:15.148 --> 00:38:17.400
They barge into my house all the time.

00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:19.277
We live together, remember?

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.404
- You live together?
- Since when?

00:38:21.487 --> 00:38:24.490
I guess it won't be for long anyway.

00:38:25.116 --> 00:38:26.993
Pardon? What does that mean?

00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:28.703
What won't be for long?

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:30.955
Si-yeol, are you getting married?

00:38:33.249 --> 00:38:34.500
What?

00:38:34.584 --> 00:38:37.837
Please. Nobody's getting married.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:41.799
Are you?

00:38:43.134 --> 00:38:45.553
Sure, we're getting married too.

00:38:45.637 --> 00:38:48.014
That's taking it too far.

00:38:48.097 --> 00:38:50.016
That's too far?

00:38:50.642 --> 00:38:53.144
- Just eat your food.
- I didn't know.

00:38:53.227 --> 00:38:55.813
You jerk. I didn't know you had it in you!

00:38:55.897 --> 00:38:58.191
You're the worst, Si-yeol.

00:38:58.274 --> 00:39:00.777
Anyway, what are you guys doing here?

00:39:01.611 --> 00:39:03.613
What are you talking about?

00:39:03.696 --> 00:39:05.657
They're our team's main sponsor.

00:39:06.157 --> 00:39:08.993
You know we come here regularly.

00:39:09.077 --> 00:39:11.329
As part of our required community service.

00:39:12.372 --> 00:39:13.957
- I see.
- But today,

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.001
they said someone already did
all the heavy lifting.

00:39:17.085 --> 00:39:18.711
So there's not much for us to do.

00:39:18.795 --> 00:39:20.838
It just worked out that way.

00:39:20.922 --> 00:39:24.801
Wait. Was it you
who did all the heavy lifting?

00:39:26.052 --> 00:39:28.096
You didn't come to see your grandma?

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.099
Grandma? Which grandma?

00:39:32.392 --> 00:39:33.935
Your grandmother.

00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:36.020
Your own grandmother.

00:39:36.104 --> 00:39:37.313
What?

00:39:37.397 --> 00:39:39.065
My grandma who passed away?

00:39:45.989 --> 00:39:47.323
- What?
- Wait.

00:39:47.991 --> 00:39:49.659
Who passed away?

00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:51.244
My grandma.

00:39:52.412 --> 00:39:53.454
What?

00:39:54.664 --> 00:39:55.873
What?

00:40:00.545 --> 00:40:01.713
There!

00:40:02.672 --> 00:40:05.425
Now, what do we have here?

00:40:07.051 --> 00:40:08.428
There we go!

00:40:10.722 --> 00:40:13.891
Man, I'm on a roll!
The cards are just going my way.

00:40:13.975 --> 00:40:16.686
You're good at this, Coach.

00:40:17.562 --> 00:40:21.190
I came by to give you some pocket money
since it's been a while,

00:40:21.274 --> 00:40:23.359
but my luck just won't let me.

00:40:24.318 --> 00:40:25.862
Should I go easy on you?

00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:28.698
Now, that wouldn't be right.

00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:30.324
- There.
- Look at that!

00:40:32.952 --> 00:40:34.203
Let's see.

00:40:35.788 --> 00:40:37.749
Here.

00:40:39.208 --> 00:40:40.543
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

00:40:46.716 --> 00:40:48.968
- Oh my.
- You brat.

00:40:49.052 --> 00:40:50.970
Don't just stand there. Come on in.

00:40:52.889 --> 00:40:53.806
Grandma?

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:56.017
Look who's here. My grandson.

00:41:07.236 --> 00:41:08.321
Go on.

00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:27.632
It really is my grandma.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:30.635
What's wrong?

00:41:32.428 --> 00:41:33.679
Did something happen?

00:41:35.389 --> 00:41:36.474
Tell me.

00:41:40.561 --> 00:41:41.729
Oh my.

00:41:54.242 --> 00:41:55.535
Grandma.

00:41:55.618 --> 00:41:56.911
There, there.

00:42:27.984 --> 00:42:30.611
I don't drink stuff like this.

00:42:31.154 --> 00:42:32.947
Just hold on to it then.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.283
I just didn't want to drink alone.

00:42:45.751 --> 00:42:48.212
What are you doing, scaring her like that?

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.464
I just…

00:42:51.799 --> 00:42:52.717
It's just that--

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.635
If it's about her nursing home bills…

00:42:57.638 --> 00:43:00.099
I kept your name
on the team roster for now.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:05.646
So the team sponsor's hospital discount

00:43:06.272 --> 00:43:09.233
should still be good for a while.

00:43:11.235 --> 00:43:12.904
Just so you know.

00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:21.746
Don't you dare get the wrong idea.

00:43:22.538 --> 00:43:25.583
It's not like I'm sitting around
waiting for you to come back.

00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:27.460
It's just because of your grandma.

00:43:27.543 --> 00:43:29.670
I'm only doing this for her sake.

00:43:30.922 --> 00:43:33.549
You're full of surprises.

00:43:35.509 --> 00:43:37.845
I thought you hated me

00:43:38.512 --> 00:43:39.931
ever since I was young.

00:43:40.014 --> 00:43:41.557
I do hate you, you punk.

00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:45.478
I haven't liked you since you were a kid,
not even a little,

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:47.772
and nothing's changed.

00:43:50.358 --> 00:43:52.068
Guess we feel the same way then.

00:43:53.194 --> 00:43:55.363
Jeez, this little brat.

00:44:02.411 --> 00:44:04.956
This actually tastes good
after all this time.

00:44:16.217 --> 00:44:17.385
Grandma.

00:44:18.719 --> 00:44:21.514
Is it getting harder for you
to move around?

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.976
That's just part of getting old.

00:44:25.726 --> 00:44:29.563
It's actually easier here
since they take care of everything for me.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.775
Nothing else is bothering you?

00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:34.652
No, I'm fine.

00:44:40.116 --> 00:44:43.828
Is something not working out
the way you wanted?

00:44:44.537 --> 00:44:45.830
What?

00:44:45.913 --> 00:44:49.375
It's okay not to try so hard.

00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:52.962
It's not okay, Grandma.

00:44:53.045 --> 00:44:55.881
I'm barely scraping by
in the fourth division.

00:44:56.507 --> 00:44:58.175
Sometimes life is like that.

00:44:59.218 --> 00:45:02.722
Things don't always go
the way you want them to.

00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:05.808
You're right.

00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:10.104
Life really doesn't go
the way you want it to.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.440
What's wrong now?

00:45:13.107 --> 00:45:17.194
In my original life and in this one,

00:45:18.738 --> 00:45:21.324
I can't seem to give you
the life you deserve.

00:45:22.366 --> 00:45:24.994
- Stop that.
- But it's true.

00:45:25.077 --> 00:45:27.288
When I had money, you weren't around.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:29.290
And looking at my life now,

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:32.918
I probably haven't even been able
to take you on a trip abroad.

00:45:33.002 --> 00:45:37.089
I don't care about any of that.

00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:42.053
All the other grandmothers here
are actually envious of me.

00:45:43.596 --> 00:45:46.140
Why? What are they envious of?

00:45:47.141 --> 00:45:50.770
They're envious because my grandson
is so sweet and visits often.

00:45:50.853 --> 00:45:53.606
And besides, I tell them

00:45:53.689 --> 00:45:57.401
that my grandson has taken me
to every corner of the country.

00:45:57.485 --> 00:46:01.864
When I show them the pictures,
they get so jealous.

00:46:03.366 --> 00:46:06.494
I… did that?

00:46:06.577 --> 00:46:07.787
Of course.

00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:10.998
You took me to see the flowers
when they bloomed,

00:46:11.082 --> 00:46:14.502
to the water when it got hot,

00:46:14.585 --> 00:46:18.422
and to the mountains to see
the vibrant autumn leaves.

00:46:18.506 --> 00:46:20.132
Then, when it got cold,

00:46:21.133 --> 00:46:23.010
you took me to the hot springs.

00:46:24.095 --> 00:46:25.679
Here, look at this.

00:46:26.555 --> 00:46:29.558
This was when we went to Yeosu.

00:46:30.393 --> 00:46:31.644
MYEONGDONG DAK-GALBI ALLEY

00:46:31.727 --> 00:46:36.315
And this was when we went to Chuncheon
for some dak-galbi. Goodness.

00:46:36.399 --> 00:46:41.070
You wandered off,
and I looked everywhere for you.

00:46:41.153 --> 00:46:44.657
And this was when we went to Pocheon.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.245
You remember the prehistoric site
with the cavemen doing this?

00:46:49.328 --> 00:46:50.955
We did that together.

00:47:06.762 --> 00:47:09.598
He's a grown man.
Why was he crying like that?

00:47:09.682 --> 00:47:11.350
He startled me.

00:47:17.565 --> 00:47:18.983
Gosh, you scared me!

00:47:21.068 --> 00:47:23.404
- It's you, right?
- What?

00:47:23.904 --> 00:47:25.906
It is you.

00:47:26.449 --> 00:47:28.659
I know everything.

00:47:29.368 --> 00:47:31.871
I know this is all your fault!

00:47:31.954 --> 00:47:33.456
What?

00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:41.213
Die, die, die!

00:47:41.297 --> 00:47:42.631
Sir, what are you doing?

00:47:42.715 --> 00:47:44.091
Get off me!

00:48:11.202 --> 00:48:12.661
I am so sorry.

00:48:12.745 --> 00:48:14.997
I'm truly sorry.

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.583
Are you all right?

00:48:18.542 --> 00:48:20.252
As you can see, I'm not dead.

00:48:20.336 --> 00:48:22.254
Though he nearly killed me.

00:48:22.338 --> 00:48:23.797
You must've been so scared.

00:48:23.881 --> 00:48:25.883
That's not the issue here.

00:48:25.966 --> 00:48:27.676
She could've been seriously hurt!

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.430
I'm so sorry.

00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:36.227
But why did he attack her all of a sudden?

00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:38.729
That looks painful.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.023
Sir.

00:48:42.316 --> 00:48:44.068
Why on earth did you do that?

00:48:47.112 --> 00:48:48.239
What?

00:48:50.324 --> 00:48:53.160
Me? What did I do?

00:48:54.703 --> 00:48:55.871
Never mind.

00:48:56.622 --> 00:48:58.457
He's usually such a gentle man.

00:48:59.166 --> 00:49:03.587
Well, my father-in-law
isn't as stable as he used to be.

00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:06.924
He's been showing symptoms
of dementia for a few years.

00:49:07.007 --> 00:49:08.759
He doesn't even recognize us.

00:49:09.426 --> 00:49:10.719
I see.

00:49:10.803 --> 00:49:14.139
But nothing like this
has ever happened before.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.849
I'm so sorry.

00:49:17.977 --> 00:49:22.189
I'm Hwang Dong-sik's son.

00:49:23.107 --> 00:49:25.693
I'm sorry for being late.
I only just heard the news.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.404
Hwang Dong-sik?

00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:31.323
I'm very sorry about my father.

00:49:33.617 --> 00:49:35.327
Are you badly hurt?

00:49:36.662 --> 00:49:39.873
Your face looks so familiar.

00:49:44.628 --> 00:49:46.839
THIRTY YEARS AGO

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:58.434
Hey.

00:50:05.149 --> 00:50:08.068
I think I remember now.

00:50:09.445 --> 00:50:11.905
You look just like
that old man did back then.

00:50:19.538 --> 00:50:21.206
Forget it. You can leave now.

00:50:21.957 --> 00:50:24.209
- Still--
- Didn't you come to apologize?

00:50:24.293 --> 00:50:26.420
You apologized, and I accepted it.

00:50:26.503 --> 00:50:27.504
So we're done.

00:50:28.255 --> 00:50:30.466
Si-yeol, I'm tired. Let's go home.

00:50:31.592 --> 00:50:33.010
Okay.

00:51:07.711 --> 00:51:08.962
Is she okay?

00:51:10.631 --> 00:51:12.883
Why is she in such a foul mood?

00:51:22.893 --> 00:51:23.811
KANG SI-YEOL'S ACCOUNT

00:51:23.894 --> 00:51:25.104
For crying out loud.

00:51:25.979 --> 00:51:29.692
I'm flat broke.
Is this really all I have left?

00:51:31.235 --> 00:51:34.780
I can barely survive a month with this.

00:51:45.374 --> 00:51:47.209
This is so frustrating.

00:52:08.021 --> 00:52:10.023
What's that smell?

00:52:22.828 --> 00:52:24.079
What are you doing?

00:52:24.872 --> 00:52:26.373
Oh, hey.

00:52:27.082 --> 00:52:28.834
Just wait a bit. It's almost ready.

00:52:38.719 --> 00:52:41.805
Why did you get pork shoulder?
I prefer pork belly.

00:52:41.889 --> 00:52:44.808
Just eat what you're given.

00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:52.983
What? Why is this so good?

00:52:53.609 --> 00:52:55.027
Is it good?

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.655
It's been a while since I cooked,
so I wasn't sure about the taste.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.200
Not bad.

00:53:01.742 --> 00:53:05.662
Since you had money, I thought
you'd just have people cook for you.

00:53:07.122 --> 00:53:11.418
You really do have a knack
for backhanded compliments.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.053
You've been sighing since yesterday
about having no money.

00:53:21.136 --> 00:53:22.554
Why the sudden feast?

00:53:22.638 --> 00:53:25.557
Well, I've always wanted to try

00:53:26.225 --> 00:53:29.102
grilled meat with soju.

00:53:33.857 --> 00:53:35.526
Plus, you seemed a bit down.

00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:37.277
Me?

00:53:40.322 --> 00:53:41.406
That's right.

00:53:41.907 --> 00:53:43.158
Now that you mention it,

00:53:43.242 --> 00:53:46.370
I think my mood is actually pretty rotten.

00:53:46.453 --> 00:53:51.250
Is it related to the ones above again?

00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:52.918
Yes.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.721
Man, those guys.

00:54:05.222 --> 00:54:07.683
If they have something to say,
they should just say it clearly.

00:54:07.766 --> 00:54:11.103
Why are they always sending
such cryptic signals?

00:54:12.104 --> 00:54:13.188
Actually,

00:54:14.398 --> 00:54:16.525
the message was fairly clear this time.

00:54:17.943 --> 00:54:18.861
Really?

00:54:20.487 --> 00:54:21.572
What's the message?

00:54:22.239 --> 00:54:24.116
That I've lived my life wrong.

00:54:25.909 --> 00:54:29.913
I think that old man earlier
was a client of mine.

00:54:29.997 --> 00:54:30.998
His face looked familiar.

00:54:31.832 --> 00:54:32.708
A client?

00:54:32.791 --> 00:54:37.212
What did you do to him
to make him act like that toward you?

00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:41.008
Who knows? I've had plenty
of clients just pass through.

00:54:41.091 --> 00:54:43.635
It's not like I remember
every single one of their stories.

00:54:43.719 --> 00:54:47.306
But I'm sure he has a reason
to hold a grudge against me.

00:54:48.015 --> 00:54:49.099
I see.

00:54:50.475 --> 00:54:54.813
Having been through it myself,
I'm not exactly surprised.

00:54:56.982 --> 00:54:58.108
What?

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.695
So, is that why you've been
feeling so low?

00:55:04.865 --> 00:55:06.241
When I first became human,

00:55:07.492 --> 00:55:11.413
I wondered why my reward
for good deeds was a life like this.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.044
But I guess this is
just their way of punishing me.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:21.006
They forced me to become human
when I never wanted to,

00:55:21.089 --> 00:55:23.759
shoved past misdeeds
I don't even remember right in my face,

00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:26.553
and now they probably want me
to reflect on them.

00:55:32.351 --> 00:55:34.186
I am sorry about all this.

00:55:34.895 --> 00:55:36.355
You're getting punished along with me,

00:55:36.438 --> 00:55:38.065
even though I caused this mess.

00:55:41.526 --> 00:55:42.736
I don't know about that.

00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:46.156
I don't see it that way at all.

00:55:49.701 --> 00:55:50.911
What?

00:55:50.994 --> 00:55:54.790
The anniversary of my grandma's death
was a few days ago.

00:55:55.832 --> 00:55:56.875
I see.

00:55:58.877 --> 00:55:59.962
You know,

00:56:00.545 --> 00:56:05.884
I always used to say
that I'd spoil her when I made it big.

00:56:07.761 --> 00:56:11.014
But she collapsed
during my first season in Europe.

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.020
She was all alone,

00:56:17.104 --> 00:56:19.856
so by the time she was found,
she was already gone.

00:56:29.449 --> 00:56:32.953
When you made this switch happen,

00:56:34.746 --> 00:56:38.166
I thought that everything
that was precious and important to me

00:56:39.292 --> 00:56:41.628
had vanished.

00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:45.215
I was wrong, though.

00:56:47.843 --> 00:56:49.302
What I'm saying is…

00:56:51.388 --> 00:56:54.391
you don't have to feel so sorry for me.

00:56:54.933 --> 00:56:56.977
I don't feel like I'm being punished.

00:57:03.108 --> 00:57:05.444
We're going to go back
to the way things were anyway.

00:57:06.278 --> 00:57:10.532
So once all of this is over and behind us,

00:57:11.158 --> 00:57:14.870
I think I'll remember this moment
like a special dream.

00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:17.581
When I think of it like that,

00:57:17.664 --> 00:57:20.542
even the bad or uncomfortable parts

00:57:22.502 --> 00:57:24.546
feel like a unique vacation.

00:57:27.758 --> 00:57:29.176
"A special dream"?

00:57:30.052 --> 00:57:31.511
More like a nightmare.

00:57:34.723 --> 00:57:35.849
What about you?

00:57:36.767 --> 00:57:40.312
Was there really nothing good
about becoming human?

00:57:42.314 --> 00:57:43.190
What?

00:57:44.816 --> 00:57:45.942
Nothing at all?

00:57:56.328 --> 00:57:58.747
No, there is something.

00:58:00.457 --> 00:58:02.209
That's a relief.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.127
What is it?

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:09.132
You.

00:58:18.475 --> 00:58:19.810
Maybe it's because I'm human now,

00:58:19.893 --> 00:58:22.813
but my heart keeps racing
for no reason whenever I look at you.

00:58:24.147 --> 00:58:27.400
I guess this is
what humans call romantic feelings.

00:58:29.736 --> 00:58:30.612
What?

00:58:31.988 --> 00:58:36.201
Si-yeol, I think I need to date you.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.020
{\an8}SPECIAL APPEARANCES
BY JUNG DONG-HWAN AND OH MIN-SEOK

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:31.089
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:59:31.173 --> 00:59:33.133
{\an8}- Open wide.
- What are you doing?

00:59:33.216 --> 00:59:34.843
{\an8}How about a date today?

00:59:35.385 --> 00:59:37.679
{\an8}I think I finally know what we have to do.

00:59:37.762 --> 00:59:39.097
{\an8}Do you want to win?

00:59:39.181 --> 00:59:41.600
{\an8}I'll make sure you move up
to the third division.

00:59:44.728 --> 00:59:46.563
{\an8}- Dad!
- How about it?

00:59:47.814 --> 00:59:48.982
{\an8}Do you remember now?

00:59:49.774 --> 00:59:52.068
{\an8}Where is the chairman right now?

00:59:53.111 --> 00:59:56.448
{\an8}So, fixing the misdeeds
you committed in the past

00:59:56.531 --> 00:59:57.574
{\an8}is the will of Heaven?

00:59:58.742 --> 01:00:02.162
{\an8}Does it look like I'm here to negotiate?

01:00:04.639 --> 01:00:06.639
