=Ancient Bracelet=

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.380
=Episode 17=

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660
=It's Alright; I'm Here=

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.560
Hurry up, all of you.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.070
Wu Luoluo?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.640
Weren't you locked away in the dungeon?

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.790
How did you get out?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.070
You even slipped me Boneless Powder.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430
You can still recognize me?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.000
So, you're not entirely clueless.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.840
As for how I got out,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.480
that's none of your concern.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.710
We are both women here.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.280
Why use such underhanded means?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.560
Underhanded?

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.790
Why not speak of your fickle ways?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.070
As Che's wife,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.840
you slept with the ruler.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.310
I thought once you stayed
with the ruler,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.310
Che would cast you aside,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.350
so I used a little drug to help you.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.000
Who would've thought

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.430
Che would care even more about you?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.000
How could you drug me?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.070
If I desired you,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.870
I'd never stoop to such means.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310
So, it was you who drugged me.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.280
You made me lose face before him.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.950
I can make you suffer even more.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.480
Once you're utterly disgraced,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.853
the ruler will surely execute you,

00:01:55.864 --> 00:01:57.200
the woman he deems impure.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.430
By then,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.590
when you're gone,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.000
I'll be the one standing by Che's side.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.230
One day,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.400
he'll marry me.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.400
My beauty,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.840
don't you worry.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.960
I'll be gentle with you.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.190
Stay back!

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.400
Get away!

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.310
Let go of me!

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.080
Move aside!

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.630
Step away!

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.960
Don't touch me!

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.350
Zhaoli!

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.310
It's me.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.310
I'm Ying Du.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.150
Ying Du...

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.680
It's all right now.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280
I'm here.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.710
Let's go.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.430
Hurry!

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.270
Zhaoli.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.740
Zhaoli.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.710
Zhaoli.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.310
You're safe now, Zhaoli.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.590
It's over.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.150
Let's go home.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.120
It seems Ying Du
is not as powerful as before.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.430
My chance has finally come.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.700
Your Highness,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.030
what should we do now?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.240
If the ruler finds out,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.800
he will never let me off.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.520
Your Highness, I acted strictly

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.800
according to your instructions.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.360
You will help me, won't you?

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.280
Rest assured.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.150
With me here,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.150
no harm will come to you.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.400
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.430
Because I'll never

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.910
let the ruler catch you.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.430
You can't even guard yourself,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.600
yet you claim you can kill me.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.360
That's a separate matter.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.240
Thank you for saving me today.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.400
Don't move.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.100
Zhaoli,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.160
you don't need to thank me.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.360
No matter what happens,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.510
I'll always keep you safe.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.000
But you don't know a single move.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160
If one day I'm gone,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.560
how will you protect yourself?

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.030
(Ying Du,)

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.750
(you slaughtered my people,)

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.430
(yet you shielded me)

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.190
(and saved me)

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.190
(from peril.)

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.830
(Which one of you is the real you?)

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.360
(Can I still trust you?)

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.440
(Zhaoli,)

00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:35.986
(before the truth is known,)

00:05:36.056 --> 00:05:37.165
(you can't trust him again.)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.190
If you stop pestering me,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.000
that will be the greatest protection.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.190
But I can't help myself.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.830
My heart belongs to you.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.200
You rogue.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.480
What are you doing?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.070
The Bracelet is useless
to you right now.

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:57.413
I'll take it back for now.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.630
When the time is right,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.070
I'll return it to you.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.200
Ying Du,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.000
you clearly know everything,

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.510
yet you keep everything hidden.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.630
And this.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.560
You can't heal it yourself.

00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:16.816
Does it have something to do
with the Bracelet's damage?

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.800
Are you concerned about me?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.800
I'm asking why the Bracelet broke.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.870
You keep saying I'm in danger;

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.240
you told me to stay away from Che.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.040
Is it because he might harm me,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.120
or are you trying to turn me
against him?

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.360
So, you'd rather doubt me

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.270
than believe I'm sincere toward you?

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.310
I just haven't seen it with my eyes.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.480
I trust no one.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.720
I'll make you believe me.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.680
You should rest for now.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.080
Your Majesty,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.460
we've found the two

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.950
who insulted Zhaoli.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.040
They are Lai and Hu
from the Wuyue tribe.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.480
You summoned me.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.560
What's the matter?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.520
Come here.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.270
Hu.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.560
Lai.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.680
What do you want to do to my people?

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.600
Ying Du, let me go.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.000
Today, I'll teach you
a few self-defense moves.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.270
For times when I'm not around,

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:31.469
they'll be enough to keep you safe.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.040
Lai!

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.920
Lai!

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.060
Lai!

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.510
What are you doing?

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.630
You're out of your mind.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.870
How could you use my hands

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.270
to harm my own people?

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.910
Try it.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.840
Zhaoli.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.150
Please, spare me.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.240
Zhaoli, spare me.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.390
Zhaoli.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.120
Zhaoli, spare me.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.360
No.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.390
No, please.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.120
Zhaoli.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.790
Please, spare me.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.790
Zhaoli.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.750
They hurt you.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.416
No.

00:09:06.427 --> 00:09:07.539
Don't let your heart soften.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.320
Zhaoli.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.320
Please, don't kill me.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.160
Zhaoli.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.100
Please, don't kill me.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.440
Please, don't kill me.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.820
Please, don't kill me.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.080
Zhaoli.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.750
Zhaoli, please don't kill me.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.200
- Zhaoli.
- Grandmother.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.750
It's me, your grandmother.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.000
Grandmother.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.240
Ying Du killed Grandmother.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.550
He killed Grandmother.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.270
You killed Grandmother.
