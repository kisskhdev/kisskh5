00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.960
(Keep Love)
Hey there.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.880
Today we're diving into

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.200
a perfect-in-the-moment topic:

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.520
The last wild fling before marriage.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.200
So, Mr. Zhou,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.600
do you see this as human nature

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.440
or as showing no respect for marriage?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480
I just don't know what to do with you.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.760
After this week,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.680
forget me.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.920
From a psychology perspective,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.360
this is often tied to

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.760
tied to pre-wedding anxiety

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.480
and pressure about the responsibility

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.720
brought by marriage and tied to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.560
a desire to
hold on to the last freedom.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
But...

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.960
But reality always hits hard.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.480
After the rush fades,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.400
it's not just yourself who gets hurt.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.560
Innocent partners and family suffer too.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.280
That's a painful truth to face.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.520
Mr. Zhou must have endured
plenty of heartbreak.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.920
No time like the present.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200
Tell us your story.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.680
That's not in the script.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.400
Love stories don't follow a script.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.800
Take a breath,
ease that pre-wedding anxiety.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.920
Reckless actions

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.160
always come with a cost.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.800
Seriously, don't cheat.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480
Did you hear that?

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.720
They were talking about you.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.800
Or maybe at someone else.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.960
I mean,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.720
did you Gu Ruomai in as a streamer

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.280
just to get close to me?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.240
What's the answer you're expecting?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.120
That's exactly my answer.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.200
It doesn't matter.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.280
What matters is

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.680
you're right here with me now.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.920
Gu Ruomai can be pretty tough.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.280
I remember back then,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.240
she even hit me for your sake.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.700
Chen Aming,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.240
serves you right for treating her

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.160
like that!

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.720
Do you know
how much Ding Daang has done for you?

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.880
It's on me.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.100
Thanks for helping me last time.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.640
Give it a try.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.680
You made it?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.280
Not bad.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.320
I'm no cook.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.620
This is the only dish I can make.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.160
Honestly, I've never had dumplings before.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.000
Your parents never made that?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.960
I don't have parents.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.280
What a coincidence, same here.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.760
But at least you've got a sister.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.360
If you like,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.760
she could be your sister too.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.540

(Finance New Wave)

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.000
Why is President Hu here again?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.480
He's been here

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.000
three afternoons in a row

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.280
to read.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680
Boss isn't around.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.920
He's still here waiting for her.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.400
What a devoted man.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120
True.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.040
Where do you think the boss is?

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.680
Can't reach her through phone.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.120
The engagement ceremony
is only days away.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.920
Guess it's that pre-wedding anxiety

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.560
kicking in.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.520
The service is over.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.960
Um…

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.960
Can we renew the contract?

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.920
We agreed to call it even.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.680
I'm not happy with your service.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.990
The debt isn't cleared yet.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.880
You're getting engaged.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.840
But didn't you come back

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.280

I cheated.

Let's call off the engagement.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.280
I owe you an apology for this.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.280
Tell me whatever you need.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.040
You're not even trying to hide it.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.680
It doesn't bother me.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.880
The ceremony will be held on time.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.960
Do you know what you're saying?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.720
Of course.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.560
I believe in our relationship.

Your fiancé...

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.440
He's... quite something.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.320
But there are things

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.500
which I do mind,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.480
even Ding Daang doesn't.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.440
And who are you to mind?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.080
President Hu.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.720
You really can be cold.

Chen Miaomiao?

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.480
President Hu,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.440
I almost believed your nonsense.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.160
While preparing for your engagement,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.400
your were playing

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.440
those games of affection with other girls.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.360
What a shame.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.840
You picked the wrong person.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.280
Hu Yitong.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.800
What's your relationship with Miaomiao?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.520
Yes.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.920
Miaomiao and I

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.880
used to be together.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.600
But we broke up a long time ago.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.400
If you have any proof

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.800
that I betrayed Ding Daang,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.400
please bring it out.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.600
Mr. Hu, looks like

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.280
you came prepared.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.400
Let me think.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.200
Hotel surveillance.

Transaction records.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.560
I'd guess
these have all been tampered with.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.200
Still,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.200
I could let Ding Daang have a look.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.040
Ding Daang.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.990
I admit Chen Miaomiao
came to me a few times.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.520
But I never

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.160
crossed any lines with her.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.360
If you don't believe me,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.280
you can ask her yourself.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.560
Ding Daang,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.040
do you believe him?

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.600
President Yu,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.280
if you're demanding
an explanation for your sister,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.680
you could've come to me directly.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.040
But please don't use Ding Daang.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.240
Yu Kun.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.800
If something really happens to Miaomiao,

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.820
you should take responsibility.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.720
Because the one who's hurt her the most

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.760
is you, her brother.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.880
If I'm not mistaken,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.980
you planned my so-called chance meeting

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.920
with her, didn't you?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.280
You only came to Ding Daang

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.440
