00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.940
What class and year are you?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.280
I'm a first year, in Class 1. My name is Ninako Kinoshita.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.400
I didn't fall for him, hoping anything would come out of this.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.410
I just want him to know how happy I am to be in love.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.600
Ren, I like you.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.270
I'm sorry. I already have a girlfriend.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.780
Is this your girlfriend?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.250
Ren only looks blunt and cold. He's really kind at heart.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.570
You can't expect anything from Ren
so long as he has a girlfriend.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.840
You don't understand the limits there are
in your relationship with him.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.620
When you have a crush like mine, it'll become obvious.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.540
Then choose me.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.170
I'll prove to you some things won't ever change.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.590
I know there's already someone else in your heart.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.670
I love you, even when you're rejecting me.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.610
Doesn't it bother you that I keep crushing on Ninako?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.200
Let's figure out what works, together.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.760
He's distancing himself to extinguish his feelings for her.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.850
No person is without worry though.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.970
- I love you.
- You're an idiot.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420
Long time no see, Takumi.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.590
It would only hurt to continue pining for Ren.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.220
But I want to stay in love with him.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.630
There's another reason to like him just a bit more.

- Morning.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.620
Looks like we're all in the same class again.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.100
- Yup.
- Lucky for you three.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.870
Why am I the only one not in Class 4?

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.740
At least you're right next door.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.090
But I wanted to be with you, Sayuri.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.200
Sorry, could I slip past you?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.800
Sure. My bad.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.890
I swear someone's trying to tear us apart.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.080
You're imagining things. And that's not happening, okay?

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.740
I see Ren's in our class, too.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.180
He is!

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.140
I feel like I'm dreaming.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.120
I'm in the same class as my crush.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.850
I won't have to rely on coincidences to see him anymore.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.520
I'll get to see him everyday, in this very classroom.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.440
Stare at him like that, and he'll realize you still like him.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440
Thanks for the warning.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.290
Ninako, you're working today, right?

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.800
Let's head over together after school.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.180
Sure.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.760
You're in a good mood.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.850
Why wouldn't I be? We're in the same class,
and I'm getting alone time with you now.

[Mao Sugimoto]

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.290
Seriously?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.890
I enrolled here because of you.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.040
No you didn't.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.650
What's with that face?

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.620
You really think I'll fall for that again?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.660
Screw off.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.650
Come on, Ninako.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.090
Right.

Want to work at the cafe again?

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.380
I can put in a word for you with Kyo.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.760
It's fine.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.000
Still bummed out over your girlfriend?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.290
- If you have any regrets, go back to her.
- I don't.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.130
I'm not exactly "bummed out" either.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.980
It's just...

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.580
Just, what? Don't force down your feelings anymore.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.500
I'm a bit disappointed in myself.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.450
When I realized I had someone else on my mind,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.600
I assumed I should make an effort to forget. And yet...

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.990
Ren, I know there's already someone else in your heart.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.060
Don't force yourself to forget and move on.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.210
I still don't understand the difference
between "making an effort" and "forcing myself".

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.380
Were your efforts in forgetting her a success?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.850
Trying to forget despite your efforts is called forcing yourself.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.390
Okay, I understand you're disappointed in yourself.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.210
But aren't you wasting time worrying about it
any more than you need to?

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.650
I mean, you're in the same class as her now.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.780
Let Ren figure this out at his own pace, alright?

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.300
Besides, this ultimately hinges on Kinoshita's feelings as well.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.400
Fair point.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.210
Sorry about my attitude earlier. Did I scare you?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.140
No.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.010
Who was that girl?

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.190
My ex-girlfriend from middle school.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.610
The one who used me to get closer to her real crush.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.360
Didn't think I'd lose my cool like that, though. How lame.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.210
You must have really cherished her.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.610
You got worked up, because you cared.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.040
I don't think that's lame.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.270
The guy my ex liked... I actually clicked with him quite a bit.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.860
I thought of him as my best friend.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.630
But one day, I saw them together.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.780
They were sharing a kiss.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.480
My girlfriend's the one who initiated it.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.950
So it really wasn't my friend's fault.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.160
Still... I don't know.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.790
He just seriously pissed me off, for some reason.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.670
I ended up distancing myself from him.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.200
I let go of both of them.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.770
Well, that dude and I aren't necessarily on bad terms though.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:30.740
We're just never going back to being best buds, I suppose.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.190
What a difficult situation.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.170
Don't look so distressed. I'll hug you.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.660
Wow, do I really warrant such a reaction?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.760
Ouch.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.220
There's no benefit in hanging around me anymore.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.040
Why not make your move with confidence instead?

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.680
I told you, I'm not falling for that again.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.470
Too bad.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.550
Long time no see, Ichinose.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.360
I look forward to seeing you around campus.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.720
She apparently came chasing you.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.020

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.250
Hey look, it's Ninako.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.150
- Busted?
- Yeah.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.080
Aw man...

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:30.210
Don't tell me you still think Ninako has a thing for you.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.620
I'm not that full of myself.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.020
Then let me ask you this. Do you want her to like you again?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.680
And if so, are you gonna do anything to make it happen?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.810
Does the possibility of Ninako liking another guy not bother you?

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.340
So what if she likes another guy?

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.160
You're only thinking of yourself.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.390
Yeah? Well, if I sway her affections in my favor,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.210
then that's no longer an issue, right?

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.850

- What?

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.950
He did it again.
[Spring, 2 Years Ago]

- Seriously?
- Yikes.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.160
He thinks he can get away with anything, with that face of his.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.060
Nice to meet you, new classmate.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.810
I hear you steal people's girlfriends or something?

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.710
Let them say what they want.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.960
And don't talk to me, you'll get roped into it.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:31.310
Yeah? Well, too bad, 'cause I talk to whoever I want.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.390
It's Mao.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.400
Come on, we'll be late.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.850
Why don't you go out with anyone, Ren?

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.980
Because I already have a girlfriend.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.880
What? Since when?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.510
Since... just the other day, I think.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.390
Who?

She's not from our school.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.130
Then what middle school does she go to?

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.890

You're always hanging out with Ichinose, right?

Do you know if he has a girlfriend?

He does.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.440

Sorry to bother you.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.750
I like you.

Mao. Do you like me?

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.940
You're asking me again?

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.670
Of course I like you.

Of course I like you.

Well, I hate you.

- Yikes.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.350
I guess that's Ichinose for you.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.240
- What a disaster.
- It's straight terrifying, man.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:05.020
It's not your fault I broke up with Mao, okay?

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.460
Ando...

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.970
We're still best buds, you hear me?

We won't let a little girl trouble ruin our friendship.

My bad.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.540
Just get back to class already.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:04.080
Class ended hours ago. I didn't feel like heading back either.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.800
What, you feel bad for me?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.660
I don't need your pity.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.110
We're not even best friends or anything.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.640
Not anymore.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:28.850
Why do you always shut up and let things pass? It pisses me off.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.020
We've been through this already.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.200
When Mao kissed you.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.450
Why didn't you ever say anything about it?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.220
You could have at least tried to make an excuse.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.040
What was I supposed to say?

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.300
What did you want me to say?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.700
In any case, you still would've...

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.960
Whatever.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.750
Stupid Ando.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.450
Takes one to know one, Stupid!

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.300
Did Ando wake up?

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.030
Yes.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.600
You doing alright?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.010
Yes.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.190
"You should speak up when you're not feeling well."

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.290
Remember?

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.230
How're you feeling?

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.200
I hate feeling like this.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.640
Just let me disappear.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.150
Ren.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.800
Kinoshita.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.260
How was Ando?

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.150
He was just feeling a bit dizzy.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.030
He should be fine after a bit of rest.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.770
That's good to hear.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.210
Say...

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.250
Yeah?

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.620
Can't friends be friends, even if the feeling's not mutual?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.580
Sorry, weird question.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:59.210
Did you get into an argument with a friend?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.540
I always knew our relationship had gotten rocky.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:11.450
So I just assumed I wasn't allowed to call him a friend anymore.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.100
Sorry, it's a bit complicated.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.040
But I feel better now after talking it out.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.390
Thanks for lending me an ear.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.390
Sure.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.530
Ren only tells well-meaning white lies.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.590
I couldn't give him any advice.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.480
I promise I feel better, really.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.240
See you around.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.670
Excuse me.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.620
I believe you were with Takumi yesterday?

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.330
I was, yes.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.010
Are you Takumi's girlfriend?

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.580
No.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.210
Then...

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.990
Do you have a crush on Ichinose?

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.360
What?

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.390
Ren and I are only friends.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.980
We'll be splitting up into groups for the school trip.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.250
I regret breaking up with you, Uehara.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.270
Sincerity is guaranteed to be a straight shot to the heart.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.090
I'm confessing to Kinoshita after Sports Day.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.640
- What?
- Just admiring you, Futaba.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.990
I know I won't be able to hold these feelings back forever.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.200
Even though I'm right at his side,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:35.320
I'm the closest, yet furthest I've been from him.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.090
[Epilogue]

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.860
Excuse me, have you seen Takumi?

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.200
He was headed your way.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.090
Maybe you two missed each other?

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.410
Seems like it.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:02.060
Just wait, he'll come sprinting back for you.
