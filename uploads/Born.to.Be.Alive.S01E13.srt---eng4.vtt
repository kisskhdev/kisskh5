[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
[Episode 13]

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.770
What's wrong, Sangba?

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.229
Captain.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.539
Your wife is looking for you everywhere.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:54.620
She said there's an emergency at home

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.780
and she wants you to go back.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.910
Didn't you tell her?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.509
I don't have time to go home.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.920
We need to head back immediately
to save people.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.560
She said you still have to go back.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.290
It is urgent.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.230
Captain.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.730
We're still preparing supplies.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.930
It'll take some time.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.330
Just go home now.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.670
Uncle, how are you?

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.240
I'm good. Thank you.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.500
Deputy County Mayor Duojie.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.960
My mom isn't happy.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.740
She insisted we come find you.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.130
You said you'd pay us back in five months.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.560
It's been half a year now.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.020
I'm sorry.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.820
I'm really struggling right now.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.950
Can you give me a little more time?

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.740
This can't wait any longer.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.060
You wrote this yourself.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.710
If this ten thousand yuan

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.640
can't be repaid,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.960
then your livestock and your pasture

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.690
will be taken as compensation.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.060
Duojie.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.690
We aren't

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.690
rich people.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.830
We saved that money
by selling our livestock.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.560
Now Basang's house

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.740
leaks when it rains.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.790
We need the money to fix the house.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.030
We can't wait any longer.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.500
I know.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.450
I'll get someone

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.030
fix your house first.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.090
As for the money...

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.329
Can you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.740
give me another month?

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:27.970
I promise

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.090
I'll pay you back next month.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.630
What if you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.090
go back on your word again?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.360
Then,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.250
you can take the livestock

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.980
and pasture.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.970
Duojie.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.310
I've watched you grow up.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.360
Have you changed since you

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.650
became the Deputy County Governor?

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.940
A man's promise

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.890
is like the scripture carved in stone.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.290
I hope you keep your word.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.240
Uncle, don't worry.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.180
I haven't changed. I'll keep my word.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.160
Alright.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.230
I'll trust you one more time.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.630
That's settled then. Let's go.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.270
Next month. Remember it.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.840
Okay.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.870
No need to see us out.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.600
I have to go back to the Uninhabited Zone
to save people.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.530
I'm leaving now.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.270
Are you just leaving like this?

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.750
Our pasture,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.270
our cattle and sheep—

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.650
Why didn't you tell me about this?

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.370
If I don't go back,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.570
Bai Ju and my men

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.390
will die in there.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.500
Dig faster.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.800
If it freezes over,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.630
we'll never be able to dig it out.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.330
Hurry up!

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.100
I can't do this anymore.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.980
I really can't dig anymore.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.980
Stand up.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600
Are you even a man?

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.810
Zhacuo hasn't uttered a peep,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.500
yet he's digging faster

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.000
than both of us

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.810
put together.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.930
Stand up, now.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.510
Zhacuo

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.330
is like a yak.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.330
I can't compete with him.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.070
Zhacuo.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.920
Cuo.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.740
Rest a bit.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.700
Eat something.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.470
There's nothing left to eat.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.740
Zhacuo.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.870
Zhacuo.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.620
Zhacuo.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.680
Zhacuo!

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.530
-Zhacuo!
-Zhacuo!

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.970
Drink water.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.490
Drink, quickly.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.390
Have some more.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.920
Quick.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.170
He can't swallow it.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.830
What should we do?

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:26.830
It's been two days.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.270
We at least had some flatbread.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.740
He gave all his flatbread

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.720
to that child.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.660
What are you doing?

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.930
What are you doing?

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.280
What are you doing?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.020
Don't shoot the antelope!

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.220
Step aside!

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.250
If I don't do it,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.110
we will all die!

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.410
Sangba!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.650
Load the rest onto your truck bed.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.160
Everything is ready.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.300
He Qingyuan is still having surgery.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.220
Can his arm be saved?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.770
I don't know.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.170
They won't let anyone in.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:17.030
Captain fell asleep

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.390
shortly after leaving home.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.190
Let him sleep a bit longer.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.620
Okay.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.300
Captain.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.310
Why didn't you wake me?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.230
Is everything ready?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.510
Yes.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.630
Load up quickly.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.250
Okay.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:47.600
Okay.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.500
Director Zhang.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.160
The Mountain Patrol is ready.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.130
Deputy County Mayor Duo asked—

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.050
Tell him

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.750
I can't guarantee anything.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.230
Understood.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.960
He's asked

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.790
if there's anything

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.920
you want to tell him.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.170
No matter what,

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.790
bring Bai Ju back.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.290
Are you sure

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.890
this is

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.780
the right direction?

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.600
Yes.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.000
Then how long

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.050
until we reach the road?

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.480
If it keeps snowing,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.640
it'll take two days.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.620
Captain, let me drive.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.220
No need.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.650
If I can't walk anymore,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.130
shoot me to death.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.240
What are you talking about?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.040
It's the same.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.960
If you can't walk anymore,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.690
I'll shoot you to death.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.740
Freezing slowly to death

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.550
is too painful.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.130
Captain.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.390
Shao Yunfei.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.240
Shao Yunfei!

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:33.770
I'm tired.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:35.900
I don't want to talk.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.220
Am I seeing things?

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.750
Why do I see

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.510
a truck up ahead?

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.940
Let's go.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.450
Check the back of it.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.609
It's out of gas.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.300
Even with gas, it won't move.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.079
It's completely rusted solid.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.800
Let's go.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.910
Let's go.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.730
I can't walk anymore.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.220
Then you rest a bit.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.980
I'll go

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.950
drag them over.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.960
Bai Ju.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.240
What?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.900
What is that?

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:47.500
Look!

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.550
A blizzard is coming.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.790
Let's go!

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.910
Hurry!

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.270
Hurry!

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.830
Why are we stopping?

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.100
Captain, it's snowing.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.010
Let's set up camp here.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.240
Get in. Keep moving.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.050
If the snow gets heavier,

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.380
we might get separated.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.270
If we lose contact,

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.400
it'll be dangerous.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.440
You keep it.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.000
I'm not thirsty.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.460
If it freezes later,

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.180
you won't be able to drink it.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:47.790
Quick.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.640
Will you ever come back
to the Uninhabited Zone?

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.380
Do we even have a future?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.350
Do you regret staying?

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.610
Not at all.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.640
My only regret

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:33.790
is

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.350
not coming sooner

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.550
to get your story

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.160
written down

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.060
and share it with the world.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.460
By your definition,

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.500
I guess that makes us

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.310
kind of noble.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.680
Congratulations.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.150
You're going to be a noble journalist.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.720
I wasn't exaggerating.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.580
I never thought about

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.770
how others would see me

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.270
or us.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.180
I just think

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.710
that I've been to places

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.720
where no one else

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.740
has ever been

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.270
and experienced stories

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.800
others have never heard of.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.530
Even though it feels like

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.350
something's missing

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.660
ending it this way,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.550
at least

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.690
I managed to get one thing done.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.530
It'll be worth it.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.850
It... It'll be worth it.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.070
My parents

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.590
died in the blizzard.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.750
I wonder back then,

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.300
how they felt

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.240
and what they were thinking.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.010
Did they think

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.480
their lives were worth it?

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.800
They were.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.670
Because they they made sure

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:30.640
you survive.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.270
Right now,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.160
I really want to live.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.010
It's not worth dying here.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.680
I really want to know

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.070
how Duojie's stomach is doing,

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.980
and whether He's arm can be saved.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.240
And before I left home this time,

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.630
I didn't get the chance

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.290
to say a proper goodbye to Mom,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.000
Shao,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.270
and Bai Ji.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.660
Shao... Shao Yunfei.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.440
Shao... Shao Yunfei.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.310
Shao Yunfei.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.070
Shao Yunfei!

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:41.300
Shao Yunfei.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:42.780
Shao Yunfei.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.690
Say something.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.570
Wake up.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.520
You can't sleep.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.610
If you sleep, you won't wake up again.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.480
Wake up.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.530
Wake up.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.830
-It's hot.
-What are you doing?

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.570
Don't take it off.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:58.100
It's hot.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:59.110
Don't take it off.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:00.750
Don't take it off!

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.330
It's hot.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.440
Don't take it off!

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:03.680
Don't take it off!

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.610
Before freezing to death,

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.210
people go into hypothermia.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.200
The body starts to send false signals

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.410
and feels an intense heat.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:10.830
Don't take it off. Don't take it off!

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:11.310
Bai Ju.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.760
The heat...

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.310
The heat feels worse than the cold.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.110
You were right.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.840
Slowly freezing to death...

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.350
Slowly freezing to death is unbearable.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.140
Bai Ju.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.200
Bai Ju.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.760
Can you shoot straight?

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.050
Yes.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:06.980
I'm here!

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.420
I'm here!

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.010
I'm here!

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.660
I'm here!

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.010
I... I'm here!

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.050
Captain!

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.050
Look back!

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.740
It's Bai!

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.240
I'm here.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.220
I'm here.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.480
I'm here.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.290
I'm here!

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.800
I'm here!

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.850
I'm here!

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.070
I'm here!

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.090
I'm here!

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.640
I'm here!

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.960
I'm here!

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.810
I'm here!

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.140
I'm here!

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.250
Bai Ju!

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.290
Bai Ju!

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:14.770
Bai Ju.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:18.320
I found you.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.180
Bai Ju.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.160
It's okay now.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.110
I found you.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.250
I found you.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.160
I found you.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.680
Breakfast.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.420
Is this enough to fill you up?

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.080
I'm not hungry.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.110
Thanks.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:50.420
Wait.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:58.930
Just put it here.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:59.930
I'll eat it later.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.060
You're quite fashionable.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.090
It's Shao's.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.139
No, I mean

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.780
the candy you're eating

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.830
is quite fashionable.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:30.960
That's also Shao's.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.340
Why are you here?

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.510
Shouldn't you be inside, lying down
and getting your IV?

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.719
I've been sleeping for two days.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.090
If I keep lying there,

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.360
I'll get bedsores.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.690
If it weren't for my mom

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.150
insisting I finish the IV,

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.340
I'd be back with the patrol by now.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.110
I wonder

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.030
how that calf is doing.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.820
Duojie gave it

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.620
to the nearby herdsmen to raise.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.350
Once a calf picks up

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.390
a human scent,

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.670
it's hard for it to rejoin the wild flock.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.080
We have to wait two or three years

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.640
and try to release it

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.760
once it's grown.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.650
If you don't want to chat with me,

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:18.830
don't force it.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.640
I'm just here to sit in the sun with you.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.340
When the IV is done,

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.140
I'll take the needle out for you.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.130
It's not finished yet?

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.330
Auntie, you're back.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.630
We're making dumplings for lunch.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.610
Bai Shao went to buy meat.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.010
Okay. Thank you, Auntie.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.160
What's wrong?

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.080
It's just

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.580
that I have frostbite.

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:51.140
It hurts and itches.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.800
I bumped it just now.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.040
This chunk looks good.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.510
This isn't grass-fed.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.090
You can tell that?

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.480
Just life experience.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:14.950
You have so much life experience.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:15.550
Sometimes my mom

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.950
even buys the wrong kind.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.230
This one is good.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.150
I guarantee this is grass-fed.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:22.800
How much?

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.450
Five yuan a jin.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.080
Okay, give me two jins.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.030
What about this chunk?

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.000
3.5 yuan a jin.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:30.430
3.5 is fine.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.390
Give me two jins.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.120
Wait.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:33.540
Buy the good one.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.140
It's on me.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.730
No need.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.380
Good quality or bad,

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.380
anyway, the reporter from

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.260
the provincial capital

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.390
won't be able to taste the difference.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:41.780
Mince it a bit for me.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.040
I'm making dumplings.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.050
Okay.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:46.550
That doesn't feel right, does it?

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.110
No matter what,

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.030
he is a guest.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.870
And I heard from my dad

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.050
that the reporter

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.570
is a bit stubborn

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.070
but quite professional.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.960
What does that

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.960
have to do with us?

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:58.800
Anyway,

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.820
he's leaving sooner or later.

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.000
So, there's no need
to give him the good stuff.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.850
That's true.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.740
Even if we try to be nice to him,

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.340
he might not

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.280
appreciate it.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.750
Bai Shao,

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.240
you've really thought this through.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.410
Does this count as social experience?

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.270
I need to learn from you.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.910
What kind of

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.600
"social experience" is that?

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.170
I just think

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.780
people here

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.320
are too honest.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:24.580
It's easy for outsiders

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.910
to take advantage of us.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.280
Exactly.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.400
I don't like

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.200
people from big cities, either.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:32.960
Going away for school

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.570
is just to broaden my horizons.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:35.310
If my parents

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.000
didn't force me,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.940
I wouldn't go.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.690
I actually think

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.110
Uncle Lin and Auntie Zhu

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.310
have good foresight.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.500
I still like it here.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.820
People around here
are simple and down-to-earth.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.950
Unlike the outside,

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.030
where you have to

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:52.710
scheme against each other.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:53.440
Look,

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:54.650
I'm not

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.590
very sharp socially, either.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.590
I can't even beat you at buying meat.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:00.840
Is the meat ready?

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.260
Yes.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:01.910
Thanks.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.080
I've discussed it with my family.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.840
I'll come back as soon as I graduate.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.530
When our county

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:11.860
establishes the mining company,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.660
it'll set up a branch in Tianduo.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.110
Then,

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:15.440
I'll go work in the city.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.300
People from our family will be

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.960
the first batch of employees.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.160
Our family?

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.710
Who knows if the mining company

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:26.310
will even get off the ground.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.260
Deputy County Mayor Duo

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.090
has always been against

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.750
the mining.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.250
Let them discuss that.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.790
Let me carry that for you.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.120
No need. It's not heavy.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.340
When we get back to your house,

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.070
teach me how to make dumplings.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:42.870
Or

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.110
I can just help you out.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:44.610
Actually, I don't know

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:45.460
what I can do.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.940
Maybe next time.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.460
We have a guest

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.570
today.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.170
Plus, Bai Ju

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.120
hasn't fully recovered from her injury.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.850
So, it's not convenient today.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:00.220
Alright, it's fine.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.530
When we first came here,

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.860
there was no courtyard.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.910
There weren't even walls.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.640
The herdsmen

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.030
set up tents for us.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.520
Unlike those small

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.030
modern tents,

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.430
those tents were the size

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.430
of a house.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.530
We worked and lived

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.150
all

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.960
in there.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.650
So the director and the staff

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.190
all lived and ate together.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.730
The atmosphere was actually quite nice.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:28.050
Back then,

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:29.710
there wasn't even a director.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:30.400
Just one teacher,

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.530
leading a few of us.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.550
That teacher

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:36.410
was a graduate of Sichuan Medical College.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.630
Later, when he got older,

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.400
he went back.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:40.560
Was there anything back then

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.090
that you found particularly unforgettable?

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:47.660
Well,

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:48.790
I picked up a girl

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.220
while I was out on rounds.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:56.220
There was also a doctor from Shanghai.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.280
He performed

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.270
an appendectomy on himself.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.730
On himself?

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.970
You haven't heard of that, right?

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.170
I remember now.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.170
It was

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.280
Uncle Sun, right?

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.130
Yes.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:08.610
I guess back then,

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.210
that was

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.210
the only case in the entire country.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:12.480
At that time,

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.350
he was out on rounds in the pastoral area,

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.550
and there were no other doctors around.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:17.570
His appendix pain

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:18.980
was unbearable.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.800
So right there on the grassland,

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.820
he set up a mirror,

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.400
used local anesthesia,

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.400
and cut it out himself.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.250
I thought

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.520
the Mountain Patrol guys
were already hardcore,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.280
but I didn't expect

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.730
the people from your hospital
to be even tougher.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.670
Alright,

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.050
stop flattering my mom.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.070
Really.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.170
People here really are impressive.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:42.190
Because this place

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.940
is where people are truly

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.380
tested and forged.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:45.960
So many people who left here

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.660
later on

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.320
went on to do really well.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.140
By the way,

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.360
your mom works at
the Cultural Department, right?

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:53.130
Yes.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.250
The former Deputy Party Secretary

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.460
of Quduo Township

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.960
was a section chief sent down

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.690
from the Provincial Department of Culture.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.210
He served in a temporary position here

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.320
for two years.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.670
Not long after he went back,

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:06.110
he was promoted to full division-level,
skipping ranks.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.400
I really think these people

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.480
are just

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:09.840
capable and able to endure hardship,

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.400
right?

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.690
Shao,

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.010
you're quite capable, too.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.740
You've been with the Mountain Patrol

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.600
for so long without complaining.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:19.680
Have you ever thought about

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.340
taking a temporary post here?

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.820
Grassroots experience

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.030
is very important,

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.110
especially for someone

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.440
in journalism like you.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.020
If you take a post here

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.720
and work for a few years,

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.280
when you go back,

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.570
your promotion speed

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.010
will be totally different

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.670
compared to your colleagues.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.820
And another thing,

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.950
that doctor

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.090
who came here

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.740
to provide support.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.940
After working for a few years,
he went back.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.400
But when he left,

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.710
he didn't go back alone.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:49.590
He took his partner

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.470
back with him.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.510
He even got

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.740
his marriage sorted.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.520
Of course, there was no wedding banquet.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.250
Conditions were limited here.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.050
But we all shared

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.570
a whole sheep together,

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.340
and it was a blast!

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:04.610
Auntie,

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.000
about this temporary posting,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.080
I… I…

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:08.880
I really haven't thought about it before.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.540
Alright, stop interviewing.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:11.630
The dumplings are ready.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.390
Go wash your hands.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.400
Well, Auntie.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.380
I'll go wash my

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:15.410
fingers.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:25.660
Mom,

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.860
why did you tell him all that?

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.290
It was an interview.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.030
I think I spoke well.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.140
The first part was fine.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.760
Why did you add all that at the end?

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:39.430
Didn't I tell you?

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.100
We're nowhere near that stage.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.310
What did I say?

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.870
I didn't mention you at all.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.410
Well, I did say one thing.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.610
I said I picked you up.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.060
Can I say that?

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.270
You talked about

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.530
"sorting out personal lives."

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:58.030
Mom,
