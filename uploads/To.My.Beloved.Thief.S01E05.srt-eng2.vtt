00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.531
{\an8}Why am I in the market?

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.658
{\an8}Gil-dong is here!

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:55.410
{\an8}Find Gil-dong!

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:56.494
{\an8}Gil-dong?

00:00:59.038 --> 00:00:59.914
{\an8}What?

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:09.174
{\an8}What happened to my voice?

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.385
{\an8}Is something wrong with my ears?

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:28.318
What?

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:35.491
Why is your face…

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.370
Why is your voice…

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.500
Why am I… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.385
What on earth is happening?

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:11.027
How much longer should I wait?

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.363
Why won't I wake up?
Why isn't this a dream?

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:14.489
Why on earth

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.367
am I in the aide's body?

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:22.330
Let's go to where I was.

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:23.581
I must go to where I am.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.627
But where am I?

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.048
Tell Her Majesty that

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.968
it's an urgent matter
relating to my marriage arrangement.

00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:35.927
Yes, my lady. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:42.892
May I ask you a question?

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:46.479
We meet again.

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:50.024
Again? It seems like
I'm supposed to know her.

00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:52.026
Nice to see you again?

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:54.570
You remember me this time.

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:56.781
Did he not recognize her before?

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.908
Of course, I do.

00:03:00.827 --> 00:03:02.370
I'm a little lost right now.

00:03:02.453 --> 00:03:03.621
Where are we?

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.207
We're in the palace.

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.126
Palace?

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.502
Yes, palace.

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.463
Palace? I'm in the royal palace?

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:14.090
The palace where the king lives?

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.592
Why the palace, of all places?

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:19.470
I'm not familiar with this place.
I don't know how to get out of here.

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:20.888
You said you knew me.

00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:22.515
Can you help me?

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:26.728
Sure.

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:29.772
You helped me last time.
Let me know if there's anything I can--

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:30.773
Thank you.

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:38.656
Where's the next gate?

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.241
Hyeopsaeng Gate is over there.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:41.951
My apologies, but could we make haste?

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:42.994
I must hurry.

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:43.911
Sure.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.880
What a pair of impetuous young things.

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:56.299
But how strange.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.303
The man looks just like my son.

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:02.889
It is unfortunate, Your Majesty.

00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:06.934
Send for Magistrate Seo.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.736
Thank you for guiding me out.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.489
And my hands…

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.826
Pardon my discourtesy. I was in haste.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.371
Seeing that Your Highness
returned so late,

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:28.456
something must've happened
at the constabulary.

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:30.792
It seems so.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.919
I can go alone from here.

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.170
Thanks for today.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.714
Hae-rim!

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:38.966
That's my name.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.430
Hae-rim of the Shin Family.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.265
And my brother is

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:49.143
the Superintendent at the Hyeminseo.

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:52.855
You're the Superintendent's sister?

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:55.400
You don't look like him.

00:04:55.983 --> 00:04:57.110
You're beautiful.

00:04:58.361 --> 00:04:59.278
If you'll excuse me.

00:05:09.288 --> 00:05:10.289
Next time,

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:12.834
please remember my name too.

00:05:22.552 --> 00:05:23.886
How did you…

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.264
Has my message already reached you?

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.141
No, sir.

00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:29.058
Pardon?

00:05:29.142 --> 00:05:30.685
I mean…

00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:32.728
I was passing by on other business.

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:39.402
I threw those into the well.

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:40.945
They found them already.

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:42.405
They're Gil-dong's.

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:45.616
The Chief Censor was

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.368
killed by Gil-dong today.

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:49.912
Is that so?

00:05:51.247 --> 00:05:52.582
About four hours ago,

00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:55.334
he came to spy
on the Chief Censor's residence.

00:05:56.794 --> 00:06:00.006
And it seems he was injured around here.

00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:03.259
Was I bleeding this much?

00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:04.969
It seems his injury slowed him down,

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:07.221
so he discarded his mask and robe

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:11.142
and fled with his true face exposed.

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:14.353
I must've been unconscious for a while.

00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:15.730
I wonder if I woke up myself

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.316
or someone moved me.

00:06:19.817 --> 00:06:21.861
Aide Kang, listen carefully.

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:24.113
Gil-dong

00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:25.865
has been framed.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.491
He's been framed?

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:28.743
Do you remember

00:06:28.826 --> 00:06:31.120
when the ruffians around Unjong Street

00:06:31.204 --> 00:06:33.331
were caught with the silk
they had stolen last winter?

00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:35.583
They claimed it was
what Gil-dong had stolen.

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:36.751
I remember that.

00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:39.712
Someone from the merchant guild
remembered one of the ruffians,

00:06:39.795 --> 00:06:41.714
so Gil-dong was able to clear his name.

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:42.882
There was another case.

00:06:42.965 --> 00:06:44.884
There was a rumor
that Gil-dong carried off

00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:46.886
the Inspector General's daughter-in-law.

00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:49.430
It turned out that she had eloped

00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:51.307
with the writing tutor.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.977
So someone used Gil-dong's name again?

00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:57.772
I never imagined his name
would be used in a murder.

00:06:58.314 --> 00:06:59.190
In any case,

00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:01.150
just focus on finding evidence.

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:03.319
Don't be fooled
by the blood-written message.

00:07:03.402 --> 00:07:04.487
Yes, Your Highness.

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:08.783
But I haven't reported

00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:11.118
those cases to you.

00:07:11.202 --> 00:07:14.038
You already know a lot of details,
including the blood-written message.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:17.041
I happened to hear it in passing.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.460
Is that so?

00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:21.170
Right.

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:25.091
Was there any report
of someone found collapsed nearby?

00:07:25.174 --> 00:07:26.300
No, Your Highness.

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:28.094
By the way…

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:34.016
Have you been drinking?

00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:37.186
I guess I have.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.356
I heard that today
was Physician Hong's wedding.

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:41.941
That may explain it.

00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:45.319
I must go now.

00:07:45.403 --> 00:07:46.862
Where?

00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:47.905
Later!

00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:49.615
You can't just go without Officer Seo!

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:50.783
Your Highness!

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:17.852
There you are.

00:08:20.938 --> 00:08:22.648
A physician was here too.

00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:25.318
Who brought me here?

00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:28.237
Let's keep this to ourselves.
Don't tell anyone.

00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:31.324
If the elders learn the new bride
was found unconscious outside the house,

00:08:31.407 --> 00:08:32.658
it would reflect poorly on her.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:34.118
All right.

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:36.162
Good thing you found her.

00:08:36.245 --> 00:08:39.165
What on earth was she doing there?

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:44.754
Was she trying to run away
because her husband died?

00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:45.671
What?

00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:48.215
Shut your mouth.

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:50.217
Hey.

00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:51.927
Wake up.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.180
Why won't she wake up?

00:08:55.931 --> 00:08:57.308
Her heart's still beating though.

00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:02.313
Is anyone in there?

00:09:04.482 --> 00:09:05.691
Is this body empty?

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:09.236
Anybody here?

00:09:09.737 --> 00:09:11.405
Are you there?

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:17.870
What?

00:09:18.704 --> 00:09:20.039
Am I back now?

00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:22.958
I knew it.

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:25.044
It was just a dream.

00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:26.212
If you were really back,

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:28.255
you wouldn't be seeing this face.

00:09:32.593 --> 00:09:33.511
Who are you?

00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:36.305
Whoever is speaking there,

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:37.765
are you the owner of this face?

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:40.267
Eun-jo of the Hong family?

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.103
How is this…

00:09:42.853 --> 00:09:45.981
Are our souls really switched?

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:47.942
This doesn't make any sense!

00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:51.404
Does it hurt a lot?

00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:54.281
How did you hurt your head?

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:59.120
I tripped and fell outside
because it was dark.

00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:01.747
How did you get here?

00:10:03.124 --> 00:10:05.668
I passed out again
as soon as I opened my eyes.

00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:07.753
Just before that,
the Chief Censor's slaves came.

00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:10.756
He doesn't know I'm Gil-dong.

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:14.051
Goodness.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.847
How can my own face look so unfamiliar?

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:19.473
Same here.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.934
{\an8}First, we must find a way to switch back.

00:10:23.644 --> 00:10:25.187
We should get out of here.

00:10:25.604 --> 00:10:26.939
Can you move?

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:39.160
The sun is up.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.078
Go get some sleep.

00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:43.164
Father will be out soon.

00:10:51.881 --> 00:10:54.341
I delivered the dinner as you ordered.

00:10:54.425 --> 00:10:56.635
I told her to get some sleep after dinner.

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:00.222
Please excuse me.

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:06.395
She looked like
she could die at any minute.

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:08.397
Poor Eun-jo could fall seriously ill.

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:11.358
She might as well just die.

00:11:21.452 --> 00:11:23.871
If you just disappear,
it might stir up trouble.

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:27.041
Tell the doorkeeper
that you're visiting your mother.

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:28.959
My mother?

00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:30.503
Then, where am I now?

00:11:32.463 --> 00:11:33.923
Is this your in-law's place?

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:38.511
Blast.

00:11:38.594 --> 00:11:40.095
Why did they have to move you here?

00:11:41.263 --> 00:11:43.307
As of yesterday, this is where I live.

00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:49.563
By the way, why did they put
the mourning dress on me?

00:11:50.648 --> 00:11:52.149
Did someone in this family die?

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.069
That…

00:11:55.778 --> 00:11:58.030
Well, that's…

00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:01.867
Someone's coming.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.787
They might see me, so I'll hide.

00:12:11.752 --> 00:12:12.670
Great.

00:12:12.753 --> 00:12:14.296
Why that wretch, of all people?

00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:18.676
What are you doing here this early?

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:20.344
I mean…

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:23.264
what brings you here, sir?

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:29.311
I came to move the body,
but I guess I came too early.

00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:30.396
Oh, no.

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:31.689
The second son?

00:12:33.274 --> 00:12:34.108
The body?

00:12:35.442 --> 00:12:37.152
Why would the body be here?

00:12:37.653 --> 00:12:38.529
Young Master?

00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:42.283
Isn't the body supposed to be placed
behind the incense table?

00:12:42.866 --> 00:12:44.451
Go check in the men's quarters.

00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:45.744
Young Master.

00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:47.663
Are you joking?

00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:48.789
Not at all.

00:12:49.707 --> 00:12:50.624
Young Master.

00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:53.168
You've come to the wrong place.

00:12:53.252 --> 00:12:54.545
Now, go back, Young Master.

00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:56.547
You almost disappointed me.

00:13:01.677 --> 00:13:03.929
Because you can't die before I ruin you.

00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:05.848
Look…

00:13:11.312 --> 00:13:12.438
You see,

00:13:13.606 --> 00:13:16.025
I don't quite follow you.

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:17.443
How could a husband

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:20.738
say such things to his new bride?

00:13:22.656 --> 00:13:23.574
Husband?

00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:26.035
Oh, no…

00:13:26.118 --> 00:13:28.829
You're supposed
to love and cherish your bride.

00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:30.372
And you said what? Ruin her?

00:13:31.915 --> 00:13:36.086
If you had a fight
with your wife last night…

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.421
Who is this husband?

00:13:37.796 --> 00:13:38.631
What are you saying?

00:13:39.381 --> 00:13:40.591
It's you, obviously.

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:43.010
This is getting out of hand.

00:13:44.887 --> 00:13:46.722
Enough joking around.

00:13:46.805 --> 00:13:48.182
What makes you think I'm joking?

00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:49.516
Have you lost your mind?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.186
The husband you keep talking about
passed away last night.

00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:55.939
Passed away?

00:14:00.736 --> 00:14:02.905
So I'm in this mourning dress
because of my husband?

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.116
Then, who are you?

00:14:09.078 --> 00:14:09.995
Answer me.

00:14:11.246 --> 00:14:12.623
The grandchild of the deceased.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.542
Grandchild?

00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:20.422
What brings you here at this hour?

00:14:21.256 --> 00:14:23.384
To keep my family under control.

00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:27.096
Is that why…

00:14:30.808 --> 00:14:31.809
Wait.

00:14:32.518 --> 00:14:34.728
If he had a grandchild,

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:38.565
he must've been well over 60, 70, even.

00:14:40.651 --> 00:14:41.902
This marriage makes no sense.

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:48.409
Have you really lost your mind?

00:14:49.493 --> 00:14:51.245
Or did you finally come to your senses?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.579
Well, obviously…

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.625
It's the latter.

00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:57.584
Young Master.

00:15:01.505 --> 00:15:02.756
I guess

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.550
I wasn't thinking straight for a moment

00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:06.760
because of the shock.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.180
Thanks for helping me understand
what's going on, grandchild.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:13.934
By the way,

00:15:14.018 --> 00:15:16.854
I would appreciate it
if you could erase from your memory

00:15:16.937 --> 00:15:19.565
that I just mistook you for my husband.

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:22.151
To have thought so, even for a moment,

00:15:22.234 --> 00:15:24.611
is deeply dishonorable to me.

00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:27.698
You've come to your senses,

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:30.492
but what's with this attitude?

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:31.618
Young Master.

00:15:32.828 --> 00:15:35.497
Some mourners have arrived from the east.

00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:37.082
Go ahead.

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:39.460
The chief mourner
shouldn't be away for too long.

00:15:39.543 --> 00:15:40.377
Young Master.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:47.259
You there, wait.

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:52.556
How are you feeling, my lady?

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:54.600
Do you remember
being carried in yesterday?

00:15:56.685 --> 00:15:58.103
Vaguely.

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:00.814
Since I'm a woman,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.150
I don't have to receive mourners.

00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:07.029
Please make sure no one enters here
during the mourning period.

00:16:07.112 --> 00:16:10.074
I will be visiting my mother.
Don't let anyone know.

00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:11.784
Yes, my lady.

00:16:22.503 --> 00:16:23.962
You can come out now, Hong Eun-jo.

00:16:37.226 --> 00:16:38.477
Climb over the wall.

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:41.021
I don't want to stay here
even for a second.

00:16:51.657 --> 00:16:53.075
Where are we going?

00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:55.994
No one passes through this path.

00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:57.246
We can talk here.

00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:05.921
About my wedding, what you heard is true.

00:17:06.588 --> 00:17:08.590
The old master was my husband,

00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:11.385
and he passed away
right after the wedding.

00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:15.013
I know this may sound absurd to you,

00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:17.266
but this is common
for people of my status.

00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:25.732
I'm sorry for saying
I was to marry their second son. I lied.

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:28.569
I just thought it was for the best.

00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:31.697
Because it would help you move on faster

00:17:32.948 --> 00:17:34.366
and ease my mind.

00:17:42.499 --> 00:17:44.585
Why are you staying silent?

00:17:44.918 --> 00:17:47.671
Say something.
We need to find a way to fix this.

00:17:49.506 --> 00:17:51.466
I just don't know what to say.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.554
I've been thinking about it
the whole way here,

00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:57.806
and there's nothing I can say.

00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:03.145
Since I'm nobody to you,

00:18:03.937 --> 00:18:06.607
I can't even be angry with you.

00:18:07.691 --> 00:18:10.152
And I know how difficult
your choice must have been,

00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:11.695
so I can't even blame you.

00:18:11.778 --> 00:18:14.615
But I don't want to pretend
that I accept or support what you said.

00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:16.033
That this is common.

00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:20.037
What's driving me crazy right now

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:22.706
is that I'm not in my own body,

00:18:23.081 --> 00:18:26.084
so I can't even just go and drag you
out of that family like a tyrant.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:34.468
So I must get my body back first.

00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:38.430
It sounds like
you will actually do what you just said

00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:40.891
once you get your body back.

00:18:40.974 --> 00:18:42.392
That is exactly what I meant.

00:18:43.518 --> 00:18:46.230
I'm also thinking about
how I should destroy this family

00:18:46.313 --> 00:18:48.857
that let this wedding happen
so I can ease my anger.

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:55.697
But what makes me most angry is

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.492
that I was completely unaware of this

00:18:59.534 --> 00:19:01.328
and gave you the silk shoes,

00:19:01.954 --> 00:19:04.122
wishing you happiness.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:05.624
I'm so mad at myself.

00:19:08.168 --> 00:19:09.962
So I'm telling you in advance this time.

00:19:10.712 --> 00:19:12.839
From now on,
I will be even more relentless.

00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:15.592
I will not hesitate even for a moment.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.554
Let us leave it at that.

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:24.685
You could have

00:19:25.978 --> 00:19:27.062
avoided it.

00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:31.108
You could have told me about it.

00:19:31.483 --> 00:19:33.193
I didn't feel the need to avoid it.

00:19:33.277 --> 00:19:35.779
And it's nothing so pitiful
that I should need help.

00:19:37.447 --> 00:19:38.991
It is unfortunate that

00:19:39.074 --> 00:19:41.159
the ill man passed away
on the day of the wedding,

00:19:41.743 --> 00:19:44.579
but I was to live
the rest of my life comfortably,

00:19:44.663 --> 00:19:47.040
in their annex as the mistress.

00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.793
That was until our bodies were switched.

00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:53.672
All the more reason
to switch our bodies back.

00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:56.633
You have a comfortable life to live,
and I have tyranny to exercise.

00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:58.802
We each have duties to fulfill.

00:19:59.636 --> 00:20:01.346
That will be our agreement for now.

00:20:02.931 --> 00:20:04.641
Madam, are you all right?

00:20:06.727 --> 00:20:08.895
The old master has passed away?

00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:11.523
Then, what happens to Eun-jo?

00:20:11.606 --> 00:20:13.567
She's a young widow now.

00:20:14.735 --> 00:20:16.611
Can we bring her back?

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:18.030
She's married now.

00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:19.614
She's part of their family.

00:20:19.698 --> 00:20:22.326
That means she must live with them
for the rest of her life.

00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:26.455
Unless she runs away somewhere far away.

00:20:28.373 --> 00:20:29.750
Runs away?

00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:38.008
I've never read a story like this
in any book.

00:20:38.091 --> 00:20:41.428
I've never heard a myth
or folk tale like this either.

00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:43.263
I've been thinking about it,

00:20:44.014 --> 00:20:45.432
and this isn't the work of a human.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.643
So this was done by something greater?

00:20:48.727 --> 00:20:49.895
As a punishment?

00:20:49.978 --> 00:20:51.646
Well, it's clearly not a blessing.

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:58.487
I won't be mad at you,

00:20:59.071 --> 00:21:00.489
so please be honest with me.

00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:02.824
Have you done something bad lately?

00:21:04.326 --> 00:21:05.243
No.

00:21:06.495 --> 00:21:09.831
And even if I have,
why would you be punished with me?

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:14.044
The question is
why it's you and me, of all people.

00:21:18.006 --> 00:21:19.383
What's your date of birth?

00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:21.635
Gyehae day, Gyeongja month, Byeongo year.

00:21:21.718 --> 00:21:24.137
That's different from mine.

00:21:27.307 --> 00:21:29.267
So are we turning to superstition?

00:21:29.643 --> 00:21:30.477
Then, follow me.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.533
You're a physician.
Can't you approach it scientifically?

00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:46.243
Quiet. You'll bring bad energy.

00:21:49.162 --> 00:21:50.163
There is

00:21:50.497 --> 00:21:51.998
a virgin ghost in your body.

00:21:54.084 --> 00:21:55.085
Do you see it?

00:21:56.253 --> 00:21:57.879
Are you really seeing something?

00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:02.008
That's why he knows
what women want better than women.

00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:04.928
You.

00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:07.931
You're a philanderer, aren't you?

00:22:11.393 --> 00:22:12.477
Get up. Let's go.

00:22:14.688 --> 00:22:16.231
Let's do a ritual.

00:22:16.314 --> 00:22:18.066
I will exorcise the ghost.

00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:19.401
Listen,

00:22:19.484 --> 00:22:22.279
I have no intention
of letting this lady leave my body.

00:22:23.196 --> 00:22:24.906
Why don't we try the ritual?

00:22:25.657 --> 00:22:27.450
Once the spirit is out of the body,

00:22:27.534 --> 00:22:29.202
we can see what we can do.

00:22:29.286 --> 00:22:30.954
What if it never comes back?

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:32.831
I have no interest
in seeing the other world.

00:22:36.209 --> 00:22:38.086
What if it wasn't our souls
that were switched,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.629
but our bodies?

00:22:40.463 --> 00:22:41.339
What?

00:22:41.798 --> 00:22:43.633
In that case, we must use our bodies.

00:22:54.603 --> 00:22:57.355
Take my hand, sincerely and solemnly.

00:23:25.508 --> 00:23:26.384
Do you feel anything?

00:23:27.093 --> 00:23:27.928
Not at all.

00:23:29.846 --> 00:23:31.556
You said we should use our bodies.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.391
Just holding hands won't do anything.

00:23:34.142 --> 00:23:35.310
So what do you suggest we do?

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:37.270
Don't take this the wrong way.

00:23:37.812 --> 00:23:38.813
Take what?

00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:59.125
Could you try to meet me halfway?

00:23:59.209 --> 00:24:00.252
What?

00:24:00.335 --> 00:24:01.169
Right.

00:24:26.486 --> 00:24:28.613
Do you feel anything?

00:24:29.322 --> 00:24:31.199
Yes, it's quite loud.

00:24:34.202 --> 00:24:36.329
I didn't know my heartbeat was so loud.

00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:38.206
Is this a joke to you?

00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:40.667
I like the sound of it.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.586
Listen to it all you want
when you're back.

00:24:44.546 --> 00:24:46.047
So it's not our bodies either.

00:24:49.426 --> 00:24:51.011
What time was it when we were switched?

00:24:52.304 --> 00:24:53.930
Around the curfew hour yesterday.

00:24:58.268 --> 00:25:00.228
Is that when we will switch back?

00:25:00.312 --> 00:25:01.855
Is this just a nightmare?

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:04.274
It's the curfew hour!

00:25:11.364 --> 00:25:12.490
It seems like the nightmare…

00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:15.994
…will be a long one.

00:25:19.205 --> 00:25:20.749
Blast.

00:25:22.792 --> 00:25:25.253
Earlier, you said it couldn't be
the work of a human.

00:25:25.337 --> 00:25:28.631
That means nothing a human does will help.

00:25:28.715 --> 00:25:30.425
Can we even continue to live like this?

00:25:30.508 --> 00:25:32.302
Without knowing
when we'll be switched back?

00:25:33.219 --> 00:25:35.221
Your Highness, there you were!

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.602
Your Highness's quarters
are in great uproar.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:42.729
It's you again.

00:25:43.396 --> 00:25:44.856
I will say no more.

00:25:45.982 --> 00:25:48.109
Your face said it all.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:49.444
What?

00:25:49.527 --> 00:25:51.821
It's obvious
that I'm the one being dragged out.

00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:53.782
And you look like
you're about to blame me.

00:25:53.865 --> 00:25:55.450
Blame this wretch. He clung to me.

00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:57.035
This wretch?

00:25:57.118 --> 00:25:59.537
Remember whose mouth
you're using to speak now.

00:25:59.996 --> 00:26:02.082
If it's right, does it matter
whose mouth says it?

00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:05.043
Look.

00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:07.587
Ignore him and talk to me, sir.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.422
- Pardon?
- I mean, talk to me.

00:26:09.506 --> 00:26:10.632
Yes.

00:26:10.715 --> 00:26:13.385
The palace is in an uproar right now.

00:26:13.968 --> 00:26:14.803
Why?

00:26:14.886 --> 00:26:17.347
Her Majesty has ordered you
to return at once.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.848
Her Majesty? Why?

00:26:20.475 --> 00:26:21.643
Tell Her Majesty that

00:26:21.726 --> 00:26:24.521
he can't go right now
due to the circumstances.

00:26:24.604 --> 00:26:26.689
It is not your place to meddle.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.317
He only listens to you. You say it.

00:26:29.401 --> 00:26:30.318
You?

00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:32.862
Her Majesty stopped eating last night

00:26:32.946 --> 00:26:35.115
and says she will not eat
until you're there.

00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:36.616
Because of me?

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:38.701
Who else could it be?

00:26:39.744 --> 00:26:42.330
What trouble did you get yourself into?

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:47.335
There's no dignity,

00:26:47.419 --> 00:26:49.712
grace or any pretext whatsoever.

00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:52.424
Why does it have to be revealed
when I'm in this body?

00:26:58.221 --> 00:27:00.557
Go and tell Her Majesty
that he's coming back.

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:07.313
So…

00:27:08.606 --> 00:27:11.443
It seems like you must go back,

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.945
Your Highness.

00:27:15.697 --> 00:27:17.073
Your Highness?

00:27:19.409 --> 00:27:21.494
Yes, that's you.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.621
The Grand Prince.

00:27:41.347 --> 00:27:42.474
So, you're saying

00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:45.935
you're the late King's second son?

00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:48.605
Yes.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.275
And the young brother
of His Majesty, the current king.

00:27:53.026 --> 00:27:54.068
That's right.

00:27:54.152 --> 00:27:55.278
In other words,

00:27:56.237 --> 00:27:57.655
you're the prince of Joseon.

00:27:59.824 --> 00:28:01.910
You seem pretty surprised.

00:28:01.993 --> 00:28:03.661
'Cause I'm handsome, like the rumors say?

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:11.628
You woke up in a palace.

00:28:12.212 --> 00:28:14.881
I thought you'd guess that much.

00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:23.598
You've become really quiet.

00:28:25.975 --> 00:28:28.436
I don't know what to say either.

00:28:29.854 --> 00:28:32.690
I can't help but hold my tongue

00:28:33.066 --> 00:28:36.236
under the weight
of the Grand Prince's name.

00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:38.363
Don't be like that. It's not like you.

00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:42.659
I'm trying to remember
everything I've said so far.

00:28:42.742 --> 00:28:44.536
Would any of that
be considered high treason?

00:28:44.619 --> 00:28:46.913
If that is the case,
would I be granted time to atone?

00:28:47.455 --> 00:28:48.665
Just act as usual.

00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:51.334
Act as usual and get my head chopped off?

00:28:52.001 --> 00:28:53.002
Is that a joke?

00:28:55.421 --> 00:28:56.548
All my life,

00:28:56.631 --> 00:28:59.259
I've never been anywhere
near the royal family, ever.

00:28:59.342 --> 00:29:01.553
Then, all of a sudden,
I'm here with someone

00:29:01.636 --> 00:29:04.264
at the very center of the royal family,
at its very top.

00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:05.557
Imagine how shocked I must be.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.475
That is exactly why I didn't tell you.

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:11.104
Because I knew it would make anyone
feel pressured and uncomfortable.

00:29:11.604 --> 00:29:14.440
I didn't hide it
because it was impressive or anything.

00:29:16.734 --> 00:29:18.403
This is my royal command.

00:29:18.486 --> 00:29:21.072
Treat me like before.
And I tolerate no disobedience.

00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:24.576
When I woke up in the palace,

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:26.870
I thought you were here on work
because you're an aide.

00:29:26.953 --> 00:29:28.538
Who'd think the palace is your home?

00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:31.207
There are probably no more
than a dozen people who live there.

00:29:33.835 --> 00:29:35.336
There are more than ten, at least.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.547
I'm not in a position to say this,
because I lied too,

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.340
but this is just not a good time.

00:29:39.924 --> 00:29:41.759
You can refuse if you want.

00:29:41.843 --> 00:29:42.969
What?

00:29:43.052 --> 00:29:46.264
How could you say something so unfilial
when your mother is refusing to eat?

00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:48.766
The owner of that body

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.268
isn't exactly a filial son anyway.

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:52.687
So do you want me

00:29:53.187 --> 00:29:55.857
to starve the Queen of this country
to death?

00:29:57.066 --> 00:29:59.277
I'm not refusing to go.
I'm asking what I should do.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.237
Come on. It's almost dawn.

00:30:01.738 --> 00:30:03.072
Just do as I say.

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:07.952
First, put your hands behind your back.

00:30:09.037 --> 00:30:10.538
Keep your back straight at all times,

00:30:11.497 --> 00:30:13.082
and look as arrogant as possible.

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:14.959
What?

00:30:16.419 --> 00:30:17.879
Didn't you say he was coming?

00:30:18.296 --> 00:30:19.297
There comes His Highness.

00:30:32.644 --> 00:30:34.270
She must be Her Majesty.

00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:42.695
Don't be nervous. Just do as I was told.

00:30:43.363 --> 00:30:46.407
Whatever I say, it doesn't come from me.

00:30:46.491 --> 00:30:49.661
It seems Your Majesty's stubbornness
deepens with age.

00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:52.121
Why did you stop eating?

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.123
It'll only ruin your fair face.

00:30:54.832 --> 00:30:56.584
Where did you sleep the last two nights?

00:30:57.168 --> 00:30:58.252
I can't believe this.

00:30:58.336 --> 00:31:00.338
My harsh words didn't surprise her at all.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.674
Somewhere where the sky is my roof

00:31:02.757 --> 00:31:04.634
and the wind is my blanket.

00:31:06.719 --> 00:31:08.763
With that lady as your companion?

00:31:08.846 --> 00:31:09.847
That lady?

00:31:10.556 --> 00:31:12.600
Hey, you didn't mention any lady.
Who is she?

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:13.935
I don't know either.

00:31:14.018 --> 00:31:15.019
Then, who knows?

00:31:15.103 --> 00:31:18.481
Last night, I saw you
frolicking around the palace,

00:31:18.564 --> 00:31:21.067
hand in hand with this lady.

00:31:27.073 --> 00:31:28.825
Your Majesty, it's a misunderstanding.

00:31:28.908 --> 00:31:30.743
There is nothing between that lady and me.

00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:32.537
I only met her once.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.914
No, I didn't meet her only once.

00:31:34.998 --> 00:31:35.832
I met her twice.

00:31:35.915 --> 00:31:37.500
Don't look so flustered.

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:38.543
Dignity.

00:31:39.335 --> 00:31:40.962
I will ask her myself.

00:31:41.045 --> 00:31:42.672
Which family does she belong to?

00:31:43.214 --> 00:31:44.173
Play innocent.

00:31:44.257 --> 00:31:45.800
I don't know. I really don't.

00:31:45.883 --> 00:31:49.178
Must I question all ladies in this country
to get you to talk?

00:31:51.556 --> 00:31:54.517
Tell her it was just one night's fun
so you don't know her name.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.020
It was just one night's fun
so I don't know her name.

00:31:57.103 --> 00:31:58.563
What?

00:31:59.022 --> 00:32:01.107
Are you saying you indulged in
so-called free love,

00:32:01.816 --> 00:32:03.192
like the rabble?

00:32:03.276 --> 00:32:04.652
- I'm one of them.
- I'm one of them.

00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:08.364
What?

00:32:10.575 --> 00:32:11.617
How dare you?

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.870
I apologize for making your son like that.

00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:16.789
No, I mean…

00:32:16.873 --> 00:32:18.708
I apologize for acting like the rabble.

00:32:20.376 --> 00:32:21.919
You're the Grand Prince.

00:32:22.503 --> 00:32:24.714
You are to be virtuous
and serve as an example.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.055
Send for the royal physician at once.

00:32:32.597 --> 00:32:34.057
You're unwell as it is.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.142
Why did you stop eating
and make things worse…

00:32:44.317 --> 00:32:46.319
That's what His Highness said

00:32:46.402 --> 00:32:49.947
over and over
because he was so deeply concerned.

00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:51.824
So it just rolled off my tongue.

00:32:52.658 --> 00:32:54.327
Right. I did do that.

00:32:55.244 --> 00:32:56.412
Are you all right?

00:32:56.954 --> 00:32:58.206
Get your hands off me.

00:32:58.289 --> 00:32:59.540
What a scoundrel.

00:32:59.624 --> 00:33:02.752
How dare you treat a precious young lady
as a mere one-night stand?

00:33:03.211 --> 00:33:05.296
That is not how I raised you.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.092
If you have any respect for me,

00:33:09.175 --> 00:33:10.968
at least pretend to obey the confinement.

00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:13.137
I will do so.

00:33:19.685 --> 00:33:21.604
You're a court lady I haven't seen before.

00:33:22.647 --> 00:33:23.564
Me?

00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:28.152
I'm the new court lady
appointed to His Highness' quarters.

00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:30.738
What is your name?

00:33:35.868 --> 00:33:37.328
My name is Hong-si, Your Majesty.

00:33:51.968 --> 00:33:52.927
Hong-si?

00:33:53.886 --> 00:33:55.304
What's wrong with that?

00:33:55.388 --> 00:33:58.474
{\an8}CONDOLENCES

00:34:02.895 --> 00:34:05.022
My condolences
on your grandfather's passing.

00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:07.942
It's because the wrong woman
married into this family.

00:34:12.947 --> 00:34:14.824
If you want a drink, come out.

00:34:17.118 --> 00:34:18.035
Jae-i,

00:34:18.995 --> 00:34:20.538
I'll pass on the drink.

00:34:21.873 --> 00:34:22.874
Look over there.

00:34:26.419 --> 00:34:27.545
She's Eun-jo's mother.

00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:30.256
Could you let her see Eun-jo briefly?

00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:45.146
I kept it secret
'cause she said she'd visit her mother.

00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:52.278
It's my fault.

00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:54.780
I caused Her Majesty's displeasure.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:57.783
Don't worry. This isn't the first time.

00:34:59.327 --> 00:35:01.454
We can't continue to stay together.

00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:03.080
I must take your body

00:35:03.164 --> 00:35:05.625
to your mother's place
by tomorrow morning.

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:09.462
Staying in the annex during mourning
isn't suspicious,

00:35:09.545 --> 00:35:10.880
but tomorrow is the funeral.

00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:13.007
You should at least show your face.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.385
Could you do that for me?

00:35:16.886 --> 00:35:18.221
You said you must keep it.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.350
I don't understand what you must
keep through that marriage, though.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.063
What about you?
Do you think you can be by yourself?

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.023
I should be able to.

00:35:29.106 --> 00:35:32.318
We must find a way to go back
without disrupting our everyday lives.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.076
Then, we need to pull another all-nighter.

00:35:46.499 --> 00:35:47.375
Who is she?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.543
Why does she act like a court lady?

00:35:49.627 --> 00:35:51.379
What are they doing in there
for six hours?

00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:52.463
Tell me about it.

00:35:52.546 --> 00:35:53.673
As His Highness has ordered,

00:35:53.756 --> 00:35:56.717
if this gets out,
everyone will be punished severely.

00:36:16.195 --> 00:36:18.489
I think I've learned enough
about the people around you.

00:36:18.572 --> 00:36:21.534
I'll handle the rest with my quick wits.

00:36:24.578 --> 00:36:26.414
By the way…

00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:29.959
Anything else you'd like to add?

00:36:30.668 --> 00:36:33.462
I wasn't sure how to bring this up, but…

00:36:34.505 --> 00:36:35.339
What is it?

00:36:36.549 --> 00:36:37.675
Our bodies.

00:36:38.259 --> 00:36:39.593
Let's say we didn't see anything.

00:36:40.386 --> 00:36:41.304
I see.

00:36:41.887 --> 00:36:43.139
Now you want privacy?

00:36:44.015 --> 00:36:45.266
But we already saw everything.

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:47.643
No, I didn't see anything.

00:36:47.727 --> 00:36:49.687
I'm not the one who saw it.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.523
I saw it through your eyes,
so you're the one who saw it.

00:36:52.606 --> 00:36:55.234
It sounds like you saw it very closely.

00:36:56.444 --> 00:36:57.653
It's the same with my body.

00:36:57.737 --> 00:36:59.405
You didn't touch my body.

00:36:59.488 --> 00:37:01.115
It's my hands that touched my body.

00:37:02.366 --> 00:37:03.451
Well…

00:37:04.327 --> 00:37:05.828
Those are my memories, though.

00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:06.746
Look here.

00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:08.205
I'm confident.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.833
You know what I mean.

00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:13.210
I didn't see it.

00:37:13.294 --> 00:37:14.795
I didn't see it through my eyes.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.757
Now, call Dae-chu in.

00:37:19.091 --> 00:37:20.051
What?

00:37:20.593 --> 00:37:21.844
Are you avoiding my question?

00:37:27.308 --> 00:37:28.976
I will walk from here.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:29.977
People might see me.

00:37:31.145 --> 00:37:32.188
Do as you please.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.859
Dae-chu…

00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:38.486
I mean,

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.154
Officer Seo.

00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:44.742
Make sure you stay
by His Highness' side at all times.

00:37:44.825 --> 00:37:46.577
See if he trembles with fear,

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.412
runs about flustered,

00:37:48.496 --> 00:37:50.456
keeps to his meals,

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:52.416
or cries alone

00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:55.586
at night.

00:37:56.921 --> 00:37:57.963
Keep a close eye on him.

00:37:58.589 --> 00:38:00.800
I don't need the advice. That's what I do.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.510
Great then.

00:38:04.762 --> 00:38:07.348
I know I should not meddle in matters
between a man and a woman…

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.185
I mean, I know it's beyond my concern,

00:38:11.602 --> 00:38:12.645
but if you ever

00:38:12.728 --> 00:38:15.147
hurt or take advantage of His Highness,

00:38:15.231 --> 00:38:17.608
then I will step up.

00:38:17.983 --> 00:38:19.860
Have you been always this cool
behind my back?

00:38:20.361 --> 00:38:21.237
What?

00:38:21.904 --> 00:38:23.280
You're one charming man.

00:38:36.669 --> 00:38:37.628
Wait!

00:38:38.045 --> 00:38:39.255
Stop what you were thinking.

00:38:42.675 --> 00:38:43.759
YOUNG MASTER

00:38:43.843 --> 00:38:44.677
MOTHER

00:38:49.432 --> 00:38:51.308
Mother, Young Master.

00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:53.936
What brings you here?

00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:57.106
You little rascal.
Where have you been running around?

00:38:57.189 --> 00:38:59.984
Young Master speaks before he thinks.

00:39:00.067 --> 00:39:01.235
So ignore his harsh words.

00:39:01.318 --> 00:39:03.070
He's kind by nature.

00:39:05.948 --> 00:39:07.867
You could get kicked out for this.

00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:09.660
That's exactly my wish.

00:39:09.743 --> 00:39:10.744
What?

00:39:11.662 --> 00:39:14.039
What matters is that she came back safely.

00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:18.335
I went to tend to a sick patient.

00:39:19.003 --> 00:39:21.964
That was very thoughtful of you.

00:39:22.047 --> 00:39:24.383
You and your nosy nature.

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:26.260
Did you have to do this now?

00:39:26.343 --> 00:39:28.262
The one who has passed is gone,

00:39:28.345 --> 00:39:29.763
but the living must go on.

00:39:29.847 --> 00:39:31.390
You don't even sound sad.

00:39:32.641 --> 00:39:36.187
It's almost like you were waiting
for the Old Master to pass.

00:39:38.481 --> 00:39:40.399
Look at her, Madam.

00:39:40.483 --> 00:39:41.984
She didn't even answer.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.028
I get it.

00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:46.947
This is why you lied
about who you were marrying.

00:39:47.031 --> 00:39:49.033
You must've been counting the days.

00:39:49.116 --> 00:39:52.620
I should have known when you insisted,
despite Madam's objections.

00:39:54.914 --> 00:39:55.956
Did I

00:39:56.499 --> 00:39:58.417
hide it

00:39:59.001 --> 00:40:00.878
even from my family?

00:40:01.837 --> 00:40:03.047
Are you playing innocent now?

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.091
Be honest with me.
You just wanted a higher status.

00:40:08.802 --> 00:40:10.846
Yes, apparently.

00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:13.766
Madam.

00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:15.059
Let's go.

00:40:15.142 --> 00:40:16.769
We don't have to worry about her.

00:40:25.444 --> 00:40:26.612
Can we talk for a moment?

00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:30.824
All she cares about is me and my family.

00:40:33.827 --> 00:40:37.081
So I married into this family

00:40:37.164 --> 00:40:38.707
against your wishes.

00:40:40.209 --> 00:40:44.004
Once you decide to do something,
you do it no matter what.

00:40:45.464 --> 00:40:48.300
I didn't try to stop you again
because I knew you wouldn't listen.

00:40:49.927 --> 00:40:51.136
I know that too well.

00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:53.722
You raised one stubborn girl.

00:40:56.183 --> 00:40:57.768
But now that I look back,

00:40:58.143 --> 00:41:01.647
I may have used that
as an excuse to let you go.

00:41:02.898 --> 00:41:05.109
I truly have no shame.

00:41:10.698 --> 00:41:12.950
I really don't understand.

00:41:14.827 --> 00:41:16.328
How is your daughter

00:41:17.371 --> 00:41:19.748
supposed to feel right now?

00:41:21.792 --> 00:41:23.294
You poor thing.

00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:26.505
Of course, you don't understand.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.717
It's because you buried everything

00:41:30.092 --> 00:41:32.094
beneath the words "I'm fine."

00:41:32.553 --> 00:41:34.388
You buried your heart.

00:41:43.439 --> 00:41:44.440
Your Highness.

00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:51.155
I watched her go in.

00:41:52.781 --> 00:41:54.867
You must be tired. Get some rest.

00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:57.036
By the way,

00:41:57.995 --> 00:42:00.831
I learned something
while searching for Your Highness.

00:42:01.624 --> 00:42:02.458
Do you know

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.586
who that woman

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:07.963
was wed to?

00:42:10.966 --> 00:42:12.426
I ended up finding out

00:42:13.677 --> 00:42:15.262
without meaning to.

00:42:18.682 --> 00:42:20.684
I wish I'd never found out.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:22.770
Your Highness,

00:42:23.479 --> 00:42:24.813
are you all right?

00:42:26.273 --> 00:42:27.274
I'm fine.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.360
I will be fine.

00:42:31.195 --> 00:42:34.239
Does this mean
she always puts others before herself?

00:42:35.866 --> 00:42:37.284
It's all my fault.

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:40.412
All I ever taught her

00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:42.456
was to endure and hold on.

00:42:47.044 --> 00:42:48.462
I'm sorry, Eun-jo.

00:42:53.842 --> 00:42:55.928
It seems like my mother is the one

00:42:57.096 --> 00:42:58.472
I must protect.

00:42:59.973 --> 00:43:02.309
No, don't.

00:43:05.854 --> 00:43:06.897
Take this.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.483
I borrowed it from the Director
of the Office of Royal Decrees.

00:43:12.778 --> 00:43:13.779
What's this money for?

00:43:16.365 --> 00:43:17.574
As you said,

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.869
you're a concubine in a powerful family,
so you'll live comfortably

00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:24.039
without worrying about food or money.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.125
But listen, Eun-jo.

00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:28.711
If you ever

00:43:29.336 --> 00:43:31.046
come to regret

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.425
your comfortable life
and want to run away,

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:36.468
take this.

00:43:37.886 --> 00:43:40.681
I hear that no one can find
those who flee to the Ming.

00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:47.146
Don't think about me or the lord

00:43:47.938 --> 00:43:49.481
and go wherever you wish.

00:43:50.816 --> 00:43:53.152
Could you give your mother
that one promise?

00:44:03.454 --> 00:44:05.497
The beautiful daughter you know

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:07.291
would have made the promise.

00:44:09.209 --> 00:44:10.461
But right now,

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.838
I can promise you this.

00:44:14.631 --> 00:44:15.883
What is it?

00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:23.015
I'll make sure
she never has to lift a finger.

00:44:37.654 --> 00:44:39.531
How is that thing going?

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.117
I used the name
of a thief called Gil-dong.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.956
Gil-dong?

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.292
He's the one who robbed
the Chief Censor's storehouse.

00:44:50.876 --> 00:44:53.962
The Chief Censor spoke bitterly about him,
even to his last days,

00:44:54.046 --> 00:44:55.756
so no one will find it suspicious.

00:45:03.013 --> 00:45:04.014
Black Sword.

00:45:09.019 --> 00:45:10.437
How are things at the constabulary?

00:45:10.521 --> 00:45:12.606
They're investigating
those around the Chief Censor.

00:45:13.774 --> 00:45:16.610
Keep a close watch over it.
Do not delegate this.

00:45:17.236 --> 00:45:18.111
Yes, sir.

00:45:23.158 --> 00:45:25.118
Is it this country

00:45:25.661 --> 00:45:27.162
that you covet?

00:45:27.246 --> 00:45:28.372
How dare you?

00:45:28.914 --> 00:45:31.083
Do you have no fear of consequences?

00:45:31.166 --> 00:45:32.376
If His Majesty finds out,

00:45:32.918 --> 00:45:36.964
your entire family,
all three generations, will be quartered.

00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:39.800
If you wish to live,

00:45:40.133 --> 00:45:43.470
give me half of Joseon.

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:49.434
Greed

00:45:50.018 --> 00:45:52.563
leads only to destruction
in the hands of the foolish.

00:45:55.774 --> 00:45:57.943
Engrave these words upon your heart,

00:45:58.026 --> 00:46:00.028
though that heart will soon rot away.

00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:52.331
I can run into other royal family members
during the day,

00:46:52.414 --> 00:46:55.917
so I will learn my way around the palace
while everyone's asleep.

00:47:05.385 --> 00:47:06.845
Lady Jang.

00:47:06.928 --> 00:47:09.598
She must be Geum-nok.
I've heard many rumors about her.

00:47:31.578 --> 00:47:32.954
I smell medicinal herbs.

00:47:34.247 --> 00:47:35.499
Where is it coming from?

00:47:46.134 --> 00:47:47.803
I've never smelled anything like this.

00:47:48.387 --> 00:47:52.557
The smoke from burning medicinal herbs
can ease certain symptoms,

00:47:52.641 --> 00:47:55.394
but filling a room with so much smoke
that it spills outside

00:47:55.477 --> 00:47:56.895
can be dangerous.

00:47:56.978 --> 00:47:58.438
Who is getting this treatment?

00:48:00.565 --> 00:48:01.817
"Gangnyeong Hall."

00:48:03.694 --> 00:48:04.903
His Majesty's bedchamber.

00:48:06.196 --> 00:48:08.782
Avoid His Majesty at all costs.

00:48:10.242 --> 00:48:11.451
No.

00:48:11.535 --> 00:48:14.204
Wrong time to be nosy,
wrong person to be nosy with.

00:48:16.039 --> 00:48:18.792
GANGNYEONG HALL

00:48:24.923 --> 00:48:26.007
Your Highness.

00:48:27.134 --> 00:48:28.635
Quiet.

00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:38.145
No one must know that I'm here.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:41.231
Yes, Your Highness.

00:48:42.899 --> 00:48:45.277
About the treatment
His Majesty is receiving…

00:48:55.787 --> 00:48:56.872
The sound.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:59.249
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:01.251
He suffers from skin affliction?

00:49:01.334 --> 00:49:02.335
Yes, Your Highness.

00:49:03.962 --> 00:49:05.130
What's the matter?

00:49:05.213 --> 00:49:08.216
I said be quiet.
You'll awaken His Majesty.

00:49:27.694 --> 00:49:30.197
Your Majesty?

00:49:42.167 --> 00:49:44.127
You wanted to check the medicinal herbs?

00:49:46.046 --> 00:49:47.047
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:49:47.756 --> 00:49:48.965
I was going for a walk and…

00:49:50.383 --> 00:49:51.259
Your Majesty,

00:49:51.343 --> 00:49:52.969
we need to get the smoke out first.

00:49:53.595 --> 00:49:55.722
Help me air the room.

00:49:56.765 --> 00:49:58.016
You too, now.

00:50:04.648 --> 00:50:06.233
What are you doing?

00:50:08.443 --> 00:50:09.361
Your Majesty,

00:50:09.903 --> 00:50:12.364
when overused,
any treatment can cause side effects.

00:50:12.447 --> 00:50:14.866
Are you questioning
the royal physician's treatment?

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:15.867
I wouldn't dare.

00:50:15.951 --> 00:50:17.661
But in my experience,
for skin afflictions,

00:50:17.744 --> 00:50:19.871
a tonic brewed with cattle gallstones
and honeysuckle,

00:50:19.955 --> 00:50:22.499
along with ointment and fresh air,
are most effective.

00:50:22.582 --> 00:50:24.376
I meant you shouldn't rely
only on new herbs,

00:50:24.459 --> 00:50:26.711
but use these proven treatments as well.

00:50:27.712 --> 00:50:30.632
You seem to know
quite a bit about my condition.

00:50:33.635 --> 00:50:35.470
You seem disappointed.

00:50:35.554 --> 00:50:37.681
Because it isn't fatal enough to kill me.

00:50:38.348 --> 00:50:39.182
Pardon?

00:50:39.975 --> 00:50:41.351
That's not what it is.

00:50:41.434 --> 00:50:44.521
In the thick smoke,
I could see Your Majesty's suffering.

00:50:46.356 --> 00:50:47.274
What?

00:50:49.067 --> 00:50:51.987
This skin affliction may appear
as small scars on the surface,

00:50:52.737 --> 00:50:55.407
but it slowly erodes
the patient's everyday life.

00:50:56.324 --> 00:50:58.368
And when prolonged,
it erodes their life as a whole.

00:50:59.452 --> 00:51:01.371
The scar on the patient's body

00:51:01.705 --> 00:51:05.125
scars their hearts as well.

00:51:06.167 --> 00:51:08.753
So in hopes of easing that burden,
even a little,

00:51:09.504 --> 00:51:11.381
I forgot my place and spoke out of turn.

00:51:20.849 --> 00:51:23.935
You sounded pretty sincere.
I was almost moved.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.062
Go now.

00:51:27.063 --> 00:51:28.231
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:51:38.033 --> 00:51:39.326
That was His Majesty?

00:51:41.328 --> 00:51:43.288
Is he not on good terms
with the Grand Prince?

00:51:56.343 --> 00:51:57.761
I should go back to my chamber now.

00:51:58.678 --> 00:51:59.846
It's already the curfew…

00:52:06.269 --> 00:52:09.397
Things have been so hectic
that I completely forgot about Gil-dong.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:12.442
I wonder if they caught
the actual murderer.

00:52:13.151 --> 00:52:16.571
I can't leave the palace
because I'm under confinement.

00:52:17.739 --> 00:52:18.865
What do I do?

00:52:20.784 --> 00:52:22.243
What do you mean, it's not Gil-dong?

00:52:22.327 --> 00:52:24.579
His name was written in blood.

00:52:24.663 --> 00:52:27.457
We're investigating those
who may have grudges against the offender.

00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:29.542
Did you just call my husband

00:52:30.168 --> 00:52:32.087
"offender"?

00:52:32.837 --> 00:52:34.923
He died an unjust death!

00:52:35.006 --> 00:52:37.008
How dare you call him an offender?

00:52:37.092 --> 00:52:38.760
How dare you?

00:52:38.843 --> 00:52:40.178
Escort her home.

00:52:40.261 --> 00:52:41.096
Yes, sir.

00:52:41.721 --> 00:52:43.515
Let go of me!

00:52:53.817 --> 00:52:54.693
Gil-dong?

00:52:55.735 --> 00:52:56.778
Get him!

00:52:56.861 --> 00:53:00.365
Gil-dong, this wretch!

00:53:05.787 --> 00:53:07.497
Don't kill him. We must take him alive!

00:53:19.592 --> 00:53:20.427
Sir.

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.595
Inform His Highness of this at once.

00:53:22.679 --> 00:53:23.555
Yes, sir.

00:54:01.718 --> 00:54:03.845
Chief Secretary Im Sa-hyeong's family.

00:54:05.096 --> 00:54:06.765
Somehow, I'm peeking into

00:54:06.848 --> 00:54:09.267
the most private family affairs
of Joseon's greatest schemer.

00:54:17.567 --> 00:54:18.485
Lady Jang?

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.958
What are you doing here,
dressed like that?

00:54:40.507 --> 00:54:43.426
It seems Grand Prince Dowol
found out about the herbs.

00:54:45.595 --> 00:54:46.805
Grand Prince Dowol?

00:54:48.098 --> 00:54:49.182
Yes.

00:54:49.766 --> 00:54:51.059
All the incense was removed.

00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:05.782
What was that?

00:55:05.865 --> 00:55:08.993
Why would my name
even come up in their conversation?

00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:11.287
- Oh, no. He's caught?
- They caught Gil-dong.

00:55:11.788 --> 00:55:14.541
- Gil-dong?
- Gil-dong was taken to the constabulary.

00:55:15.583 --> 00:55:17.877
This is so frustrating.

00:55:20.255 --> 00:55:21.297
Eun-jo!

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.299
Eun-jo.

00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:25.426
Are you coming from the burial rites?

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.512
How are you feeling? Are you all right?

00:55:28.012 --> 00:55:28.888
Yes.

00:55:28.972 --> 00:55:31.015
By the way, Gil-dong was caught?

00:55:31.474 --> 00:55:32.851
I just heard about it too.

00:55:32.934 --> 00:55:35.854
Gil-dong was shot with an arrow yesterday.

00:55:37.147 --> 00:55:37.981
What?

00:55:40.316 --> 00:55:41.359
Eun-jo.

00:55:42.569 --> 00:55:44.320
His Highness has disappeared again?

00:55:44.988 --> 00:55:48.116
I didn't hear any cough so I checked,
and he was already gone.

00:55:50.869 --> 00:55:52.370
The case is closed.

00:55:52.453 --> 00:55:53.371
Yes, sir.

00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.083
Wait!

00:55:58.751 --> 00:55:59.586
Physician Hong.

00:56:13.266 --> 00:56:15.810
This was Gil-dong?

00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:25.069
His Highness folded the bedding
and the clothes this neatly?

00:56:25.737 --> 00:56:26.946
That's not the only thing.

00:56:28.489 --> 00:56:30.116
He was cleaning!

00:56:31.034 --> 00:56:32.118
This is a grave matter.

00:56:33.286 --> 00:56:34.871
Find His Highness!

00:56:34.954 --> 00:56:35.872
Did something happen?

00:56:35.955 --> 00:56:36.956
You scared me.

00:56:37.665 --> 00:56:39.375
Where have you been?

00:56:39.459 --> 00:56:40.710
I went to the Royal Pharmacy.

00:56:40.793 --> 00:56:42.670
To have the tonic prepared
for Her Majesty.

00:56:42.754 --> 00:56:43.630
Pardon?

00:56:44.047 --> 00:56:47.133
I think I should do that much
to ease my guilt.

00:56:48.051 --> 00:56:50.261
Why did you fold the bedding
and the nightclothes?

00:56:51.262 --> 00:56:52.430
Because I woke up.

00:56:52.513 --> 00:56:53.890
You could have summoned us.

00:56:54.432 --> 00:56:57.018
Did Your Highness
put on your clothes yourself as well?

00:56:57.727 --> 00:56:59.729
Yes, so you could sleep longer.

00:57:01.648 --> 00:57:05.235
Please tell us if we have done
anything wrong, Your Highness!

00:57:05.318 --> 00:57:06.236
You did nothing wrong.

00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:08.279
Bring in the royal physician at once.

00:57:08.905 --> 00:57:09.989
Why are you doing this?

00:57:10.073 --> 00:57:11.074
Your Highness,

00:57:12.408 --> 00:57:14.661
Officer Park has reached the constabulary.

00:57:15.662 --> 00:57:17.247
Have they already received the message?

00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:23.169
He was struck by an arrow
and died on the spot.

00:57:24.754 --> 00:57:27.465
Gil-dong has died?

00:57:29.259 --> 00:57:30.343
And the fake Gil-dong?

00:57:30.927 --> 00:57:32.178
It's taken care of.

00:57:32.262 --> 00:57:34.597
Take care of the rest with your own hands.

00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:35.557
Yes, sir.

00:57:45.733 --> 00:57:46.776
It's finished.

00:57:49.153 --> 00:57:50.613
Farewell, Gil-dong.

00:57:51.155 --> 00:57:52.448
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

00:57:59.956 --> 00:58:02.125
Someone might come to collect

00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:04.127
the fake Gil-dong's body.

00:59:56.698 --> 00:59:58.366
{\an8}They were stored carefully.

00:59:58.449 --> 00:59:59.492
{\an8}Those…

00:59:59.575 --> 01:00:00.451
{\an8}I did that?

01:00:00.535 --> 01:00:01.869
{\an8}I kept them carefully?

01:00:01.953 --> 01:00:03.413
{\an8}Give me a break.

01:00:03.496 --> 01:00:05.039
{\an8}What am I to do with this?

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:08.418
{\an8}Should I have read the room
and waited before entering?

01:00:08.501 --> 01:00:11.045
{\an8}Yes. From now on,
count to ten before you enter.

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:14.215
{\an8}When you look at me,
I see turmoil in your eyes.

01:00:14.298 --> 01:00:15.341
{\an8}What are you trying to do?

01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:17.468
{\an8}I'm trying to say nothing should be done.

01:00:17.552 --> 01:00:20.471
{\an8}The Grand Prince keeps getting in the way.

01:00:20.555 --> 01:00:22.557
{\an8}You there, Grand Prince's court lady.
Halt.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.642
