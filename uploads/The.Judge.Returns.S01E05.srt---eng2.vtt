Who brought this?

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.252
That old woman...
who collects cardboard.

00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:46.705
You've seen her before. Right?

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:50.462
It was mixed in with the scrap paper she got.

00:00:50.462 --> 00:00:53.091
The fact that this was found
in the scrap pile is a secret.

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:56.091
Just forget it, okay?

00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:59.557
So this is... really that dangerous?

00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:00.673
That's kind of scary.

00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:02.962
Maybe I should've just thrown it away.

No.

It's about to rip.

- Welcome.
- Not much today.

- That's my son.
- He's handsome.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:23.928
I found the ledger.

00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:25.185
Okay!

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:27.354
I picked up the rest of them too.

00:02:27.354 --> 00:02:30.065
Someone had them tied up inside Ttajyo's house.

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:32.943
That had to be Director Lee Chang Hyo.

00:02:32.943 --> 00:02:34.278
Hey.

00:02:34.278 --> 00:02:36.321
What's so special about that ledger anyway?

00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:37.539
It's a list of draft dodgers

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.074
who were exempted using
Director Lee's false medical certificates.

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:44.160
Darn it. Some things never change.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.832
Back in our day, people dodged the draft

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.041
using family connections
and landed cushy assignments.

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:49.334
Then...

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:51.962
why would they keep a ledger
of their own crimes?

00:02:51.962 --> 00:02:53.797
Because crooks don't trust anyone.

00:02:53.797 --> 00:02:55.591
They assume everyone's just like them.

00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:56.842
So they're always

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:58.635
trying to get leverage on each other,

00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:01.889
not realizing it's their own weakness.

00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:17.915

Once he knows who's named in it,

00:12:13.106 --> 00:12:16.752
I also saw the insurance murder case
in the news.

00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:22.407
Have some.

00:12:22.407 --> 00:12:24.784
I was just doing my job.

00:12:24.784 --> 00:12:27.829
These days,
people who actually do their job are rare.

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:31.513
That's why you stood out to me.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.206
What do you think of this place?

00:12:36.255 --> 00:12:38.986
If you're going to be assigned
to the Seoul Central District Court,

00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:41.201
you'll be coming here often.

00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:43.845
As for your ticket to Seoul,

00:12:43.845 --> 00:12:46.541
this should take care of it.

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:50.560
Sounds like...

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.519
you know what's in the bag.

00:12:56.983 --> 00:12:59.402
It's something you don't need anymore.

00:12:59.402 --> 00:13:02.187
For the third cabinet, we appoint...

00:13:02.187 --> 00:13:06.368
Assemblyman Woo Gyo Hoon as Justice Minister.

00:13:10.205 --> 00:13:13.945
This will be pushed through
as the party's official position.

00:13:15.043 --> 00:13:16.419
His Excellency,

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:19.547
thank you.

00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:21.758
Prepare well for the confirmation hearing,

00:13:21.758 --> 00:13:23.635
and serve your country.

00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:25.135
I will dedicate myself completely

00:13:25.135 --> 00:13:29.114
as Justice Minister who serves this nation.

00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:42.971
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:13:54.874 --> 00:13:56.779
Everyone named in the draft-dodging ledger

00:13:56.779 --> 00:13:58.406
will become both fuel and sacrifice

00:13:58.406 --> 00:14:00.332
to turn Kang Shin Jin
into something untouchable.

00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:04.551
I can never let that ledger
fall into his hands.

00:14:04.551 --> 00:14:06.376
Supreme Court Justice Kim Jun Man,

00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:09.013
and the ruling party's floor leader,
and senior secretary...

00:14:09.013 --> 00:14:10.446
You could form an entire cabinet

00:14:10.446 --> 00:14:12.308
using just the names in that ledger.

00:14:12.308 --> 00:14:13.619
Ask any one of them,

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:16.146
and getting a ticket to Seoul wouldn't be hard.

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:18.739
Traffic's about to get bad.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:23.787
Won't you regret this?

00:14:28.783 --> 00:14:30.909
Sir,

00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:35.540
you've never really known regret, have you?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.326
People only understand true regret

00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:39.502
at the moment they die.

00:14:39.502 --> 00:14:42.680
That one irreversible moment.

00:14:46.593 --> 00:14:49.719
You sound like you've died before.

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.575
Of course not.

00:15:01.274 --> 00:15:02.692
Whether you were at the Blue House

00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:05.445
or here at Suojae,

00:15:05.445 --> 00:15:07.864
do you know what's stayed the same?

00:15:07.864 --> 00:15:09.032
That power in this country

00:15:09.032 --> 00:15:11.409
is still in your hands, sir.

00:15:11.409 --> 00:15:12.410
That's right.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.620
But...

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.455
there's something else.

00:15:15.455 --> 00:15:17.540
The people sitting in
that conference room earlier.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.667
They talk patriotism out loud,

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:21.920
but inside, all they care about is themselves.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.841
Funny how they never change.

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:34.849
From their kids' problems

00:15:34.849 --> 00:15:37.024
to bribes...

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:39.717
to women.

00:15:39.717 --> 00:15:43.330
This is intel on everyone
who comes in and out of Suojae.

00:15:44.275 --> 00:15:45.652
You'll handle it.

00:15:45.652 --> 00:15:47.862
Cover it up when issues come up.

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:52.003
And if someone looks like trouble,
take them out early using this.

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:54.290
Yes, sir.

00:15:57.914 --> 00:16:01.809
Do you know why I trust you with this?

00:16:01.809 --> 00:16:03.419
Because...

00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:06.941
you have files on me too, sir.

00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:08.716
Yeah.

00:16:08.716 --> 00:16:11.511
I guess you see money as just a tool.

00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:13.805
So instead of money,

00:16:13.805 --> 00:16:16.891
I decided to keep you in the shadow of power.

00:16:16.891 --> 00:16:19.345
That work for you?

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.020
I'll serve the country

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.972
with absolute loyalty under your shadow.

00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:29.404
Good.

00:16:29.404 --> 00:16:32.407
I offered him a move to Seoul,
but he turned it down.

00:16:32.407 --> 00:16:35.120
He seemed interested in the ledger.

00:16:35.868 --> 00:16:39.038
That complicates things.

00:16:39.038 --> 00:16:41.771
I'll reach out to him again soon.

00:16:43.668 --> 00:16:45.775
All right.

00:16:47.411 --> 00:16:49.285
Senior, I look forward to working with you.

00:16:49.285 --> 00:16:51.558
Oh, that's enough.

00:16:54.512 --> 00:16:55.930
Chief Kang.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.108
Okay, bye.

00:17:00.702 --> 00:17:02.935
Good work.

00:17:06.149 --> 00:17:07.275
By the way...

00:17:07.275 --> 00:17:08.359
Assemblyman Woo.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.778
Get over here.

00:17:10.778 --> 00:17:13.072
Brother, you should call me Minister Woo.

00:17:13.072 --> 00:17:15.061
Come on.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.844
Hello?

00:17:28.755 --> 00:17:30.965
Well done.

00:17:30.965 --> 00:17:33.785
Let's get dinner sometime soon.

00:17:40.099 --> 00:17:41.517
CEO Jang Tae Sik

00:17:41.517 --> 00:17:44.505
will be released with no charges.

00:17:45.697 --> 00:17:47.890
You are the best.

00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:18.057
Good afternoon, Chief Judge.

00:18:18.057 --> 00:18:20.697
Please take a look at this.

00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:24.102
What is it?

00:18:24.102 --> 00:18:26.504
My mother runs a scrap yard in Seoul.

00:18:26.504 --> 00:18:28.217
All kinds of things come through there.

00:18:28.217 --> 00:18:30.191
May I turn on the TV for a moment?

00:18:30.191 --> 00:18:32.231
Go ahead.

00:18:35.154 --> 00:18:37.156
Three suspects have turned themselves in

00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:39.450
for stealing jewelry worth two billion won

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.994
from a residence in Samseong dong,
Gangnam, Seoul.

00:18:41.994 --> 00:18:45.415
The victim is the home of
a well known hospital director.

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.315
The suspects include two delivery drivers

00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:49.515
who regularly visited the apartment,

00:18:49.515 --> 00:18:54.518
along with a three-time convicted
safecracker known as Ttajyo.

00:18:54.518 --> 00:18:56.258
Since the victim never reported the theft,

00:18:56.258 --> 00:18:58.204
police were unaware anything had been stolen.

00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.846
After the suspects' sudden confession,

00:18:59.846 --> 00:19:01.556
police rushed to contact the victim

00:19:01.556 --> 00:19:03.516
to confirm the loss.

00:19:03.516 --> 00:19:05.017
Some are now speculating

00:19:05.017 --> 00:19:06.955
that there may have been issues

00:19:06.955 --> 00:19:10.030
with the stolen items themselves.

00:19:11.524 --> 00:19:14.777
I'll be heading to Chungnam tomorrow.

00:19:14.777 --> 00:19:17.317
Make sure you bring it back.

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:19.699
This ledger names

00:19:19.699 --> 00:19:24.086
Supreme Court Justice Kim Jun Man,
even the son of a senior secretary.

00:19:24.705 --> 00:19:27.017
If this gets out,

00:19:27.017 --> 00:19:31.191
it'll be a huge burden on a president
with less than a year left in office.

00:19:31.786 --> 00:19:33.712
But...

00:19:35.649 --> 00:19:39.137
Why did you bring this to me?

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:42.290
This is more than I can handle.

00:19:44.015 --> 00:19:45.558
Because I believed

00:19:45.558 --> 00:19:48.504
you'd protect it.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.537
A poisoned chalice...

00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:02.485
I thought he was just a little tiger.

00:20:02.485 --> 00:20:05.591
He's trying to grab me by the throat.

00:20:17.837 --> 00:20:20.134
Military service

00:20:20.134 --> 00:20:23.137
is a sacred duty of every Korean man.

00:20:23.137 --> 00:20:26.557
Social status and power

00:20:26.557 --> 00:20:30.102
must never interfere with it.

00:20:30.102 --> 00:20:31.635
The courts of the Republic of Korea

00:20:31.635 --> 00:20:33.646
will deliver strict justice

00:20:33.646 --> 00:20:36.234
to everyone involved in draft dodging,

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:39.878
regardless of rank or position.

00:20:40.488 --> 00:20:41.599
The court

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:43.883
will not only punish
those who committed the offense,

00:20:43.883 --> 00:20:44.871
[His Excellency Park Kwang To]

00:20:44.871 --> 00:20:46.953
but also anyone who instigated it, aided it,

00:20:46.953 --> 00:20:50.017
or helped cover it up.

00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:52.487
There will be no special treatment.

00:20:52.487 --> 00:20:54.752
No leniency.

00:20:54.752 --> 00:20:56.420
I will now announce the names.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.800
Cho Hu Heon,
leader of the Daehan Joongsim Party.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.573
Supreme Court Justice Kim Jun Man.

00:21:04.428 --> 00:21:08.474
Assemblyman Lee Young Hyun
of the New Future National Party.

00:21:08.474 --> 00:21:11.769
Shin Tae Hyun, CEO of Youngryun Holdings.

00:21:11.769 --> 00:21:15.356
- Chief Judge Yeon Eun Woo of the Seoul High Court.
- This is insane.

00:21:15.356 --> 00:21:17.859
Kim Go Geum, CEO of Pyeongguk Steel.

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:20.332
What kind of lunatic does this?

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.414
Sir.

00:21:26.075 --> 00:21:28.261
If you were going to announce all of it anyway,

00:21:28.261 --> 00:21:29.704
why take out insurance?

00:21:29.704 --> 00:21:30.746
I don't know.

00:21:30.746 --> 00:21:32.290
I didn't expect the Chief Judge

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.532
to tell me to make the announcement myself.

00:21:34.532 --> 00:21:35.591
Still...

00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:37.970
you were impressive.

00:21:44.719 --> 00:21:46.204
When I checked the list

00:21:46.204 --> 00:21:49.031
to see who might get me a ticket to Seoul,

00:21:50.766 --> 00:21:52.446
I found my law school classmate.

00:21:52.446 --> 00:21:54.353
Painfully honest.

00:21:54.353 --> 00:21:56.444
He knows my family runs a scrap yard,

00:21:56.444 --> 00:21:57.658
so every time we met,

00:21:57.658 --> 00:22:00.860
he worried about
cardboard prices, scrap metal prices.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.064
He said it was a shame

00:22:02.064 --> 00:22:03.877
I didn't have a single relative
in the judiciary,

00:22:03.877 --> 00:22:06.317
that I'd be stuck bouncing around
district courts forever.

00:22:06.317 --> 00:22:08.990
He actually tried to comfort me.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.935
So I was hoping

00:22:10.935 --> 00:22:12.916
I'd get a chance to comfort him someday.

00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:15.625
This was perfect.

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:18.878
But singling out just one name
felt a little off.

00:22:18.878 --> 00:22:19.879
So I just...

00:22:19.879 --> 00:22:22.340
went ahead and did it.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.340
You...

00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:34.381
You expect me to believe that?

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.227
It's the truth.

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:44.695
That's a shame.

00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:47.698
I even brought an extra gift
with your ticket to Seoul.

00:22:47.698 --> 00:22:49.992
You should've come earlier.

00:22:49.992 --> 00:22:52.505
Still, no regrets.

00:22:53.204 --> 00:22:55.623
Whether it's a drama or real life,

00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:58.971
revenge is always the most satisfying.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:03.707
Calling out the names
of your old classmates from that list

00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:06.285
must've felt incredible.

00:23:07.802 --> 00:23:10.104
But...

00:23:10.721 --> 00:23:15.241
You probably upset
some very powerful people this time.

00:23:16.018 --> 00:23:18.364
Are you going to be okay?

00:23:19.313 --> 00:23:21.698
Of course not.

00:23:22.953 --> 00:23:24.610
That's why we set it up

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.331
so it looks like I was just following orders
from Chief Judge Baek

00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:29.209
and reading the list.

00:23:29.209 --> 00:23:32.320
You know, Chief Judge Baek
plans to stay here till the end.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.454
But me? I'm just getting started.

00:23:46.511 --> 00:23:48.771
I'm sorry.

00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:52.954
About the list being exposed?

00:23:52.954 --> 00:23:54.223
Or about...

00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:55.850
the list I have

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.913
being only half of it?

00:23:58.913 --> 00:24:02.440
Which one are you actually sorry about?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.091
I missed a few updates.

00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:05.651
That's on me.

00:24:05.651 --> 00:24:07.957
I'm sorry.

00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:10.489
You think I don't know you?

00:24:10.489 --> 00:24:14.335
You've never done sloppy work. Not once.

00:24:19.802 --> 00:24:21.959
So tell me.

00:24:21.959 --> 00:24:25.101
What else are you hiding in there?

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:30.319
Did I misjudge you?

00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:32.521
I'm sorry.

00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:37.254
It won't happen again.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.213
Let's hope the Hankuk Hospital director
knows how to keep his mouth shut.

00:24:49.213 --> 00:24:51.697
How much do you trust him?

00:24:51.697 --> 00:24:54.306
I'll take care of it. Cleanly.

00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:08.881
His Excellency.

00:25:08.881 --> 00:25:11.034
Let's have a seat.

00:25:11.675 --> 00:25:13.714
You too.

00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:16.972
What's the hearing schedule?

00:25:16.972 --> 00:25:19.475
About two weeks out.

00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:22.413
Then it'll be a war until then.

00:25:22.413 --> 00:25:26.090
The media will dig into your everything.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.107
Even if they hang me upside down,
time will still pass.

00:25:30.107 --> 00:25:31.645
No matter what they throw at me,

00:25:31.645 --> 00:25:33.226
I plan to hold out and explain everything

00:25:33.226 --> 00:25:34.865
on the day of the hearing.

00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:37.910
Still, you need to prepare properly.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.578
You'll support him.

00:25:39.578 --> 00:25:41.427
Yes, sir.

00:25:41.427 --> 00:25:43.165
His Excellency,

00:25:43.165 --> 00:25:46.252
the Ministry of Justice staff will be enough.

00:25:46.252 --> 00:25:49.880
You really think you can prep for a hearing
laying everything bare

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.906
in front of people you don't even know?

00:25:56.262 --> 00:25:58.347
Take care of what needs to be taken care of.

00:25:58.347 --> 00:25:59.890
Cover what needs to be covered.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.063
Yes, sir.

00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:17.074
The hearing prep office is

00:26:17.074 --> 00:26:19.201
in the Yeonheung Building in Jongno,

00:26:19.201 --> 00:26:21.036
so drop by when you have time.

00:26:21.036 --> 00:26:22.997
Still, it's a request from the President.

00:26:22.997 --> 00:26:26.102
You should at least go through the motions.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.006
Do people still use
things like this these days?

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.342
Looks like...

00:26:35.342 --> 00:26:39.755
thriftiness has been ingrained
in you since childhood.

00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:41.765
I guess so.

00:26:41.765 --> 00:26:44.512
People don't change easily.

00:26:46.858 --> 00:26:48.898
By the way...

00:26:48.898 --> 00:26:53.319
Is being sharp and adaptable
something you're born with too?

00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:55.279
You haven't even been at Suojae that long,

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:59.112
and you're already sitting right next to him.

00:27:02.067 --> 00:27:05.039
I don't mean anything by it.

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:07.208
When someone rises too fast,

00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:10.985
people start whispering.

00:27:13.386 --> 00:27:15.758
Anyway...

00:27:15.758 --> 00:27:20.346
I heard you grew up
in a hostess bar district in Cheongnyangni.

00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:22.919
I'll be in touch soon.

00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:25.931
All right.

00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:31.982
If you really grew up in a place like that,

00:27:31.982 --> 00:27:34.988
do you even know who your father is?

00:27:43.535 --> 00:27:47.041
What else are you hiding in there?

00:27:49.386 --> 00:27:52.108
Did I misjudge you?

00:27:52.753 --> 00:27:57.085
I heard you grew up
in a hostess bar district in Cheongnyangni.

00:28:06.225 --> 00:28:08.644
What is it?

00:28:08.644 --> 00:28:11.063
Yes, sir.

00:28:11.063 --> 00:28:13.023
It appears Judge Lee handing over the ledger

00:28:13.023 --> 00:28:15.109
was an impulsive move.

00:28:15.109 --> 00:28:18.195
One of the names belongs to
his law school classmate.

00:28:18.195 --> 00:28:20.281
Looks like there was some bad blood.

00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:22.283
You actually believe that?

00:28:22.283 --> 00:28:24.660
He pretended to want the ledger,

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.163
then handed it straight to Baek Yi Seok.

00:28:28.163 --> 00:28:29.957
He wanted something from Baek.

00:28:29.957 --> 00:28:31.956
Well...

00:28:33.043 --> 00:28:34.920
He was afraid

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.798
his own career would be blocked.

00:28:37.798 --> 00:28:39.831
Baek Yi Seok plans to spend
the rest of his days

00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:41.760
at the Chungnam District Court,

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.080
but Judge Lee thinks he's just getting started.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.556
It seems...

00:28:45.556 --> 00:28:47.622
ambition mattered more to him than loyalty.

00:28:47.622 --> 00:28:51.145
So he used Baek Yi Seok to get his revenge?

00:28:51.145 --> 00:28:54.231
You know his family runs a scrap yard.

00:28:54.231 --> 00:28:57.885
That classmate mocked him
about it at every gathering,

00:28:57.885 --> 00:29:01.655
bringing up scrap paper
and scrap metal prices just to needle him...

00:29:01.655 --> 00:29:04.128
even taking shots at
his provincial law school background.

00:29:04.128 --> 00:29:07.619
Still, you don't swing
a butcher's knife to kill a dog.

00:29:10.837 --> 00:29:14.752
Either way,
if he used Baek Yi Seok to leak the ledger,

00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:18.197
he's clearly not under Baek's shadow.

00:29:19.596 --> 00:29:21.800
Still,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.803
we should warn him.

00:29:24.803 --> 00:29:28.042
Leave Lee Han Young to me.

00:29:29.205 --> 00:29:32.353
Go pay a visit to the Hankuk Hospital director.

00:29:32.353 --> 00:29:35.402
He's probably very nervous right now.

00:29:35.402 --> 00:29:37.504
Yes, sir.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.473
About the guy who took the bag...

00:29:55.473 --> 00:29:57.952
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:29:58.962 --> 00:30:01.131
They dodged the draft
with fake medical records.

00:30:01.131 --> 00:30:02.482
They deserve to be punished.

00:30:02.482 --> 00:30:03.967
Do I need another reason?

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:06.595
Do you have any idea
what the Chief Judge just did?

00:30:06.595 --> 00:30:09.390
He slapped down
a whole lineup of powerful people.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.441
That move just cost him a shot
at the Supreme Court.

00:30:13.441 --> 00:30:16.895
I already told my wife we were moving to Seoul
and to list the house.

00:30:16.895 --> 00:30:18.857
So you're mad you're not going to Seoul now?

00:30:18.857 --> 00:30:20.025
Yeah, darn it.

00:30:20.025 --> 00:30:21.711
If the Chief Judge had been promoted,

00:30:21.711 --> 00:30:23.197
I would've gone with him.

00:30:23.197 --> 00:30:24.738
Now what am I supposed to do?

00:30:24.738 --> 00:30:26.303
Call your wife first.

00:30:26.303 --> 00:30:28.938
What if the house actually sells?

00:30:29.993 --> 00:30:31.209
Oh, right.

00:30:31.209 --> 00:30:33.176
It can't sell.

00:30:33.176 --> 00:30:34.200
Thanks.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.213
[My Darling]

00:30:35.213 --> 00:30:37.334
Hey, can you do me a favor?

00:30:37.334 --> 00:30:38.794
I'm shaking. I can't do it.

00:30:38.794 --> 00:30:41.369
- Do what?
- Call my wife.

00:30:43.173 --> 00:30:45.286
Good luck.

00:30:45.926 --> 00:30:48.887
You don't have an ounce of loyalty in you.

00:30:48.887 --> 00:30:51.332
You're paying.

00:30:53.308 --> 00:30:55.519
Can't you at least text her for me?

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:57.980
That'll just make her even angrier.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.152
Yeah, you're right.

00:31:03.502 --> 00:31:05.745
Baek lost his shot at the Supreme Court

00:31:05.745 --> 00:31:07.573
by detonating the draft-dodging bomb.

00:31:07.573 --> 00:31:08.657
But...

00:31:08.657 --> 00:31:10.200
the fallout from the draft scandal

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.453
will end up pulling him to Seoul.

00:31:19.126 --> 00:31:20.402
Sir, are you okay?

00:31:20.402 --> 00:31:23.283
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:31:23.283 --> 00:31:25.007
That one.

00:31:25.007 --> 00:31:27.156
That was it.

00:31:32.806 --> 00:31:35.412
We should get out of the way.

00:31:44.222 --> 00:31:45.330
That bastard...

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.563
He's definitely holding a grudge
over his trial.

00:31:56.318 --> 00:31:58.667
Please!

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:14.973
This is...

00:32:14.973 --> 00:32:18.863
a warning for exposing
the draft-dodging ledger.

00:32:36.816 --> 00:32:38.664
I made sure he got the message.

00:32:38.664 --> 00:32:40.956
Good work.

00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:44.545
There'll be new work for you soon.

00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:46.725
Stand by.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.028
Baek Yi Seok exposed the ledger

00:32:55.028 --> 00:32:58.684
knowing it would cost him a Justice seat.

00:32:58.684 --> 00:33:02.104
Was that his conviction?

00:33:02.104 --> 00:33:05.156
Or was it Lee Han Young's move?

00:33:16.326 --> 00:33:17.661
Hey.

00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:20.998
Maybe the world isn't all bad after all.

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.491
I got a few stitches in my forehead,

00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:24.459
and my wife didn't say a word.

00:33:24.459 --> 00:33:26.925
About not going to Seoul, I mean.

00:33:28.046 --> 00:33:31.300
She even canceled the house listing herself.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.551
That's a relief.

00:33:32.551 --> 00:33:34.704
Yeah. It really is.

00:33:38.724 --> 00:33:41.977
But about that motorcycle...

00:33:41.977 --> 00:33:43.520
It looked familiar.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.713
Really?

00:33:44.713 --> 00:33:45.752
Yeah.

00:33:45.752 --> 00:33:47.024
I think...

00:33:47.024 --> 00:33:50.957
it might've been one of the guys I sentenced.

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:56.992
He's definitely someone
with a grudge over a trial.

00:33:56.992 --> 00:33:58.784
Hey, that hurts.

00:33:58.784 --> 00:34:01.788
You know, being a judge means

00:34:01.788 --> 00:34:05.934
your life's never more important than justice.

00:34:05.934 --> 00:34:07.377
Like yesterday?

00:34:07.377 --> 00:34:09.105
You literally put your life on the line.

00:34:09.105 --> 00:34:12.938
This is Kang Shin Jin,
at the Seoul Central District Court.

00:34:28.624 --> 00:34:30.984
Kang Shin Jin reached out himself.

00:34:30.984 --> 00:34:34.244
He wants to know what kind of man I am.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.035
[I Wanted to Meet You]
We often say

00:34:40.035 --> 00:34:43.455
[Today's Featured Guest]
some people can live without the law.

00:34:43.455 --> 00:34:45.666
But today's guest

00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:49.628
is someone who cannot live without it.

00:34:49.628 --> 00:34:53.588
Please welcome Chief Justice Kang Shin Jin.

00:34:57.511 --> 00:35:00.931
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:35:00.931 --> 00:35:03.351
Please, have a seat.

00:35:09.192 --> 00:35:11.097
In a past life, you had me killed

00:35:11.097 --> 00:35:12.693
without ever speaking to me.

00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:13.791
And in this one,

00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:16.968
you want to share a table the moment we meet?

00:35:18.448 --> 00:35:20.514
Fine.

00:35:21.493 --> 00:35:22.828
If it means I can catch you,

00:35:22.828 --> 00:35:25.053
I'd gladly do it.

00:35:33.046 --> 00:35:36.398
You went through
something rough yesterday, right?

00:35:36.398 --> 00:35:38.093
Are you okay?

00:35:38.093 --> 00:35:39.678
The nerve to not even hide

That was out of line.

01:02:10.142 --> 01:02:11.700
I'll keep an eye on him for now.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.941
Don't worry.

01:02:14.563 --> 01:02:17.607
Still, I'm curious.

01:02:17.607 --> 01:02:19.401
Now that the price is off the table,

01:02:19.401 --> 01:02:22.112
will he finish the task I gave him,

01:02:22.112 --> 01:02:24.031
or just walk away?

01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:25.699
The task?

01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:28.118
I told him to take care of Woo Gyo Hoon.

01:02:28.118 --> 01:02:31.997
If I leave him alone,
he'll stab me in the back later.

01:02:31.997 --> 01:02:33.722
We can't trust Lee Han Young yet.

01:02:33.722 --> 01:02:37.111
I think the Woo Gyo Hoon matter should be...

01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:39.004
That's out of line too.

01:02:39.004 --> 01:02:41.923
I said I'm watching him.

01:02:41.923 --> 01:02:44.301
Dig deeper into Lee Han Young.

01:02:44.301 --> 01:02:46.470
His family background.

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:49.544
Whether he ever lived in a redevelopment zone.

01:02:49.544 --> 01:02:51.183
And...

01:02:51.183 --> 01:02:54.394
bring the junior
we planted in Chungnam to Seoul.

01:02:54.394 --> 01:02:57.075
Have him keep tabs on Baek Yi Seok.

01:02:57.075 --> 01:02:59.847
And watch Lee Han Young too.

01:03:01.151 --> 01:03:03.953
Understood.

01:03:22.314 --> 01:03:25.834
After the administration changed
and Prosecutor General Eom Jun Ho stepped down,

01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:27.844
his son returned from overseas

01:03:27.844 --> 01:03:30.617
and was arrested on drug charges.

01:03:30.617 --> 01:03:32.557
Among those arrested with him

01:03:32.557 --> 01:03:33.810
was Woo Gyo Hoon's daughter,

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.223
- Woo Hee Young.
- Do you admit the charges?

01:03:50.902 --> 01:03:54.055
Why is Kang Shin Jin going after Woo Gyo Hoon?

01:03:54.055 --> 01:03:58.174
Does Woo Gyo Hoon have leverage on him?

01:04:22.607 --> 01:04:25.807
Now it really begins.

01:04:26.611 --> 01:04:29.153
Let's start with Haenal Law Firm.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:34.536
[Haenal Law Firm]

01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:40.371
In my past life,

01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:42.919
I wore Haenal's leash and lived like a slave.

01:04:42.919 --> 01:04:44.754
That was my choice.

01:04:44.754 --> 01:04:47.693
And it ended in an unjust death.

01:04:49.593 --> 01:04:51.695
CEO Yoo Seon Cheol.

01:04:51.695 --> 01:04:53.346
In this life too,

01:04:53.346 --> 01:04:56.083
you chose me.

01:04:56.083 --> 01:04:58.651
But this time, your fate

01:04:58.651 --> 01:05:00.145
is mine

01:05:00.145 --> 01:05:02.738
to decide.

01:05:30.241 --> 01:05:32.758
The Prosecutor General's son
was doing drugs in the U.S.

01:05:32.758 --> 01:05:34.811
- So?
- His daughter was too.

01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:37.369
Looks like Woo was mixed up with
the Nammyeon District Mayor.

01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:38.809
Seems like he took lots of money.

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:40.418
He used to be a gangster.

01:05:40.418 --> 01:05:42.495
Take the Nammyeon-gu sinkhole case.

01:05:42.495 --> 01:05:45.475
The sinkhole was caused by
shoddy water and sewer work.

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:48.198
Start with the guy
who died in the sinkhole. Now.

01:05:48.198 --> 01:05:49.249
Good riddance, right?

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:50.886
As the investigation stalled,

01:05:50.886 --> 01:05:53.308
the victims held
the Nammyeon District Office responsible.

01:05:53.308 --> 01:05:54.673
He's the type who knows exactly

01:05:54.673 --> 01:05:56.505
how to use people and how it'll play out.

01:05:56.505 --> 01:05:57.753
We need to take action.

01:05:57.753 --> 01:06:00.117
Kang Shin Jin, the place you belong

01:06:00.117 --> 01:06:02.433
is a courtroom.
