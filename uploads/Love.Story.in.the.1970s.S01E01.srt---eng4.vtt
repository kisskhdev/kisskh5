Not so fast!

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.770

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.700
Hello.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.130
Hello.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.460
Are you Lin's mother?

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.700
Yes.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.250
Hello, ma'am.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.580
I'm Lin's colleague.

00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:28.515
My name is Fang Muyang.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.850
You're Fang?

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.860
Lin often writes to me
that you've been good to him

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.060
while working in the northeast.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.610
It's my job.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.300
I'm on family reunion leave.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.610
Lin got these goods for you.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.650
He wanted me to tell you

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:42.970
to enjoy them.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.160
Oh, my.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.620
You're on family leave,
and you're delivering for him?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.460
Have some water.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.430
Thank you, but no.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.060
I need to deliver more items.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.010
Okay, when you're done delivering,

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.770
go home

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.650
and visit your parents, okay?

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.980
Okay.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:11:59.420
Okay.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.300
Okay, ma'am.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.250
I'm off.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.010
Bye, Fang.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.690
Goodbye.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.530

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.570
Your thought report...

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.690
It's well written.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.890
For the past year,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.580
I can see you've been working hard.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.300
Good job.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.490
Keep up the good work.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.940
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

Tu.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.040
- Ms. Xu?
- We snapped lots of photos

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.840
at the basketball court earlier.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.370
Tell the Publicity Division

00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:54.937
to print those photos

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.370
and pin them on the Publicity Board.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.320
Okay, I'm on it.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.100
Go..

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.610
Zhang, how's the report
for the Secretary coming along?

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.250
I'm working on it, Ms. Xu.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.270
Keep it up.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.300
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.300
Ms. Xu.

00:13:09.204 --> 00:13:10.320
What else do you need?

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.550
This is my university
application letter.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.580
(Application Letter)
Last year, you said that I lack

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.250
collective consciousness, and I agree.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.850
I've taken your advice to heart,

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.180
and I've been improving myself.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.010
This year, I've joined every group event

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.420
in the factory.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.340
So,

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.700
can the factory

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.300
vouch for me this year?

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:35.940
Fei.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.460
Personally, I'd love to vouch

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.940
for your application to
the Worker-Peasant-Soldier University.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.460
But, as you know,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.700
university referrals are decided

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.890
by a poll among the factory leaders.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.100
So, right now,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.440
what you should do

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.940
is to work hard

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.370
and unite everyone.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.660
Got it, Ms. Xu.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.320
I will follow your orders.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.100
Ms. Xu.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.915
Today's paper.

00:13:58.871 --> 00:13:59.530
Perfect timing.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.620
(Feng Lin)
Feng, tell Fei Ni

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.250
what a university candidate

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.610
should keep in mind.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.420
Actually, Fei Ni is considered

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.071
well-educated among the factory workers.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.990
However, education is not the key factor
in university applications.

00:14:15.004 --> 00:14:17.329
What candidates should do
is cut down on superficial work

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.350
and align themselves
with the country's ideologies.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.730
Feng Lin.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.850
I've been doing that.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.340
I write thought reports every month.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.300
(Jiangcheng Daily)

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.130
Let's see what you wrote.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.250
"Their eyes

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.660
sparkle in a way that is unique
to the workers,

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.090
full of clearity..."

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.760
It's "clarity".

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.700
Full of clarity.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.380
(Full of clarity)

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.940
This is your biggest problem.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.700
Your writing should be easily understood

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.220
by the ordinary workers and farmers.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.100
You just had to use
these difficult words

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.060
to show that you're
more cultured than them, right?

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.770
This proves that you look down on them.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.020
How is that being aligned
with the country's ideologies?

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.150
No, Ms. Xu.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.340
I didn't.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.770
I think

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.060
Feng has a point.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.260
Don't use difficult words.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.730
We need to cater

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.650
to other comrades

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.460
who are less educated.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.220
You're right, Ms. Xu.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.340
I'll keep that in mind.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:28.280
Good.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.100
But, Ms. Xu.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.730
If I can go to university

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.180
and learn further,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.220
I'd certainly improve.

00:15:34.226 --> 00:15:36.130
What kind of place
do you think the university is?

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.250
Everyone wants to improve.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.293
Does that mean everyone
gets to enter university?

00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:41.530
You got in
despite your vocabulary level,

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.580
so why can't I?

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.240
What do you mean?

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.820
What I said.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.530
Say that again...

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.340
That's enough.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.780
Your individualistic thoughts

00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:50.900
have not been fully eliminated.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.940
You react too strongly

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.300
towards criticism.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.850
Ms. Xu, I think her criticism is wrong.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.660
Does that mean she can't criticize you?

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.210
If she's right, work on it.
If not, keep it in mind.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.570
It's okay, Sir.

Hurry up.

her university application today.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.220
Yeah, the electric meter keeps ticking.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:58.900
Look.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.740
Stop!

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.880
Nana, Jiang Xia!

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.660
Get back here!

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:14.700
Don't run off!

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:15.850
Get back here!

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.180

I bought you ice cream.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.130
Thank you, Grandma.

Your parents have been sent
for re-education.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.290
You can't stay here anymore.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.020
(Young Fang Muyang)

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.020
Comrade, who are you looking for?

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.940
Wang Xiuju.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.980
Go in and turn right.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.330
Thank you.

(Next week)

(marks my third year working here.)

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.570
That means I'm eligible
for a university referral.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.330
(Three Years Ago)

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.850
I don't care if you're one week

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.610
or one day short.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.520
Young lady, you have
many future opportunities.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.050
Don't rush.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.570

(Two Years Ago)

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.460
Have you looked at my application form?

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.460
I've been working here

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.290
for three years and 351 days.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.770
Work length is not a criterion.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.920
It's all about work capability.

00:21:20.026 --> 00:21:22.071
We'll talk when you win
a Technician Award.

(Technician Award Winners)

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.404
(Fei Ni)
Ms. Xu, Mr. Wang mentioned

00:21:27.448 --> 00:21:29.500
(One Year Ago)
that if I win a Technician Award,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.130
I'd get a university referral.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.130
As far as I know,

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.530
you haven't been joining
group events this year.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.530
Fei Ni.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.980
Be a team player.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.940
University referrals are decided

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.500
based on a voting process.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.050

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:14.960
How much for a night's stay?

00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:16.420
Do you have a referral letter?

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:17.700
Yes.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:24.640
(This is to certify that Fang Muyang)

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.340
(is visiting Jiangcheng
for family visitations.)

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:25.940
(He should be granted staying rights.)

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.799
It's 0.70 yuan
for a single room per night.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.160
How many nights are you staying?

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.740
0.70 yuan?

Zhang, we're off.

00:22:36.426 --> 00:22:37.900
There's no one else inside, right?

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.640
No.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.050

at twice the amount.

(Young Fei Ni)
I can only pay one yuan.

No deal, then.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.760
It's useless to you, anyway.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.190
You won't be using it.

00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:08.737
I'll sell it to the junk collector.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.700
Sure, go ahead.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.370
I'm sure no one else

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.740
other than me would want that.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.740
No one wants it?

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:20.770
I'll burn it, then.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.850
No.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.330

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.420
I can't go higher.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.530
I still need to buy lunch.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.260
Deal.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.570
Anyway, I'm just leaving it
with you temporarily.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.700
I'll buy it back when I return.

I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:53.248
Actually, it's good
that you're going away to work.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.020
You can go to many places
and see different scenery.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.460
Unlike me, who's never left Jiangcheng.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.460
It's okay.

00:25:01.604 --> 00:25:04.320
Wherever I go, I'll draw everything I see
so I can show you.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.500
No.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.530
You hid one of your sketches
in my Maths workbook,

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.810
and I got a scolding.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.370
I don't want your sketches.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.660
How long has it been since you last ate?

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:19.980
Not that long ago.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.500
Two or three days.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:25.330
Here.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:25.980
No.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.940
We made a deal,

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.700
so 1.50 yuan it is.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.610
It's a loan. Remember to pay me back.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.940
Forget it.

00:25:32.137 --> 00:25:33.293
I guess you won't be able

00:25:33.293 --> 00:25:35.050
to repay the money you owe me.

00:25:35.093 --> 00:25:36.330
Just take care of yourself.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:39.940
Fei Ni.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.660
Wait for me.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.660
I'll pay twice as much back.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.130
Sure, it's a promise.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.500
Young lad.

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.180
You really think

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.570
you can hide yourself like this?

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.770
Sir.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.770
There's no one else here.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.180
Can you let me stay the night here?

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.180
I'll leave in the morning.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.700
I can't.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.700
Who knows whether you're good or bad?

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.050
Go, run along now.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.700
It's more comfortable to sleep at home.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.020
I don't have a home.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.290
What...

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.290
Still, you can't sleep here.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.260
This is a public space.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.940
If the higher-ups find out,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.940
I'd get punished.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.020
Fine, I'll leave.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.290
If you really have nowhere else to go,

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.570
you can share a room with me tonight.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.220
I don't think your room
can fit another person.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.850
Beggars can be choosy, huh?

00:28:03.404 --> 00:28:04.530
I don't want to trouble you.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.980
The world is huge.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.420
I'll find a place to sleep.

(Dongfeng Bathhouse)

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.740
What a tall fellow.

00:28:11.137 --> 00:28:12.700
It's true, there's no room for him.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.610
(Fei Ni's house should be here.)

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.980
(Which house is it?)

Ms. Liu!

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.500
Are you okay, Ms. Liu?

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.610
Quick, go save Ms. Liu!

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:49.900
Where's my raincoat?

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.900
Get me a flashlight.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.530
Okay.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.090
Dad, Mom, what happened?

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.090
I heard someone cry for help.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:57.180
I'm going out.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:58.260
Stay at home, ladies.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.090
Be careful out there.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:03.740
Ms. Liu!

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:04.810
What happened?

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.740
My house collapsed!

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.530
My husband and son are inside!

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:08.330
Quick!

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.290
Got them!

- Get the cart!
- Maodou!

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.810
Quick!

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.230
Get the cart!

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.130
Quick!

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:14.940
Put him down!

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.130
Help me!

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.660
Careful!

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.740
Hold tight.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.420

- Hold tight!
- Hold tight!

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.520
Go!

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.220
Be careful!

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.330
Hurry up!

00:30:28.404 --> 00:30:29.850
All the houses here are in danger.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.260
A second collapse might happen.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.370
Get everyone out!

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.050
Okay.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.530
- Quick!

- Ms. Liu!
- Wake up!

Quick!

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:46.530
Run!

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.160

Go!

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:16.700
Someone help!

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.460
Another house has collapsed!

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.750

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.910

- Feng Lin!
- Hey!

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.130
- Help!
- What's going on?

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.320
This tree caused
Feng Lin's house to collapse.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.640
She is still inside!

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.240
I'll help!

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:30.220

Feng Lin!

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.050
Feng Lin!

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.260
What should we do?

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:45.700
Comrade!

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.570
Comrade!

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.290
(Wang Defa)

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:48.940
What happened?

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.560
I'll do it!

00:32:11.337 --> 00:32:12.020
I can't do it.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.020
Get more people to help.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.420
Go!

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:20.370
Go!

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:21.530
Comrade.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:22.260
Save me.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.220
Comrade.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:29.980
Comrade.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.810
Save me. I don't want to die.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:32.980
Comrade.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.260
Comrade, save me. I don't want to die.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:35.900
Comrade.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.220
I don't want to die.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.020
You won't.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.180
Your leg is stuck.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.260
Comrade.

00:32:45.271 --> 00:32:46.048
Here's a raincoat.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.330
Comrade.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.130
What is it?

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.850
Nothing.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:54.700
Thank you.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:55.900
You're welcome.

00:32:57.582 --> 00:32:58.500
I'll count to three.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.050
Pull your leg out as hard as you can.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.220
You hear me?

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:02.330
One!

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.020

Another house has collapsed! Go!

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.220
Run!

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.330
Check if anyone's hurt!

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:44.530
Where is he?

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.210
Over there!

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.050
He's still inside.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.330
Go now!

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:47.900
Go!

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:48.850
Go!

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:50.500
Quick!

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.937
Check if there's anyone else inside!

00:33:52.693 --> 00:33:53.500
That's a big tree.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.048
Everyone should've evacuated by now.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.093
There's still someone inside!

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.000
Save him!

00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.600
Quick!

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.530
- Save him!
- Save him!

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.170
Save him!

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.190
Go!

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:03.360

Comrade!

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.982
Last night's rain was hellish.

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:23.900
- Homes were destroyed.
- Here, some warm water.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:24.420
Yes.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.410
Pull this out.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.250
Okay.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.250
Slowly.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.380
Be careful.

You can read later.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.570
I'm searching for news

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.860
about the young man last night.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:53.770
News doesn't appear that fast.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.860
You don't know this,

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.540
but that young man was godsent.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.610
When he saved Liu's family,

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.060
he was already a hero.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.540
Then, he went back there

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.170
to save more lives.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.570
What a pity.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.690
I thought he's in hospital?

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:11.610
He didn't make it?

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.650
How would I know?

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.020
I heard

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.610
his condition was serious, though.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:20.540
That young man

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.860
was brave

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.020
and dashing.

Can you give me the paper?

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.650
Not now.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:31.770
Give her that.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.980
Ni wants to go to university.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.610
We subscribed to the daily

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.760
so that she can keep herself
updated with current issues

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.693
as well as the country's
policies and ideologies.

00:35:38.782 --> 00:35:40.610
It's not to satisfy
your hunger for gossip.

The Secretary and I

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.420
went to the hospital this morning.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:58.500
That young man

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.540
is currently in stable condition.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.340
However, he did bump his head,

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.210
so there may be
a blood clot inside his brain.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.820
No one knows

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:08.460
when he'll wake up.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:10.860
All his family members

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.570
have been sent for re-education.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.650
We can't reach them for now.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.650
I called you two over

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.940

I know he saved my family,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.610
and I should go,

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.940
but you know my family's condition.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.540
I have old folks and a kid to care for.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.340
I can take care of him for a day or two,

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.940
but as for the long term...

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.130
As you can see, my arm is injured.

on behalf of our factory

you will become our role model.

no, everyone in the industry,

learn from you!

still got some conscience.

Let's welcome him.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:52.650
Fang Muyang.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.380
(Chen Wenshu)
Sit beside Fei Ni.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.770
Let's begin today's class.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.170
Yesterday, we read the first part

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.650
of Musings on the Red Cliff.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:03.982
We're actually sitting together.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.000
Okay, everyone.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.150
Open your textbooks. Let's continue.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:25.560
Fei Ni fell on the floor!

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.420
Quiet!

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.130
What are you doing, Fei Ni?

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.860
Yelling in my class?

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.130
You have no discipline.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:35.290
Meet me in my office later.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.130
Yes, ma'am.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.980
Fei Ni.

00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:49.500
You finished your reflection report?

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:50.730
Did Ms. Chen lecture you?

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:52.210
Let's go.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.900
I'll take you home.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:55.170
No need.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.980
I didn't mean to scare you.

00:40:59.048 --> 00:41:00.490
I just wanted to return the housefly.

00:41:01.471 --> 00:41:02.980
Who knew you'd be so timid.

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.980
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.340
I'll give you a ride back.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.570
You're limping.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.204
It'd be dark by the time you get home.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.210
Give me a chance to redeem myself, okay?

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.220
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Secondary School)

00:41:32.271 --> 00:41:33.460
I'm good at cycling, right?

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.540
Eyes on the road.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.820
You still don't believe me?

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:39.340
I can even do this.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.970
Okay, I believe you.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.900
I'll pay for your shirt.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.900
No need.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.500
Just stay away from me.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.260
(No way.)

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.420
(It's bad luck every time I see you.)

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:16.290
(I quit.)

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:23.920
(A Female Worker's Hymn of Love)

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.120
(For 20 years, a female worker
has been nursing a wounded hero.)

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.220
(Now married, her dedication
has also won her a place in university.)

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.210
Fang Muyang.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.950
As long as I take good care of you,

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.130
I might get picked as a role model.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.130
When I become a role model,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:40.540
they'd have no reason

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.020
to deny my university referral.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:49.130
Fang Muyang.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.130
You got me into trouble so many times.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.060
This time,

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.540
you have to make it up to me.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.500
Wake up soon,

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.290
and I'll write everything off.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:01.730
We'll be even, okay?

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:07.090
Silence is consent.

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:08.570
That's settled, then.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:11.020
Let's work hard together.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.500
Old friend.
