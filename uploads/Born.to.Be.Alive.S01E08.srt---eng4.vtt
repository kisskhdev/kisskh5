[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.140
[Episode 8]

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.000
I'll definitely knock on the door
next time.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.650
B-Because

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.759
when Zhacuo told me,

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:47.370
I was wondering.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.920
I said

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.759
your family rules were quite strange.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.490
-If bad guys want to come in…
-What are you doing here?

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.620
To bring you photos.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.570
I didn't take any photos.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.820
I took candid shots in the mountains.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.910
Just got them developed.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.980
Thanks.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.220
You can leave now.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.670
What's wrong?

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.820
Not all of them are yours.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.010
Before taking them,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.340
you didn't even tell me.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.710
My hair was all messy.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.460
Because it's candid,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.300
that's how it is.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.650
It's more natural.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.880
They turned out well.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.380
Thanks.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.750
Bye.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.910
What now?

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.060
I-I'd like some water.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.900
I'm thirsty.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.600
Thanks.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.110
It's empty.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.930
Are all these

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.450
from patients to your mom?

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.079
In Mazhi County,

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.010
my mom's patients are everywhere.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.070
These are just from the last two years.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.810
In my mom's cabinet,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.940
there are many more.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.579
This is you, isn't it?

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.400
Isn't it?

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.700
Look.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.450
It's nice to have a big family.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.630
Which one are you again?

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.310
The third.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.630
The third.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.900
Who are these?

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.910
Relatives?

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.480
Careful.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.740
Also my parents.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.960
Don't look like them.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.570
Obviously.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.420
Because they are not

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.680
the same people at all.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.210
These were my birth parents.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.840
Also border aid doctors.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.560
Later,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.630
they died in an accident.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.540
I'm sorry.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.940
Sorry.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.990
When are you leaving?

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.440
The water is a bit hot.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.040
I'll leave after I finish it.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.910
I mean,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.850
how long will you stay

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.310
with the Mountain Patrol?

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.650
I'll leave after I finish my report.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.870
My unit has a rule.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.480
Housing is only allocated upon marriage.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.090
So right now,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.310
I live with my parents.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.510
My dad
is in the Animal Husbandry Department.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.450
My mom is in the Cultural Department.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.510
Alright, alright.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.530
I'm not a census officer.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.840
I'm not questioning you
about your background.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.470
Yeah, you're not.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.700
We're just chatting.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.300
My mom works at the Cultural Department.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.120
But she's not a writer

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.830
a painter, or anything.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.640
She works in an office,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.420
in HR.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.720
I used to go there all the time as a kid.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.120
Has anyone ever told you
that you talk a lot?

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.780
Actually, yes.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.380
A lot of people say that.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.120
A-And a lot of people

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.909
think I'm a really nice guy,

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:47.810
very enthusiastic.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:48.830
You must have felt it too,

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.770
right? Right?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.659
But I think

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.330
it's just my job.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.260
I can't let the conversation drop.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.780
I can't let there be dead air.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.840
See? We haven't had

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.650
any awkward silences, have we?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.060
I've definitely felt it.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.870
Finish your drink and go.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.200
My mom will be back soon.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.820
Okay.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.010
Alright.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.030
I won't see you out then.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.050
Bye.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.860
What are you looking at now?

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.490
I've been in Mazhi for so long,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.300
and there's something
I've been wondering about.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.850
Today I've finally figured out what it is.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.830
What?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.659
What is it?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.330
Your county...

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.570
doesn't have any trees.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.570
Not a single one.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.440
I've been in Mazhi for so long,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.100
but I didn't see a single tree.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.150
Not in town,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.770
not in the pasture,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.870
not even in Bolamula.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.690
But right here in your yard,

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.020
there's this huge tree.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.910
Even though the leaves are gone,

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.530
it still looks

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.940
very healthy.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.220
Really.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.690
This tree...

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.600
is so big!

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.170
Who's come for our tree again?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.750
Auntie.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.800
Mom.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.030
-We have a guest?
-Auntie.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.260
No, he's a colleague.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.060
He just dropped something off.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.000
He's leaving now. Go on.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.820
A colleague?

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.620
From the Public Security Bureau

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.590
or the Mountain Patrol?

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.510
-Neither.
-Neither.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.120
Auntie,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.190
I'm Shao Yunfei,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.220
a reporter

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:39.860
from the "Western Evening News."

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.150
I'm here to interview Officer Bai

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.180
and the Mountain Patrol.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.770
Yes, that's right.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.940
And he's leaving now.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.060
No wonder.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.980
You're so fair-skinned.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.060
Since you're here,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.159
stay for dinner.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.010
-Okay.
-He won't…

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.810
Perfect.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.190
Some herdsmen sent us some lamb.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.390
How about making dumplings?

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.980
Do you like them?

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.640
I love them.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:56.440
Mom, he has things to do.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.810
I really like dumplings.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.180
Really?

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.300
Auntie, let me hold the umbrella.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.950
Eat before you go.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.410
Let me help. Here, Auntie.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.380
Come in.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.940
Time for dumplings. Hurry.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.860
Have some chili too?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.420
Yes.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:13.950
Here.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:16.870
Mom.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.610
Aren't we waiting for Bai Ji and Bai Shao?

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.200
Bai Shao is having dinner with colleagues.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.070
She won't be back.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.000
Bai Ji is on duty.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.360
Later,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.450
take some to him.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.920
If Shao hadn't come,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.640
I wouldn't have bothered

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.040
to make these dumplings. Here.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.500
Exactly.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.860
You have me to thank.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.610
Is it to your liking?

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.260
It's delicious.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:36.480
I love it.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.830
Good.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.909
My mom can't cook.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.510
Since my grandmother passed away,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.150
I've rarely had

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.350
dumplings this good.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.429
If you like them,

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:43.690
you should come often.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.720
Those young men

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.600
from the Mountain Patrol
come all the time.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.060
Really?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.640
Then I'll come often too.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.980
Delicious.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.600
Shao.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.980
Does your newspaper

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.050
have a large circulation?

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:56.980
Yes, it's large.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.700
Our newspaper office

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.270
is directly under the province.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.860
It's a department-level institution.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.670
We have daily news,

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.030
evening news, commercial news,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.980
a legal newspaper, a Tibetan newspaper,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.980
and 2 magazines.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.470
I'm just

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.360
a reporter in a small division

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.820
of the evening news.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.420
Then the paper consumption must be huge.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.550
Mom, what a question.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.680
Isn't that obvious?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.530
Shoo.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.240
It's huge.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.820
Because we need paper everywhere.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.430
Then you don't make

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.050
the paper yourselves, do you?

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:22.630
No.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.080
A paper mill supplies us.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.600
Then that mill

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.800
must be quite big too.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.500
I've been

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.170
there.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.480
It has several sites.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.340
It is quite big.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.650
They can produce

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.130
newsprint, wrapping paper,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.060
and kraft paper.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.070
They can make

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.390
all kinds of paper.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.850
Do they make toilet paper?

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.600
Yes. The Tulip...

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.880
Tulip toilet paper

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.290
is made by them.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.710
That's the one

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.100
our work unit distributed.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.390
The quality is quite good.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.590
Auntie, why do you ask

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.500
about this?

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.250
Could you give me

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.510
the contact info

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.600
for the paper mill?

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.000
Do you want to buy paper?

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.030
Yes.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.050
I want to buy a batch of toilet paper.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.810
With good quality.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.590
And it has to be cheap.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.050
Why do you need so much?

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.700
Doesn't the convenience store

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.540
sell it?

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.610
It's not good.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.760
And it's not cheap.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:09.910
Sure.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.620
Don't worry, Auntie.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.030
I'll contact

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.540
my colleague in purchasing.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.540
I'll try to get you

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.550
a wholesale price

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.370
for a batch of paper.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.700
Well, that'll be great.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.240
Thank you so much.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.900
No problem.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.750
Here, eat.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.030
Okay.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.910
Eat up. Have some more.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.240
Okay.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.930
Here.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.300
Thanks, Auntie.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.410
Shao.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.120
Where is your family from?

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.180
We're from the provincial capital.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.930
My mom is in the Cultural Department.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.600
My dad
is in the Animal Husbandry Department.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.700
My mom works

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.150
at the Cultural Department,
but she isn't...

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.960
She isn't a writer

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.910
or a painter.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:38.750
She works in the office,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.650
in HR.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.480
When I was little,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.530
I often went to their cafeteria

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.480
to eat dumplings.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.310
None were better

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.360
than yours.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.590
Supplies are here!

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.820
Move the stuff!

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.300
Okay!

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:02.980
Beer.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.940
Wangmu,

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.390
why is there beer?

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.080
Reporter Shao is treating us.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.810
Two bottles each.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:08.740
Don't take more.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.510
The cheapskate is actually spending money.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.580
Come on.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.290
I was stingy before

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.480
because I was broke.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.220
I just got my paycheck

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.670
from the newspaper office.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.720
I'm now the Moneybags

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.200
in the Mountain Patrol!

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.750
-Thanks, Mr. Moneybags!
-Thanks, Mr. Moneybags!

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.080
Thanks, Mr. Moneybags.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.320
Beer is weak.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.140
You guys drink it.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:24.600
Come on.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.540
I didn't forget you.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.480
So nice of you.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.730
I'll go get him.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:40.940
Okay.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.430
Mom asked me to tell you

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.450
not to take these things

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.090
too seriously.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.130
There's no need

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.550
to stop coming to the shop

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.820
because of this.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.290
I feel bad

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.240
for letting you misunderstand

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.090
that I'm some

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.670
big shot.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.520
It's not certain if I'll get

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.520
a permanent position in the future.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.980
We knew long ago

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.580
that you aren't an official.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.210
But she

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.670
kept calling me Director He.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.590
She thought

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.480
calling you that

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.490
would sound sophisticated

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.840
and nice.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.500
B-But because of that,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.000
I ran up a huge tab with you.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.690
We let you run a tab,

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.510
but not because you're an official.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.370
It has nothing to do with

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.240
whether you have a permanent position.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.290
Mom said

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.510
everyone is born

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.880
with debts.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.320
If not money,

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.070
then favors.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.270
They will be paid off,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.930
sooner or later.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.390

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.710
We are different from them.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:01.530
Don't forget who you are.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.090
Move!

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.280
Move faster!

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:16.930
Why did you come here?

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.410
Where is Ma Yizhong?

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.660
Ma Yizhong has been tied up.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.480
Move!

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:24.080
Hurry up!

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.680
The bullet has been removed.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.610
He'll be okay after I disinfect it.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:53.920
Bite this.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.140
What is your name?

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.060
They all call you Boss.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.090
No one knows your name.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480
What is your name?

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.530
I asked him earlier.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.690
He didn't say a word.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.320
You and Zhacuo take turns tonight.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.450
Watch them closely.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.130
Okay.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.040
No need.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.680
I'll watch.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.790
If she wants to watch, then let her.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.440
She doesn't trust us anyway.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.970
Stop.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.220
Give me the gun.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:57.970
I'll keep watch here.

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.380
She wants to watch them herself.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.210
She's a police officer.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.470
She knows the law best.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.470
What are we?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.040
Handing the murderer over to the police

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.260
is how we avenge Dongzhiba.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.000
Go to sleep.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.290
I'll keep watch.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:35.020
Cut the crap.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.140
Give me the gun.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.400
Go.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.130
Who's there?

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.210
It's me, me.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.670
Shao Yunfei.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:34.780
What's wrong?

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.110
It's an old problem.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.190
I'll be fine after taking some pills.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.170
Why aren't you sleeping?

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:43.850
Do you have a headache?

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:44.550
No.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.030
I'm used to the altitude.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.250
It's just that today...

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.710
I was a bit excited.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.220
Did you see what happened during the day?

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.570
When we camped yesterday,

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.730
I saw the Milky Way.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.460
Those stars...

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.270
They were so beautiful.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.420
They weren't like

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.620
stars in other places

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.740
that twinkle.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:20.500
They looked like

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.900
they were fixed in the sky,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.100
so many and so bright.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.760
Yes.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.460
The altitude is high here.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:29.490
Without pollution,

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:30.590
the air is clear.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.740
You can see more clearly.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.890
It's a pity.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.260
I didn't bring a tripod,

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.660
so I couldn't capture it.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:40.940
The most beautiful things

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.470
should be kept in the heart.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:47.670
This is why you

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.030
came here, right?

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.400
For such a beautiful land,

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:53.970
it's well worth

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.010
preserving.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.760
I really don't want to do
something so difficult.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:10.770
But...

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.340
In Bolamula,

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.510
there are thousands of

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.380
wild animals.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.220
I know they are right there.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.060
They also know

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.890
we are here.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.540
If we don't do this,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.750
no one will.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.130
We have no choice.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.160
It's fate.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.600
Then how long do you think

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.400
you'll keep doing this?

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:53.790
I don't know.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.500
I only know

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.900
I can't give up now.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.280
Han...

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.700
Han doesn't like

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.540
me writing about him.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.200
So, do you want me

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.440
to write in the report

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:16.780
about the team members'

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.110
personal experiences?

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:21.400
I kept you here

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.530
because I trust you.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:23.890
Just write.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.060
Everything we do here

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.340
and what you see in Bolamula—

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:28.470
write them all down.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.460
Let more people know.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.030
Then,

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.320
what about the past?

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:41.150
Everyone has a past.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.800
And they make mistakes.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.330
You've made mistakes, too?

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.250
I've made more mistakes than any of them.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:01.870
You'll find out later.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.580
It hurts again?

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.370
There's hot water in the tent.

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:23.750
Go drink some.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.530
Okay.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.690
Keep watch for me for a bit.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:32.560
Call me if anything happens.
