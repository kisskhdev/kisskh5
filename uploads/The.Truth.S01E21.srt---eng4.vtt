=Episode 21=

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:32.685
(Flint Bar)
Huashan's hottest spot right now.

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:34.244
The owner is called Monkey.

00:01:34.565 --> 00:01:36.364
He's said to be Bao Hei's

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:37.884
biggest distributor now.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.205
Monkey and Bao Hei
have been at odds for a while.

00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:43.804
There are rumors saying

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:47.205
Monkey plans to retire and go clean.

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:48.804
Another story goes

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:51.005
that he's been infiltrated
by the police.

00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:53.005
You did your homework?

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:55.285
Can't fight a battle unprepared, right?

00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:01.604
Monkey has a record of Bao Hei's
dirty dealings all these years.

00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:04.925
Bao Hei is worried
that if Monkey really defects,

00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:06.405
it'll fall into police hands.

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:07.845
So he sent us to handle it.

00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:12.204
It's that simple?

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.444
If it's really so important to Bao Hei,

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:22.285
why did Bao Hei wait until today?

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.044
And let outsiders like us get involved?

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:27.405
Based on Bao Hei's side of the story,

00:02:27.484 --> 00:02:30.724
he doesn't want
to confront Monkey just yet.

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:32.565
Monkey doesn't know us.

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.245
So this job is for the two of us.

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:36.005
If it works out, everyone's happy.

00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:37.924
If it doesn't, he doesn't lose much.

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:41.805
Any clues?

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:51.324
That thing is right here.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.565
(Floor Plan)

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.245
It's on Monkey's office computer.

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:56.204
About four or five guards are there.

00:02:56.764 --> 00:02:58.005
Plus the bar's security.

00:02:58.525 --> 00:02:59.604
The computer password?

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:05.005
You've asked too many questions today.

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:15.005
We're not just here
for the record of dirty dealings, right?

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:44.965
Try it.

00:03:45.764 --> 00:03:46.565
What?

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:08.164
Perfect.

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:00.725
First time at a bar?

00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:01.925
You look nervous.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.245
It is my first time.

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:09.485
Then just follow me later.

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:10.296
Don't be afraid.

00:06:09.404 --> 00:06:09.925
Beauty.

00:06:21.084 --> 00:06:22.444
Don't go overboard later, okay?

00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:26.084
Hi there!

00:06:26.165 --> 00:06:27.444
What can I get for you two?

00:06:27.444 --> 00:06:28.605
Get him a cola.

00:06:28.644 --> 00:06:29.764
Okay, just a moment.

00:06:58.964 --> 00:07:00.084
Just like I told you.

00:07:00.605 --> 00:07:01.884
I love your lip color.

00:07:02.644 --> 00:07:03.764
He's so sleazy.

00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:05.844
Seriously? He had to order alcohol.

00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:06.644
Is that so?

00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:08.084
Are you ready yet?

00:07:08.884 --> 00:07:09.524
Yeah.

00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:14.764
Together.

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:23.805
Come on.

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:27.844
Thanks.

00:07:44.084 --> 00:07:44.565
Come on.

00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:45.764
Let's have one here.

00:07:46.084 --> 00:07:47.084
Bottoms up.

00:07:56.524 --> 00:07:57.324
Where are you going?

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:03.725
Handsome, where's the dance floor?

00:08:05.524 --> 00:08:06.524
It's over there.

00:08:12.404 --> 00:08:14.125
I'm a bit drunk.

00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:16.204
Take me there.

00:08:18.204 --> 00:08:19.485
She wants you to take her in.

00:08:19.485 --> 00:08:20.324
Just hurry up.

00:08:20.644 --> 00:08:21.444
Okay.

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:38.485
Keep your voice down.

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:40.085
Shake it.

00:08:42.485 --> 00:08:43.365
What are you doing?

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:45.804
I'm talking to you.

00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:50.605
You scoundrel. Can't you see us?

00:08:51.684 --> 00:08:52.764
I'm talking to you.

00:08:52.764 --> 00:08:53.365
Exactly.

00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:54.044
What the heck?

00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:54.725
What's this?

00:08:54.725 --> 00:08:55.284
What's this?

00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:56.365
Want to die?

00:08:56.365 --> 00:08:56.924
Want a fight?

00:08:57.284 --> 00:08:57.965
Knock it off.

00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:22.164
Stop fighting.

00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:25.205
Stop fighting.

00:09:52.804 --> 00:09:53.404
Come in.

00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:56.804
Boss,

00:09:58.245 --> 00:09:59.125
there's trouble.

00:09:59.164 --> 00:10:00.085
Troublemakers?

00:10:00.404 --> 00:10:02.044
Where are they from? Who's with them?

00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:05.485
Call more people to hold them down.

00:10:06.684 --> 00:10:07.965
You bunch of good-for-nothings.

00:10:59.915 --> 00:11:02.099
(Copying...)

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:03.384
(Sales Revenue)

00:11:17.205 --> 00:11:17.804
Hurry.

00:11:18.684 --> 00:11:19.485
Go back first.

00:11:23.768 --> 00:11:26.241
(Copying...)

00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:42.264
(Copying...)

00:12:28.504 --> 00:12:30.488
(Copying...)

00:12:36.845 --> 00:12:37.845
You're so slow.

00:12:43.365 --> 00:12:44.164
How's it going?

00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:45.085
How much longer?

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:46.044
Almost done.

00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:01.725
After them!

00:13:35.884 --> 00:13:36.325
Go!

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:37.284
- Let's go.
- Move.

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:42.125
Get up.

00:13:51.485 --> 00:13:52.085
Boss,

00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:52.644
it's done.

00:13:56.524 --> 00:13:58.085
Did you remember to tip off Monkey?

00:13:58.205 --> 00:13:58.884
I did.

00:14:04.164 --> 00:14:04.924
Have a drink.

00:14:06.284 --> 00:14:07.085
Thanks, Boss.

00:14:12.884 --> 00:14:13.684
Isn't it hot?

00:14:14.764 --> 00:14:15.564
It's okay.

00:14:37.325 --> 00:14:39.245
Must be an accident.
Traffic's backed up.

00:14:47.245 --> 00:14:48.485
There's an accident ahead.

00:14:48.524 --> 00:14:50.325
Be careful and drive slowly.

00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:55.205
An accident ahead.

00:14:55.205 --> 00:14:56.564
Be careful and drive slowly.

00:15:02.764 --> 00:15:03.445
Officer.

00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:05.564
I'm with Yunxi CID.

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:06.884
What's going on?

00:15:07.044 --> 00:15:08.564
A small truck has overturned.

00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:09.884
Yunxi CID?

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.005
Here in Huashan on a case?

00:15:12.005 --> 00:15:12.564
Yes.

00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:13.804
My colleague.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.524
She's exhausted after a long day.

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:17.644
Is the overturn serious?

00:15:18.205 --> 00:15:19.005
Nothing major.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.284
Just blocked the road.

00:15:22.044 --> 00:15:23.044
You've worked hard.

00:15:23.325 --> 00:15:24.125
This section

00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:25.884
has many big trucks at night.

00:15:26.445 --> 00:15:27.884
Drive safely on the road.

00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:29.564
Okay, thanks.

00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:30.884
You've worked hard too.

00:15:51.605 --> 00:15:53.325
You actually called me your colleague?

00:15:53.764 --> 00:15:55.005
You lied without hesitation.

00:15:55.005 --> 00:15:56.245
How impressive you've become.

00:15:57.284 --> 00:15:58.764
We're cooperating right now.

00:15:59.445 --> 00:16:00.485
Calling us colleagues

00:16:00.924 --> 00:16:01.845
is no problem.

00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:16.605
Drive safely.

00:16:26.564 --> 00:16:28.965
Haven't seen that tail
since the toll booth.

00:16:29.005 --> 00:16:29.965
Why did they stop?

00:16:30.325 --> 00:16:31.485
Isn't it better this way?

00:16:35.485 --> 00:16:37.564
But that black Buick behind us

00:16:37.764 --> 00:16:39.085
has been tailing us for a while.

00:16:40.005 --> 00:16:41.085
I noticed long ago.

00:16:41.804 --> 00:16:42.605
Hold on tight.

00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.125
It's a Huashan plate.

00:16:55.564 --> 00:16:56.404
Monkey's men?

00:16:58.284 --> 00:16:59.845
Pretty quick on their feet.

00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:09.165
That isn't the only one.

00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:10.245
There are more behind.

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:15.044
Looks like Bao Hei's trying
to make things harder for us.

00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:23.885
Hold on tight.

00:18:00.925 --> 00:18:02.445
Get them! Get them!

00:18:06.524 --> 00:18:07.324
Watch out.

00:18:38.564 --> 00:18:40.645
Reverse! Reverse! Reverse and chase!

00:18:44.485 --> 00:18:45.205
Go!

00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:09.205
Hurry!

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:10.324
- Go!
- Go!

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:19.604
Go! After them!

00:19:30.524 --> 00:19:31.324
Split up and search!

00:20:02.044 --> 00:20:02.725
Go!

00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:13.445
- After them!
- Go!

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:14.445
Go! After them!

00:20:31.604 --> 00:20:32.165
Go.

00:20:37.524 --> 00:20:38.005
Over there.

00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:38.485
Okay.

00:20:49.524 --> 00:20:50.245
Watch out!

00:20:56.445 --> 00:20:57.084
Go!

00:21:07.804 --> 00:21:08.485
Over there!

00:21:08.885 --> 00:21:09.445
Hurry!

00:21:13.084 --> 00:21:13.885
Cops are here.

00:21:14.925 --> 00:21:15.524
Let's go.

00:21:16.885 --> 00:21:17.405
Move.

00:23:13.464 --> 00:23:18.136
(Yunxi Police Department)

00:23:24.165 --> 00:23:27.005
Your simulation results
match the crime scene data closest.

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:28.205
How do you explain that?

00:23:30.725 --> 00:23:32.324
How is that possible?

00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:34.764
There must be some mistake.

00:23:35.364 --> 00:23:37.885
I had no grudge against Ding Youcai.

00:23:37.925 --> 00:23:39.445
We were close.

00:23:39.564 --> 00:23:43.124
So you scammed him for 50,000
because you were close?

00:23:43.165 --> 00:23:43.804
No.

00:23:46.524 --> 00:23:48.364
Ding Youcai threatened to report you.

00:23:48.604 --> 00:23:50.645
So in a rage, you killed him.

00:23:50.645 --> 00:23:51.324
No.

00:23:51.804 --> 00:23:52.685
It wasn't me.

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:56.844
If not you, then how do you explain
this photo of you fleeing the scene?

00:24:03.405 --> 00:24:04.324
Look closely.

00:24:05.925 --> 00:24:07.965
Impossible. It can't be.

00:24:19.205 --> 00:24:20.685
Captain Leng, we found it.

00:24:21.524 --> 00:24:22.364
Where?

00:24:23.005 --> 00:24:24.245
Right in his office.

00:24:24.364 --> 00:24:25.844
We found the murder weapon back then.

00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:28.165
That push dagger is at the lab now.

00:24:31.965 --> 00:24:36.084
Wh-what? Someone's framing me.

00:24:36.165 --> 00:24:37.445
I clearly threw it...

00:24:37.844 --> 00:24:38.764
Where did you throw it?

00:24:43.764 --> 00:24:44.885
Leniency for confession.

00:24:45.044 --> 00:24:46.324
It's not too late to talk now.

00:24:47.364 --> 00:24:48.364
Officers,

00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:50.324
I'm afraid even if I tell you,

00:24:51.005 --> 00:24:52.084
you won't believe me.

00:24:52.364 --> 00:24:56.405
Actually, it... it was just an accident.

00:24:59.764 --> 00:25:02.124
That day,
Ding Youcai asked me to come over.

00:25:02.364 --> 00:25:03.844
I didn't want to go at first.

00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:07.885
He said he had something
more important to discuss with me.

00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:10.165
So after thinking it over,
I decided to go.

00:25:26.965 --> 00:25:27.764
Ding Youcai,

00:25:28.844 --> 00:25:30.405
we're in the middle of nowhere.

00:25:30.405 --> 00:25:31.245
What's this about?

00:25:33.165 --> 00:25:33.925
Something good.

00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:35.205
Something good?

00:25:43.364 --> 00:25:44.165
Ding Youcai,

00:25:45.005 --> 00:25:46.645
why exactly did you want to see me?

00:25:47.564 --> 00:25:49.645
What did Ding Youcai want
with you that day?

00:25:50.124 --> 00:25:51.405
What else could it be?

00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:55.804
All that fuss
was all about that 50,000 yuan.

00:25:56.844 --> 00:25:57.725
He told me

00:25:58.044 --> 00:26:01.324
that his young wife had just found out
she was pregnant again.

00:26:02.124 --> 00:26:03.205
She needed care.

00:26:03.564 --> 00:26:04.524
They needed money.

00:26:05.084 --> 00:26:07.324
He wanted me
to return that 50,000 yuan to him.

00:26:08.965 --> 00:26:09.885
I mean,

00:26:10.165 --> 00:26:12.284
I just made
a bit of hard-earned commission.

00:26:12.284 --> 00:26:14.364
I even found him a wife.

00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:17.364
What's wrong
with a little price difference?

00:26:18.005 --> 00:26:19.044
Get to the point.

00:26:26.925 --> 00:26:30.284
That day, he was drunk.

00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:34.885
That guy couldn't hold his liquor.

00:26:35.564 --> 00:26:36.885
And he was a mean drunk.

00:26:37.764 --> 00:26:40.485
First, he called Yu Meigui

00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:42.005
and yelled at her.

00:26:42.645 --> 00:26:45.764
Then he started acting up.

00:26:46.165 --> 00:26:47.364
He pulled out that dagger

00:26:47.364 --> 00:26:49.645
and tried to stab me with it.

00:26:50.284 --> 00:26:51.044
He stabbed me.

00:26:53.245 --> 00:26:54.084
You scammed me.

00:26:54.165 --> 00:26:55.524
I'll kill you.

00:26:55.524 --> 00:26:56.284
Ding Youcai,

00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:58.124
what are you doing?

00:26:59.564 --> 00:27:00.764
Are you crazy?

00:27:02.005 --> 00:27:02.925
What's wrong with you?

00:27:03.364 --> 00:27:03.965
What?

00:27:03.965 --> 00:27:04.965
You scammed me.

00:27:30.165 --> 00:27:30.764
Ding...

00:27:31.284 --> 00:27:32.084
Ding Youcai?

00:27:34.165 --> 00:27:35.524
Believe me.

00:27:35.524 --> 00:27:37.205
I really didn't mean to.

00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:39.324
It was self-defense.

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.005
Why did you take the murder weapon?

00:27:42.205 --> 00:27:46.324
I saw it on a legal TV show.

00:27:46.324 --> 00:27:48.685
It... it would have fingerprints on it.

00:27:49.165 --> 00:27:50.084
Where did you throw it?

00:27:52.165 --> 00:27:53.205
That thing

00:27:54.044 --> 00:27:55.084
went in easy

00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:57.084
but came out hard.

00:27:57.604 --> 00:28:00.284
I struggled a lot to pull it out.

00:28:00.604 --> 00:28:02.645
Got blood all over my hands.

00:28:04.405 --> 00:28:07.245
I just stuffed it in my pocket.

00:28:07.844 --> 00:28:13.165
On the way back,
I tossed it into a sewer drain.

00:28:14.965 --> 00:28:16.685
Do you remember the exact location?

00:28:17.245 --> 00:28:19.165
It's been too long. I forgot.

00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:20.324
Easy. Easy.

00:28:23.084 --> 00:28:23.764
Give it to me.

00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:24.965
- Come on.
- Here.

00:28:26.764 --> 00:28:27.645
Slow down.

00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:28.445
Be careful.

00:28:29.445 --> 00:28:30.005
Careful.

00:28:32.165 --> 00:28:33.445
Well? Got anything?

00:28:33.764 --> 00:28:34.564
Nothing yet.

00:28:35.764 --> 00:28:36.645
Next spot. Let's go.

00:28:37.764 --> 00:28:38.844
Grab the gear.

00:28:43.564 --> 00:28:44.564
Give me a hand. Come on.

00:28:49.124 --> 00:28:50.245
I'll go down. I'll go.

00:28:52.124 --> 00:28:52.804
Be careful.

00:28:52.804 --> 00:28:53.764
- Here.
- Careful. Easy.

00:28:54.245 --> 00:28:54.844
It's fine.

00:28:59.885 --> 00:29:00.925
- Slowly.
- Okay, got it.

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:03.524
Okay.

00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:07.124
Watch your step.

00:29:07.324 --> 00:29:07.965
Okay.

00:29:14.405 --> 00:29:16.005
Well? Find anything?

00:29:17.205 --> 00:29:18.205
Nothing so far.

00:29:21.965 --> 00:29:22.885
How many more spots?

00:29:23.764 --> 00:29:24.564
Two.

00:29:28.165 --> 00:29:30.604
If we don't find it,
we'll have to widen the search.

00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:37.725
It's the last one, right?

00:29:38.005 --> 00:29:39.485
Long, this is the last one.

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:41.165
I'll do it.

00:29:42.165 --> 00:29:43.084
I'll turn the light on.

00:29:44.084 --> 00:29:44.764
Be safe.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:46.965
Take it slow.

00:29:47.885 --> 00:29:48.564
Careful.

00:29:51.205 --> 00:29:52.165
Watch your footing.

00:29:55.124 --> 00:29:56.005
Slow down, Long.

00:29:58.044 --> 00:29:59.005
Be careful.

00:30:06.364 --> 00:30:07.324
How is it, Long?

00:30:08.005 --> 00:30:08.965
Find anything?

00:30:09.965 --> 00:30:10.965
Nothing.

00:30:11.284 --> 00:30:12.205
Let me look again.

00:30:21.685 --> 00:30:22.485
Got it.

00:30:27.005 --> 00:30:27.844
Easy now. Easy.

00:30:28.044 --> 00:30:28.645
Here.

00:30:29.124 --> 00:30:29.764
Give it to me.

00:30:29.764 --> 00:30:30.564
Watch your step.

00:30:39.485 --> 00:30:40.165
Wrap it up.

00:30:45.165 --> 00:30:49.205
The prosecutor's office will handle
your case fairly according to the law.

00:30:50.564 --> 00:30:51.564
Thank you.

00:30:52.324 --> 00:30:53.324
What about her?

00:30:53.965 --> 00:30:57.844
The case of Yu Meigui organizing
illegal cross-border marriage agencies

00:30:58.205 --> 00:31:00.124
has been handed over
to the relevant authorities.

00:31:01.005 --> 00:31:07.885
An investigation into potential fraud
and harboring is underway.

00:31:14.284 --> 00:31:16.564
This is the DNA test report.

00:31:17.524 --> 00:31:18.685
The evidence shows...

00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:26.524
Seems you already know.

00:31:27.965 --> 00:31:30.165
Working backwards
from the baby's birth date,

00:31:30.645 --> 00:31:32.925
I rarely went back to that place
during that period.

00:31:33.165 --> 00:31:35.005
Nothing happened between us at all.

00:31:35.764 --> 00:31:37.364
Then why did you...?

00:31:39.084 --> 00:31:41.044
When she came to me pregnant,

00:31:41.604 --> 00:31:44.044
I knew she wouldn't want
to keep that child.

00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:47.364
Even though he's not my son,

00:31:48.645 --> 00:31:50.005
he's still my brother.

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:58.564
Please keep this secret for me.

00:32:00.564 --> 00:32:01.485
Is that okay?

00:32:08.152 --> 00:32:09.016
(Fang Qihang was sentenced to life for)

00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:10.282
(organizing illegal border crossings,
trafficking women for profit,)

00:32:10.282 --> 00:32:11.232
(and murdering Ding Youcai.)

00:32:11.232 --> 00:32:12.082
(Ruan Shihong and others)

00:32:12.082 --> 00:32:13.112
(committed marriage fraud,
for which they will be prosecuted.)

00:32:15.925 --> 00:32:16.885
Wh-What's going on?

00:32:17.685 --> 00:32:18.925
I tried to bathe your dad.

00:32:18.925 --> 00:32:19.844
He wouldn't let me.

00:32:20.324 --> 00:32:21.764
Look at me. I'm soaking wet.

00:32:22.205 --> 00:32:23.044
You know what?

00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:25.245
I won't do this job
for any amount of money.

00:32:26.604 --> 00:32:27.205
Look.

00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:28.405
Look how he scratched me.

00:32:29.205 --> 00:32:30.165
Sorry about it.

00:32:30.165 --> 00:32:31.844
How about I add another 800 yuan?

00:32:31.844 --> 00:32:33.764
What's the point?

00:32:34.445 --> 00:32:36.405
With your dad like this,
get him to a hospital.

00:32:37.364 --> 00:32:39.445
You need to accept the reality sooner.

00:32:47.844 --> 00:32:48.645
Dad,

00:32:50.205 --> 00:32:51.645
what's going on?

00:33:02.044 --> 00:33:03.725
Who is that hooligan?

00:33:04.405 --> 00:33:06.124
He's the caregiver I hired for you.

00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:07.364
To take care of you.

00:33:09.844 --> 00:33:10.844
Who are you?

00:33:11.284 --> 00:33:12.685
I'm your son.

00:33:13.445 --> 00:33:14.524
You are my father.

00:33:15.324 --> 00:33:17.084
My son? Wait.

00:33:18.604 --> 00:33:19.604
Who am I?

00:33:20.685 --> 00:33:21.764
You are my father,

00:33:22.245 --> 00:33:23.645
named Leng Xingguo.

00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:25.205
I am your son,

00:33:25.524 --> 00:33:26.685
named Leng Qiming.

00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:28.044
- Remember?
- Wrong.

00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:30.245
Wrong.

00:33:31.124 --> 00:33:34.804
You... why are you in my house?

00:33:35.524 --> 00:33:36.205
Dad,

00:33:36.764 --> 00:33:38.044
we are family.

00:33:38.405 --> 00:33:40.445
So we have to live together.

00:33:41.245 --> 00:33:42.405
Family?

00:33:46.084 --> 00:33:46.965
Where's my mom?

00:33:48.925 --> 00:33:50.685
Where's my mom? I want to see my mom.

00:33:50.885 --> 00:33:53.205
I'm begging you. Please.

00:33:53.284 --> 00:33:54.804
I want to see my mom.

00:33:54.804 --> 00:33:56.165
Let my mom come.

00:33:56.165 --> 00:33:56.725
Get up.

00:33:56.725 --> 00:33:59.405
I want to see my mom. Let my mom come.

00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:01.044
I miss my mom.

00:34:03.165 --> 00:34:04.685
Mom.

00:34:14.744 --> 00:34:19.864
(No-Name Diner)

00:34:42.765 --> 00:34:43.365
Jiao,

00:34:43.845 --> 00:34:46.005
I'm attending
the charity adoption sale event today.

00:34:46.325 --> 00:34:47.320
I'm taking the noon off.

00:34:47.564 --> 00:34:49.405
They'll handle the shop later.

00:34:49.405 --> 00:34:50.164
Got it.

00:34:52.124 --> 00:34:53.325
I've thought it through.

00:34:54.044 --> 00:34:55.445
Let's not adopt after all.

00:34:56.285 --> 00:34:58.805
Having a dog
means facing separation eventually.

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:04.124
From now on, I'll make things
for the adoption agency's charity sales.

00:35:05.524 --> 00:35:06.564
Whatever you say.

00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:12.445
Ten yuan per box.

00:35:12.445 --> 00:35:13.325
Green ingredients.

00:35:13.325 --> 00:35:14.285
Homemade.

00:35:14.684 --> 00:35:15.765
Suitable for all dogs.

00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:16.684
Like Akitas

00:35:16.684 --> 00:35:17.805
and Toy Poodles.

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:19.724
(Charity Sale, Gathering Warmth)
And Gold... Golden Retrievers.

00:35:19.724 --> 00:35:20.644
All of them.

00:35:20.644 --> 00:35:21.285
Smell it.

00:35:21.564 --> 00:35:22.485
Pure and natural.

They've all had their shots.

00:35:27.524 --> 00:35:28.765
Vaccinated too.

00:35:28.765 --> 00:35:29.485
Rest assured.

00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:31.405
Thanks for your kindness.

Ten yuan. Ten yuan.

My dog is six months old.

00:35:37.724 --> 00:35:39.285
It can have these.

00:35:39.285 --> 00:35:42.285
A single box
lasts a six-month-old puppy a full week.

00:35:42.885 --> 00:35:44.044
I'll take two boxes then.

00:35:44.044 --> 00:35:44.805
Two boxes, right?

00:35:44.805 --> 00:35:45.845
(Take Me Home)
Okay, thanks.

How much per box?

It's ten yuan. Ten yuan.

Yes, that's right.

00:36:00.365 --> 00:36:01.244
Here, little one.

Come here, come here.

00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:04.084
Have some water.

00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:05.084
Aren't you hot?

Jing, here is an adoption flyer.

00:36:10.325 --> 00:36:12.164
Take a look if you're interested.

00:36:13.044 --> 00:36:14.524
You're very caring towards dogs.

00:36:15.084 --> 00:36:17.485
The most important condition
for adoption

00:36:17.644 --> 00:36:19.084
is to treat them like family

00:36:19.164 --> 00:36:20.164
and never abandon them.

00:36:20.164 --> 00:36:21.564
You perfectly meet the criteria.

00:36:23.564 --> 00:36:24.524
Okay, thanks.

00:36:24.524 --> 00:36:25.604
We'll not adopt, however.

00:36:26.524 --> 00:36:27.244
Alright.

00:36:28.684 --> 00:36:30.164
Time's up. Let's head back for now.

00:36:32.684 --> 00:36:33.365
Okay.

00:36:35.164 --> 00:36:36.244
Good. Come on.

00:36:37.965 --> 00:36:38.405
Good.

00:36:43.325 --> 00:36:44.365

You're too kind.

00:37:34.724 --> 00:37:36.524
Mr. Leng is a respected senior.

00:37:36.524 --> 00:37:37.325
Rest assured,

00:37:37.365 --> 00:37:40.204
he will receive excellent care here.

And you shouldn't be too pessimistic.

Although Mr. Leng's condition
has progressed rapidly,

00:37:46.524 --> 00:37:49.244
we've had patients
in similar situations before.

After a period of intensive treatment,
they showed improvement.

He might not need
long-term hospitalization.

00:37:55.124 --> 00:37:55.564
Okay.

If you need anything, just tell him.

00:38:16.684 --> 00:38:17.925
If he can't solve it,

00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:19.285
have him go find a nurse.

00:38:20.124 --> 00:38:21.965
Your things,

00:38:22.084 --> 00:38:24.124

00:38:24.124 --> 00:38:26.164
are all in this drawer.

00:38:27.684 --> 00:38:28.644
Be especially careful

Open your eyes slowly.

Don't rush. Take your time.

00:38:57.564 --> 00:38:59.604
Make sure
to shake it off properly, got it?

00:38:59.684 --> 00:39:01.845
Otherwise, in this heat,
you could get chafing,

Young man,

00:40:27.644 --> 00:40:29.524
do you work in the same place as Leng?

00:40:30.644 --> 00:40:31.925
Is it a permanent position?

00:40:34.564 --> 00:40:35.445
It's fine.

00:40:35.445 --> 00:40:37.005
Even if it's just a temp job,

00:40:37.325 --> 00:40:38.805
it's not ordinary anyway.

00:40:40.084 --> 00:40:41.204
Are you local?

00:40:41.365 --> 00:40:42.325
Yes, I am.

00:40:43.445 --> 00:40:44.724
You're not seeing anyone, right?

00:40:45.485 --> 00:40:47.885
My granddaughter
just got her master's degree

00:40:47.885 --> 00:40:49.204
from a top-tier university.

00:40:49.445 --> 00:40:52.724
She landed a job at a foreign company
as soon as she graduated.

00:40:56.365 --> 00:40:58.285
Foreign companies
aren't stable these days.

Government jobs are the most secure.

00:41:00.845 --> 00:41:01.405
(I'll send you the details later.)
Right?

00:41:02.285 --> 00:41:03.805
You should consider my daughter.

00:41:04.325 --> 00:41:05.365
A middle school teacher.

00:41:05.564 --> 00:41:07.244
At a key school, not a homeroom teacher,

00:41:07.244 --> 00:41:08.728
with summer and winter breaks.

00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:12.885
Your younger daughter
is several years older than him.

00:41:12.885 --> 00:41:14.365
How could that be possible?

00:41:14.365 --> 00:41:15.885
Why wouldn't it be possible?

00:41:16.164 --> 00:41:17.485
She's not that much older.

00:41:17.485 --> 00:41:19.485
An older wife is a treasure.

00:41:19.485 --> 00:41:21.564
What's wrong with having more wealth?

00:41:22.084 --> 00:41:23.164
Alright, alright.

00:41:23.325 --> 00:41:24.925
Go dance. Come on, go dance.

00:41:24.925 --> 00:41:25.524
It can wait.

00:41:26.965 --> 00:41:28.044
Come on, let's dance too.

00:41:28.124 --> 00:41:28.845
Young man,

00:41:28.845 --> 00:41:30.445
you should consider my granddaughter.

00:41:30.445 --> 00:41:31.005
Okay.

00:41:31.005 --> 00:41:32.405
She is a master's graduate.

00:41:37.325 --> 00:41:38.485
I'm taking a break.

00:41:38.684 --> 00:41:39.485
Okay.

00:41:39.485 --> 00:41:40.325
Go rest.

00:41:40.644 --> 00:41:41.285
Look.

00:41:41.644 --> 00:41:43.124
My daughter is great.

00:41:43.405 --> 00:41:45.485
Your daughter is older
than that young man.

00:41:46.485 --> 00:41:47.965
I give up.

00:41:48.845 --> 00:41:50.684
You didn't even step in to help me out.

00:41:52.524 --> 00:41:54.965
That's why I said right away
that I have a girlfriend.

00:41:57.365 --> 00:42:00.445
From your tone,
things must be going well.

00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:01.405
Tell me about it.

00:42:02.724 --> 00:42:03.965
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:10.724
When exactly did you get
that injury on your face?

00:42:14.485 --> 00:42:15.164
