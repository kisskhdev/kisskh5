[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.210
[Episode 16]

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.570
Here.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.500
A wedding gift.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.450
Did you make it?

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.310
I saw it.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.470
She wove it herself.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.280
Treat Shao well.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.060
I've memorized

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.920
your ID number.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.060
If you dare do anything wrong,

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.400
I can track you down.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.400
Don't worry, Officer Bai.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.930
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.930
Alright.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.370
Get going.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.250
Drive safely.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.090
Shao.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.220
Are you still mad at me?

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.410
Bai Ji!

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.890
Bai Ji!

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.280
If you dare treat Shao badly...

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.610
What?

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.030
I'll bash your head in!

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.980
You silly child!

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.110
Let me see.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.650
It's bleeding.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.680
Here.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.000
I'm fine, Auntie.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.090
Bai Ji.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.050
Bai Ji! Bai Ji! Bai Ji!

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.590
It's a deal then.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.690
If, in the future,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.720
I let Shao

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.970
suffer even a little,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.280
I'll buy you a plane ticket,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.410
and you can come to Guangzhou

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.470
and bash my head in.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.800
Go.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.930
Just go.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.770
Chun,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.390
my letters to you

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.019
might become less frequent.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.240
Because now,

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.740
I have to write to 2 people.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.380
Shao and Xi have already

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.990
gone to Guangzhou.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.640
Officer Bai!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.740
We should get going!

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.360
Okay, coming!

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.330
Shao is starting

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.140
her own clothing company.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.890
She's busy all day long.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.780
She says she often gets bumped into
in Guangzhou.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.180
Xi says

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.370
it's because she walks too slowly.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.360
Perhaps,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.150
we're used to walking slowly.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.210
Because on the grassland,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.640
walking fast or slow

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.060
makes no difference.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.780
The destination is right there.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.830
It won't run away.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.510
Because of Uncle Lin,

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.040
Bai Ji resigned and came home.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.660
He was reluctant.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.770
But now,

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.050
he is moving forward at his own pace,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.330
continuing to search

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.510
for his place.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.300
Sister, come here!

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.390
Hurry up!

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.430
Come on, come on.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.830
Alright.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.220
Everyone is here, right?

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.120
You've all seen the design,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.660
right?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.240
Sanitary belt.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.590
I think I'm luckier than Bai Ji.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.909
I haven't taken so many detours.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.290
I can't claim any achievements yet,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.350
but as to what I'm doing now,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.110
I think it's meaningful.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.230
However...

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.310
Shao Yunfei said

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.040
there are no wrong turns

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.630
or long ways around.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.780
Every step has value.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.890
Maybe,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.690
one day,

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.409
you'll suddenly realize

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.690
you can sail your ship

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.250
anywhere in the world

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.910
you want to go.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.920
I asked him,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.380
why a ship?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.270
He said

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.690
it's because the world

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.170
is connected by the ocean.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.210
But I still prefer

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.560
the grasslands, snow-capped mountains,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.810
and the starry sky of Bolamula.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.890
He said

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.920
he likes them too.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.270
We talked a lot when we were in danger.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.430
I didn't expect

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.740
him to have

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.280
a steady and reliable side.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.159
You really

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.909
can't judge a book by its cover.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.770
Yan!

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.560
Yan!

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.750
Bai Ji.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.240
Going to make rounds?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.040
Hurry, hurry.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.010
Eat your food. Hurry.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.990
Not today.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.860
There's no time.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.690
I have to go now.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.860
You can't skip meals.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.220
Even yaks need to eat grass

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.370
to produce milk.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.040
I'll pack it for you.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.720
No, no, no.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.820
Your lunchbox isn't convenient.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.990
We have buns with us.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.420
I made this especially for you.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.880
-Have some.
-There's no time, really.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.110
Let's go, Senior.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.690
Coming.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.000
Here.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.160
Hello.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.490
Hello.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.540
Come on, take your time.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.000
Come on.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.900
Okay, thanks.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.610
No problem.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.320
I get a double portion?

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.500
You've been working very hard.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.360
I'll bring you double from now on.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.140
Will I get this every time?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.720
This isn't for you.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.370
This isn't for you.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.100
You eat this.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.230
I'll just eat this.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.520
Now you're shy?

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.870
You were bold enough when you arranged it.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.450
These beans are good.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.470
Here.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.750
You eat this too, Mom.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.810
Have more meat.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.680
It's good, right?

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.410
Can I ask you something, Mom?

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.770
That senior

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.860
who has gone on rounds with Yan today—

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.280
what does he do?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.630
He's a doctor.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.340
Of course, I know he's a doctor.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.669
I know the few guys

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.299
in your hospital inside out.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.130
I mean, is he

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:40.890
new here?

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.550
A graduate student

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.750
from a medical university in Shanghai.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.290
He's here for medical aid.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.370
I heard his mom is a doctor, too.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.510
His dad

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.610
studied pharmacy.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.950
A family of doctors.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.190
He looks delicate,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.740
but he can handle hardship.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.070
He learned to ride fast.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.510
Yanzi

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.470
only taught him a few times,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.870
and he rides pretty well.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.050
You, you, you.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.960
Stop eating.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.760
Just eat one portion, Mom.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.360
Your face is getting chubby.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.750
Eat less.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.820
I'm leaving, Mom.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.170
You go on.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.460
So stingy.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.080
I need this from now on.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.850
How is it?

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.290
This film is good, right?

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.950
It's okay.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.700
Cost a fortune.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.310
So now can you

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.570
teach me photography?

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.080
Sure.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.630
The model is right here.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.160
Shoot me.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:35.910
Perfect.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.970
Come on, shoot him.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.800
Strike a pose then.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.370
What are you doing?

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:47.990
Guess.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Panning for gold.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.250
Are you panning for gold?

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.250
Yunfei, you're amazing.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.620
You knew it instantly.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.300
Of course he is.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.150
You were in the same trade.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.100
Shoo, shoo. Don't...

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.840
Yunfei, were you a fossicker too?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.510
I wasn't. Never.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.310
Never, never.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.530
This pose is really bad.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.160
Stop doing it.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.620
Come on.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.380
Put it down.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:06.930
Get in.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.330
Get in.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.200
Look.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.760
Let me see.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.280
Right.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.240
Shoot from here.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.340
Okay.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.260
Loosen up a bit.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.460
Hold the wheel.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.690
Shift gears.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.270
Just strike a pose.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.080
Right.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.360
Don't.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.980
Don't start it!

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.460
Move aside!

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:26.490
Get out.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.890
You'll break it.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.580
Then I'd have to fix it.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.420
Don't mess around.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.070
Don't touch the car again.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:38.890
Okay.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.480
Ju.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.610
Can you teach me to drive?

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.150
No.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.970
I'll wash

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.890
your clothes for a week.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:48.580
No way.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.740
Two weeks.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.490
Come on.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.340
One month.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.800
I'll think about it.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.740
Two months.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.380
Three months.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.450
Deal.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:10.720
You look so smug.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.240
Tashi, let me tell you.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.910
Someone like her,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.770
in the old society,

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.020
would be Huang Shiren,
the ruthless landlord.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.850
Inhumane.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.020
What does that mean?

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.070
Inhumane.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.070
Spot on.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.580
But he's the one

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.840
who's willing to do it.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:32.760
Here.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.520
Just this?

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.120
Not enough?

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.450
There were potatoes yesterday.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.220
You can have my tsampa.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.120
Here.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.020
Yesterday

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.390
was Uncle Zhacuo's birthday,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.450
so we had good food.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.330
We usually just eat this.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.510
Only soup.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.850
What language did you speak?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.960
Was it English?

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.440
Yeah.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.820
He's gone crazy memorizing words.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.050
It's called situational learning.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.770
Ignore him.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.750
How do you say "Ge Da Tang"?

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:19.860
It's called

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.800
dough drop soup.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.020
What about this?

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.050
This... This...

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.690
Zanba (tsampa).

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.050
I think next time,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.320
you'll fail the exam again.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.860
Your English

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.020
isn't as good as Tashi's.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:42.640
Exactly.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.520
Come in.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.130
Cleaning your gun?

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.790
You bet.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.750
Ever since you criticized us,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.600
everyone

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.260
has kept their guns spotless.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.660
Come on.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.720
Only Han Xuechao

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.650
cleans it well.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.500
How are you and Shao doing

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.560
with distributing the toilet paper?

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.130
It's going okay.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.050
What's up?

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.100
Here.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.050
10,000.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.030
So much money.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.630
Where did you get it?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.870
I borrowed it from my sister.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:08.780
She has savings she doesn't use.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.050
It's just sitting there.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.580
Take it for your emergency.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.780
Thank your sister for me.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.430
No problem.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.230
I'm off.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.460
Wait.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.440
Take this 2,000

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.030
to He.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.290
I borrowed the money

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.840
for you to redeem your house.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.820
What's this for?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.800
I will.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.670
8,000 for the house,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.070
and this 2,000 for the team.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.530
Isn't that killing two birds
with one stone?

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.460
Not enough, is it?

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.500
True.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.650
Give the team another 1,000.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.510
Everyone has been eating poorly.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.410
I meant the house.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.690
You still owe 10,000.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.360
Well...

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.570
What if I

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.550
pay back 6,000 first?

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.240
For the sake of our relationship,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.240
he probably

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.200
won't take away my pasture, right?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
This way, the pasture will be saved,

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.260
and the team will get an extra thousand.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.240
As for the rest,

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.770
I'll pay back slowly later.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440
What do you think?

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.510
It's not great.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.860
I don't know

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.080
if you're shrewd or stupid.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.700
You're back!

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.590
What are you doing?

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.730
Milking the cow.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:11.610
Leave the cow alone.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.600
I just milked it.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.700
You haven't done it in years.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.230
Careful, or it'll kick you.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.350
Then what should I do?

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.600
Go hang the laundry.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.510
Okay.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.660
Come, rest a bit.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.540
Have some tea.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.900
I'm almost done.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.830
I'll drink it later.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.020
It'll get cold.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.780
There's something in my pocket.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.440
Take it out.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.300
This side.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.560
Is this it?

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.540
Open it and see.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:11.450
You paid the money back?

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.579
I paid back most of it.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:15.349
There's a little left,

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.150
but he gave me the IOU back.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.740
Where did you get the money?

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.069
Did you borrow it again?

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.579
My sheep!

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.819
How many sheep did you sell?

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.070
I didn't sell a single tuft of wool.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.530
It's the team's money.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.550
Cairen.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.320
I'm usually not home.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.580
It's been hard on you.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.100
I have good news too.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:51.670
♪ Snow lotus in my heart ♪

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.480
I'm cured.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.720
I went for a check-up this morning.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.460

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.590

I'm completely healed.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.230
That's wonderful.

From now on, use

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:06.400
that toilet paper properly.

Bai Ji.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.270
Uncle Lin.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.960
What are you hiding from?

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.090
No,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.060
I'm not hiding.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:03.970
You...

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.640
Are you here to pick up
medicine for Auntie Zhu?

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.070
She's giving extra tutoring

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.720
to the students

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.810
who are lagging behind.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:10.720
So, here I am.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.610
Are you...

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.050
selling boxed lunches?

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.800
I had nothing to do at home,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.660
so I've started a small business.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.780
Give me 2 boxes.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.010
Okay.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.640
No, no, no.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.460
I can't take your money.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.920
My mom will scold me if she finds out.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.000
You're running a business.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
It's not her call.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.810
Uncle... Let me get your change,

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.440
Uncle Lin!

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.240
Keep it!

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.640
A 2-yuan boxed lunch

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.210
can be made this well.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.030
It's really good.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.300
I didn't expect Bai Ji

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.460
to have such skills.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.660
Come in.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.180
Director Zhang.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.710
Okay. Put it here.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.420
I didn't expect it either.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.230
Everyone in the hospital,
from staff to patients,

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.810
says his food is delicious.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.160
He

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.560
gets up early every day

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.610
to prepare the food.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.070
He cares more about this
than anything else.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.740
But Bai Ji is still so young.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.580
If he keeps doing this,

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.110
it's not much of a career.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.790
It's fine.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.030
He likes cooking.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.400
Keeping him by my side

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.260
puts me at ease.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.210
Zhang.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:24.430
If Zhu Li

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.660
said anything to you,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.560
don't take it to heart.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.710
Not at all.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.300
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.110
She is a mother.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.110
She has already

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.710
been very considerate of me.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.710
After all,

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.170
it was Bai Shao who acted inappropriately.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.160
I didn't raise her well.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.960
It's my fault.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:41.850
Come on.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.570
When it comes down to these things,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.030
there's no right or wrong.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.410
We, as parents,

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.880
were just indulging in wishful thinking,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.480
wanting the two kids to date.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.410
But chemistry

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.410
is up to them.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.500
We can't control it.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:59.160
And we shouldn't take it

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.200
personally.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.270
Yes.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:02.770
Right.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.430
Our two families

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:07.510
should carry on

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.370
just as before.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.940
If, because of this,

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.390
we stop seeing each other,

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.810
won't that

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.740
make us a laughingstock to others?

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.960
So I think

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.050
Bai Ji should go back.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.550
What do you say?

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.240
It's not about not seeing each other.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.260
It's just about Bai Ji,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.160
and I'm really sorry

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.360
to trouble you again.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.880
You just can't get past

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.940
this mental block.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.310
This affects the child's future.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.000
That's why

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.940
Zhu Li said you handled

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.520
this matter foolishly.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.530
I was just afraid you'd overthink it.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.690
Bai Ji actually

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.950
wants to come back too.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.640
Really.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:44.170
Come in.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.660
Director Zhang,

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.190
the prescription is ready.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:48.610
Okay.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.540
Here is her medicine.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.410
It's settled then.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.800
Let's eat, come on.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.370
The pickup's leaf spring is loose.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.730
If they can't fix it today,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.460
have Han go buy parts tomorrow.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.060
Okay.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.200
Did you call me?

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.530
About your father asking you to go back,

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.530
what do you think?

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.430
I told him

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.590
if he wanted me back,

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.250
he had to trade 10 sheep for me.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.520
He can't bear to part with them.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.390
So there's nothing I can do.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.240
Fine.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.450
Got it.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.480
I'm heading out.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.540
Have we got enough gas?

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.430
We're a little short.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.830
I'll go borrow some money

00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.590
to pay off our tab

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.920
before they'll sell to us.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.550
Okay. Make it quick.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.680
As for the instant noodles,

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.140
can we bring more this time?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.000
With the previous amount

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.140
for 7 people,

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:08.660
we may basically

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.120
starve for the last 3 days.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.180
Six people.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.680
Captain,

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.370
did Tashi teach you math?

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.330
Shao will leave in 2 days.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.440
He's not coming with us
into the mountains this time.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.570
Don't you know that?

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.760
It's understandable, actually.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.110
Shao's leave

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.350
is long overdue.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.740
Conditions are so tough here.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.180
During the last few trips,

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.380
he managed to keep up.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.740
For a reporter,

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.900
that's impressive.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:47.880
He's not someone

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.340
who's afraid of hardship.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:50.510
Right, right.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:51.610
He is someone

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.700
who goes all out.

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.680
Yesterday,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:24:59.900
he showed me the draft

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.700
he wrote.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.830
It's really good.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.850
But on our team,

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.130
except for you,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.760
he's interviewed everyone.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.250
Shao complained to me

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.400
several times,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.720
saying you keep stalling
and won't cooperate.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.740
On our team,

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.250
you're the only woman

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.130
and the only police officer.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.860
It wouldn't be right
if you didn't say something.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.010
I have nothing to say.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.720
Aren't they cold?

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:35.220
You don't understand.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.180
It's spacious there.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.530
If they really start fighting,

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:38.410
they have room to move.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:39.670
It saves the bottles and jars

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.930
from getting smashed.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.040
We'll still have to break it up.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.000
No need.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.510
Shao Yunfei is too soft-skinned.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.170
He definitely can't beat Bai.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.940
Why do I get the feeling

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.740
that you're avoiding me lately?

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:53.810
No, I'm not.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.050
It's just

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.530
that I don't really like
being interviewed.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.960
You're harder to deal with
than leaders.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.890
I've finally got to interview you.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.850
I hate the kind of people

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.340
who run to leaders for everything.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:07.900
When you were in school,

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.960
did you always snitch to the teacher?

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:11.970
Let's just get started.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.230
What do you want to ask?

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.370
How old are you?

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.180
Don't you know how old I am?

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.330
Where are you from?

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.310
You stayed at my house

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.140
for so many days.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.620
You chatted with my mom every day.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.150
Don't you know where I live?

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.900
It's the same process for everyone.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.920
So are you going to interview me or not?

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.180
If not, I'm going back.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.130
What is your dream?

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:43.320
Are you

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.550
writing a primary school composition?

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.140
Then let me ask something else.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.160
Forget it. No need to change.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.090
That one is fine.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.640
When I was little,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.420
I wanted to be like my mom

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.550
and become a doctor.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.690
Later, I liked shooting guns.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:58.180
So I became a police officer

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.980
and joined the Mountain Patrol.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:00.950
It took a lot

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.560
to finally get off the bench.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.180
I just want to do a good job patrolling

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.780
and be a real police officer.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.640
Your mom said

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.640
you don't like sitting in an office.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.110
Shao Yunfei.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:17.190
Do you

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.820
not understand what I meant?

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.080
You might not know this.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.420
Before, I would rather

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.450
have transferred back to an office job

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.450
than stayed in the Mountain Patrol.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:31.740
I know.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.660
You wanted to go into the mountains
back then,

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.520
but the Captain wouldn't let you.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.140
I felt

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.460
that he wanted me around

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.740
just to use me as a handyman,

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.800
like a decoration.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.840
He didn't give me a single chance.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.770
He just had a preconceived notion

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.770
and dismissed me,

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.570
making me follow

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:46.510
his way of doing things.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.240
Why should I?

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.960
I thought,

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.510
instead of wasting away here,

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.150
I should just go back to the bureau.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:56.850
Even if I went to Household Registration,

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.950
I would still be

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.100
the most capable one there.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.230
I'd do the job better than anyone else.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.240
There are many kinds of police officers.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.090
Just like you reporters,

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.490
there are many kinds too.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.490
If you do one kind well

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.980
and push yourself to the limit,

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.850
you can be a real police officer.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.790
That's basically what I mean.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.400
So,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.040
do you have any plans

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.930
for the future?

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.610
Like,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.270
after the reserve is established...

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:31.920
No.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.770
Didn't I tell you last time?

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.530
I just want to stay here

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.730
and continue being a police officer.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:42.790
Bai Ju.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:43.980
Can't you just

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.110
humor me a little?

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.560
I really don't have any.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:49.780
Really.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.060
Is it wrong to have no plans?

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.160
My dad was someone

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.490
who didn't make plans.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.510
He just wanted to stay grounded

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.860
and do his job well.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.340
No matter how big or small,

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.530
he gave it his all.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.060
I think that's pretty good.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:13.470
No matter how far you plan,

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.060
it's better to keep your feet
on the ground.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.910
But life

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.200
isn't just about work.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.520
There's family,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.480
friends,

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.170
and lovers.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:24.610
Those are

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:25.940
even harder to plan for.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:27.420
Really?

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.130
I think you're quite willing

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.190
to plan for others.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.050
What did I do?

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.680
When He Qingyuan was chasing girls,

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.680
you really poured cold water on him.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:36.710
That wasn't very nice.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.030
How was I not nice?

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.310
He's the only one on the team

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.160
I can actually

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:43.890
talk to.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.710
If he goes chasing other girls,

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.810
what am I supposed to do?

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.070
To chase them with him?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.420
But you can't let everyone

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.640
stay single forever.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.810
I don't really mean to stop him

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:52.720
from dating.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.710
Besides,

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.300
when love comes,

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:57.300
who can stop it?

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.730
What about you?

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.740
What about me?

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.750
You have a job,
but you don't work properly.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.960
You take creative leave all the time,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.550
run around outside,

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.810
and never settle down.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.540
Is it

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.900
that everywhere you go,

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:16.650
besides doing interviews,

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.180
you're just chasing girls?

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.200
Me?

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.600
Who did I chase?

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.220
One last question.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.420
Why did you kiss me?

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.130
That time we got caught in the snow
in the Uninhabited Zone,

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.190
why did you kiss me?

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.270
You were hypothermic and hallucinating.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.200
So you don't know

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.020
that I know you kissed me, right?

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.950
I'm very sure you kissed me.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.380
I felt it.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.470
It's just that at that time,

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:03.020
my body couldn't

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.110
react.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:08.520
I...

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:09.790
I...

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.920
I only...

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.140
I only did that because I thought
you were dying.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:13.850
You said it yourself.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.540
You told me to shoot you dead.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.920
Then why didn't you kiss Zhacuo?

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.140
Bai is looking this way.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.020
Is that the signal?

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:24.500
Must be!

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:24.900
Go!

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:26.750
Don't cause trouble!

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.400
Don't cause trouble.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:29.570
Sit down.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.170
Maybe I overthought it.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.380
But I did think about it seriously,

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.130
and I tried to start planning.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.720
However,

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.030
you're right.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.330
No matter how good the plan is,

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.730
it's better to keep your feet
on the ground.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.960
Because sometimes,
no matter how well you plan,

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.760
it might just be

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.940
wishful thinking.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.190
W-What are you doing?

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:16.790
After I leave,

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.050
don't miss me too much.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.300
I can't wait for you to leave.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.060
Get lost.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.440
Don't come back again.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.210
Let's go.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:47.630
It's so cold.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:48.160
Let's go.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.540
You go back first.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.170
I want to stay here

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.630
and sit for a while longer.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.390
I hope that you can

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.530
deliver these notes

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:00.500
directly to

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.410
the hands of the leaders

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.540
of relevant provincial departments.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.900
The Department of Forestry,

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.270
the Lands Administration Bureau,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.530
and the Department
of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:08.530
As long as a department

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.880
is related to this matter,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.409
you should pay them a visit.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.400
Regarding the establishment
of the nature reserve,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.460
aren't you going to submit

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.590
a formal report?

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.449
Then what is the purpose of these notes?

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:20.460
I will work on

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.480
the formal report

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.920
on the nature reserve quickly.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.510
But,

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.429
if we wait to finish a full report

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.880
before sending it up
from the county to the city

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.060
and then to the province,

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.389
it'll take way too long.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.190
So you want

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.330
the leaders to have

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.850
a preliminary understanding of this place

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:37.980
beforehand, right?

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.500
Okay.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.739
Don't worry.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.830
I will do my best.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:48.820
Thank you.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.310
Put the two seats

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.000
a bit apart.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:57.650
Spread out a bit.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.460
Sangba, you sit there.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:58.960
Let me see.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.960
Let me have a look.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.230
So serious?

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:07.610
It's a big group photo.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.320
This is my most precious souvenir

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.780
from the Mountain Patrol.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.030
Is it?

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.970
Is this the most precious one?

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:15.730
Yes.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.030
I'm planning

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:18.090
to use it as the photo

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.460
at the end of my report.

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.380
The Public Security Brigade
has a mission today.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.830
Bai Ju has gone to the bureau to help.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:25.690
She can't come.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:31.970
It's a pity.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.090
It's nothing.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:40.580
It's okay

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.390
if she doesn't come to see me off.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.150
I meant,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.380
our team isn't all here today.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:47.420
It's a pity that we can't all

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.550
be in the newspaper.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:52.820
Zhacuo,

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.140
are you ready?

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.050
Tell the Captain to come down.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.820
Han. Han.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.770
Come on, come on.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.820
Coming.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.070
Okay, coming.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:00.570
Captain,

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.970
Reporter Shao has been setting up
for ages.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:04.820
Do I sit here?

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.420
Okay, come on.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.520
Almost ready.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.150
Sit properly.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.080
Okay, here we go.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:10.820
Look at the camera.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.500
Hold it.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.190
Brother.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.630
How's business?

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.230
Is it alright?

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.230
Is business okay?

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.920
Pretty good.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.650
Pretty good.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.250
Alright,

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.700
now you can shift gears.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.590
Head up. Head up.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.230
Look ahead when shifting gears.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.490
Straighten the wheel.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.100
Don't look down.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:38:59.710
Look ahead.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.010
This all needs to be muscle memory.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.870
Make it a habit.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:02.620
Understand?

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.920
We're back!

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.600
We're back!

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.760
We're back!

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.910
Jiumei, Liu!

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.210
When did you get back?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.490
Give it to me.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.010
We're in the newspaper!

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:27.920
Look, look!

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.570
The photo. The photo.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:28.960

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.040

You're in the paper.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.730
