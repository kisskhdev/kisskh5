=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 9=

00:01:21.943 --> 00:01:26.022
I remember you loved
Rembrandt most back then.

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:30.022
You always said his paintings
carried a tragic tone.

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:33.080
What about you?

00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:35.302
Do you still like Monet?

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:37.703
No, not anymore.

00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:46.223
Do you still paint?

00:01:50.063 --> 00:01:50.680
And you?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.143
What do you do now?

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:55.503
I don't paint either.

00:01:56.423 --> 00:01:57.803
Now,

00:01:59.064 --> 00:02:00.102
I run a small business.

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:16.743
Remember how we used to come here
after evening self-study?

00:02:23.303 --> 00:02:24.102
Yes.

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:29.063
People say you should look forward.

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:32.312
But some things

00:02:34.072 --> 00:02:35.183
just can't be forgotten.

00:02:44.783 --> 00:02:45.743
Like this place.

00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:52.542
I still remember us sitting
right over there discussing Rembrandt.

00:03:13.023 --> 00:03:14.623
This is my favorite painting.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.623
What do you like about Rembrandt?

00:03:21.023 --> 00:03:21.903
Some say

00:03:22.463 --> 00:03:25.422
Rembrandt's art depicts the struggle
between light and dark.

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:28.623
What do you think?

00:03:30.582 --> 00:03:31.503
I agree.

00:03:32.343 --> 00:03:35.183
Light and dark
are inherently intertwined.

00:03:35.422 --> 00:03:36.903
Just like this world.

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:39.582
There's sunlight, and there are shadows.

00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:45.343
That's why I never
really liked Rembrandt.

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:48.023
I prefer Monet,

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:50.142
always standing solely in the sunlight.

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:55.704
How lucky must one be

00:03:56.856 --> 00:03:58.296
to always stand in the light.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.503
Let's talk next time.

00:04:22.782 --> 00:04:23.582
Dan Qing.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:27.983
Take care.

00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:31.983
You too.

00:04:58.543 --> 00:05:00.462
Here, your favorite qingbuliang.

00:05:01.623 --> 00:05:03.103
Jing, you dote on me most.

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:14.142
Did you meet the nephew of Tang's wife?

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:18.262
We added on social media,
but haven't met.

00:05:18.582 --> 00:05:19.902
Why? What happened?

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:23.743
Nothing to talk about.

00:05:24.183 --> 00:05:25.183
What would we talk about?

00:05:25.582 --> 00:05:28.142
How could you not know
what to talk about?

00:05:29.342 --> 00:05:30.983
Our jobs are completely different.

00:05:30.983 --> 00:05:32.183
He's at the Forestry Bureau.

00:05:32.743 --> 00:05:34.183
We just don't connect.

00:05:36.183 --> 00:05:36.983
So you...

00:05:37.623 --> 00:05:40.543
You two should talk
about things outside work.

00:05:41.222 --> 00:05:42.183
Like what?

00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:45.983
Like movies,

00:05:46.582 --> 00:05:47.582
art,

00:05:48.183 --> 00:05:49.142
pop songs,

00:05:49.142 --> 00:05:50.743
food,

00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:52.983
and anything young people like.

00:05:53.382 --> 00:05:55.943
Jing, you know how it is.

00:05:56.183 --> 00:05:58.382
I barely have time
to pay attention to any of that.

00:05:58.382 --> 00:05:59.702
Just making small talk?

00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:03.743
I'm really at my wits' end
with you cops.

00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:05.022
Well...

00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:13.462
For us, it's just the same
three points every day:

00:06:13.782 --> 00:06:15.822
the station, home, and here.

00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:19.063
The most relaxing part of my day
is eating something at your place.

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:23.303
And the thing we care about most
is solving cases.

00:06:23.423 --> 00:06:25.303
Nothing else much.

00:06:28.663 --> 00:06:29.743
I can see it now.

00:06:30.582 --> 00:06:34.543
Your love life will only be solved
within the police department.

00:07:45.543 --> 00:07:46.822
Let me show you something good.

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:52.423
Here.

00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:04.382
How is it?

00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:05.423
Do you like it?

00:08:34.783 --> 00:08:35.663
It smells amazing!

00:08:36.222 --> 00:08:37.783
How did you know I hadn't eaten?

00:08:39.183 --> 00:08:40.383
What is this you cooked?

00:08:55.982 --> 00:08:57.543
What's wrong now?

00:08:57.622 --> 00:08:59.742
Weren't you on a date
with your unrequited love today?

00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:01.222
How was it? Tell me.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.183
Mind your own business.

00:09:06.783 --> 00:09:09.383
You're in a bad mood.

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.183
Something's bothering you. Talk to me.

00:09:16.183 --> 00:09:17.183
Won't say?

00:09:17.742 --> 00:09:18.982
Then I'm going to eat noodles.

00:09:28.824 --> 00:09:31.742
(Dongyuan Community
Convenience Health Service Station)

00:09:31.742 --> 00:09:32.702
I never expected

00:09:33.263 --> 00:09:36.502
that Niu Bosheng really lost
his bag and clothes.

00:09:37.383 --> 00:09:38.582
This guy is so twisted.

00:09:39.143 --> 00:09:40.663
He must have planned it long ago.

00:09:41.462 --> 00:09:42.543
That's possible.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.512
But getting people who barely know him

00:09:46.008 --> 00:09:48.742
to remember something from months ago

00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:50.383
was still quite risky, wasn't it?

00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:51.903
Captain Sun.

00:09:52.462 --> 00:09:54.903
Why are you speaking up for Niu Bosheng?

00:10:17.903 --> 00:10:19.462
You know you had a dream last night?

00:10:19.943 --> 00:10:20.742
Dream talk.

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:23.663
What did I say?

00:10:24.502 --> 00:10:25.622
What could it be?

00:10:26.263 --> 00:10:28.143
Just kept saying one person's name.

00:10:28.502 --> 00:10:29.742
Yumo.

00:11:00.822 --> 00:11:01.943
It is all Wang Xiaole.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:04.063
There are words too.

00:11:05.462 --> 00:11:08.222
May 17, 2005.

00:11:08.222 --> 00:11:09.462
School organized spring outing.

00:11:09.462 --> 00:11:12.183
This is the first photo
I took of Xiaole.

00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:13.622
Xiaole looks beautiful.

00:11:13.622 --> 00:11:15.063
Like an angel.

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:20.063
December 30, 2006.

00:11:20.063 --> 00:11:22.063
New Year's Gala.

00:11:22.063 --> 00:11:24.903
Xiaole's singing was so beautiful.

00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:29.543
June 2008.

00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:31.063
Grade-wide group photo.

00:11:31.342 --> 00:11:32.143
What a pity.

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:35.822
Our class wasn't next to Xiaole's class.

00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:38.263
That's so corny.

00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:41.342
This guy is really lovesick.

00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:44.822
These photos
are arranged chronologically.

00:11:45.222 --> 00:11:47.342
No close-ups, all taken secretly.

00:11:57.982 --> 00:11:59.502
Condoms of the same brand.

00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:01.183
Round packaging.

00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:02.822
Also arranged chronologically.

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:05.023
But why are all the wrappers
under the tree square?

00:12:17.063 --> 00:12:18.462
The packaging of these condoms

00:12:18.462 --> 00:12:19.702
is of different colors.

00:12:19.943 --> 00:12:21.462
They weren't tossed on the same day.

00:12:23.263 --> 00:12:26.822
This type of condom
shouldn't be commercially available.

00:12:26.943 --> 00:12:29.222
They should be
free family planning supplies.

00:12:29.462 --> 00:12:30.462
Officer,

00:12:30.462 --> 00:12:34.183
I suggest you ask the family planning,
neighborhood committee, and hospitals.

00:13:00.088 --> 00:13:03.063
(Mutt)

00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:04.663
I've already told you.

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:06.502
I didn't kill Xiaole.

00:13:07.102 --> 00:13:08.742
You don't need to waste your time on me.

00:13:08.742 --> 00:13:10.502
Why don't you go find the real killer?

00:13:12.102 --> 00:13:12.903
Niu Bosheng,

00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:16.102
you're an educated person.

00:13:16.303 --> 00:13:17.303
You should understand

00:13:17.702 --> 00:13:21.303
that we wouldn't have brought you here
without solid evidence.

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:23.783
Put it this way.

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:28.143
The evidence we have
points overwhelmingly to you.

00:13:30.102 --> 00:13:34.063
The reason we're still
talking to you here

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:38.663
is to give you a chance to confess.

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:40.383
In my lifetime,

00:13:41.383 --> 00:13:42.582
I dare to admit what I do.

00:13:43.102 --> 00:13:44.582
I'll never shirk it.

00:13:45.702 --> 00:13:47.502
But for things I didn't do,

00:13:47.982 --> 00:13:50.742
whether it's here,
the procuratorate, or the court,

00:13:50.742 --> 00:13:51.663
I won't admit.

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:52.742
Because I didn't do it.

00:13:56.543 --> 00:13:59.102
How long have you known Wang Xiaole?

00:14:00.183 --> 00:14:01.063
17 years.

00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:04.102
Did she know you loved her?

00:14:04.543 --> 00:14:05.342
No.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:09.663
You never confessed to her?

00:14:11.982 --> 00:14:13.622
I've said it before.

00:14:14.702 --> 00:14:17.742
Watching her from afar
was enough for me.

00:14:19.102 --> 00:14:20.702
After Xiaole got together with Wu Da,

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:22.502
I gradually realized

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:25.303
that I projected myself onto Wu Da.

00:14:26.543 --> 00:14:27.582
When they were together,

00:14:27.982 --> 00:14:30.063
it felt like I was with Xiaole.

00:14:32.462 --> 00:14:33.383
To be honest,

00:14:33.943 --> 00:14:35.462
if you truly love someone,

00:14:37.183 --> 00:14:39.582
her happiness becomes your happiness.

00:14:41.222 --> 00:14:42.702
Xiaole chose Wu Da.

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:45.102
And I sincerely wished them well.

00:14:45.263 --> 00:14:47.702
I hope they'll have a long, happy,
and peaceful marriage.

00:14:50.063 --> 00:14:51.502
Then one day, they got divorced.

00:14:52.943 --> 00:14:55.383
Honestly, I was pretty down for a while.

00:14:57.543 --> 00:14:59.222
But later I figured it out.

00:15:00.063 --> 00:15:01.720
Xiaole could find happiness

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.982
with Huang Chong.

00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:07.032
And she could get rid

00:15:07.992 --> 00:15:09.462
of Wu Da, that deadbeat.

00:15:14.742 --> 00:15:18.742
Wang Xiaole and Huang Chong
were already planning to get married.

00:15:19.982 --> 00:15:22.303
They planned to move downtown
after the wedding.

00:15:23.143 --> 00:15:26.222
No more peeping this time, right?

00:15:28.582 --> 00:15:30.622
Huang Chong owns
two properties in Yunxi.

00:15:31.224 --> 00:15:32.728
The most suitable place for marriage

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.023
is the Riverside Garden in downtown.

00:15:37.543 --> 00:15:40.303
I rented an apartment
across from their complex.

00:15:41.462 --> 00:15:44.982
The location and view are great.

00:15:46.582 --> 00:15:47.263
Come in.

00:15:48.702 --> 00:15:50.582
Master, Captain Sun,
may I ask a few questions?

00:15:58.063 --> 00:15:59.663
You called Wu Da a deadbeat.

00:15:59.663 --> 00:16:00.582
What did you mean?

00:16:02.102 --> 00:16:03.303
After they divorced,

00:16:04.183 --> 00:16:07.502
Wu Da would constantly
harass Xiaole at her place.

00:16:07.502 --> 00:16:09.383
And he borrowed a lot of money
from Xiaole too.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.502
Wu Da really

00:16:11.502 --> 00:16:13.183
has no shame as a man.

00:16:14.102 --> 00:16:16.822
Before the divorce,
he was always jealous of Xiaole.

00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:18.102
And he hit her.

00:16:18.742 --> 00:16:22.263
After the divorce, he clung to her
like a leech, pestering her endlessly.

00:16:22.702 --> 00:16:24.502
You witnessed Wu Da hitting Wang Xiaole?

00:16:27.582 --> 00:16:28.502
A few times.

00:16:28.982 --> 00:16:30.303
But it wasn't severe.

00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:31.742
They mostly argued.

00:17:04.183 --> 00:17:05.663
I don't want this life any longer!

00:17:05.663 --> 00:17:07.062
Go live it by yourself!

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:08.462
Useless!

00:17:08.462 --> 00:17:09.423
Say that to me again!

00:17:09.742 --> 00:17:10.462
Say it again!

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:11.032
Useless!

00:17:11.032 --> 00:17:11.640
You...

00:17:13.016 --> 00:17:13.623
Let go of me!

00:17:13.623 --> 00:17:14.502
Say it to me again!

00:17:14.502 --> 00:17:16.343
Useless! You are useless!

00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:17.583
You are useless!

00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:20.222
Coward!

00:17:20.222 --> 00:17:21.383
All you can do is hit women!

00:17:23.702 --> 00:17:24.542
Don't touch me!

00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:25.183
How dare you!

00:17:25.183 --> 00:17:25.742
Let go!

00:17:25.903 --> 00:17:26.823
How dare you defy me!

00:17:27.423 --> 00:17:28.143
How dare you!

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:31.702
Disappear!

00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:32.222
You!

00:17:35.943 --> 00:17:36.742
Let me go!

00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:42.702
Let me go!

00:17:47.302 --> 00:17:48.702
They argued a lot?

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:51.383
Yes.

00:17:52.262 --> 00:17:55.903
Haven't you ever thought
about standing up for Wang Xiaole?

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.742
They made up quickly after every fight.

00:18:00.462 --> 00:18:03.823
Besides, Xiaole chose Wu Da herself.

00:18:04.742 --> 00:18:07.903
I can't and won't
make any decisions for her.

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.903
But I-I did end up
regretting it a bit later.

00:18:13.702 --> 00:18:16.302
Why did I have to lend Wu Da the money
to buy that apartment?

00:18:16.302 --> 00:18:17.782
Without that apartment, Xiaole...

00:18:21.823 --> 00:18:23.062
This is yours, right?

00:18:26.903 --> 00:18:27.542
Yes.

00:18:29.062 --> 00:18:30.262
Did you save every single

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:35.022
condom wrapper?

00:18:43.062 --> 00:18:44.903
They're proof of love
between Xiaole and me.

00:18:46.222 --> 00:18:48.143
Not a single one was lost or missed?

00:18:52.262 --> 00:18:53.903
This brand isn't common here.

00:18:54.462 --> 00:18:55.302
How did you get them?

00:18:55.623 --> 00:18:56.423
From overseas sites.

00:18:57.103 --> 00:18:58.903
I have payment records. You can check.

00:18:59.623 --> 00:19:00.903
Have you ever switched brands?

00:19:02.383 --> 00:19:03.022
No.

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:05.623
Once I set my mind on something,
I stick to it.

00:19:07.903 --> 00:19:11.302
Did anyone else know
about your collection habit?

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:19.183
How could I let
anyone else know about it?

00:19:34.143 --> 00:19:34.823
Master,

00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:37.903
if Niu Bosheng is telling the truth.

00:19:38.262 --> 00:19:41.302
He never used
any other brand of contraceptive.

00:19:41.742 --> 00:19:44.302
Then what about those wrappers
in the pine forest?

00:19:45.302 --> 00:19:46.663
Given Niu Bosheng's personality,

00:19:47.183 --> 00:19:48.903
even if he used a different brand,

00:19:49.262 --> 00:19:51.183
he would have taken
the wrapper back to keep.

00:19:51.183 --> 00:19:52.943
He wouldn't have left it at the scene.

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:57.143
Captain Leng, Ye.

00:19:57.222 --> 00:19:57.943
Listen.

00:19:57.982 --> 00:19:59.623
I investigated
at the community hospital.

00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:02.383
Niu Bosheng's locker
was indeed broken into.

00:20:02.383 --> 00:20:04.183
The clothes and bag really were stolen.

00:20:04.423 --> 00:20:08.143
His colleagues at the community hospital
can confirm all this.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.823
But since there's
no surveillance footage,

00:20:13.302 --> 00:20:16.583
we can't rule out
that he staged it himself.

00:20:16.823 --> 00:20:20.663
After all, the DNA evidence
points directly to him now.

00:20:22.462 --> 00:20:25.462
But it's also true that Niu Bosheng
rented a place near Huang Chong's home

00:20:25.663 --> 00:20:27.022
before the crime occurred.

00:20:27.663 --> 00:20:29.423
If he really planned to commit murder,

00:20:30.183 --> 00:20:31.903
there'd be no reason for him to do that.

00:20:35.542 --> 00:20:36.343
Master,

00:20:37.222 --> 00:20:40.462
don't you think we found
Niu Bosheng a little too easily?

00:20:41.302 --> 00:20:44.542
If no third party knew
about his collecting habit,

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:47.022
then those wrappers in the pine forest

00:20:47.623 --> 00:20:49.143
were planted there intentionally

00:20:49.343 --> 00:20:50.782
to lead us straight to Niu Bosheng.

00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:55.623
Also, if Niu Bosheng
is telling the truth,

00:20:56.903 --> 00:20:58.823
that means Wu Da lied to us.

00:20:59.663 --> 00:21:04.062
His relationship with Wang Xiaole
might not be as good as he claimed.

00:21:10.903 --> 00:21:12.423
Officers, you're back again.

00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:08.952
(Shancheng Community)

00:22:10.502 --> 00:22:12.982
(If those condom wrappers
were planted intentionally,)

00:22:13.702 --> 00:22:15.742
(then the real killer passing the gate)

00:22:16.462 --> 00:22:18.222
(was likely intentional too.)

00:22:19.302 --> 00:22:22.383
(He did it to lead us to the pond)

00:22:22.943 --> 00:22:24.943
(and let us find
the critical clothing evidence.)

00:22:25.542 --> 00:22:26.943
(So we'd incriminate Niu Bosheng.)

00:22:28.502 --> 00:22:30.168
(He must have planned an exit strategy)

00:22:31.032 --> 00:22:32.583
(before doing this.)

00:22:33.062 --> 00:22:35.183
(An exit route hidden
from surveillance cameras.)

00:23:41.383 --> 00:23:42.343
Everyone, gather round.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.143
(Convenience Service Center)

00:23:46.143 --> 00:23:50.302
We need all surveillance footage
around this community hospital.

00:23:50.823 --> 00:23:53.742
Don't overlook any camera
that might've caught the bag thief.

00:23:54.423 --> 00:23:55.222
Understood.

00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:57.022
Six months.

00:23:57.502 --> 00:24:01.222
It's nearly the maximum retention period
for public area surveillance.

00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:04.222
Would he time the theft
right before the footage expired?

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:05.903
It's possible.

00:24:06.022 --> 00:24:08.062
Niu Bosheng seems pretty twisted.

00:24:08.062 --> 00:24:09.583
Maybe he did it himself.

00:24:09.583 --> 00:24:10.462
Classic hypocrisy.

00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:12.343
We still have to investigate.

00:24:12.343 --> 00:24:12.903
Yes.

00:24:12.903 --> 00:24:14.343
Move out. Spread the search.

00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:15.143
Yes.

00:24:15.222 --> 00:24:15.823
Over there.

00:24:15.982 --> 00:24:17.022
And there. Find more.

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:17.502
Got it.

00:24:45.022 --> 00:24:49.222
You lent Wu Da that 200,000 yuan
for his apartment, right?

00:24:50.343 --> 00:24:52.143
That money actually
came from Niu Bosheng.

00:24:52.542 --> 00:24:54.943
Truth is, I wasn't particularly close
with Niu Bosheng.

00:24:55.742 --> 00:24:57.742
He just approached me
out of the blue once,

00:24:57.982 --> 00:25:01.623
asking me to lend the money
to Wu Da under my name.

00:25:03.222 --> 00:25:05.702
Did Wu Da know about this?

00:25:06.782 --> 00:25:08.103
He probably found out.

00:25:08.542 --> 00:25:10.663
After he repaid the loan,

00:25:10.982 --> 00:25:12.663
during a class reunion,

00:25:14.022 --> 00:25:15.143
I got drunk

00:25:15.143 --> 00:25:16.343
and spilled the truth.

00:25:16.742 --> 00:25:18.742
Wu Da was sitting right
next to me at the time.

00:25:18.903 --> 00:25:20.943
Logically, he should have heard it.

00:25:21.583 --> 00:25:22.702
But I'm really not sure.

00:26:10.623 --> 00:26:11.262
Sir.

00:26:11.663 --> 00:26:12.262
Excuse me.

00:26:12.462 --> 00:26:13.782
Is the surveillance camera yours?

00:26:14.022 --> 00:26:14.742
Yes, it is.

00:26:14.742 --> 00:26:15.302
What's up?

00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:18.183
I'm from the police department.

00:26:18.383 --> 00:26:20.823
I'd like to know if you keep
the footage from six months ago?

00:26:20.823 --> 00:26:21.462
Yes.

00:26:21.823 --> 00:26:23.542
Great! Where is it?

00:26:23.623 --> 00:26:24.222
Over here.

00:26:24.222 --> 00:26:24.782
Okay.

00:26:56.222 --> 00:26:57.222
Niu Bosheng?

00:26:59.262 --> 00:27:00.062
I remember him.

00:27:00.943 --> 00:27:02.502
I fought with him back in school.

00:27:02.648 --> 00:27:04.143
(Yunxi Police)

00:27:04.143 --> 00:27:05.103
So it really was him?

00:27:07.103 --> 00:27:08.502
So far,

00:27:09.143 --> 00:27:11.022
the evidence directly points to him.

00:27:12.542 --> 00:27:13.823
He's twisted.

00:27:14.262 --> 00:27:15.782
Never thought after all these years,

00:27:16.903 --> 00:27:17.623
he...

00:27:19.823 --> 00:27:20.623
It's all my fault.

00:27:21.663 --> 00:27:22.903
I didn't protect Xiaole.

00:27:25.062 --> 00:27:26.183
Alright.

00:27:26.702 --> 00:27:27.502
Calm down.

00:27:28.423 --> 00:27:31.103
Tell us what you know about Niu Bosheng.

00:27:32.943 --> 00:27:34.222
I don't know much either.

00:27:35.462 --> 00:27:37.702
I think he works as a doctor
at a major hospital.

00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:39.702
Do you know

00:27:41.222 --> 00:27:43.022
that for your wedding apartment,

00:27:43.903 --> 00:27:47.903
part of the money was loaned by him
under another classmate's name?

00:27:48.623 --> 00:27:49.423
I don't know.

00:27:49.742 --> 00:27:51.302
If I had known it was his money,

00:27:51.302 --> 00:27:52.542
I wouldn't have taken it.

00:27:56.062 --> 00:27:59.462
You are very familiar with the area
around Shancheng Community, right?

00:27:59.982 --> 00:28:04.903
Have you been to that patch
of woods north of it?

00:28:05.982 --> 00:28:09.143
I probably went there
when I was buying the house.

00:28:09.343 --> 00:28:10.423
But not since then.

00:28:11.462 --> 00:28:12.823
You know the Dongyuan Community?

00:28:15.702 --> 00:28:16.903
That urban village, right?

00:28:16.982 --> 00:28:17.823
Have you been there?

00:28:19.262 --> 00:28:21.462
Before the divorce,
I bought groceries there.

00:28:21.943 --> 00:28:22.742
Are you sure?

00:28:25.022 --> 00:28:26.302
Then do you know

00:28:26.542 --> 00:28:31.663
Niu Bosheng holds a weekly clinic
at the Dongyuan Community Hospital?

00:28:33.702 --> 00:28:34.502
No, I didn't.

00:28:42.264 --> 00:28:48.914
(Tuxi Express Supermarket)

00:29:08.542 --> 00:29:09.343
Tired?

00:29:09.742 --> 00:29:11.103
If you are tired, take a break.

00:29:12.302 --> 00:29:14.583
That parcel pickup point owner
really went all out.

00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:15.542
From 8 AM to 10 PM,

00:29:15.542 --> 00:29:17.022
365 days a year,

00:29:17.183 --> 00:29:19.062
he doesn't delete
a single bit of footage.

00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:20.383
He gets a new one once it's full.

00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:21.583
And it's all HD.

00:29:22.022 --> 00:29:24.742
If other places
had surveillance like this,

00:29:24.903 --> 00:29:26.222
how much easier our job would be.

00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:29.462
These parcel pickup services

00:29:29.462 --> 00:29:32.462
often deal with issues
like lost packages, damaged items,

00:29:32.462 --> 00:29:33.702
items taken by mistake,

00:29:33.903 --> 00:29:35.302
and even people stealing packages.

00:29:36.183 --> 00:29:38.143
I guess they're sick of the hassle too.

00:29:38.702 --> 00:29:39.782
They've been scared.

00:29:45.103 --> 00:29:45.823
Hello?

00:29:46.663 --> 00:29:47.623
Where are you?

00:29:47.903 --> 00:29:49.903
Okay, I'm coming out right now.

00:29:53.903 --> 00:29:54.502
Jing.

00:29:55.222 --> 00:29:56.143
Bringing food for Lei?

00:29:56.383 --> 00:29:57.302
Yes. Busy, huh?

00:29:57.302 --> 00:29:57.903
I need to go.

00:30:05.383 --> 00:30:06.262
What brings you here?

00:30:06.623 --> 00:30:07.502
Bringing you food.

00:30:07.943 --> 00:30:08.663
Porridge.

00:30:08.782 --> 00:30:09.663
Nice!

00:30:09.823 --> 00:30:11.262
Looks like you'll work late again.

00:30:12.423 --> 00:30:13.343
Go eat it now.

00:30:13.383 --> 00:30:14.583
I need to walk the little one.

00:30:14.823 --> 00:30:15.462
Okay.

00:30:16.782 --> 00:30:18.462
Take it slow on the way back.
Be careful.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.008
Long and the others might be hungry.
I brought enough for all.

00:30:23.663 --> 00:30:24.502
Head back now.

00:30:28.903 --> 00:30:29.702
Bye.

00:30:38.663 --> 00:30:40.143
- What's that?
- Coming.

00:30:40.542 --> 00:30:41.702
Fuel is coming.

00:30:42.502 --> 00:30:43.903
Let me see what's good?

00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:46.502
Here, take two boxes.

00:30:46.502 --> 00:30:47.302
One box is enough.

00:30:47.302 --> 00:30:48.062
Just one box?

00:30:51.663 --> 00:30:52.222
Ziwu.

00:30:52.623 --> 00:30:53.183
Come on.

00:30:55.623 --> 00:30:58.062
Jing really knows how to look after us.

00:30:58.062 --> 00:30:59.183
Wouldn't let us go hungry.

00:30:59.343 --> 00:31:00.742
You must have smelled it.

00:31:00.742 --> 00:31:02.143
I was about to bring yours over.

00:31:02.143 --> 00:31:03.143
Jing brought it.

00:31:03.143 --> 00:31:03.903
Yeah.

00:31:04.623 --> 00:31:07.502
Come on. Eat up and then back to work.

00:31:07.502 --> 00:31:08.343
Tastes great.

00:31:17.103 --> 00:31:17.982
Don't just eat.

00:31:17.982 --> 00:31:19.143
Have some water.

00:31:22.062 --> 00:31:22.823
I'll open it.

00:31:23.103 --> 00:31:24.022
I'm leaving.

00:31:26.022 --> 00:31:26.742
Lei.

00:31:27.982 --> 00:31:28.823
What? Get in.

00:31:28.823 --> 00:31:30.583
Is there any new discovery?

00:31:30.702 --> 00:31:31.663
Nothing yet.

00:31:33.262 --> 00:31:34.742
You should go eat too.

00:31:35.903 --> 00:31:37.462
Call me if you find anything.

00:31:37.502 --> 00:31:38.143
Okay.

00:31:38.943 --> 00:31:39.903
Eat slowly.

00:31:50.232 --> 00:31:53.496
(Tuxi Express Supermarket)

00:31:56.056 --> 00:31:58.104
(Tuxi Express Supermarket)

00:31:59.623 --> 00:32:00.423
Captain Leng,

00:32:01.062 --> 00:32:01.782
come here.

00:32:04.103 --> 00:32:04.742
Look.

00:32:09.462 --> 00:32:10.262
Wu Da?

00:32:11.343 --> 00:32:13.623
Wu Da framed Niu Bosheng.

00:32:14.702 --> 00:32:16.462
But during the time of the incident,

00:32:16.982 --> 00:32:20.262
the dog-walking uncle clearly saw
Wu Da drinking in the flower bed.

00:32:31.302 --> 00:32:31.982
Let's go.

00:32:35.462 --> 00:32:36.183
Yes.

00:32:36.623 --> 00:32:38.262
Still the same path every day.

00:32:42.542 --> 00:32:43.502
Another one?

00:32:46.623 --> 00:32:47.782
Young people

00:32:48.742 --> 00:32:50.062
drink heavily.

00:41:28.462 --> 00:41:29.823
(What's the injury on your hand?)

00:41:30.662 --> 00:41:31.502
I forgot too.

00:41:32.343 --> 00:41:34.223
Probably bumped into something.

00:41:36.582 --> 00:41:38.662
Mao, let's go home.

00:41:41.343 --> 00:41:42.303
Happy now?

00:41:45.982 --> 00:41:47.182
How'd you get over here?

00:41:47.182 --> 00:41:48.062
Come here.

00:41:55.223 --> 00:41:56.022
Master.
