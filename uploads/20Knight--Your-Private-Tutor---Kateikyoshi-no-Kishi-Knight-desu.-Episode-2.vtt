WEBVTT

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.860
Good morning

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.320
Please come now

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.960
Welcome!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.520
Good morning, no good.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.340
Wow, it's not a nuisance.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:31.940
That's good

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.940
Hello, please go.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.370
Are you here?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.770
Aha

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:14.720
teeth

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:32.780
teeth

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.100
Haha, totally Yankee

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.180
- are you studying?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.680
Can you do it?

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.060
Moreover, the tutor

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.200
He's a weak man!

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.080
Tutor, Knight Nai

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.240
Toru-kun, what are you?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.040
What you don't have to worry about

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.120
I don't need to worry about it?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.800
I will definitely make you happy

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.420
I'm sure you'll be happy just because you do it.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.840
To!?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.460
Please leave everything to me

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.840
Confess, confess!?

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.220
Study hard and do your best

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.040
Let's graduate, okay?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.580
That was it, haha.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.860
No, no, that's weak

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.240
Don't worry, it's my Terri

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.220
The man who is not in Tory!

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.260
Why was he running in the wrong direction?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.120
Even my stomach doesn't hurt.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.220
mosquito?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.560
Even my stomach doesn't hurt.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.720
mosquito?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.440
Is it poop?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.160
That's annoying, Fuka.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.900
Ah, ah, thank you, I have no flaws.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.400
Right, men get into fights.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.660
I cut the wind with my strong shoulders,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.320
stand up to teachers and authority figures

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.140
I'm breaking the rules, but

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.800
Is that what you protect?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.040
It's a condition of being a cool guy.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.800
Hey Takasugi!

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.220
Smoking on the emergency stairs

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.820
It was you, right?

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.040
It's not me, liar!

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.280
you come out of the emergency stairs

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.900
I saw you going

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.180
Me, except for the smoking area.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.500
And I don't smoke.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.900
Don't worry, do something

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.800
Enaoi!

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.040
Are they those glasses?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.420
It was off!

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.260
Don't make excuses!

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.760
There's nothing I can do about it

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.240
Hey, my name is Sensei.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.600
I hate adults who follow me

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.020
But I always see this guy

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.440
It's bad to judge by appearance.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.620
I decided it was you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.820
I don't want to see anything inside.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:09.560
I can't do it

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.960
Masen's Yarrow!

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.880
I'll come out someday!

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.780
But Kuroda-san's graduation

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.899
Sometimes in Yamasen

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:16.760
I went to pay my respects.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.920
On the contrary, I was blown away

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.880
That's what I heard, right?

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:20.459
Seriously?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.540
Is that Mr. Kuroda?

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.820
Yamasen overflowing and strong

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.000
Is that so? People will look at it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.200
Don't rely on it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.860
Happo beauty or sister?

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.760
Beautiful?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.320
You’re beautiful, aren’t you beautiful?

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.260
You guys are beautiful

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.080
Where are the people?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.040
You're an idiot, beautiful

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.540
Who are the idiots?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.280
He's beautiful, I'm beautiful too

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.980
I want a woman, it's impossible.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.540
What shall we do today?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.400
Will I come home?

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.980
I have new surroundings but it's nice

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.600
Well, I'm Koopa.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.200
I'll use the papa

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.280
I've been cumming since I was born.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.940
I decided to use Pa.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.860
Why am I around my house?

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.980
You're going to change

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.600
is holding it, elementary school student

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:22.500
It's okay, it's 7pm.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.540
What's wrong, I'm going home today.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.840
Papa?

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.460
It's rare that I'll give it to you.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:48.390
Hey, wait a minute, you

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:55.470
Maybe it's a good AV

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.890
So you ran away for 6 hours.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.930
It is a 2-disc set of about

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.210
Vertical story

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.510
You can beat me too

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.710
Yo idiot, I'm him

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.290
I doubt whether I have a woman.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.590
to you

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.430
There's no way a woman can do it

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.550
Straight eyes

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.210
I'm not talking about elementary school.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:36.430
I'm going to eat raw food.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.010
Thank you, teacher. Today is also the day.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.970
That's wonderful thank you ma'am

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.410
It's also nice to have a flower shop.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.350
Ranankeras lined up

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.270
Ma'am every time I see you

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.950
Reminds me of the book

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.630
Thank you for your continued support

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:18.460
Oh ranan keras today

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.120
He's right on time

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:28.240
It's empty when I come to

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.660
If you'll excuse me, I'm here.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.900
Gardener's Knight Nai

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.600
Commonly known as Kissfis

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.320
Doru-kun, I studied hard today too.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:54.300
Let's hold it together.I'm the teacher.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.680
I hate it, it's a knight knight

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:22.220
Because it's the same thing

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.900
I won't find it and tell you about it.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.940
Tell me, if you give up

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.360
Because even if it's painful, it will bloom

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.659
sky like masmakis

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.840
You are blooming towards

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.780
According to the chant of

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:46.740
Drama that's not stupid anymore

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.340
it's more natural for me

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.560
So if you go there, you'll kiss

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.160
It's a kiss after all

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.860
Thor has a talent for studying.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:01.380
Today's theme is Noh.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.680
I'm on strike, but today I'm in a good mood

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.740
I'm addicted to the pace of

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:14.300
Hey, what's wrong?

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.780
Thor-kun, that's enough.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.740
Rae Unmotivated A

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:30.960
Peel huh?

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.360
what?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.680
What's the matter?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.200
What? What is this?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.340
Is it kiss kiss?

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.540
He doesn't seem to have a fever, but it's lame.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.420
When did you start?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.160
No, no, no, that's the pun

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.420
Is it different because it's not?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.860
Surprise me and kiss me

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.540
Kishi, I'm sorry, but I'm Tsutomu today.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.260
I don't feel like forcing it, so I

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.320
How can I even graduate?

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.040
It's time for Kishi-Kishi too

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.140
You can take it easy until

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.240
I also read the manga

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:23.010
There's a problem. Do you think it's a problem?

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.670
Don't feel like studying?

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:33.270
Hey, Mr. Dale.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.570
The squeaky eyes

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.310
Should I raise it?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.400
There are times like that, right?

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.210
Hey, why?

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.190
What, what is this situation?

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.130
Thor, please sleep.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.450
I'll read it to you

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:13.210
Karaso co-sleeping learning!?

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.730
Kisikisi, this kind of class

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:22.010
It's okay, it's okay.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.570
Responding to changes

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.730
My job is to be a tutor.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:32.800
Since I always refer to that person as

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.840
I used to call you teacher, so here I am.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.120
But just write Sensei (Watch on www.kisskh,id or www.kisskh,la to support Admin)

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.760
I want to tell you my real name

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.800
This embarrasses the world

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.160
Rather than being shy

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.780
is natural to me

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.600
Yes, I can do it.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.980
I'm sorry, I'm a pleasant teacher.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.440
Pick up the brush that I don't want to say

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.000
I have the same feelings

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.180
In a certain sliding door

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.560
For the first time, I met a father I knew.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.330
Did you see it, Thor?

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.940
Thor-kun?

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.460
Ah, are you okay?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.700
Ah, I read it to sleep

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.780
It's like a baby

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:43.920
Let's continue now

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.180
Enough is enough, enough is enough, it’s enough to be normal.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:57.020
What's so interesting about it?

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:57.840
I have to do this because

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.780
I guess that's not the case. Interesting.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.220
I feel like I don't have the knowledge

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.180
I don't understand it, haha?

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.200
Thor is historical

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.220
Who do you like as a person?

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.600
Is it?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.340
Nobunaga Ota: Why?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.960
From the unifier of the world, I see.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.520
Nobunaga to be exact

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.580
has unified the country

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.360
There isn't. Is that so?

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.460
Yes, on the verge of unification

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.560
and sing near Honnoji Temple

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.860
Killed by lyricist Akechi Mitsuhide

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.940
It has been done to me, Nobunaga.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.280
Because I didn't take care of her properly

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.620
Do you love it?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.600
The one below is really cute

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.300
Ruyappa Yankee Fat

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.500
Because ro's benevolence is important.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:08.220
I see, you have a point, Akira.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.920
If I hadn't been killed by Chi

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.040
Nobunaga unified the country

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.380
What do you mean?

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.960
There is a great possibility that

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.240
i have teloria

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.900
Tell the world that you were

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:32.220
I should do it, but then

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.080
Maybe what is free time?

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.740
It's a completely different history.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:42.540
I'm so excited

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.320
Yeah, I'm so excited

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.790
What's wrong, miracle worker?

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.750
I have a lesson for you who just pass by

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.630
I have various talents.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.230
It's interesting to learn about things

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:13.450
That's okay, you'll pass.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.810
has the ability to enjoy studying

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:26.760
It means that you are capable

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.340
If it stays like that, it will be a miracle again

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.220
follow the master's pace

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:37.310
It's so sad yesterday

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.150
Find a cute girl

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.490
In the gym?

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.230
Which child?

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.310
Even if you don't know, Insoo

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.230
Che because I found it

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.110
I'm looking forward to it

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.370
key is internet

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.450
That's not it, it's real

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.550
Yankees are internet

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.090
It'll probably cost about a bit.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.950
Here's how to cut Akechi

00:15:54.950 --> 00:16:02.540
Well then, what a Yanki?

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.540
- A video with a lot of chatter

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.180
I'm raising it, it's okay

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.860
But it's still pretty good

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.660
Where are you living?

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.000
Yankee looks at this video

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.640
I'll give it some thought.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.900
yankee thing

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.940
I feel bad for family businesses.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.940
Is it bad if I get caught?

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.680
What is it? Maybe it's just something I'm thinking about.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.440
But I can't pass.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.300
Did you find a good girl?

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.220
picture?

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.020
I don't want to call you teacher right away.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.340
Let's do it, it's really easy

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.340
The miracle worker is a teacher, so what?

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.200
I was mumbling.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:59.550
You, the woman, pass by.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:05.440
What's the point, PE?

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.839
graffiti on the wall of the mansion

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:12.180
You guys are terrain

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.540
Master, I was surprised.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.980
Hey Yamase, we are today.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.940
I've been here forever PE.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.819
It seems like he doesn't go to the mansion.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.060
It's been a long time since we've been here

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.960
I was slacking off all the time.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.580
How many times should I be arrogant?

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.060
As I said, we are in class.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.480
I slack off but it bothers people

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.680
Don't do anything like that

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.860
No way, he's dressed like that.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.320
Who cares what they say?

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.860
I believe like you guys

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.700
Japan is saved because of Nano.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.800
What is it going to become?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.680
Stop making me angry.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.120
Stop it, calm down, me.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.360
I'll press it, stop it.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.980
Cucumber but annoying

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.940
Damn it, after the war, I

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.100
Enemies like us

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.780
It's a big deal because I'm doing it.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.780
I can't trust people

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.660
Mr. Knight is here today.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.620
It's a day to talk, so what's this?

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.960
What happened to the icon?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.920
Is it something to do? What is this?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.120
Even a knight is a mountain

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.260
In the end, I'm the same as Setatsu.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.320
You can also tell by appearance.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.240
I'm sure this is cut off

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.820
What should I do in the sauna today?

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.720
I'm coming, majikatsu

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.540
You who are negative are on the street

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:53.380
If you can win, you will pass.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:58.240
It's almost class time

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.560
But it's too long

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.000
I think it's a sauna ornament

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.480
It's the one who got it. It's okay.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.940
It's too much and I'm going to collapse

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:19.130
Yooiah

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.750
I'll cross from there.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.410
What are you talking about, this road?

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.650
When I was driving by because it was too much

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.990
I've never seen this before.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.330
You are so small

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.730
What if I imitate it?

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:57.340
Okay, okay

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.320
You're really like that

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.920
It's so hot!

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:12.740
Eja na yoshi ya sauna

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.540
Knight passing by

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:24.980
I'm a knight, so I'm here today.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.920
At Itoru's house

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.980
I was on my way.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.200
Oh no, boycott

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.160
I found it before

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.920
No, I'm a little upset today.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.700
It's too bad, I pass by

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.740
That's admirable A-chan and child

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.900
A back you can be proud of to your children

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.360
I'm complaining

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.580
No matter what

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.520
The knight is also like me

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.840
The key is to follow traffic rules.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.720
You idiot, there's no way

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.520
What are you doing, Toru-kun?

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.820
is the word scheming master

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.740
Do you know this?

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.480
Is that the master? Has anyone seen it?

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.060
If you just look at it, you won't know what's inside.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.320
Does that mean it doesn't matter?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.060
The teacher is the one who said this word.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.180
Have you seen an excellent disciple?

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.440
I made a judgment based on

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.100
From the story of regretting something

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.500
It's a four-letter idiom that comes

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.180
In other words, the essence of Toru-kun

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.520
The enemy inside is visible

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.780
It can't be determined just by

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:42.850
I haven't seen it all this time.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.890
It's just a matter of making a decision

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:50.330
I've been exposed to this for a long time, but this is my first time

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.030
Yo, don't say that to an adult.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.390
Judging only from the top

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.830
and try to know what's inside

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.070
It's a waste not to have it

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:05.010
I'm also talking about Kishigishi.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.010
judge on the surface

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:13.450
A plot master or lecturer

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.590
That's pretty good

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.890
words you have to say

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.390
You can be saved by knowing

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.790
There are times when knowledge

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:30.150
is important, maatama

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.110
I also need to study

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.350
That's right, I'll do it

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.530
Are you motivated?

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.610
Well, I can't come out, but it's a bit

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.850
It would be nice if it was about that.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.970
Rukun goes home and studies.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.370
It's my first time, right?

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.630
The adult who tried to

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.430
By the way, where are you passing?

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.530
Did you try to go to

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.630
Unasauna I'm still going

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.170
I've never experienced it, that's true.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.250
Looks like Kishi-Kishi isn't there.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:14.330
Is that a reverse plot master?

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:24.880
There's a pattern, too.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.020
in the territory of

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.780
He's supposed to be a man who doesn't exist

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.460
Why did you take the T-shirt out of your bag?
