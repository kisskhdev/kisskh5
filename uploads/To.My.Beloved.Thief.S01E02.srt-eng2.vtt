WEBVTT

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:53.533
It's already two hours past 6:00.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:55.827
She probably forgot about it.

00:00:56.578 --> 00:00:58.163
Let's go.

00:00:58.246 --> 00:00:59.289
Yes, Your Highness.

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:06.379
What if she didn't forget?
What if something happened to her?

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:08.173
-Pardon?
-I mean, think about it.

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:09.924
My face is hard to forget.

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:15.096
I guess, I have no choice but to wait,
for such is my generosity.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.600
Did you not say she treated you
like you were a mad slave?

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:21.895
She must have fled after realizing
she'd get a punishment, not a reward.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.481
If you'll excuse me,
I must relieve myself.

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:44.459
…one of the few blessings I was born with.

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:49.464
Poverty, misery, sadness and tears.

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:52.508
There's no punishment.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.513
I just wanted to give you these.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.560
I hoped these might bring
a little fortune into your life,

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:06.940
when you were born
into nothing but misfortune.

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.490
Dae-chu, make haste.

00:02:15.573 --> 00:02:17.283
Let us go now. (Support Admin Watch on

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:32.298
If I am no longer allowed
to live a woman's life…

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:36.886
If tonight is my last chance…

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:44.936
Of all times,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.731
and
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:50.858
of all people…

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:09.127
What took you so long?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.379
Do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting--

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:45.663
That…

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:47.623
That would be my reward.

00:03:55.173 --> 00:03:56.174
Your Highness.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.553
Your Highness.

00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:02.472
Why is your face red?

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.474
I just got…

00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:07.393
robbed now.

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.521
What did they steal?

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:15.234
Well…

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:17.028
It's…

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.696
Did you see the bandit's face?

00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:21.616
How did he look?

00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:27.163
Comely.

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:29.207
Comely…

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.418
What? He's comely?

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:35.505
We must find him.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.840
I must have lost my mind.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:40.259
Why did I do that?

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:43.763
That was ridiculous, even to me.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:46.391
He must be utterly dumbfounded.

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.855
I must go back and explain.

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:14.877
Did he leave?

00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:17.713
What do I do?

00:05:18.506 --> 00:05:21.342
After tonight,
we won't get to see each other again.

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:29.183
This is why they say
nothing good ever happens at night.

00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:37.275
Where did she go?

00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:43.865
Oh, dear. It's getting late.

00:05:43.948 --> 00:05:45.116
It's the curfew hour!

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.784
Close the gates!

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.005
But why…

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.973
You.

00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:11.267
I will catch you no matter what.

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:12.977
Your Highness.

00:06:15.104 --> 00:06:16.647
I looked everywhere, but found no one.

00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.609
It's past the curfew hour.
You must return to the palace.

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:21.444
Let us go back for now.

00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:22.486
Yes, Your Highness.

00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:50.097
Right, I almost forgot.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.725
The grains are missing?

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:56.437
It wasn't us. It's the work of a thief.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.314
-What?
-Look.

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.274
They stole the grains
and left this drawing.

00:07:00.358 --> 00:07:01.651
This insolent little…

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.495
Gil-dong is truly impressive.

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:22.547
Who's there?

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:37.603
It is curfew.

00:07:38.771 --> 00:07:40.064
Present your pass.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:52.076
Officer Park?

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.413
It's me.

00:07:55.496 --> 00:07:56.581
It's you, Eun-jo.

00:07:57.373 --> 00:07:59.500
Did you see a man wearing black just now?

00:08:02.587 --> 00:08:04.880
Only a glimpse.
I was looking for my shoes.

00:08:06.007 --> 00:08:07.216
What's the matter?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.176
Right. The curfew pass.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.678
Oh, never mind.

00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:12.138
It's just us.

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:16.475
Security is especially tight today.

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:20.146
This is just between you and me.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:23.065
Whoever has the Baekjeong mask
is Gil-dong.

00:08:24.817 --> 00:08:26.235
Oh.

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.113
Did Officer Kang Yun-bok find that out?

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:30.364
No, it's…

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.201
Well, you don't know him.

00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:37.121
He's a newly appointed aide.

00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:39.457
He's a pale, well-groomed man.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.000
Oh, I see.

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:45.212
He suspects
those spreading rumors about Gil-dong.

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:48.090
And one of the suspects was questioned.

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:49.800
Who was that?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.972
She's called Lady Dong-ju.
You must know her too.

00:09:04.315 --> 00:09:07.485
If I'd come here as Gil-dong, as usual,
I would've been caught.

00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:28.923
Ma'am.

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:30.591
You're here.

00:09:32.593 --> 00:09:34.929
Why does my baby struggle to fall asleep?

00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:36.597
It must be due to malnutrition.

00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:38.015
Let me take a look.

00:09:49.068 --> 00:09:51.570
This was found in your coat.

00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:04.375
I brought the silk shoes.

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:12.133
Why run away?

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:14.719
He's a thief. Of course he ran away.

00:10:14.802 --> 00:10:16.053
No.

00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:18.848
I'm not talking about the man.

00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:23.436
I'm talking about this woman.

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:29.650
Around 8:00 tomorrow morning,

00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:32.862
assemble all the court ladies,
including the head court lady.

00:10:39.618 --> 00:10:41.078
I will now receive remonstrance.

00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:42.204
Let us begin.

00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:46.250
By Your Majesty's great wisdom and virtue,

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:49.336
the realm prospers in peace day by day.

00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:52.590
It is all thanks to your devoted service.

00:10:53.632 --> 00:10:57.052
May Your Majesty take good care
of your royal health

00:10:57.136 --> 00:10:59.388
and continue to watch over the realm.

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:00.765
I shall bear it in mind.

00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:06.729
Why don't we save the daily praises
for tomorrow

00:11:06.812 --> 00:11:09.482
and talk about something more interesting?

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:10.941
I'm so bored here in the palace.

00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:13.360
I want to hear about the world out there.

00:11:15.863 --> 00:11:17.281
Over the past year,

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:21.827
the storehouses of officials,
including my own, have been robbed.

00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:23.120
And apparently,

00:11:23.204 --> 00:11:26.248
this thief pretends to be
a righteous outlaw.

00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:29.210
There was such an incident?

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:31.337
We must catch the thief.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.215
There is no need
to fuss over some petty thief.

00:11:34.298 --> 00:11:38.552
Stories like that have always been around.

00:11:39.512 --> 00:11:40.429
It seems like

00:11:41.347 --> 00:11:44.016
all of you should be careful.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.771
What do you mean, if I may ask?

00:11:49.355 --> 00:11:53.359
The great thief, Im Kkeok-jeong
did not only cut open rice sacks

00:11:53.442 --> 00:11:55.819
but also corrupt officials.

00:12:04.203 --> 00:12:06.872
What is the name of the thief?

00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:08.374
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.460
He is known as "the friend on the road,"

00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:14.046
and his name is Gil-dong.

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:17.800
Are you sure it isn't
"the poop on the road"?

00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:19.343
"Poop"?

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:36.735
The censors' remonstrances are becoming

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:38.487
more and more flattering.

00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:41.115
I liked it though.

00:12:41.824 --> 00:12:43.409
Do you not like it?

00:12:43.492 --> 00:12:46.036
They're all lies.

00:12:46.996 --> 00:12:49.290
They're worse than Hong Min-jik.

00:13:05.514 --> 00:13:07.891
Chief Censor Hong Min-jik, say that again.

00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:11.979
Altering the Sillok annals
is unprecedented in history.

00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:14.231
Punishing them based solely on the appeal

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:17.693
would bring great misfortune
upon Your Majesty in the future.

00:13:25.534 --> 00:13:27.911
Why don't you offer
your remonstrance as well?

00:13:29.413 --> 00:13:32.416
Punishing immoral writings

00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:37.463
is right and necessary.

00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:40.841
Your Majesty

00:13:43.427 --> 00:13:44.928
made the right decision.

00:13:50.726 --> 00:13:51.602
Is that so?

00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:02.780
Do you miss Hong Min-jik,

00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:04.948
Your Majesty?

00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:09.411
He may not be to my liking,

00:14:09.495 --> 00:14:12.247
but at least he was sincere.

00:14:20.506 --> 00:14:21.590
What do you mean?

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:24.593
There's sincerity in here too.

00:14:28.764 --> 00:14:29.848
Is that so?

00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:32.685
Let me see

00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:34.478
where the sincerity is.

00:14:43.195 --> 00:14:45.864
Father, are you leaving
the palace already?

00:14:47.366 --> 00:14:49.076
I need to meet Min-jik.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.679
Look.

00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:10.014
If you don't want it, give it.

00:15:10.097 --> 00:15:11.473
I'm cooling it down.

00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:14.768
We could go to my house
if you don't like courtesans' house.

00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:22.317
This is my bribe.
Please take good care of Eun-jo.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.280
She does not take after you.

00:15:27.364 --> 00:15:28.490
She's not soft.

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:32.536
She may seem tender,

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:33.579
but she's strong.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.667
Let it be said that this marriage
was solely my own desire.

00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:43.130
My desire to live in comfort
under the protection of a powerful family.

00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:45.758
I apologize.

00:15:48.177 --> 00:15:49.678
What are you apologizing for?

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:53.098
I always feel like I owe you.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.727
You're funny.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.355
Right. I will send the wedding gifts back.

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:03.817
Please take them. They're for the girl.

00:16:03.901 --> 00:16:06.528
They would only be
a burden to my daughter.

00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:08.655
You paid a bride price worth a house.

00:16:08.739 --> 00:16:11.158
Just how hard do you want
to work my daughter?

00:16:14.453 --> 00:16:16.538
You make me ashamed of myself, as always.

00:16:18.582 --> 00:16:20.459
Is there a reason why

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.294
you came to see me?

00:16:25.964 --> 00:16:27.049
No.

00:16:28.258 --> 00:16:29.802
I just wanted to say hello.

00:17:04.461 --> 00:17:07.589
You've been frowning all day long.

00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:09.633
What's the matter?

00:17:09.716 --> 00:17:11.009
Oh.

00:17:11.552 --> 00:17:14.179
I was just thinking
about the book I read yesterday.

00:17:16.223 --> 00:17:17.224
What is it about?

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:19.351
I don't know how to read, so tell me.

00:17:24.523 --> 00:17:25.899
So, the story is…

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.318
about a woman.

00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:30.362
The Grand Prince has summoned us.

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:33.198
-Will he tell us stories again?
-About his achievements?

00:17:34.116 --> 00:17:36.410
-Me!
-Me!

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.246
You there.

00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:44.376
If the woman kissed first,

00:17:45.002 --> 00:17:46.336
it must be love.

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:48.714
Love?

00:17:50.757 --> 00:17:52.593
No, it was the first time we met.

00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:55.888
So it was love at first sight.

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:02.352
Well, I do have the looks for it.

00:18:02.978 --> 00:18:05.189
So the woman in the book
fell in love with the man.

00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:06.940
What? No!

00:18:07.024 --> 00:18:08.192
Then why did she run away?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.072
Because she was startled
by what she had done.

00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:21.496
And the next thing she knew,
she'd already run away.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.000
Clearly, she just tested the water
and ran off.

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:27.169
If it's love at first sight,
why would she run away?

00:18:27.252 --> 00:18:29.546
If she had run off with him,
that would be love.

00:18:33.884 --> 00:18:35.552
Why do you think she ran away?

00:18:35.636 --> 00:18:38.263
Maybe she realized
the water she tested was too lukewarm.

00:18:39.181 --> 00:18:40.182
It happens.

00:18:40.265 --> 00:18:42.935
She kissed him, full of anticipation.

00:18:43.018 --> 00:18:47.022
She expected butterflies
and sparks and all that.

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:48.398
But no.

00:18:48.482 --> 00:18:51.360
All she felt was the cold breath
coming from his nose.

00:18:51.443 --> 00:18:55.697
That's when she started
feeling uncomfortable.

00:18:59.534 --> 00:19:01.453
Don't answer my questions from now on.

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:04.456
-Why?
-I told you not to ask questions too.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:07.251
Goodness. Then why did she even kiss him?

00:19:07.334 --> 00:19:10.212
She is dying to know that herself.

00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:14.007
But no matter how hard she thinks,
she can't find the answer.

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:19.012
That's when you use
your heart to understand.

00:19:21.265 --> 00:19:22.557
Heart?

00:19:24.643 --> 00:19:26.395
Love is like that.

00:19:27.854 --> 00:19:30.315
You can never understand it
with your head.

00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:33.735
No, it's not love.

00:19:35.237 --> 00:19:36.780
It shouldn't be love.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.533
She's engaged.

00:19:42.452 --> 00:19:44.830
I know it's just a story,
but what a bad woman.

00:19:44.913 --> 00:19:47.332
She should be punished for what she did.

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:50.377
Right?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.753
Of course.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.513
A few lashes wouldn't be
nearly enough, would they?

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:03.932
May I?

00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:09.604
Though she kissed him for love,
it may have been a forbidden love

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.482
that could never be fulfilled.

00:20:14.276 --> 00:20:15.402
Forbidden?

00:20:15.485 --> 00:20:18.530
That kind of love
is bound to be deep and intense.

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:21.408
Like a noble lady and a slave.

00:20:23.243 --> 00:20:24.703
A mistress and a slave?

00:20:27.205 --> 00:20:28.373
A slave.

00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:29.791
Slave boy!

00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:31.668
Boy. He's my slave boy.

00:20:33.003 --> 00:20:35.505
It is true that she thinks I'm a slave.

00:20:35.589 --> 00:20:37.758
Is that why she thought
it was forbidden love?

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:40.260
Let me ask you a question.

00:20:40.344 --> 00:20:42.262
If that slave

00:20:42.971 --> 00:20:45.932
turns out to be a noble man…

00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:52.189
or even a Grand Prince…

00:20:57.861 --> 00:20:59.446
You always respond in the same way.

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:01.656
Should I take it
as a good sign or a bad sign?

00:21:02.449 --> 00:21:03.784
About the slave talk earlier…

00:21:03.867 --> 00:21:05.994
Were you referring to your friend?

00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:07.996
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:10.499
I don't have a friend.

00:21:10.582 --> 00:21:11.958
Of course it was me.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:14.503
So what was stolen from you yesterday
was a kiss?

00:21:17.923 --> 00:21:20.967
I will go to the constabulary
on my own from here.

00:21:21.718 --> 00:21:24.221
What about me?
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

00:21:25.222 --> 00:21:27.265
You have a very important thing to do.

00:21:39.486 --> 00:21:43.532
My beautiful face
makes the fabric look dull. Doesn't it?

00:21:43.615 --> 00:21:46.034
Are you sure it is not because

00:21:46.118 --> 00:21:48.453
of the dark cloud hanging over your face?

00:21:48.537 --> 00:21:51.289
What is it? What's bothering you now?

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:55.001
I don't know. Everything.

00:21:56.044 --> 00:21:57.879
Everything is bothering me.

00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:00.507
And this woman here will be my concubine.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.551
No, maybe you already are.

00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:07.347
Wait here. I will go
and have them all changed.

00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:08.974
Don't bother.

00:22:09.057 --> 00:22:12.561
I don't have the courage to defy the fate
my brother has set for me.

00:22:12.644 --> 00:22:13.895
What?

00:22:13.979 --> 00:22:16.440
I will go with this.
Eventually, it will grow on me.

00:22:16.523 --> 00:22:19.234
And eventually, it will look pretty to me.

00:22:19.317 --> 00:22:22.154
Madam, the silk dress
I had tailored the other day…

00:22:26.616 --> 00:22:29.619
I will come back later.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

00:22:29.703 --> 00:22:30.996
Can I speak with you briefly?

00:22:34.749 --> 00:22:36.001
Could you leave us alone?

00:22:36.585 --> 00:22:37.669
Yes, my lady.

00:22:44.718 --> 00:22:47.596
I just got my new wig.

00:22:48.889 --> 00:22:51.808
If you could pull it gently,
that would be great.

00:22:57.814 --> 00:23:00.233
Did you just say "support"?

00:23:01.193 --> 00:23:03.528
Yes, that is what I said.

00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:05.697
I would like to support both my husband

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.948
and the love between you two.

00:23:07.032 --> 00:23:09.618
From what I was taught,
that is a wife's virtue.

00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:13.663
Who taught you that was a virtue?
Your father or your mother?

00:23:13.747 --> 00:23:15.749
I lost both my parents when I was five.

00:23:15.832 --> 00:23:17.584
I learned about the virtue

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.212
from a book.

00:23:21.421 --> 00:23:22.672
From a book?

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.054
So you have no intention
of slapping my face

00:23:29.137 --> 00:23:31.306
or pulling my hair?

00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:35.310
Slap what?

00:23:36.353 --> 00:23:37.354
Look, Young Master.

00:23:37.437 --> 00:23:38.897
I've been a courtesan for ten years,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.399
and I've never seen a wife
who wants to befriend a concubine.

00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:42.317
Oh, dear.

00:23:43.526 --> 00:23:45.737
So my fiancée has such a big heart

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.365
that she finds good in everything,
even in her enemies.

00:23:48.448 --> 00:23:50.325
You can call off the wedding if you want,

00:23:50.408 --> 00:23:53.036
but from now on, do not use me
for your silly little games.

00:23:55.747 --> 00:23:57.624
Why is No-eul so upset?

00:23:59.167 --> 00:24:01.795
Because the one who should be upset
chose compassion.

00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:05.924
Pleading might work better
on my big-hearted fiancée than bullying.

00:24:12.264 --> 00:24:14.432
Dropped! You'll get a penalty.

00:24:16.476 --> 00:24:19.729
You can't hit even a single shot.
I thought your father was in the military.

00:24:19.813 --> 00:24:21.856
You're no better yourself.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.026
My family has produced
great scholars for generations.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.195
Brushes are our swords.

00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:31.825
But then again, look what happened
to your father with his sharp tongue.

00:24:31.908 --> 00:24:32.909
What did you just say?

00:24:33.618 --> 00:24:35.829
My sister, Eun-jo,
would have hit them all.

00:24:36.788 --> 00:24:37.831
What?

00:24:37.914 --> 00:24:40.250
How dare you compare
a concubine's daughter to us?

00:24:43.628 --> 00:24:44.879
Enough with that.

00:24:44.963 --> 00:24:47.257
But he started it.

00:24:49.301 --> 00:24:53.305
When Eun-jo was little,
she played with bows instead of dolls.

00:24:53.388 --> 00:24:54.889
She's twice as good an archer as you.

00:24:54.973 --> 00:24:56.766
She's just a woman. Stop bluffing.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.268
-Want a bet?
-Sure!

00:24:58.351 --> 00:25:00.645
You grown-up men
are acting like little boys.

00:25:02.856 --> 00:25:04.107
What are you betting?

00:25:04.649 --> 00:25:07.319
Just like love,
fights are meant to be encouraged.

00:25:13.575 --> 00:25:14.784
-Your Highness.
-Hello.

00:25:14.868 --> 00:25:16.202
I received your message.

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.955
-So, Gil-dong robbed again?
-Yes, Your Highness.

00:25:20.081 --> 00:25:20.999
By the way,

00:25:22.709 --> 00:25:25.754
-is Your Highness unaccompanied?
-Oh, Dae-chu?

00:25:25.837 --> 00:25:28.882
Has anyone seen this woman?

00:25:29.883 --> 00:25:34.888
I must find this woman!
Only then can I return home!

00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:36.639
Dae-chu is looking for silk shoes.

00:25:37.349 --> 00:25:39.517
Do you fancy silk shoes?

00:25:40.226 --> 00:25:43.146
Well, they have
lovely colors and patterns.

00:25:43.772 --> 00:25:44.773
But most of all,

00:25:44.856 --> 00:25:46.649
they have a lovely personality.

00:25:46.733 --> 00:25:49.444
Silk shoes have a lovely personality?

00:25:50.695 --> 00:25:51.571
It's a human.

00:25:52.822 --> 00:25:55.825
And everything about them is lovely,
so it must be a woman.

00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:57.660
Why don't you stop
investigating my business

00:25:57.744 --> 00:25:59.621
and investigate the theft instead?

00:26:02.832 --> 00:26:05.126
-Is this the drawing Gil-dong left?
-Yes, Your Highness.

00:26:06.586 --> 00:26:09.464
There's no consistency whatsoever
in the items he steals.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:11.216
Indeed, Your Highness.

00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:12.342
Why seaweed?

00:26:13.176 --> 00:26:15.595
I wonder if his wife
gave birth or something.

00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:22.435
-You're here.
-Did you call for me?

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:25.855
On the night Gil-dong stole the seaweed,
Officer Park saw a suspicious man.

00:26:26.523 --> 00:26:27.357
Is that so?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.068
I'm not sure if it was Gil-dong,
but it was a very nimble man.

00:26:31.736 --> 00:26:35.407
Actually, Eun-jo must have seen him
better than me.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.617
-Physician Hong was there too?
-Yes.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.035
Do you know the physician?

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:41.830
A woman's corpse is supposed to be
examined by a female physician.

00:26:41.913 --> 00:26:44.833
So whenever we lack female officers,
we get help from Physician Hong.

00:26:47.502 --> 00:26:49.170
Where is that physician now?

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.093
Eun-jo!

00:26:57.053 --> 00:26:58.388
Young Master?

00:26:58.471 --> 00:26:59.472
What is the matter?

00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:01.766
I need you to follow me somewhere.

00:27:04.227 --> 00:27:05.728
-A bet?
-Yes.

00:27:05.812 --> 00:27:08.398
You just need to hit this apple here.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.363
Are you sure you have the time for this?

00:27:15.447 --> 00:27:17.740
You have
a civil service examination to pass.

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:21.202
Do you hang out with those men every day?

00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:26.332
They're the only ones who hang out with me
since our family's fallen.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.419
And now, we're like family.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.014
I'll win the bet for you,
if you promise me one thing.

00:27:42.849 --> 00:27:45.310
That concubine's daughter
looks familiar somehow.

00:27:45.393 --> 00:27:46.686
How unpleasant.

00:27:48.104 --> 00:27:50.732
She doesn't know her place
and acts like his sister.

00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:52.650
How annoying.

00:28:05.663 --> 00:28:08.041
Didn't she refuse to do it at first?

00:28:08.124 --> 00:28:09.792
Why did she change her mind?

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:12.045
-Because I agreed to promise one thing.
-A promise?

00:28:12.128 --> 00:28:15.256
I agreed to stop hanging out with you two
if she wins.

00:28:18.676 --> 00:28:19.552
Is that so?

00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:25.433
You.

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:27.101
Do you really not know me?

00:28:27.936 --> 00:28:29.354
You look strangely familiar.

00:28:30.355 --> 00:28:33.691
Well, I don't think we have met before.

00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:36.945
Can I start now?

00:28:38.321 --> 00:28:39.364
Wait.

00:28:41.616 --> 00:28:43.326
We should change the rules.

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:49.332
You raised the stakes.

00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:51.251
Pardon?

00:28:51.334 --> 00:28:54.254
If you made your brother
promise something so serious,

00:28:55.463 --> 00:28:56.840
you need to risk something too.

00:29:01.177 --> 00:29:03.596
Why don't you stand there
instead of the target?

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.977
-Jae-i.
-What?

00:29:10.395 --> 00:29:11.437
Do you not want to?

00:29:13.147 --> 00:29:14.357
What's the matter?

00:29:15.233 --> 00:29:16.109
Are you upset?

00:29:16.776 --> 00:29:17.694
Not yet.

00:29:17.777 --> 00:29:18.820
Go stand there.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.130
You can do it, right?

00:29:49.183 --> 00:29:50.310
Eun-jo.

00:29:51.352 --> 00:29:52.478
Please.

00:29:57.275 --> 00:29:58.318
Please…

00:29:59.527 --> 00:30:00.778
Please…

00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:19.797
I only meant for him
to focus on his studies until the exam.

00:30:21.257 --> 00:30:24.218
If this is because
of what I asked him to promise me,

00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:25.553
please punish me instead.

00:30:25.637 --> 00:30:26.888
I am punishing you.

00:30:28.765 --> 00:30:30.767
Does it look like
I'm punishing Dae-il now?

00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:34.896
The more Dae-il shivers in fear,

00:30:36.564 --> 00:30:38.566
the more your hands tremble.

00:30:40.568 --> 00:30:42.737
I'm punishing the right person.

00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:48.076
Why would you…

00:30:49.452 --> 00:30:50.787
go to such lengths?

00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:55.208
It's disgusting to see
a lowly concubine's daughter

00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:56.292
acting like his sister.

00:30:57.502 --> 00:30:59.003
You're a concubine's child.

00:30:59.087 --> 00:31:00.838
It's against propriety and order.

00:31:04.634 --> 00:31:06.719
I did not try to act like his sister.

00:31:07.804 --> 00:31:11.057
I simply followed my heart.

00:31:12.392 --> 00:31:15.353
If my heart itself
is against propriety and order,

00:31:17.563 --> 00:31:18.439
I apologize.

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:45.299
Of course.

00:31:45.383 --> 00:31:49.262
A woman can't shoot an arrow.
It was all a bluff.

00:31:52.473 --> 00:31:53.599
What?

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.189
I received my punishment,
so please honor your promise.

00:32:12.994 --> 00:32:13.953
Well, this is bad.

00:32:14.871 --> 00:32:16.998
I bet my favorite waist sash on this.

00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:18.374
You can tie it again.

00:32:25.048 --> 00:32:27.467
Did you shoot a flying sparrow?

00:32:28.384 --> 00:32:31.971
Well done! You hit a target
that was smaller and farther away.

00:32:32.055 --> 00:32:33.556
It's a perfect victory.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.480
My word.

00:32:40.563 --> 00:32:42.607
It pierced right through the heart.

00:32:45.276 --> 00:32:48.071
Your future sister-in-law
has quite the talent.

00:32:50.239 --> 00:32:51.115
Sister-in-law?

00:32:51.199 --> 00:32:52.658
Did you not know?

00:32:52.742 --> 00:32:54.619
She will be your brother's concubine.

00:32:57.705 --> 00:32:59.499
Lord Im Sa-hyeong's second son?

00:32:59.582 --> 00:33:00.958
Why are you saying this now?

00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:03.127
I told you, they're like my family.

00:33:03.211 --> 00:33:05.379
He's our brother-in-law, to be precise.

00:33:07.507 --> 00:33:10.426
To be really precise,
he'd be my grandson-in-law.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.136
This is getting messy.

00:33:12.804 --> 00:33:15.306
Why are all those people gathered there?

00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:21.687
Go ahead without me.

00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:25.233
I must tend
to Chief Censor's wife by 2:00.

00:33:39.831 --> 00:33:42.041
Nothing's been caught,
other than the Baekjeong mask.

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:44.293
Until the investigation quietens down,

00:33:44.377 --> 00:33:47.046
I will have to keep myself
from being nosy.

00:33:57.682 --> 00:34:00.184
Right, I forgot about that.

00:34:04.272 --> 00:34:05.273
Oh?

00:34:34.343 --> 00:34:35.428
Your Highness, just now…

00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.721
Is the female physician here?

00:34:40.224 --> 00:34:41.267
Your Majesty.

00:34:43.936 --> 00:34:46.564
Mother. What brings you here?

00:34:48.858 --> 00:34:51.903
Are you Officer Kang Yun-bok?

00:34:51.986 --> 00:34:53.571
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:34:53.654 --> 00:34:56.115
If I ever set foot here again,

00:34:56.782 --> 00:34:59.785
it will be with an order for your arrest.

00:35:03.998 --> 00:35:05.458
You may leave now.

00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:17.970
Why did you refuse
Chief Censor's daughter?

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.932
She was unsightly.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.688
You do not belong at the constabulary.

00:35:27.772 --> 00:35:29.190
Playing officer is

00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:31.609
my little hobby
that even his Majesty has allowed.

00:35:31.692 --> 00:35:33.861
When will you stop
living like a scoundrel?

00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:34.862
A scoundrel.

00:35:34.946 --> 00:35:36.530
An idler. A shameless wretch.

00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:39.283
Not anybody can be called these.

00:35:39.367 --> 00:35:41.494
Only I, a Grand Prince…

00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:48.000
How much more…

00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:51.295
How much more disappointment
must I endure?

00:35:52.713 --> 00:35:54.507
There will be no more disappointment

00:35:55.758 --> 00:35:56.926
so long as you place

00:35:57.802 --> 00:35:59.387
no expectations upon me.

00:36:01.138 --> 00:36:02.223
You…

00:36:04.183 --> 00:36:05.309
You are…

00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:30.918
Her Majesty seemed quite upset.

00:36:31.002 --> 00:36:33.045
Shouldn't you do something?

00:36:34.505 --> 00:36:35.798
Nothing.

00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:38.551
Keep your brilliance
hidden from the world.

00:36:39.385 --> 00:36:42.305
Keep yourself from my sight,
and do nothing.

00:36:43.097 --> 00:36:44.724
I will do nothing.

00:36:46.392 --> 00:36:49.478
Your Highness is especially cold
to Her Majesty.

00:36:51.564 --> 00:36:53.482
It's good for her that I'm a bad son.

00:36:54.442 --> 00:36:57.445
Don't take what Her Majesty said earlier
too much to heart.

00:36:58.112 --> 00:37:00.364
Her Majesty was merely letting off steam.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.785
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

00:37:05.578 --> 00:37:06.787
It is nothing, Your Highness.

00:37:08.539 --> 00:37:10.124
This waiting is getting tedious.

00:37:10.207 --> 00:37:13.794
Let me go and meet Physician Hong myself.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.963
My lady.

00:37:16.672 --> 00:37:17.923
Are you looking at it?

00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:29.518
Why? Is it really that interesting?

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.772
Why would anyone read this?

00:37:32.855 --> 00:37:34.815
I know he will be my husband,

00:37:34.899 --> 00:37:37.276
but I really cannot understand
the appeal of this.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.196
Oh, dear. That's intense.

00:37:41.447 --> 00:37:43.366
Could you turn the page?

00:37:45.826 --> 00:37:47.745
I hear Gil-dong is a Baekjeong.

00:37:47.828 --> 00:37:48.704
Gil-dong?

00:37:51.332 --> 00:37:52.208
I want to get out.

00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:54.960
Hey, move. Make way.

00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:03.886
This man is full of charm.

00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:07.640
You speak as if you can see
his face behind the mask.

00:38:07.723 --> 00:38:09.600
Yes, I can see it.

00:38:10.267 --> 00:38:11.977
I can see his heart, not his face.

00:38:15.648 --> 00:38:16.774
SEEKING THIS MAN

00:38:17.566 --> 00:38:19.443
Who is this man?

00:38:20.277 --> 00:38:21.237
"Name, unknown."

00:38:21.904 --> 00:38:24.073
"Notable remarks, a dullard."

00:38:24.156 --> 00:38:27.034
"Fusses over cold water
and says it's like a thunderbolt."

00:38:27.118 --> 00:38:28.869
"Disrespectful, regardless of company."

00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:30.746
Enough reading for now, my lady.
Let us go.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:32.915
-We must stop by the Hyeminseo.
-Sure.

00:38:35.376 --> 00:38:36.460
Goodbye.

00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:45.553
I thought you might be hungry,
so I bought these on my way.

00:38:45.636 --> 00:38:48.639
You should call the patients over.
I bought enough to share.

00:38:49.974 --> 00:38:53.352
I know you used the snacks
as an excuse to wander around the market.

00:38:53.436 --> 00:38:55.354
You must conduct yourself properly.

00:38:56.522 --> 00:38:58.190
That is not…

00:38:58.274 --> 00:38:59.525
No talking back.

00:39:03.112 --> 00:39:05.072
You must return home before sunset.

00:39:06.198 --> 00:39:07.241
Yes, Father.

00:39:24.258 --> 00:39:25.801
Oh, a dullard.

00:39:31.307 --> 00:39:33.225
Why do you look at me, Your Highness?

00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:37.521
Pardon me.

00:39:37.605 --> 00:39:39.273
See? She's talking to you.

00:39:40.065 --> 00:39:41.358
May I help you?

00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:43.694
By any chance,

00:39:43.777 --> 00:39:46.947
is the man next to you a dullard?

00:39:47.698 --> 00:39:48.699
I can hear you.

00:39:51.577 --> 00:39:52.828
You are mistaken.

00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:54.580
-He is--
-I'm an aide.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.082
I apologize.

00:39:57.166 --> 00:39:59.543
You look like a dullard
someone is looking for,

00:39:59.627 --> 00:40:00.628
so I asked.

00:40:01.504 --> 00:40:02.630
Don't worry.

00:40:02.713 --> 00:40:05.758
Surprisingly, it isn't my first time
being called a dullard.

00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:09.303
Well, then, if you'll excuse me…

00:40:25.486 --> 00:40:26.529
Watch out.

00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:29.949
By the way,

00:40:30.032 --> 00:40:32.117
what was Physician Hong
doing there late at night?

00:40:32.201 --> 00:40:34.245
Women don't usually go out
at such a late hour.

00:40:34.328 --> 00:40:36.747
Well, you may ask her yourself.

00:40:44.588 --> 00:40:45.673
Look, Jeom-baek.

00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:49.593
Where is Physician Hong?

00:40:49.677 --> 00:40:51.178
Eun-jo is off duty today.

00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:54.265
Oh, dear. Where would she be now?

00:40:54.348 --> 00:40:58.269
Whenever she's off duty,
she goes around seeing patients.

00:40:58.352 --> 00:40:59.520
So we do not know.

00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:01.939
We can't see her today either?

00:41:02.022 --> 00:41:03.857
It is really hard to meet this physician.

00:41:04.608 --> 00:41:05.609
Your Highness.

00:41:08.612 --> 00:41:11.115
These are the people
who have visited the widow.

00:41:11.198 --> 00:41:13.325
"Lady next door, lady across the road,

00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:15.828
lady from the house behind,
lady two doors down,

00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:18.205
female shaman, female physician."

00:41:19.665 --> 00:41:21.250
Were there any male visitors?

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:22.334
No, Your Highness.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.086
She didn't leave her house?

00:41:24.169 --> 00:41:26.005
I don't know if this counts,

00:41:26.088 --> 00:41:29.091
but about two hours earlier,
she was stripped of all her belongings

00:41:29.174 --> 00:41:30.509
and was dragged to her master.

00:41:30.593 --> 00:41:32.720
Who is her master?

00:41:32.803 --> 00:41:34.013
Chief Censor.

00:41:35.097 --> 00:41:36.307
Wait.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.560
Gil-dong robbed
Chief Censor's storehouse yesterday.

00:41:41.854 --> 00:41:44.648
Did anyone see smoke rising
from that house's chimney?

00:41:44.732 --> 00:41:46.066
Yes, Your Highness.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.278
I was told
they cooked rice in the morning.

00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:53.240
What's the matter, Your Highness?

00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:59.747
Go and bring that widow
to the constabulary at once.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.011
I can finally move my shoulders.

00:42:16.347 --> 00:42:18.182
How's your insomnia these days?

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.311
I think I'll only get some sleep
when I'm dead.

00:42:23.896 --> 00:42:25.105
My lord!

00:42:25.189 --> 00:42:27.566
The child has done no wrong!

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.195
Is something happening?

00:42:32.154 --> 00:42:34.907
What a sweet baby.

00:42:37.868 --> 00:42:39.495
The baby has put on some weight.

00:42:39.578 --> 00:42:42.790
It means the mother had milk
to feed the baby.

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.920
You had no money to give to your master,

00:42:48.003 --> 00:42:49.755
yet you had food to eat?

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.175
These were found in her house.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.399
Where did you get this rice?

00:43:09.066 --> 00:43:09.942
That's…

00:43:11.402 --> 00:43:13.487
That's what I gave her last night.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.948
Do you have a pimp now?

00:43:17.157 --> 00:43:18.158
Eat it.

00:43:18.784 --> 00:43:19.827
Eat it.

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:22.579
Come on. Eat it.

00:43:22.663 --> 00:43:23.914
Eat it.

00:43:30.462 --> 00:43:32.881
Seize all her possessions
and send her back empty-handed.

00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:34.299
Yes, my lord.

00:43:36.927 --> 00:43:38.345
My lord.

00:43:42.516 --> 00:43:43.600
I beg your pardon,

00:43:44.393 --> 00:43:45.519
but the baby and the mother

00:43:45.602 --> 00:43:49.273
have been unable to eat
and suffering from malnutrition.

00:43:49.356 --> 00:43:52.818
Please show mercy
and allow her to keep the rice at least.

00:43:53.819 --> 00:43:55.070
My wife said that

00:43:55.696 --> 00:43:57.573
you were a decent physician,

00:43:58.323 --> 00:43:59.825
so I thought well of you.

00:44:02.786 --> 00:44:04.413
But you don't know your place.

00:44:06.957 --> 00:44:10.919
I'm a physician,
and these two are my patients.

00:44:11.003 --> 00:44:13.130
That is why I beg this favor of you.

00:44:13.213 --> 00:44:16.717
She needs to eat
for the medicine to take effect.

00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:22.556
Unlike humans,

00:44:22.639 --> 00:44:25.726
beasts die once their purpose is served.

00:44:26.435 --> 00:44:28.771
That is how the world works.

00:44:52.294 --> 00:44:55.881
Go home for now.
I will stop by later tonight.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.272
I was going to stay quiet
for the time being, but…

00:45:20.989 --> 00:45:23.075
Heading to Chief Censor's storehouse?

00:45:35.879 --> 00:45:37.130
Who is he?

00:45:39.925 --> 00:45:41.093
Do not worry.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.263
This is not where you will die.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:49.851
What?

00:45:51.186 --> 00:45:52.187
What?

00:45:52.271 --> 00:45:53.438
Are you coming over?

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.525
Slave boy?

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.361
Why don't you just stay there?

00:45:59.444 --> 00:46:01.446
I'd rather have some space between us.

00:46:03.031 --> 00:46:05.075
No, I must be mistaken.

00:46:05.158 --> 00:46:06.159
What are you doing?

00:46:06.827 --> 00:46:09.371
That's his voice. I wasn't mistaken.

00:46:09.955 --> 00:46:10.998
What?

00:46:11.832 --> 00:46:13.750
What's the slave boy doing here?

00:46:15.627 --> 00:46:17.963
I knew you wouldn't be an ordinary man,

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.049
but you're far more peculiar
than I thought.

00:46:21.133 --> 00:46:24.219
Wait, that he knows I was going
to Chief Censor's storehouse means…

00:46:24.303 --> 00:46:25.387
Gil-dong.

00:46:26.346 --> 00:46:27.848
He knows me.

00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:29.182
But how?

00:46:29.266 --> 00:46:32.352
But before that, how does he look so sane?

00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:35.147
Are you amazed by my insight,
seeing how I was already waiting here?

00:46:37.566 --> 00:46:39.359
What are you nodding about?

00:46:39.443 --> 00:46:40.819
What is happening?

00:46:40.902 --> 00:46:42.279
I can't believe how I look either.

00:46:42.362 --> 00:46:43.864
You may not believe me but it's true.

00:46:43.947 --> 00:46:45.198
You may not believe this, but…

00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:48.160
Is this all because I did not believe him?

00:46:49.328 --> 00:46:50.537
Wait, does this mean…

00:46:51.913 --> 00:46:54.207
I thought the silk clothes
he was wearing were borrowed.

00:46:54.291 --> 00:46:56.501
Does this mean he's really not a slave?

00:46:56.585 --> 00:46:58.045
When theft is your trade,

00:46:58.128 --> 00:47:00.922
you're bound to get acquainted
with an aide or two.

00:47:01.006 --> 00:47:02.466
No need to be so startled.

00:47:03.759 --> 00:47:05.427
An aide?

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.304
He's a newly appointed aide.

00:47:07.387 --> 00:47:08.764
He's a pale, well-groomed man.

00:47:08.847 --> 00:47:10.098
This cannot be true.

00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:12.392
There's no time to be in shock.

00:47:12.476 --> 00:47:14.227
-I must run--
-Stop.

00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:15.646
I won't chase you.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.106
If I intended to catch you,

00:47:18.649 --> 00:47:20.859
I would have tailed you
to find who you were.

00:47:39.628 --> 00:47:42.506
You know where the thief is
and yet you won't give chase?

00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:44.299
If Chief Constable finds out…

00:47:45.467 --> 00:47:48.136
Go and bring that widow
to the constabulary at once.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.388
Yes, Your Highness.

00:47:52.307 --> 00:47:55.394
But we don't have any evidence.

00:47:55.477 --> 00:47:58.563
Where do you think a widow
who didn't even have money for her master

00:47:58.647 --> 00:47:59.648
got the rice?

00:48:03.527 --> 00:48:04.945
Could it be Gil-dong…

00:48:05.028 --> 00:48:07.989
The rumor that Gil-dong
is a righteous thief might be true.

00:48:09.825 --> 00:48:11.243
And if it is true,

00:48:12.536 --> 00:48:14.037
how much would it be worth?

00:48:15.956 --> 00:48:17.207
Where could he be?

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:33.181
Yes.

00:48:34.015 --> 00:48:35.183
I took it.

00:48:44.735 --> 00:48:45.902
I ate it.

00:48:50.282 --> 00:48:51.742
Because I was hungry.

00:48:52.951 --> 00:48:57.539
And I bet other people who owe Gil-dong
did the same.

00:48:59.332 --> 00:49:02.210
This was stolen. Do not tell anyone.

00:49:06.089 --> 00:49:08.675
It is my fault
that the rumor is going around.

00:49:08.759 --> 00:49:12.345
I was so happy to receive
what I didn't deserve

00:49:12.429 --> 00:49:15.807
that I forgot about Gil-dong's request
and ran my mouth.

00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:17.809
But I will not cause any more trouble.

00:49:19.686 --> 00:49:22.022
I'm the one who was fed with stolen rice.

00:49:22.981 --> 00:49:24.149
Arrest me.

00:49:43.293 --> 00:49:45.003
The officer who questioned me

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:47.214
sent me all this?

00:49:48.799 --> 00:49:51.009
He'd like you to just accept them.

00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:57.974
The Grand Prince said to me,

00:49:58.642 --> 00:50:01.978
"How could I blame
the widow and her child for their hunger?"

00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:07.567
And how could I blame Gil-dong

00:50:08.652 --> 00:50:10.320
for not overlooking the hunger

00:50:11.238 --> 00:50:12.864
of a widow and her child?

00:50:18.245 --> 00:50:20.080
And I don't have the answer yet.

00:50:27.587 --> 00:50:30.173
Why does he say he wouldn't catch me?

00:50:31.049 --> 00:50:33.426
But I will not support your theft either.

00:50:35.136 --> 00:50:38.598
Neither will I blame Joseon
for ignoring corrupt officials. However…

00:50:39.516 --> 00:50:40.559
However?

00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:42.644
I will allow you

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.689
to look after your neighbors your way.

00:50:47.148 --> 00:50:49.401
Does he want me to continue the theft?

00:50:50.193 --> 00:50:51.152
Right.

00:50:51.236 --> 00:50:53.196
The widow had a message for you.

00:50:54.114 --> 00:50:55.448
Gil-dong always came by

00:50:56.491 --> 00:50:58.535
whenever I was hungry and sick,

00:50:58.618 --> 00:51:01.162
although I don't know how he always knew.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.000
The smartest person I know

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.044
once said this to me.

00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:16.970
Hunger alone is misery enough,

00:51:17.762 --> 00:51:20.098
yet to suffer
my master's beatings as well…

00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:24.978
I am so sick of this life.

00:51:27.105 --> 00:51:29.566
I have been a physician
for only five years now,

00:51:29.649 --> 00:51:32.027
but I have learned something in that time.

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:36.698
When a person is hungry and ill,

00:51:36.781 --> 00:51:39.659
it is the heart that suffers most.

00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:42.913
Is that so?

00:51:45.707 --> 00:51:47.542
And when your heart is deeply hurt,

00:51:48.209 --> 00:51:49.336
that is when

00:51:50.003 --> 00:51:51.379
no medicine works.

00:51:54.758 --> 00:51:56.885
No matter how fine the medicine,

00:51:56.968 --> 00:52:00.805
it cannot reach a wounded heart.

00:52:01.681 --> 00:52:03.224
That person said to me

00:52:03.808 --> 00:52:05.393
that sometimes, it's not fancy medicine

00:52:05.477 --> 00:52:09.731
but a bowl of rice prepared with love
that heals a person.

00:52:11.775 --> 00:52:13.526
And that's exactly what happened to me.

00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:15.737
THIS WAS STOLEN. DO NOT TELL ANYONE.

00:52:41.805 --> 00:52:46.309
The rice I swallowed
through the lump in my throat…

00:52:54.693 --> 00:52:57.529
reached and touched my heart deeply.

00:52:59.197 --> 00:53:00.865
So each time he came by,

00:53:01.992 --> 00:53:05.328
the warmth he left behind
made me so happy.

00:53:10.917 --> 00:53:12.919
She said she was happy to have known you

00:53:14.129 --> 00:53:15.338
and thanked you.

00:53:17.257 --> 00:53:20.468
This is how I knew you'd go
to Chief Censor's storehouse tonight.

00:53:21.511 --> 00:53:23.138
It's all thanks to the widow.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.099
I thought you'd come back tonight

00:53:26.182 --> 00:53:28.643
to see the widow and the baby
exploited by Chief Censor

00:53:28.727 --> 00:53:30.270
based on what she told me.

00:53:36.359 --> 00:53:38.653
And you're where I predicted you would be.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:41.156
From now on,

00:53:42.866 --> 00:53:44.367
stay within my expectations.

00:53:46.578 --> 00:53:47.871
Just stay within

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:50.623
what I can handle.

00:53:52.667 --> 00:53:53.877
What does this mean?

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.336
Does he really mean that?

00:53:56.755 --> 00:53:58.590
But if you go beyond my forbearance

00:53:58.673 --> 00:54:01.593
and threaten the foundations of Joseon,
I will arrest you.

00:54:03.428 --> 00:54:04.387
Bear this in mind.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.806
Just because I do not chase you

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:09.434
does not mean I let you go.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.194
Isn't that Gil-dong?

00:54:21.071 --> 00:54:22.322
He looks just like the sketch.

00:54:23.323 --> 00:54:25.283
It's Gil-dong! Gil-dong is here!

00:54:26.242 --> 00:54:27.285
Oh, no.

00:54:29.245 --> 00:54:30.872
He was just stalling for time.

00:54:30.955 --> 00:54:31.956
Wait.

00:54:33.708 --> 00:54:34.751
Stop!

00:54:37.087 --> 00:54:38.171
He's here!

00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:51.768
Hasn't the arrest order been canceled?

00:54:51.851 --> 00:54:52.936
It was canceled so urgently

00:54:53.019 --> 00:54:55.897
that it seems it never reached
the officers already out on patrol.

00:54:57.065 --> 00:54:59.275
There's a ball of cotton
instead of the arrowhead.

00:54:59.359 --> 00:55:01.111
Enough with the act and get up.

00:55:02.904 --> 00:55:05.657
This unnecessary chase
could put His Highness in danger.

00:55:06.157 --> 00:55:07.408
Guard His Highness first.

00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:12.372
Stop there!

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.004
Stop the attack!

00:55:34.394 --> 00:55:36.146
What kind of twisted fate is this?

00:55:37.063 --> 00:55:38.064
From now on,

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:40.066
stay within my expectations.

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.152
Just stay within

00:55:43.027 --> 00:55:44.279
what I can handle.

00:55:47.198 --> 00:55:49.159
I almost fell for it.

00:55:58.585 --> 00:56:00.211
I hope he escaped safely.

00:56:17.979 --> 00:56:21.274
HYEMINSEO

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:00.980
Why did he come here?

00:57:02.232 --> 00:57:03.900
Is he after Gil-dong?

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.534
I saw the lantern was lit, so I came in.

00:57:15.245 --> 00:57:16.955
Oh, no. What do I do?

00:57:20.416 --> 00:57:23.044
Hyeminseo is closed now. Please leave.

00:57:25.797 --> 00:57:26.673
Is it you?

00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:34.222
It's you, isn't it?

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:36.891
Should I just run now?

00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:47.652
It is you.

00:57:55.076 --> 00:57:56.119
The silk shoes.

00:57:57.495 --> 00:57:58.580
Silk shoes?

00:57:59.998 --> 00:58:00.999
The flowery rain.

00:58:02.292 --> 00:58:03.334
Flowery rain?

00:58:27.692 --> 00:58:28.735
There you are.

00:58:31.696 --> 00:58:33.281
Lady Flower.

00:59:41.224 --> 00:59:43.017
What happened to your arm?
Did you get hurt?

00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:44.686
You said you would only look.

00:59:44.769 --> 00:59:46.771
Just looking won't do.

00:59:46.854 --> 00:59:48.773
You must be close to the Grand Prince.

00:59:48.856 --> 00:59:50.566
We are very close.

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:51.984
I heard he was a philanderer.

00:59:52.068 --> 00:59:53.736
I told you to donate anonymously.

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.697
There are unsavory rumors
about Your Highness.

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.864
This should be made known.

00:59:56.948 --> 00:59:57.782
They're my rumors.

00:59:57.865 --> 00:59:59.492
Put a man on the Grand Prince.

00:59:59.575 --> 01:00:02.286
Find out whom he meets and where he goes.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.080
You didn't even realize you got hurt.

01:00:04.163 --> 01:00:05.081
Are you always dull?

01:00:05.164 --> 01:00:08.292
Does he know that
you're marrying a man in his 70s?

01:00:08.376 --> 01:00:11.254
It will be interesting if he finds out.

01:00:11.337 --> 01:00:13.214
What are you doing now?

01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:14.590
I'm courting you.

01:00:14.674 --> 01:00:16.050
Is there a man you hold dear?

01:00:16.134 --> 01:00:20.096
