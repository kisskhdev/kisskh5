00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.080
Wasn't he supposed to heal himself?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.560
What happened?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.680

Seven days ago,

00:04:00.253 --> 00:04:01.910
he suddenly coughed up blood
and fainted.

00:04:02.193 --> 00:04:04.150
(Everlasting Joy)
His self-healing was gone then.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.800
Even the Bracelet was damaged.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.870
Whenever he uses his power,

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.150
the Frostbite Curse worsens.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.840
Yet he ignored his health

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.870
and forced his power
to mend the Bracelet.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.120
He said it was to protect you.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.070
(Could what Ying Du said be true?)

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.630
(He cannot heal himself)

00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:21.100
(because he brought me back to life)

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.390
(by forcing the Bracelet
to turn back time.)

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.120
(But I saw him)

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.000
(kill Grandmother.)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.720
Why did he kill my people?

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.310
Those two?

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.560
They tormented you

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.750
with Wu Luoluo.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.120
His body was at its limits,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.149
yet you still wounded him.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.070
Do you know

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.830
that with his current state,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.000
he may lose his life at any moment

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.240
and may never wake up again?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.080
Luo Cheng,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.070
there must be a way to save him,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.960
right?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.750
There is no way,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.680
unless we find the legendary Saintess.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.850
(The Saintess?)

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.270
Now, your power has awakened,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.310
and you've become the Saintess.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.360
The ruler's power is unique.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.870
If the Saintess could serve
as the remedy's guide,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.470
perhaps

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:23.059
it could temporarily suppress
the Frostbite Curse within him.
