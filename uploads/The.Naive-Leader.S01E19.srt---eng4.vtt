00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.959
I don't know what the Northeastern Army is up to.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.040
The Japanese have occupied them for so many years.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.760
Yet they remain indifferent.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.640
They still don't know to fight back.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a disgrace to us soldiers.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.159
And that so-called Central Army.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.640
They came up with...

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:52.799
...that "internal pacification before external resistance."

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.799
Pacify my ass.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.239
They can't distinguish priorities or friend from foe.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.319
Ignoring real work for nonsense.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.879
All day long, they just make empty promises.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.879
My troops are now strong and well-equipped.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.840
We have the men, we have the guns.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.079
Resources are plentiful, and the soldiers are united.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.159
It is the perfect time for us...

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.680
...to conquer a territory.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:14.879
Quick, quick, quick!

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.520
Once we become bigger and stronger...

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.759
...and absorb the scum around us...

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.120
...we will attack.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.159
Let the Northeastern Army see...

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.960
Let the Central Army see...

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.080
...the courage of our Sichuan soldiers.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.039
I don't believe these Japanese...

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.479
...have three heads and six legs.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.840
When the time comes, I'll raise my sword...

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.080
...and take them down one by one.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.879
I've finally waited for this day.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.879
Drive the Japanese back home!

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.800
Ready, go!

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.599
Drive them back home!

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.240
Drive them back home!

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.960
Drive them back home!

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.639
What are you doing?

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.080
Brother Fan ordered not to kill him.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.560
If he moves, I can kill him.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.680
Down with Japanese Imperialism!

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.439
Move!

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.000
If you want to hit him...

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240
...hit me first.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.199
Get out of my way!

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.400
Go! Go quickly!

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.639
Drive them back home!

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.840
Drive them back home!

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.800
Get down. You're acting crazy.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.840
Commander Wei is righteous!

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.639
Attention, everyone!

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.680
Salute Commander Wei!

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.479
Just a little bit more.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.520
Why didn't you let me kill him?

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.080
Although he is no gentleman...

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.360
...he cares about the national cause.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.240
We need generals like him right now.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.879
What about Pockmarked Tiger?

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.520
Have you forgotten her vengeance?

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.960
In the face of the greater cause...

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.599
...personal grudges must be put aside.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.159
It's easy for you to say.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.159
If it were vengeance for your wife...

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.520
...you wouldn't act this way.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.439
I would do exactly the same.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.680
Yu Zhen would understand too.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.159
Pockmarked Tiger was a heroine.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.560
I believe she...

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.199
...would have the same spirit.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.319
But you...

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.439
...are underestimating her.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.479
You can't even protect those around you.

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.319
You can't avenge your closest kin.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.680
How can you talk about the national cause?

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.720
Exactly.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.560
Stop the car!

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.600
Stop! Stop!

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.519
You're awake.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.720
No...

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.600
If you want to leave, just leave.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.079
I didn't say I was coming with you.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.279
You did say it.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.600
Regarding this matter...

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.480
You didn't snitch to Commander Wei.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.439
That proves...

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.720
...we're on the same side.

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:45.560
You, oh you.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.399
You can't just decide for me.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.439
I... I want to go back.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.360
Come, come, I'll take you back.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.399
You'll be dead if you go back.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.040
Just be good and come with me.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.439
Let's go.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.720
Go, go, go.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.600
This fool is quite something.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:23.720
He's got guts.

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:24.680
Commander.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.040
Commander.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.680
This was found on the opera stage.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.480
That spot was perfect for hitting you.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.439
Where is Xuanjizi?

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.240
He's disappeared.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.600
This is the lucky general he recommended to me.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.879
Commander Chen.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.240
Commander Chen, come on out.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.319
We need to talk.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.560
Commander Chen.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:53.439
I came here this time...

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.279
on my own accord.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.079
I mainly just want to...

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.839
get my little brother back.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.720
If you hand him over to me...

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.399
I'll give you Commander Liao's munitions...

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.160
...every last bit of them.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.600
If you don't give him to me...

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.439
I'll destroy all the munitions.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.079
You won't get a single one.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:15.160
Commander Chen.

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.319
Commander Qin died at their hands.

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.279
And he still comes to negotiate with us.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.480
I think he's here to die.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.879
Since he's looking to die...

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.240
we might as well oblige him.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.439
Since we are friends

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.160
We warmly welcome you

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.319
Welcome, welcome

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.199
A warm welcome

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.959
Welcome, welcome

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:46.040
A warm welcome

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.079
Welcome, welcome

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.879
A warm welcome

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:51.720
Let's go, let's go

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.639
Commander Chen

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.839
You know the grudge between him and me

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.160
Now that you've taken him in

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.279
When he comes for my life later

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:04.839
I'm afraid I won't be able to fight back

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.920
Stay sharp

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.519
If anything goes wrong later

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:10.800
Take Xiu Gu and leave first

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.959
Commander Wei lacks someone like you

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.759
That's why he does whatever he wants

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.439
Don't worry

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.439
You are my advisor

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:27.399
Brother Fan

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.040
This Qiong liquor is decades old

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.879
This level of reception

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.319
Is a bit high

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.600
Brother

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.639
It's fine

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.000
Come with me later

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.959
Go where?

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.120
Take you back, of course

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:50.439
I'm not going

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.199
I'm very comfortable here

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:53.480
Except that I can't leave the city

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:55.040
I can go wherever I want

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.560
And do whatever I want

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.199
Really?

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.000
Are you two here to watch him?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.360
Not entirely

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.120
Those two are my moneybags

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:09.920
And they're responsible for my safety

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.600
That Commander Chen is very refined

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.040
He's actually quite nice

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.360
Since I got here

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.160
He has never made things difficult for me

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.399
The conditions I raised

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:19.800
He has met them all

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.560
Unlike those boorish soldiers

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:24.319
He even mentioned to me

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.600
That he appreciates you very much

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:27.639
Why don't you join me

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:28.519
And stay here

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.879
You've been brainwashed

00:08:32.959 --> 00:08:34.480
Commander Chen treats you well

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.759
To use you to control your Old Man

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.159
I must send you back

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.240
To Commander Liao

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:44.320
It's very unsafe here

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.679
He gives me what I want

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.120
I can give to him too

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.480
It's a fair exchange

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:51.159
What is a kid like you thinking

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.919
I'll tie you up and take you back if I have to

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:55.639
First Brother

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.480
Brother

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.200
We should have come here long ago

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.159
Look at this setup

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:00.080
This is

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.679
The attitude one should have for talent

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.399
Look at that guy named Wei

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:05.600
He only knows how to make things hard for us

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.240
Brothers

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.480
Come on, drink up

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.000
I think it's pretty good here

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.559
At least there's a chance to avenge my dad

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:16.320
It's not that simple

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:18.360
If it were simple

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.240
Would I have waited until now?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.480
Brother, come, sit here

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:27.320
Come, come, come

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.039
Then, then I'll just...

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.759
Suit yourself

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.679
Come, sister, sit on my lap

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.919
You are not allowed to get ideas about him

00:09:57.159 --> 00:09:58.320
If I don't get ideas about him

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.960
What if he gets ideas about me?

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.159
I can't just let him do whatever he wants

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:04.000
I guarantee he won't touch you

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.080
I think the most important thing now

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.320
Is to find a place to settle down

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.919
We can't go up the mountain again

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:12.919
Although I can't figure out Commander Chen's thoughts yet

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:15.000
At least he thinks highly of you

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.159
How about

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.480
We stay for now

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.679
And wait and see

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.519
There's no better choice at the moment

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360
Commander Chen

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:41.039
understands people best.

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:43.679
You've taken care of my brothers

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.519
very well.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:46.879
Are you satisfied?

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.360
They are certainly very satisfied.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.759
Since I'm staying,

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.759
can you hand that Huo fellow

00:10:58.039 --> 00:10:58.879
over to me?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.960
Brother Fan,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.200
can you give me some face?

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:04.879
He killed my father.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.799
When will vengeance ever end?

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.600
By your logic,

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:10.559
shouldn't I

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:11.840
wipe out your troops too?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.879
After all,

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:14.799
you caused me to lose a regiment.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:17.159
Commander Qin died because of you.

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.279
So Commander Chen

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.679
is unwilling to hand him over.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.519
The battlefield and officialdom are ever-changing.

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:36.679
If the wind changes one day,

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.240
and Commander Wei wants me to hand you to him,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.279
tell me, should I hand you over

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:42.720
or not?

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:48.519
If you really want him,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.279
it's not impossible.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:53.120
Your troops need to be disbanded and reorganized.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.919
My brothers trust me,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.720
that's why they're with me.

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:01.080
These brothers of yours

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.799
indulge in wine and women,

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.559
love to eat and gamble.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.159
Keeping them around

00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:08.200
is likely to cause trouble.

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:11.960
Brother Fan, no need to worry.

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:14.039
You keep your men,

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.679
I'll keep mine.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.919
If one day you achieve military merit,

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.080
perhaps,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.559
as a reward,

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:22.000
I can hand him over to you.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.639
But if your troops make a mistake,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.879
I agree to disband and reorganize.

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.639
Brother Fan is straightforward.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.720
I like your boldness and loyalty.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:40.600
It's a deal.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.759
It's a deal.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.039
I won.

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.440
How did you win?

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.399
Five pieces in a row.

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.399
I won.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.000
Everyone,

00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:02.519
this is Fan Pengju.

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:04.399
He is our Brigade Commander Fan.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:05.720
Please welcome him.

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:12.480
Today,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.200
Brigade Commander Fan officially joins my Chen Division.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:18.840
I hope you all put aside prejudices,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.559
and cooperate sincerely.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.559
Past grievances

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.000
are written off.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.960
Let us progress together.

00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:30.360
Good!

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.440
Good!

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.639
Good!

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.399
Good! Good!

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:23.919
You punk, one day,

00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:26.080
you'll choke even on cold water.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.440
Thanks to you,

00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:32.000
I'm already choking a bit on water.

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.879
Living under someone else's roof now,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.720
having some cold water to drink isn't bad.

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:38.240
You don't need to guard against me.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.559
Right now,

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.240
I won't do anything to you for the time being.

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:48.840
I don't need to guard against you either.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.360
You wouldn't dare do anything to me.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.559
Can't kill him.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.960
Can't kill him.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:42.039
Let him go.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.840
If we want to kill Young Master Huo,

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:42.320
our troops

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.799
cannot make any mistakes.

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:47.639
Just let me be your compass.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.080
Hurry up.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.000
Come on, what's with the shouting?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.679
Hurry up.

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:00.840
Green Dragon.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.600
I don't want the Green Dragon.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.080
Pong.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.320
You'll Pong just about anything.

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.480
Here, Five Wan.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.480
This ban on gambling...

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.440
did you guys seriously not see it?

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:16.359
Violating military orders...

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.039
has serious consequences.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.880
Just a little gambling in our downtime...

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.000
just to blow off some steam.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.680
This is an order from Division Commander Chen.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.880
Xuanjizi and I have to enforce it.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.680
Six Bamboo.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.119
We're a regular army now.

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:30.039
We shouldn't be acting like this.

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:31.440
So brazenly.

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:33.519
It's too loud.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.160
I could hear it from the courtyard.

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:38.000
Brigade Commander Fan followed the sound here.

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:41.240
Since you're already here...

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.519
play a couple of rounds with us.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.119
Come on, come on.

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:43.839
Come on, join us.

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:44.640
No, no, no.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.079
I'm not here to play Mahjong with you.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.839
I came specifically to tell you...

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.640
Division Commander Chen is different from Commander Wei.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.640
Division Commander Chen doesn't care about personal favors.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.759
It's fine.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.799
When the time comes...

00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:58.920
if you get caught by Xuanjizi...

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.519
you won't be able to wiggle your way out.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.079
What's the big deal?

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.559
That Division Commander Chen is overstepping a bit.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.680
You built this army with your own two hands.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.640
What gives him the right to control so much?

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.279
Exactly.

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:09.440
It pisses me off just hearing about it.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.720
I'm definitely going to play a round today.

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:13.039
Let's see what he can do to you.

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:14.880
We can't play.

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:17.200
You're going to gamble this army into the ground.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.640
Play Ba Wan.

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:21.640
Ba Wan, Pong!

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.880
Is he playing or are you?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.119
We're brothers. How deep is our bond?

00:18:31.279 --> 00:18:33.519
Like a shirt to the back, like meat to the bone.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.920
Live together, die together.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:37.319
That's right.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.759
So play a round with us today.

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:40.640
Come on, sit, sit, sit.

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:42.279
Come on, Boss.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.480
You've got great luck.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.880
Why are you sitting here?

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.160
Let me play a hand, come on.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.680
Brother Fan.

00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:50.759
We haven't hung out like this in ages.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.319
Our brotherhood is fading.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.559
Let's really enjoy ourselves today.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:55.440
Fine. Nine Bamboo.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.599
Hold on.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:00.079
Go to the door and keep watch.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.200
Let us know if anything happens.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.640
Why am I always the lookout?

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.880
Just go.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.400
That Four Bamboo play was awful.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.200
Playing Four Bamboo with a hand like this...

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.319
Go, go, go, get to the door.

00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:09.440
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:19:10.359 --> 00:19:11.039
Five Dots.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.680
What kind of hand is this?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.319
He's coming, he's coming!

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:21.279
Who's coming?

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.960
He's here! Xuanjizi is here!

00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:25.559
We're screwed, we're screwed.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.720
Hide, quickly!

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.359
What are you afraid of?

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.359
Hide!

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:30.799
Play! Play! Play!

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.680
Hurry up and play!

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:38.839
The audacity

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.359
Red Dragon

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:40.640
Gathering to gamble

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.880
Confiscate them

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.119
What are you doing?

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:45.720
What's your problem?

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.279
What? You're so fierce.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.319
Our Big Brother...

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.000
What are you yelling for?

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.559
Clearing my throat, practicing vocals

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.359
Just stay out of the card playing business

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.680
Our Big Brother...

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:02.559
What do you want to say now?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.599
Nothing, nothing

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:08.000
What is under this table?

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.720
Nothing, nothing

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.400
Listen up

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.839
Within ten minutes,

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:15.119
everyone present here

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:17.079
go to the Military Law Office for ten military club strikes.

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:19.119
If anyone dares not to go,

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:20.960
they'll be in confinement for half a month.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.839
Big Brother, come out.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.759
Careful

00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:36.160
I said let's not play

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.599
You insisted I play

00:20:38.119 --> 00:20:39.799
Now it's like a cat clawing sticky rice cake,

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:41.240
can't get the claws free.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.519
You, a dignified Brigade Commander

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.839
What are you afraid of?

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:46.119
In the face of military discipline,

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:48.160
everyone is equal.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.839
If you violate military discipline,

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:51.519
you have to suffer the consequences.

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:53.559
The trouble you caused yourself,

00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:55.119
you bear it yourself.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.359
Money

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.559
My money is still there

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.680
Now our butts are going to blossom

00:21:07.839 --> 00:21:09.279
Luckily I didn't throw money in

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.000
Darn it

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.799
Trying to fix me?

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:00.839
Come on, let's play

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:03.440
Come on

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:05.400
Where did you get that?

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.240
A cunning rabbit has three burrows

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.079
Mahjong must have three sets

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:10.799
You still dare to play?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.839
Brigade Commander Fan just hid under the table

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.519
And we got beaten with military clubs

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.279
Right now, my heart is all...

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:19.880
Like a toad eating long beans—hanging in suspense.

00:23:20.319 --> 00:23:21.599
What are you scared of?

00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:24.039
I don't believe he can keep this up every day

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.920
Darn it

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:27.640
Come on, let's play

00:23:27.759 --> 00:23:29.359
First Brother, forget it

00:23:29.519 --> 00:23:30.200
What?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.559
Even you are scared?

00:23:34.759 --> 00:23:36.079
Who can ban gambling?

00:23:36.839 --> 00:23:38.839
If anyone can actually eat this mahjong tile,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.000
I will quit gambling.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.079
Who dares to eat a mahjong tile?

00:23:41.839 --> 00:23:43.160
Don't speak too absolutely

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:44.000
Maybe,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.400
there really is someone who doesn't believe in fate.

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:46.480
Empty talk

00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:48.079
I'm not boasting

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:50.400
If anyone eats this mahjong tile,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.960
I will take this whole set of mahjong,

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.039
and swallow it all.

00:23:57.119 --> 00:23:58.200
You said it

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:00.559
If anyone dares to eat one mahjong tile,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.400
you will swallow the whole set.

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.319
I said it

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.720
Carrying a bellows to the camp,

00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:37.079
you're still a bit green.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.920
Just wait

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.319
First Brother said,

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:52.160
if anyone eats one mahjong tile,

00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:55.079
he will swallow the whole set.

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:56.960
And then quit gambling.

00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:59.119
I just ate a mahjong tile

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.119
When it comes to gambling addiction,

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:03.279
who has a bigger one than me?

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.799
First Brother,

00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:06.599
keep your word.

00:25:07.759 --> 00:25:09.359
Fine, I'll eat it

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:13.799
Brigade Commander Fan, as per your orders,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.319
the dishes are ready.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.680
First Brother, please

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:38.559
Are you a cat?

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:40.079
Using your claws?

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:42.440
I prepared chopsticks for you

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.640
Come on

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.079
What?

00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:51.480
Choking it down dry?

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.240
Dip it in some sesame sauce, it tastes delicious.

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:09.319
How is it?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.920
It's so bitter.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.920
That one is made of coptis.

00:26:14.079 --> 00:26:15.039
Of course it's bitter.

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:16.799
You eat that Red Dragon.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.079
Mix in a little sugar.

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:20.400
I guarantee it'll taste sweet.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.799
What's wrong?

00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:35.039
Choked on it?

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:38.960
I prepared Qiong liquor especially for you.

00:26:39.359 --> 00:26:40.880
Here, wash it down.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.559
This Ba Wan.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.640
Must be mixed with that chili oil.

00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:53.720
That chili oil has Sichuan pepper and chilies.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.799
Stir-fried together.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.119
Authentic Sichuan flavor.

00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:57.680
It tastes excellent.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.480
How does it taste?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.160
Bitter.

00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:14.119
Bitter.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.160
So you know it's bitter.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.160
Having a troop that can't show its face is what's bitter.

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:22.240
Being a disgrace is what's bitter.

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:25.480
Being sloppy and slack is what's bitter.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.400
If the troops can't win battles,

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:30.039
losing face is what's bitter.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.440
You eat some.

00:27:44.839 --> 00:27:46.519
You were smiling just now.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.519
Eat some.

00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:50.720
I just had lunch, I'm very full.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:52.079
It hasn't gone down yet.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.160
Eat some.

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.480
Will you guys still gamble?

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.119
No gambling.

00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:07.359
Gamble or not?

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.160
Absolutely not.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.359
Good.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.000
Brothers.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.720
From today on, we get tough.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.519
Training must be done properly.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.079
We must make a name for ourselves in battle.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.400
Yes, sir!

00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:43.599
Come catch me.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.519
Come catch me.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.599
Brother.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.200
Brother.

00:28:58.839 --> 00:28:59.559
Something happened.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.599
Something happened.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.079
What?

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:03.759
Xiu Gu.

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:06.079
She ran off with that Troupe Leader.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.440
I saw that coming long ago.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.720
Those two have always had something going on.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.079
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:29:16.119 --> 00:29:17.319
You were rising in the ranks.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.359
Who would've thought she'd stray?

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:20.720
Go catch her, quick.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.559
Roger that.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.480
Brother.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.720
How about we tie them up,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.480
tie them to a stone,

00:29:38.599 --> 00:29:39.640
and throw them into the pond.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.640
Do you believe

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.599
I'll kill you all right now?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.480
Let him go.

00:29:44.079 --> 00:29:45.240
It was all my idea.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.880
Kill me or cut me, do as you please.

00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:48.240
Xiu Gu.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640
If we die, we die together.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.880
I'm not afraid.

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:02.880
Think it over carefully.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.720
Scarface.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.759
Give me the gun.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.519
Brother, let me handle this.

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:14.559
Give it here.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.960
None of you are allowed to follow.

00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:21.519
Stay right here.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.640
Move.

00:30:33.119 --> 00:30:33.920
Stop right there.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.240
Think this through carefully.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.559
Brother Fan.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.640
You're the first man to ever move my heart.

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:56.079
I willingly became your concubine.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.519
I followed you through life and death.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.240
I never once thought...

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.839
...of replacing Sister Yu Zhen.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.559
I just wanted to be with you, to care for you.

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:10.039
But what about you?

00:31:13.759 --> 00:31:15.400
You pushed me far away.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.559
Your eyes are cold when you look at me.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.039
You avoid me.

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:23.519
You reject me.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.319
The only reason I stayed with you...

00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:28.000
...was to avenge my father.

00:31:32.079 --> 00:31:33.799
You're a high-ranking official now.

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:35.880
Yet you say your hands are tied.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.279
You know me.

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:41.039
I've always been this way.

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:42.799
Love is love, and hate is hate.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.319
I know when to let go.

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:49.160
I have no reason to follow you anymore.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.960
I've made up my mind.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.440
Go ahead, do it.

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:13.200
You two...

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.720
walk away from here.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.640
Take ten steps.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.720
I'll fire three shots.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:22.480
If I miss you...

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.079
...then run for your lives.

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:27.079
Don't torture us like this.

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:28.720
Just get it over with.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.359
I said go!

00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:59.720
I'm out of practice.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.200
You two...

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.839
...live a good life.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.160
Go as far away as you can.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:38.279
In this lifetime...

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:41.880
...don't let me ever see you again.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.599
And don't let...

00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:46.279
...my men see you either.

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:50.039
Go on.

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:12.680
Darn it.

00:34:13.319 --> 00:34:15.760
It tears my heart out.
