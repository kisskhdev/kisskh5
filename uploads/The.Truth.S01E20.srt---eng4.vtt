00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:23.666
This car's interior
has had many cleanings.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.466
But the bottom layer of felt
in the truck bed

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.386
has been perfectly preserved
all these years.

00:01:28.386 --> 00:01:30.585
I detected Ding Youcai's DNA on it.

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:32.986
Also,

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:36.425
the DNA from an unknown female
was found on the phone case.

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:39.986
If it's not the victim's,

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.026
it must be the killer's.

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.225
It belongs to an unknown female.

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:52.186
So you're resuming your old business?

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.626
Or have you never really stopped?

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:56.986
No, I'm just...

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.145
Let me put it this way.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:04.585
I do run a travel agency.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:08.905
I organize group tours abroad
for a few days of fun.

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:14.145
Once they're out,
the local tour operators take over.

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:17.145
I don't know what the local operators
arrange for them to do.

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:23.320
The victims
don't seem to tell the same story.

00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:25.745
Don't listen to their nonsense.

00:02:25.986 --> 00:02:27.305
What victims?

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:29.145
They are all adults.

00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:33.625
The black-and-white contracts
spell everything out clearly.

00:02:36.705 --> 00:02:38.106
What about the money you collected?

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.066
The bulk goes
to the local tour operators.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:43.585
I only collect the tour fee.

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:45.016
At most...

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:49.305
At most, there is just a tiny margin.

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:51.066
You have no idea.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.946
Some competitors
are downright unscrupulous.

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:56.465
Utterly immoral.

00:02:56.786 --> 00:02:58.666
If you say you're broke,
they'll say it's fine.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:02.585
They send people to loan sharks
operated by their associates

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:04.025
to borrow at exorbitant rates.

00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:08.946
Look. Compared to them,
I run a truly ethical business.

00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:14.346
Plus, all my procedures and paperwork
are completely legal.

00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:16.905
Why were you in such a rush
to fly southwest?

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:22.905
It's because those people
keep harassing me.

00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:26.625
Enough. Let's get serious.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.425
You know about Yu Meigui, right?

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:34.865
You mean Ding Youcai's young wife?

00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:37.386
Didn't I say?

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:40.266
I need to check my records.

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:45.145
How come I heard
she's quite close to you?

00:03:46.585 --> 00:03:50.025
She goes to your place
for events and gatherings.

00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:56.705
I'm warning you.

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:59.106
You've lied to us multiple times.

00:04:00.465 --> 00:04:01.976
We now suspect

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:04.824
you're connected to Ding Youcai's death.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:06.106
No.

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:07.986
It has nothing to do with me. Really.

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:10.145
Did that brat Ding Yu say that?

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:13.625
How could that little brat
slander me like that?

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.226
I haven't even brought up his mom...

00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:18.546
I mean, his stepmother
and their little scandal.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.466
Ding Yu and Yu Meigui?

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:24.305
They once borrowed my office
for a gathering.

00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:27.065
I happened to need something
and went back.

00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:29.146
I saw those two in a car...

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:32.706
It isn't official,

00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:36.226
but they're still a son
and his stepmother.

00:04:36.226 --> 00:04:38.385
What kind of people are they?

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.305
So you told Ding Youcai?

00:04:44.106 --> 00:04:46.706
No, I-I didn't.

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:50.026
It's their family business.

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:51.385
I didn't want to meddle.

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:56.305
But I suspect Ding Youcai found out.

00:04:56.906 --> 00:04:59.425
Why else would he
keep beating Yu Meigui?

00:04:59.786 --> 00:05:01.305
So, according to you,

00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.865
Ding Youcai frequently abused Yu Meigui?

00:05:05.528 --> 00:05:10.865
Well, I shouldn't speak ill of the dead.

00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:16.625
But Ding Youcai could be
quite heavy-handed sometimes.

00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:18.265
He hit her during her pregnancy.

00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:20.305
Yu Meigui was pregnant?

00:05:20.706 --> 00:05:21.706
When was that?

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:25.505
About four or five years ago.

00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:26.505
What about the child?

00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:28.146
I heard she miscarried.

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:29.505
Ding Youcai beat her.

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:32.466
You seem to know quite a lot.

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:33.906
You claim you aren't close to her?

00:05:36.425 --> 00:05:38.065
Where is Yu Meigui now?

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.146
I don't know.

00:05:42.106 --> 00:05:44.146
You'd better think carefully
before answering.

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:46.385
I-I really don't know.

00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:49.466
I was actually trying
to find her myself.

00:05:50.865 --> 00:05:54.346
It happens that foreign wives
run off after marriage,

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:57.346
but so many lately isn't normal.

00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.666
So I need to find her and ask.

00:05:59.786 --> 00:06:02.146
That's why I bought the plane ticket.

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:05.986
So you and she were running
the cross-border marriage business?

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:10.385
It's outbound travel. Travel.

00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:18.185
The child's mom is named Yu Meigui.

00:06:21.346 --> 00:06:24.106
You needed the birth certificate
to register the child.

00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:26.786
The birth certificate
lists the mom as Ruan Shihong.

00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:29.706
Her passport number
is identical to Yu Meigui's.

00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:33.986
I find it strange.

00:06:33.986 --> 00:06:37.466
Why did your dad name her Yu Meigui?

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:39.146
Even share your mom's surname.

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:41.226
I named her.

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:43.425
My dad wasn't pleased,

00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:44.986
but he didn't object.

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:48.906
So when did you two start?

00:06:49.706 --> 00:06:51.546
After she lost her first child.

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:55.786
That child was Ding Youcai's, right?

00:07:00.226 --> 00:07:01.706
I called her 'Auntie.'

00:07:02.745 --> 00:07:03.546
She refused,

00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:06.505
said it aged her,
and told me to call her 'Sis.'

00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:11.385
Back then, I did try to see her
as a stepmother.

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:13.656
But she...

00:07:14.904 --> 00:07:16.346
She was too young.

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:19.425
And I... I was too young too.

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:21.026
So you acted on impulse, huh?

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:24.945
Originally, we just had
some mutual affection.

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.346
Sometimes, if we talked a bit more,

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:29.546
my dad would fly into a rage.

00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:31.466
He didn't dare touch me,

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:33.226
so he'd take it out on her.

00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:34.945
Try it.

00:07:35.065 --> 00:07:35.786
Okay.

00:07:41.385 --> 00:07:42.106
Eat more.

00:07:43.226 --> 00:07:44.425
See if it's good.

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:51.146
It's good, right?

00:08:02.505 --> 00:08:03.546
He hit you again?

00:08:09.466 --> 00:08:11.026
Didn't you try to protect her?

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:12.625
Of course I did.

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.305
But whenever I explained
or stood up for her,

00:08:15.505 --> 00:08:18.625
my dad would be even worse to her
when I wasn't around.

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.625
So I took on a lot of part-time jobs,

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.146
trying to avoid being alone with her.

00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:25.706
My dad was always paranoid.

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.906
He never believed the child was his.

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:28.586
So, in the end...

00:08:31.986 --> 00:08:35.586
After that, we got together.

00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:38.025
She wanted me to take her away.

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:39.385
But I...

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.665
Did Ding Youcai find out?

00:08:42.986 --> 00:08:45.586
Honestly, I don't know.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:48.306
At least, he never mentioned it
in front of me.

00:08:49.986 --> 00:08:53.346
Maybe Meigui
was a bit disappointed in me.

00:08:55.306 --> 00:08:58.145
During that time, her relationship
with my dad improved quite a bit.

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:00.186
But not long after,

00:09:01.586 --> 00:09:02.986
my dad had that accident.

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:08.545
Did Yu Meigui act strangely
after it happened?

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:10.745
I don't know.

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:14.946
After I found my dad, I called her.

00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:16.505
Couldn't get through.

00:09:18.986 --> 00:09:20.785
So you didn't call the police
right away?

00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:23.905
You thought Yu Meigui
was the killer, didn't you?

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:27.265
Listen to me!

00:09:29.905 --> 00:09:32.426
We've gathered a lot of evidence.

00:09:34.186 --> 00:09:36.106
If you keep being evasive like this,

00:09:37.186 --> 00:09:39.706
it will only add
to your culpability, understand?

00:09:40.426 --> 00:09:42.066
For that meal my dad didn't finish,

00:09:43.066 --> 00:09:45.385
the lunchbox was brought from home.

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:48.426
That dish tasted just like her hometown.

00:09:48.426 --> 00:09:49.905
No one else could make it.

00:09:51.706 --> 00:09:53.466
After I cleaned that up

00:09:53.466 --> 00:09:56.426
and got home,
I found her luggage was gone.

00:09:57.586 --> 00:09:58.986
Her phone was turned off too.

00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:04.186
I didn't know how to face her.

00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:09.145
I thought, if she's gone, so be it.

00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:12.306
I never expected that one day,

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:15.745
she would come back.

00:10:25.466 --> 00:10:26.145
Ding Yu,

00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:27.986
someone's here for you.

00:10:28.426 --> 00:10:29.186
For me?

00:10:29.186 --> 00:10:29.745
Yeah.

00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:44.905
Meigui?

00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:55.466
A few days
after giving birth to that child,

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:56.265
she left again.

00:10:56.946 --> 00:10:57.986
I didn't look for her.

00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:00.986
I figured she probably
wouldn't come back.

00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:05.745
Didn't you ask her about your dad?

00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:11.186
Haven't you been in touch these years?

00:11:11.426 --> 00:11:12.066
No.

00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:21.785
Raising a child alone
must be really tough.

00:11:23.066 --> 00:11:25.346
Haven't you thought
about finding someone else?

00:11:26.665 --> 00:11:28.426
F-Find someone else?

00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:31.186
Here's the thing.

00:11:33.545 --> 00:11:35.306
I was young back then

00:11:37.826 --> 00:11:39.346
and wasn't able to protect my mom.

00:11:41.706 --> 00:11:43.946
When I grew up,
I couldn't protect her either.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:47.545
And my dad...

00:11:49.265 --> 00:11:50.785
I failed him too.

00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:56.186
I'm not someone reliable.

00:11:57.385 --> 00:11:59.586
So I shouldn't drag anyone else down.

00:12:05.745 --> 00:12:07.346
Come on.

00:12:08.826 --> 00:12:10.826
What are you two talking about?

00:12:11.785 --> 00:12:12.306
You guys eat.

00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:14.066
Don't pry into women's talk.

00:12:14.745 --> 00:12:16.145
I'll go clean the kitchen. Eat up.

00:12:16.545 --> 00:12:17.865
Come on. Let's eat.

00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:21.545
What's with Jing? She seems so happy.

00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:23.265
Just happy for no reason.

00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:24.865
What else could it be?

00:12:30.905 --> 00:12:31.946
Let me ask you something.

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:36.346
Have you noticed Little Qian
being all secretive lately?

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:38.106
On a mission, probably.

00:12:39.265 --> 00:12:40.066
What mission?

00:12:41.586 --> 00:12:42.466
You want to know?

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:47.265
Eat your noodles.

00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:51.306
What?

00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:52.706
Eat your noodles.

00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:57.665
Everyone's being mysterious, huh?

00:12:57.865 --> 00:12:58.466
Okay.

00:13:20.905 --> 00:13:21.946
Here's what we think.

00:13:22.106 --> 00:13:25.625
Bao Hei is sending you to Huashan
for two reasons.

00:13:26.025 --> 00:13:28.145
First, to test Huo and his gang

00:13:28.226 --> 00:13:33.226
and see if they can run safe shipments
to Wannan and Yunxi.

00:13:34.226 --> 00:13:35.466
Second, to test you.

00:13:35.466 --> 00:13:38.025
Bao Hei is interested
in your fake identity.

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:41.466
Someone's been investigating
your background lately.

00:13:41.865 --> 00:13:45.426
We're gradually
identifying everyone involved.

00:13:47.145 --> 00:13:48.905
This mission is extremely challenging.

00:13:49.426 --> 00:13:51.865
You'll face
many unimaginable difficulties.

00:13:53.785 --> 00:13:55.745
You must be extremely cautious.

00:13:56.265 --> 00:13:58.106
Abort the mission if necessary.

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:00.826
Ye,

00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:02.106
safety first.

00:14:04.186 --> 00:14:04.986
Got it.

00:14:23.265 --> 00:14:24.385
Don't get your car wet.

00:14:25.226 --> 00:14:25.986
It's fine.

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:27.946
Where are they?

00:14:28.145 --> 00:14:29.545
Didn't I tell you already?

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:30.586
It's just us today.

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:47.186
Which way?

00:14:48.905 --> 00:14:49.905
Follow the GPS.

00:14:50.426 --> 00:14:51.466
Head toward Huashan first.

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:52.785
I'll guide you when nearer.

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:22.905
Bao Hei insisted those two
go to Huashan alone.

00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:24.145
He's up to no good.

00:15:29.505 --> 00:15:30.265
Madman,

00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:33.586
after eating, come with me
to Huashan for a look.

00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:37.385
That'd openly show Bao Hei
we don't trust him.

00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:39.905
We won't be able to proceed afterward.

00:15:41.145 --> 00:15:42.106
In Qing's opinion,

00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:45.145
Bao Hei mainly wants
to test Ye Qian's capabilities.

00:15:46.226 --> 00:15:47.905
Since he's interested in Ye Qian,

00:15:48.905 --> 00:15:51.865
they probably won't face
any real danger, right?

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:53.665
Nothing serious.

00:15:54.346 --> 00:15:54.986
Perfect.

00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:56.586
While the tail's gone,

00:15:56.946 --> 00:15:58.106
let's handle our business.

00:16:07.346 --> 00:16:07.946
Ziwu.

00:16:09.346 --> 00:16:10.306
Perfect timing.

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.226
The DNA test results are in.

00:16:12.426 --> 00:16:16.025
It's a maternal match between
the unknown female and Ding Yu's child.

00:16:16.186 --> 00:16:19.106
Meaning the texts and calls that night

00:16:19.106 --> 00:16:20.905
were both handled by Yu Meigui?

00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:23.186
Her blood
was on the phone case and buttons.

00:16:23.186 --> 00:16:24.306
She's now the prime suspect.

00:16:24.306 --> 00:16:25.306
- Captain Leng.
- But...

00:16:26.426 --> 00:16:28.785
We had Fang Qihang
contact Yu Meigui as you instructed.

00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:30.426
Yu Meigui is now on a flight to Yunxi.

00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:31.466
She lands in two hours.

00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:33.265
What did you just say?

00:16:33.265 --> 00:16:34.025
See for yourself.

00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:34.706
Okay.

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:35.466
Let's go.

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:36.186
We're off, Zhang.

00:16:58.665 --> 00:16:59.905
Captain Leng, heads up.

00:17:00.265 --> 00:17:02.025
Yu Meigui is exiting through Gate 2 now.

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:04.226
Copy that.

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:35.025

Captain Leng,

00:22:53.906 --> 00:22:55.545
I asked the property management.

00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:57.025
They recognized Yu Meigui

00:22:57.025 --> 00:22:59.545
as the tenant of Unit 202, Building 1.

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.146
She's rented here for years.

00:23:01.386 --> 00:23:02.545
Also, they mentioned

00:23:02.545 --> 00:23:04.265
that apartment
likely houses many people.

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:06.345
New faces are constantly
coming and going.

00:23:06.345 --> 00:23:07.785
All relatively young women.

00:23:08.466 --> 00:23:12.105
Notify the precinct
to send female officers.

00:23:12.305 --> 00:23:13.825
Foreigners might be involved.

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:14.226
Okay.

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:15.305
Give them a heads-up.

00:23:15.466 --> 00:23:16.386
- Okay.
- Go now.

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:24.706
Didn't I already tell you?

00:23:25.706 --> 00:23:26.505
Where are you from?

00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:31.386
When did you arrive?

00:23:32.585 --> 00:23:33.545
I don't remember.

00:23:44.146 --> 00:23:44.946
Yu Meigui,

00:23:44.946 --> 00:23:48.585
a marriage scam for financial gain
is a crime in our country,

00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:49.345
you know?

00:23:51.505 --> 00:23:53.305
How can you call that a scam?

00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:56.946
We followed the legal requirements

00:23:57.345 --> 00:24:00.505
and got legally married
as soon as we entered the country.

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:04.065
The law guarantees freedom of marriage

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:06.305
and protects women's rights.

00:24:07.706 --> 00:24:12.426
Besides, matters of the heart
are always mutual.

00:24:13.146 --> 00:24:15.105
The girls want to leave
because they're unwilling.

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:19.505
Your government should be protecting us.

00:24:21.505 --> 00:24:24.545
Shouldn't divorce be handled
at the marriage registration office?

00:24:26.105 --> 00:24:27.906
If parting ways could be that easy,

00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:29.906
why go to all this trouble?

00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:33.386
After all, I was the one
who introduced them.

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.585
I have to take some responsibility.

00:24:35.946 --> 00:24:39.025
Whenever they encounter those
who like to get violent,

00:24:39.265 --> 00:24:40.825
and the marriage becomes unbearable,

00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:44.545
I need to give them an escape route

00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:45.906
and a safety net.

00:24:47.386 --> 00:24:50.545
That must be a lesson learned
from your own experience, right?

00:24:55.866 --> 00:24:57.946
We've found Ding Youcai.

00:25:03.626 --> 00:25:04.745
Do you remember him?

00:25:07.025 --> 00:25:08.906
We've also found that taxi.

00:25:10.025 --> 00:25:12.745
Ding Yu cleaned that car back then.

00:25:14.105 --> 00:25:16.946
But some evidence can't be washed away.

00:25:20.745 --> 00:25:24.146
Don't you want to know
what Ding Yu said?

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:33.226
No matter what Ding Yu said,

00:25:34.505 --> 00:25:35.706
I didn't kill Ding Youcai.

00:25:44.426 --> 00:25:49.146
That day, we girls from the same place
were having a gathering.

00:25:50.426 --> 00:25:52.345
Midway through,
I got a call from Ding Youcai.

00:25:52.345 --> 00:25:53.305
He told me to see him.

00:25:57.545 --> 00:26:00.946
He sounded drunk on the phone.

00:26:01.466 --> 00:26:02.906
He seemed agitated.

00:26:05.226 --> 00:26:06.305
I didn't want to go.

00:26:07.305 --> 00:26:10.585
But I knew if I pissed him off,

00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:13.785
I'd be the one getting hurt
when he lashed out.

00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:15.906
So I went.

00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:19.785
When I got there...

00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:10.065
I never deleted the photo.

00:27:11.105 --> 00:27:13.745
I kept it, thinking
it might be useful someday.

00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:16.706
Why not call the police?

00:27:17.666 --> 00:27:19.305
I was afraid the police
would suspect me.

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:21.304
Mainly because

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:24.792
my visa wasn't
exactly compliant back then.

00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:27.706
I didn't want to go.

00:27:29.105 --> 00:27:30.505
So you went to Ding Yu?

00:27:33.025 --> 00:27:34.386
Ding Yu suspected me too.

00:27:36.205 --> 00:27:37.505
But he wouldn't call the police.

00:27:38.305 --> 00:27:39.146
I knew that.

00:27:41.146 --> 00:27:43.825
I used Ding Youcai's phone to call him.

00:27:59.608 --> 00:28:01.304
(Ding Yu)

00:28:19.032 --> 00:28:21.464
(Cover my shift in South City)

00:28:54.105 --> 00:28:57.626
Later, I went to stay
with the other girls here.

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.105
About the photo,

00:29:03.928 --> 00:29:05.226
had you seen this person before?

00:29:08.466 --> 00:29:11.745
I-It was too dark that night,

00:29:12.785 --> 00:29:14.386
and I was too nervous.

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.146
I couldn't see clearly.

00:29:16.706 --> 00:29:19.626
One photo alone
doesn't clear you of suspicion.

00:29:19.825 --> 00:29:21.745
Plus, you had a motive
to kill Ding Youcai.

00:29:22.545 --> 00:29:23.666
It really wasn't me.

00:29:30.946 --> 00:29:32.186
Fang Qihang.

00:29:33.186 --> 00:29:33.906
Why?

00:29:34.025 --> 00:29:35.386
Fang Qihang. It should be him.

00:29:36.105 --> 00:29:38.345
D-Ding Youcai paid 100,000 to buy me.

00:29:38.466 --> 00:29:40.745
But my bride price,

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:43.706
the fees, and the tolls
shouldn't have totaled more than 50,000.

00:29:43.946 --> 00:29:46.745
Fang Qihang pocketed the other 50,000.

00:29:48.545 --> 00:29:51.025
Fang Qihang, you liar!

00:29:51.345 --> 00:29:53.105
That woman's only worth 50,000.

00:29:53.226 --> 00:29:54.626
And you charged me 100,000?

00:29:55.105 --> 00:29:56.585
Don't let me find you.

00:29:56.785 --> 00:29:59.065
If I find you, I'll kill you!

00:30:03.226 --> 00:30:03.906
Let's go.

00:30:04.585 --> 00:30:05.688
Let's settle this with him.

00:30:06.008 --> 00:30:06.706
Move!

00:30:08.825 --> 00:30:10.305
Have you seen that knife?

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:16.345
Ding Youcai used that thing
to scare me plenty.

00:30:17.825 --> 00:30:19.386
Sometimes when he was in a bad mood,

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:21.825
he'd threaten me with it.

00:30:22.866 --> 00:30:24.600
He wouldn't dare act up
if Ding Yu's there.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:29.825
Did you touch Ding Youcai's body?

00:30:33.186 --> 00:30:34.706
Ding Youcai was afraid I'd run away.

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:38.986
He always kept my passport
and residence permit on him.

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:43.745
That night when I went to get them,

00:30:43.745 --> 00:30:44.706
I was so scared.

00:30:45.025 --> 00:30:47.626
I even cut my hand on his zipper pull.

00:30:57.345 --> 00:30:58.906
The DNA test results are in.

00:30:59.186 --> 00:31:02.785
It's a maternal match between
the unknown female and Ding Yu's child.

00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:05.825
Meaning the texts and calls that night

00:31:05.825 --> 00:31:07.666
were both handled by Yu Meigui?

00:31:07.986 --> 00:31:09.866
Her blood
was on the phone case and buttons.

00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:10.986
She's now the prime suspect.

00:31:21.785 --> 00:31:22.426
Hungry?

00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:24.226
Want to eat something?

00:31:24.866 --> 00:31:26.505
But there are only instant noodles here.

00:31:26.986 --> 00:31:29.105
Or should we drive a bit further

00:31:29.146 --> 00:31:30.466
and eat once we reach the city?

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:32.666
Instant noodles are fine.

00:31:33.226 --> 00:31:33.866
Okay.

00:31:34.946 --> 00:31:35.785
Add a sausage.

00:31:36.585 --> 00:31:37.265
Okay.

00:31:40.986 --> 00:31:41.505
Ma'am,

00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:42.745
one sausage

00:31:42.906 --> 00:31:44.146
(Through the pain, no tears fall)
and two instant noodles.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.190
(You promised to grow old with me)
How much?

00:31:45.505 --> 00:31:46.386
Eighteen yuan.

00:31:50.904 --> 00:31:52.856
(One more moment, just hold me)

00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:02.785
Sir,

00:32:02.986 --> 00:32:04.105
I want to sing a song.

00:32:04.626 --> 00:32:05.585
Sure. What song?

00:32:10.426 --> 00:32:11.426
What do you like?

00:32:52.505 --> 00:32:53.265
Chen Yumo,

00:32:54.666 --> 00:32:57.666
I want to go to the same college as you.

00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:00.265
I want it too.

00:33:03.785 --> 00:33:05.345
What did you say? I didn't hear it.

00:33:05.345 --> 00:33:06.065
Say it again.

00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:07.785
Never mind.

00:33:08.986 --> 00:33:09.825
I heard it.

00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:11.386
You said you want it too, right?

00:33:11.585 --> 00:33:12.345
Nonsense.

00:33:12.706 --> 00:33:13.345
You said it.

00:33:13.666 --> 00:33:14.186
I heard it.

00:33:14.186 --> 00:33:14.706
I didn't.

00:33:14.706 --> 00:33:15.466
I heard it.

00:33:15.745 --> 00:33:16.666
I didn't say it.

00:33:17.144 --> 00:33:18.226
You said you like me too.

00:33:18.906 --> 00:33:19.466
I didn't.

00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:20.025
You said.

00:33:20.426 --> 00:33:21.345
You misheard me.

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:22.466
I didn't say it.

00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:32.505
Where were you then?

00:33:32.866 --> 00:33:33.906
I couldn't find you.

00:33:37.666 --> 00:33:38.986
I wanted to find you.

00:33:39.825 --> 00:33:41.186
But my dad wouldn't let me go out.

00:33:42.466 --> 00:33:43.345
Not sincere enough.

00:33:43.946 --> 00:33:45.906
Couldn't you have found a way to go out?

00:33:46.745 --> 00:33:48.666
Besides, didn't you have your phone?

00:33:48.986 --> 00:33:50.305
Your dad took it too?

00:33:53.226 --> 00:33:54.025
Yeah.

00:33:55.706 --> 00:33:57.505
But I still managed to sneak out.

00:33:58.305 --> 00:33:59.505
On the day you moved.

00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:36.346
Yumo? Yumo.

00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:38.105
Yumo!

00:34:39.386 --> 00:34:40.266
Yumo!

00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:43.225
Yumo!

00:34:47.665 --> 00:34:48.386
Yumo!

00:34:51.306 --> 00:34:51.986
Yumo!

00:35:17.346 --> 00:35:19.306
Did you become a cop out of guilt?

00:35:30.826 --> 00:35:31.866
You felt

00:35:33.065 --> 00:35:34.025
guilty toward me.

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.225
You wanted to help me

00:35:36.866 --> 00:35:37.866
and protect me.

00:35:40.386 --> 00:35:41.065
Is that right?

00:36:00.786 --> 00:36:01.505
Forget it.

00:36:03.346 --> 00:36:04.786
It's been so long.

00:36:06.105 --> 00:36:07.185
I've let it go.

00:36:09.386 --> 00:36:10.266
You should too.

00:36:15.025 --> 00:36:16.065
As for now,

00:36:17.025 --> 00:36:20.025
we'll each get what we need.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.960
Good working with you.

00:36:37.305 --> 00:36:38.185
Good working with you.

00:36:40.625 --> 00:36:42.225
I've clarified the photo.

00:36:42.225 --> 00:36:43.705
Yu Meigui has a point.

00:36:43.866 --> 00:36:45.466
Judging by the height and build,

00:36:45.665 --> 00:36:47.505
this person does look a lot
like Fang Qihang,

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.585
especially with him
rolling up his sleeves.

00:36:49.705 --> 00:36:51.786
Even the height matches Fang Qihang's.

00:36:51.946 --> 00:36:52.545
Captain Leng,

00:36:53.386 --> 00:36:54.946
we verified with the telecom company.

00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:57.986
Yu Meigui did receive Ding Youcai's call
during the crime window.

00:36:58.065 --> 00:37:01.585
Her claim about attending
a hometown gathering was also confirmed.

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:05.505
The incident where Fang Qihang scammed
Ding Youcai out of 50,000 is also true.

00:37:05.786 --> 00:37:07.625
Fang Qihang
had a business partner back then.

00:37:07.786 --> 00:37:08.826
According to him,

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:10.746
Fang Qihang started
by scamming acquaintances.

00:37:10.746 --> 00:37:12.786
His earliest clients
were all people he knew.

00:37:12.786 --> 00:37:14.625
Ding Youcai wasn't the only one
he scammed.

00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:18.466
Plus, Ding Youcai repeatedly
visited their office to make threats

00:37:18.466 --> 00:37:19.786
to sue Fang Qihang for fraud.

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:23.466
Yu Meigui's blood was found
on the victim's phone case and buttons.

00:37:23.705 --> 00:37:26.466
I thought she cut herself
while stabbing with the push dagger.

00:37:27.225 --> 00:37:30.025
But she said it happened while unzipping
his jacket to find her ID.

00:37:30.386 --> 00:37:32.705
She didn't deliberately
hide this crucial detail.

00:37:33.746 --> 00:37:37.065
Plus, piercing a skull barehanded
requires immense strength.

00:37:38.466 --> 00:37:41.145
Given her physical condition,
Yu Meigui couldn't have done it.

00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:44.705
So if that's the case.

00:37:44.705 --> 00:37:48.946
Ding Yu, Yu Meigui, and Fang Qihang
are all suspects.

00:37:48.946 --> 00:37:52.545
But our current evidence
can't confirm or rule out anyone.

00:37:54.946 --> 00:37:56.346
I have an idea.

00:38:01.065 --> 00:38:01.906
The rain stopped.

00:38:11.266 --> 00:38:12.065
A rainbow.

00:39:00.145 --> 00:39:00.946
Number one.

00:39:02.585 --> 00:39:03.386
Push dagger.

00:39:04.946 --> 00:39:06.386
Cooperate with us for an experiment.

00:39:07.266 --> 00:39:08.946
Right back of the head. Stab hard.

00:39:55.866 --> 00:39:56.786
Is this okay?

00:39:57.426 --> 00:39:58.225
That's enough.

00:40:08.185 --> 00:40:08.986
Number two.

00:40:13.105 --> 00:40:14.466
Please cooperate with us.

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:16.105
Right back of the head. Stab hard.

00:40:50.065 --> 00:40:50.866
Number three.

00:40:55.545 --> 00:40:57.145
Please cooperate with us.

00:40:57.145 --> 00:40:57.866
Officer,

00:40:58.025 --> 00:40:59.266
is this really necessary?

00:41:00.225 --> 00:41:01.346
It really wasn't me.

00:41:01.346 --> 00:41:03.266
T-This is so unlucky.

00:41:04.625 --> 00:41:06.545
Right back of the head. Stab hard.

00:41:52.585 --> 00:41:53.866
Wait, look.

00:41:53.866 --> 00:41:56.185
I really don't know
how to use this thing.

00:41:57.185 --> 00:41:58.545
The clear need no clearing.

00:41:58.866 --> 00:41:59.906
You look a bit guilty.

00:42:06.306 --> 00:42:07.105
