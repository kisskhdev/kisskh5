00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.960
{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.200
But I realized

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.480
they weren't just meeting secretly.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.200
They were plotting.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.760
Sure enough,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.560
in the clothes he kept close to him,
I found a delicate wooden box.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.400
Inside it were two pills.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.840
They're Breath-Stopping Pills.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.240
I didn't know
what they were planning next,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.760
but I was terrified.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.760
It had to be that woman's idea!

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.920
So that day, in front of Prince of Xin,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.840
you knocked over the drink and pastries

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.520
because you recognized that vial

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.919
and knew what was inside.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280
I never thought
you'd really find that poison.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.360
I know you're testing me.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.800
But even if it exposes me,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.040
I won't let Prince of Xin
be tricked into drinking that poison.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.880
I'm sure you know too

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.400
that butterfly box
was made from Annan rattan.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.520
I did all of this alone.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.960
I won't let that woman
drag Prince of Xin down.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.600
Prince of Xin must have earned
a lot of merit in his last life

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.560
to have you guard him like this.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.440
But to slip this drug
without anyone noticing

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.200
into the Imperial Medical Office's
decoction for Lady Wang,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.720
you couldn't do it alone.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.960
Mr. Xiao, don't underestimate me.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.960
Our masters may be high and mighty,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440
but when they truly need something done,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.240
they must still rely
on lowly servants like us.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.880
Where are you going?

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.080
Jinghe killed someone.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.560
The evidence is conclusive.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.480
Kill her or punish her, it's up to you.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.240
But as for Zheng,
I'll find out from him myself

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.440
what happened to him.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.480
Secretly meeting
a consort is a grave crime.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.240
We can't let palace servants frame him.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.040
Jinghe spins a fine tale,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120
even she finds it moving.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.600
Too bad it's only the prologue.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.920
Your story hasn't been told yet.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.560
How could I let you go now?

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.320
This is life or death.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.720
Don't play games!

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.240
Why is this wretch here?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.640
Are you shielding a murderer?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.160
Calm down.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.400
You recognize this ruan, don't you?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.560
You gave it to Lady Wang.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.360
She probably didn't like it.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.360
She never even touched it once.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.360
Poison, butterflies, candles.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.320
Those were done by Jinghe.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.320
But she wasn't behind it all.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.640
It was never her.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.240
You admire Prince of Xin.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.399
How could you bear
to kill the one he loves?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.640
But a mother is different.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.760
As his mother,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.120
how could you not notice that Prince Xin's
frequent trips to the palace

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.320
weren't about filial piety?

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.560
He wanted to see someone else.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.280
Killing Yushu was your decision.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.920
You knew Jinghe adored Prince of Xin.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.400
Even if she wanted to keep his secret,

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.360
she couldn't withstand your questioning.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.040
No. It was me.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.520
I betrayed Prince of Xin.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.160
CULTIVATE SERENITY WITHIN

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.760
When Consort Wei
learned Prince of Xin's secret,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.920
it was a weight off my mind.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.080
Prince of Xin admitted
to secretly meeting Lady Wang.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.000
As for the rest,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.960
he didn't say a word.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.640
How could you allow a lowly maid
to set her sights on Prince of Xin?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.640
Even if Jinghe only wanted
to be a concubine?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.160
You sent Jinghe to Prince of Xin.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.800
Because you needed her to spy on him.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.720
And you,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.320
of course, wouldn't turn down
such a sweet deal.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.720
You even knew to repay her kindness.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.760
You brought Consort Wei
the Breath-Stopping Pills.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.760
After you stole them,
Prince of Xin didn't notice?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.080
He noticed soon enough.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.680
I know you're worried about me.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.920
Jinghe,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.360
you don't have to keep kneeling before me
begging for forgiveness.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.440
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.400
We're both just doing

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.160
what we believe is right.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.040
Lady Wang is pregnant.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.080
Mother, help me get her out of the palace.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.960
You…

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.560
You…

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.000
Do you even know what you've done?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.080
You went to see Lady Wang

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.680
not because you admired her talent

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.600
or felt a kinship with her.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.720
Kinship?

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.040
What a bitter joke.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.120
That shameless wretch was truly bold.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.640
She already got pregnant by my Zheng.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.080
No shame at all.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.080
You two worked together so well.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.040
After you killed Lady Wang,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.000
to stop anyone from examining the body,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.560
Consort Wei arranged pine shavings
and a river-willow coffin.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.440
And Jinghe carefully prepared
that pretty box of butterflies.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.080
Even after she died,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720
you still wouldn't let her go.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.160
Then why wouldn't
she let go of Prince of Xin?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.200
I hate to see him lose someone he loves.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.200
But he has been
completely bewitched by her.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.680
To beg Consort Wei,

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.160
he'd rather kneel in the rain
for two hours.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.160
All thanks to Yunxiang Powder.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.680
Yunxiang Powder?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.360
Wasn't it the Breath-Stopping Pill?

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.200
Zheng, why are you up?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.640
What is Yunxiang Powder?

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.720
What did you feed her?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.600
Answer me.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.440
What is Yunxiang Powder?

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.280
It's poison.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.840
Colorless, tasteless.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.120
A poison that kills without a trace.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.400
- Why?
- Because she's a madwoman!

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.720
So she had to die.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.000
I once tried to reason with her.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.360
She wouldn't listen.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.960
I know

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.520
what you were plotting.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.280
Zheng is too naïve.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.640
Your plan

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.559
wasn't clever at all.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.360
We had to try to know.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.080
If you can help us keep the secret,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.200
that would be a merit too.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.120
Merit? No, it's a sin!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.000
Look at you, a mere music girl
from the Music Office,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.760
you became

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.080
a rank-eight Imperial Consort overnight,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.000
assured of comfort for life.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.640
That's a blessing
so many in this deep palace crave.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.600
What could you possibly still want?

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.320
If living is only about a secure life,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.680
that's dreadfully dull.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.360
I don't lack money.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.560
I entered the palace to learn music.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.840
That "blessing" you speak of
means nothing to me.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.960
But to be favored by His Majesty

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.320
is the highest honor.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.480
To you, it's an honor.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.280
To me, it's a cage.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.400
If the price of his favor

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.520
is losing my freedom
for the rest of my life,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.600
then I don't want it.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.320
So you ignore all decency,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.400
for your selfish desire,
and ruin my Zheng for life?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.200
Ignore all decency?

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.480
Selfish desire?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.320
Ruining a life?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.360
With every accusation you throw,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.400
are you describing me
or the Emperor himself?

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.600
His Majesty is old enough to be my father.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.240
On a whim,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.000
he made me an Imperial Consort
and then just dropped me.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.720
I could've left this palace,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.440
but now I can only grow old here, alone.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.200
You're just unwilling

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.880
to accept you lost his favor so quickly.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.600
I'm unwilling to accept my fate,
changed so easily by others!

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.920
Yushu,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.040
have you ever thought

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.040
maybe you want too much?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.680
In this palace,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.200
consorts have no more than that.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.520
If you want wealth and glory,
go fight for his favor.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.960
If you want peace and ease,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.440
stay in your place.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.280
What if I want freedom?

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.360
To be forgotten by His Majesty

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.640
is to be free of the palace's chains.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.680
You like playing the ruan, right?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.440
You live alone in this huge Hanliang Hall.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.640
No one ties you down.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.600
Play whenever you want.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.240
Isn't that freedom too?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.680
For people, freedom is having a choice.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.840
Bending yourself to fit,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.840
finding joy in misery,
it's just lying to yourself!

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.640
Look at you.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.400
So what if you're Consort Wei?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.360
How pitiful.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.760
People are pitiful

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.800
only when they want too much.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.360
Keep to your place,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.560
know what's proper,

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.440
and life will be easy.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.720
All these years,
you've kept to your place.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.440
Not once have you felt wronged?

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.320
Night after night,
being neglected by your husband,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.880
did "knowing what's proper"
really get you through?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.600
I have His Majesty's respect,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.880
and I have my Zheng.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.120
We are not alike,
so let us each go our own way.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.600
I didn't need to tell you this much.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.280
I won't see you out.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.840
You probably think
as long as I don't interfere,

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.400
you can use the Breath-Stopping Pill
to fake your death

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.400
and leave the palace.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.440
But you may not know,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.840
after a consort dies,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.200
the body lies in state
at Mortuary Hall before burial.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.520
The timing and dose of the pill
must be very precise,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.240
or you'll die for real!

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.520
If you wake before the burial,
the guards will find you.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.400
After you're buried,
if no one digs you out in time,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.200
you're as good as buried alive!

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.320
Zheng may be a prince,

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.040
but to secretly move an imperial consort

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.640
and send her away,
you think that would be easy?

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600
During this process,

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.400
a single misstep will cost you your life.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.520
We keep talking to ourselves.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.680
Prince of Xin and I have it all planned.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.240
I'll get away clean.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.040
He doesn't know

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.200
what a mother would do for her child!

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.200
I knew she wouldn't give up easily.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.040
I had people watching her.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.600
But I never imagined

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.240
she'd dare ask a Medical Officer

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.240
to examine her.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.320
Once he examined her…

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.280
HANLIANG HALL

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.920
…her pregnancy would be exposed.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.320
My Zheng would be dragged into it.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.080
She and the child in her belly

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.160
will always be a threat to Zheng.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.480
So she had to die!

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.480
You bribed the Medical Officer

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.880
and slipped Yunxiang Powder
into her pregnancy tonic.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.920
Yes.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.120
Then you deceived
Prince of Xin into believing

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.680
you'd help Yushu flee by faking her death.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.040
But Yushu took too much
of the Breath-Stopping Pill

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.400
and never woke up.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.440
Yes.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.360
Mother.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.840
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.520
Zheng,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.840
you're too honest, too soft-hearted.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.720
That's why people can fool you.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.360
That woman doesn't love you!

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.920
She's only using you!

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.320
Forget her. Forget all of this.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.320
In the future, you'll have
a proper princess consort,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.600
and you'll have a child with a clean name.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.080
Did you ever think

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.800
why Yushu would dare
ask the Medical Officer to examine her?

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.720
Either she was foolish

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.320
or she meant to threaten me
and get back at me!

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.000
But either way, she deserved to die!

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.920
No…

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.520
No…

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.000
I was the foolish one.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.880
Zheng,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.400
what did she do to you?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.920
Of all the women in the world,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.200
why do you cling to her alone?

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.080
All my life,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.240
inside these palace walls,

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.640
I've never met a woman as vibrant as her.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.680
The first time I saw her
at the Music Office,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.760
I fell for her.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.720
I knew what her heart longed for
wasn't something I could give.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.040
What she wanted was a life of freedom,

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.680
traveling the world with a ruan.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.240
So I never dared to wish for more.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.800
To share moments sparring over melodies…

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.720
IN VIRTUE LIES TRUE NOBILITY

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.240
…weaving lyrics and tunes,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.120
that was blessing enough.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.320
I knew she would soon be free
of her service and the palace.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.440
I hated to see her go,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.040
but I was truly happy for her.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.720
The life she dreamed of
was the life I wanted too.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.160
I couldn't have it.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.840
If she could see it for me,
that was enough.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.840
Until that day.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.280
Father took Yushu to bed.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.040
Where is Yushu?

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.120
In that moment, my world spun.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.400
The one I loved lost her freedom for good.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.560
I knew what all of this meant to her.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.480
But he was my father,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.520
the reigning emperor.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.600
There was nothing I could do.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.720
- Zheng.
- Your Highness.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.680
Zheng, what's wrong?

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.240
Thank you.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.560
After that,

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.640
Yushu moved to Hanliang Hall.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.119
And Father vanished from her life.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.319
Whenever I entered the palace,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.040
I'd take a detour
and stop behind Hanliang Hall.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.960
I just wanted to see
that patch of sky above her.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.360
HANLIANG HALL

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.080
If I was lucky,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.960
I'd even hear her ruan.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.400
I could hear all her bitterness and pain.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.640
Later,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.680
she realized she was pregnant

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.600
and wanted even more
to leave this deep palace.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.640
Yushu…

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.040
Your Highness, help me.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.320
Please rise.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800
What's the matter?

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.920
She said… she had lost the will to live.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.800
But the child became her reason

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.760
to go on living.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.520
She could see
the sorrow of women in the harem,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.360
and she could also see

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.800
how even an imperial son is bound by fate.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.080
She didn't want her child
to bear any of it.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.720
She wanted to run.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.840
Do you remember

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.920
Princess Zhaosi faking
her death at the Lantern Festival?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720
What are you trying to do?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.240
I wish to do the same.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.320
After that,

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.320
I found a way to get
the Breath-Stopping Pill.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.080
Yushu and I planned everything,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.240
but Jinghe and Mother found out.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.880
Mother is usually cautious,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.720
but if she knew that child was mine,

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.720
she would've helped me.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.840
I just never thought

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.280
I'd get Yushu killed because of it.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.440
You didn't kill Yushu.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.120
Consort Wei did.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.520
And the one she killed

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.800
wasn't just a selected lady,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.040
but an imperial heir too.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.840
An imperial heir?

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.680
A bastard who can't
be brought into the light,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.720
and you call it an imperial heir?

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360
Mother.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.080
That's not true.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.800
Even now,

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.920
you still want to protect her?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.320
That child was a mistake,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.560
a sin.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.560
Are you still going to hide it?

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.440
I'll ask you again.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.280
Why did Yushu dare ask
the Medical Officer to examine her?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.160
Because that child was His Majesty's.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.680
Heaven sees all.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.400
Lady Wang's body was burned,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.200
but that only made
the innocent child's bones come to light.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.920
The fetus's bones had formed.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.400
That means Yushu
was at least four months pregnant.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.240
Yushu used to love drinking.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.880
But we investigated.
The maids at Hanliang Hall said

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.360
less than a month after her investiture,

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.840
she stopped drinking to drown her sorrows.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.000
She used to drink to drown her sorrows.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.320
But later, we never saw her drink again.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.520
Back then, she already realized
she was pregnant.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.720
Less than a month

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.680
after her investiture?

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.320
Jinghe, you care so much
about Prince of Xin.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.840
You should know exactly

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.360
when he started meeting her
at Cheng'en Palace.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.600
It's…

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.760
two months ago.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.520
That's right.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.040
The "haunting" rumors at Cheng'en Palace
started two months ago.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.640
Two months ago,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.640
when Lady Wang met Prince of Xin,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.000
she was already three months pregnant.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.520
Yet you never once doubted
Prince of Xin's lies.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.960
That Medical Officer
you bribed and threatened

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.560
must have known how far along she was.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.120
But you only worried about Prince of Xin

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.920
and never asked about the fetus.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.440
You killed her in haste!

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.680
When she was murdered,
the fetus was already five months along,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.040
already shaped like a child.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.080
I didn't know…

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.040
I didn't know…

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.240
Zheng…

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.120
You lied to me.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.520
Why did you lie to me?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.040
But the Imperial Medical Office
has no record.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.080
So who can prove
her child was His Majesty's?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.560
She slept with someone else
and got pregnant with a bastard.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.680
She used Zheng's soft heart
to try to flee the palace.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.120
She almost led my Zheng
into a grave mistake!

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.640
I did it for the royal family's honor.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.520
I did it for my child. That's why…

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.440
- Mother!
- That's why I did it!

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.920
Yushu did it for her child too.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.720
To get the child out of the palace,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.400
she was willing to risk her life.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.520
But because of what you said,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.960
for her child,
she could even give up her freedom.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.440
She had already decided

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.320
to spend her whole life
trapped in this palace.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.960
If the Medical Officer truthfully reports
the fetus's age,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.240
that would prove the child

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.320
was Father's.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.160
But you…

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.880
But I…

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.840
But I'm a mother too. A mother!

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.200
Now, the truth is clear.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.920
Your Ladyship, close the case.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.560
This case… How should it end?

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.360
You plotted against Lady Wang,
poisoned an imperial heir.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.000
And to hide your crimes,
you framed me and Mr. Xiao for an affair.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.800
Consort Wei, will you take it all,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.120
or share some
with Prince of Xin and Jinghe?

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.440
I have no guilt to admit.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.680
Fine move.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.720
Jinghe was the perfect scapegoat.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.280
Even if you walk away unscathed,
what about Prince of Xin?

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.680
What does that have to do with him?

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.680
The sachet he wears every day

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.480
was made by Lady Wang.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.440
It may prove little, but that's enough.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.320
I learned that from you.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.560
What happened doesn't matter.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.680
What His Majesty thinks happened
matters most.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.440
So you want revenge.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.320
You want to drag me down together, huh?

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.280
If we can't settle this,
we can talk about something else.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.920
What?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.360
Prince of Xin fell at his residence

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.240
and hurt himself.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.400
You're trying to clear that wretch?

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.520
No chance.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.560
She dared to murder an imperial son.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.760
She must die!

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.920
You're right.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.040
Whoever dares murder
an imperial son must die.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.200
IN VIRTUE LIES TRUE NOBILITY

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.520
Your Ladyship,
if you get to see Prince of Xin,

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.680
could you tell him I'm sorry?

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.720
Funny.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.240
He asked me to apologize to you too.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.320
That night, I dreamed of Yushu.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.560
She wanted us to live on.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.840
Where's your pipa?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.160
All of them were from the Music Office.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.200
I don't want to take
a single thing from this palace.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.480
What a pity.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.080
Her Ladyship went to such trouble
to find this pipa,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.040
a hundred-year-old one.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.040
What now?

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.280
A hundred years ago,
Xingqing Palace didn't exist.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.600
So it doesn't count as palace property.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.760
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.280
Thank you, miss.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.440
Listen to her. Live on and live well.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.600
Did you plan this all along

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.080
to save Ahao by hiding the truth?

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.320
Consort Wei can twist things to her will,

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.760
but one thing she said was right.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.160
No one can prove
Yushu's child was His Majesty's.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.920
If this stirs up trouble,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.560
the only one we can convict

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.680
is Jinghe, who framed you and me.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.320
Consort Wei will still walk away clean.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.120
If His Majesty grows suspicious,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.280
the one doubted and blamed
will be Prince of Xin.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.640
With a truth this murky,

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.360
it's better to trade it for Ahao's life.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.040
That's true.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.280
The truth coming out

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.720
isn't always the best ending.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.840
What story did Consort Wei make up
to report to His Majesty?

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.640
"Consort Wei loves music,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.440
and she and Lady Wang bonded over it.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.080
Who knew Lady Wang
only wanted to leave the palace,

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.360
and even asked Consort Wei for help?

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.760
Consort Wei tried
her best to dissuade her,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.640
but Yushu had made up her mind.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.120
She insisted on faking her death.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.320
To spare His Majesty any shame,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.880
Consort Wei had no choice
but to put her to death in grief."

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.840
And what of our "scandal"
at Cheng'en Palace?

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.840
That night, I didn't go there,

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.320
but you and Wuren showed up there.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.760
You'd been investigating for days,
exhausted, and fell asleep.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.240
Eunuch Liu
had been humiliated by you before.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.160
He held a grudge,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.000
so he made up a pack of lies
and spread it everywhere

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.640
to ruin your name.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.560
And Consort Wei had him beaten to death.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.040
For one life, one can make up a lie.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.560
To cover a lie, one can sacrifice a life.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.920
Mr. Xiao, I say this case
isn't worth investigating.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.760
PRINCE OF XIN'S MANSION

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.720
Your Highness…

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.720
I…

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.040
Scold me. Or hit me if you want.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.880
Just don't leave me.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.520
Don't worry.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.480
Since I promised Mother
to bring you into this residence,

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.400
I won't abandon you.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.000
Everything in this residence,

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.760
you may use as you like.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.480
But…

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.080
I truly can't stay here any longer.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.760
I used to think

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.840
none of us were wrong.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.160
Mother wanted to protect me.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.120
She wasn't wrong.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.040
I wanted to help Yushu.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.760
I wasn't wrong either.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.640
And you,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.960
for a hopeless love,

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.840
gave everything willingly.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.800
You weren't wrong.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.320
But now I feel

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.800
we were all wrong.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.880
Your Highness…

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.640
I thought you were unaware of my feelings.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.600
I thought you always saw me as a servant,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.480
a concubine bound by duty.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.440
So you knew everything…

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.240
Jinghe,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.640
I understand

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.320
how you feel.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.440
But she'll never know

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.080
my feelings again.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.360
Your Highness…

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.120
I'm sorry.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.120
Jinghe,

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.600
live on and live well.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.080
Be good to yourself.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.360
Your Highness…

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920
Your Highness!

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.080
Your Highness!

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.760
Your Highness!

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.560
Your Highness!

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.880
Lately, I haven't seen you as often.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.240
State affairs have been heavy.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.600
Yet Your Majesty still
troubles yourself to visit me.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.520
It's my fault.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.400
If Your Majesty won't blame me
for Lady Wang's case,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.440
I already…

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.880
feel deeply grateful for Your grace.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.840
She brought it on herself.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.800
As consorts, we should keep to our place.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.280
How could she think
she can enter the palace for favor,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.320
then run away for freedom?

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.320
If she had really pulled it off,

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.880
she would've set the worst example.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.880
The entire harem would be in chaos.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.080
This concubine lacks ability,

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.480
but this is all I can do
to help Your Majesty

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.440
keep the rules and hold the balance.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.480
It's getting late. Come.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.240
Let's dine together.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.080
CHENXIANG PAVILION

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.800
My lady, look!

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.240
Bad luck!

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.680
Your Majesty, please step back!

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.040
Guards!

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.720
Save Consort Wei!

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.040
Protect His Majesty!

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.400
Protect His Majesty!

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.800
Help!

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.680
Help!

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.920
Help!

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.560
Help…

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.200
Help…

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.920
- You useless idiot!
- Consort Wei! Are you alright?

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.000
Your Majesty…

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.000
My face…

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.200
- You…
- My face…

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.880
My face…

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.720
My face…

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.280
Boss! Something happened
to Consort Wei yesterday.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.400
Consort Shu wants you to check it out.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.160
What happened?

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.480
You know the Night-Wandering Maiden?

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.720
The ghost-bird crow?

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.440
Yesterday, they clawed Consort Wei's face
right in front of His Majesty.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.360
Since when did my bureau start exorcising?

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.000
First, they had me
investigate the ghost infant,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.080
now it's a ghost bird. I'm not going.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.800
Boss, that bird isn't an ordinary bird.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.800
They say they're turned
from pregnant women

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.560
who died with a grievance.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.160
Now everyone says Consort Wei is linked

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.360
to the ghost infant case.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.960
Does Consort Wei keep the outfit
she wore that day?

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.520
I asked.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.480
She said it was bad luck,
so she had it burned later.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.880
This season, crows crave lovefruit.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.520
Consort Wei favors bright colors.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.480
Someone stained her clothes
with lovefruit juice

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.440
without her realizing.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.120
When the crows flew home,
drawn by the lovefruit scent,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.800
they attacked Consort Wei.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.680
That's the truth
of the "Night-Wandering Maiden."

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.800
Then let's investigate
the Imperial Wardrobe Service.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.280
All laundry goes through there.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.560
Your Ladyship, Consort Shu
asked you to investigate this.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.639
There's a record of who washed
Consort Wei's clothes.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.560
We'll find out.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.440
No need.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.520
When did you get transferred
to the laundry?

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:30.280
After Hanliang Hall was "haunted,"

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.000
Ruisheng and I applied to transfer out.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.120
So Ruisheng is in the laundry too?

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.520
She got transferred
to the Imperial Food Service.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.679
So, she stole the fruit,
and you starched the clothes.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.560
You really worked well together.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.159
You usually look dull,

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:55.760
but this time, you were clever.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.120
So what now?

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.240
What can we do?

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.160
The only evidence

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.400
that the clothes were tampered with
was burned by Consort Wei.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.120
There's nothing left to investigate.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.200
Heaven is watching, and karma's real.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.480
Who can predict?

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.360
Come on. Let's report to Consort Shu.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.440
These mysteries are beyond my reach.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.920
Stay for dinner tonight.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.600
I had them make lamb.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.080
His Majesty will come too.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.920
His Majesty gets annoyed
just seeing me. I'm not staying.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.760
As for your marriage, His Majesty
is letting the matter drop.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.440
The eunuchs and maids who spread rumors
have all been slapped and expelled.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.960
You're still His Majesty's
most spoiled child.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.880
Consort Wei's crime

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.000
was quietly pressed down.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.120
If His Majesty doesn't want to hear it,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.640
how could word ever get out?

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.880
Peiyi…

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.440
This storm

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.800
has settled.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.600
Prince of Xin took a hard assignment

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.120
and asked leave to travel away.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.680
After the crow incident,
Consort Wei went mad.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.440
She's recovering at Qinghui Palace
and can't return without summons.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.680
Prince of Xin's concubine
has died by her own hand to atone.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.120
So you can say you got justice
for Lady Wang.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.120
She died by her own hand?

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.040
That justice wasn't won by me.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.480
And who has truly ever gotten justice?

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.280
The innocent die for nothing.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.160
Those who take the blame die of guilt.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.720
Those who love freedom
clip their own wings.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.480
Those who are bound
spin their own cocoons.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.960
I can uncover the truth,
but I can't find justice.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.800
SWALLOW HOUSE

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.560
Have you heard?

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.600
Our marriage is set aside.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.960
As I said, I wouldn't drag you down.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.680
- So this was your plan too?
- What?

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.480
Being trapped with me for a night,
the rumors spreading,

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.800
and drawing Consort Wei out?

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.360
You think too highly of me.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.520
If I could foresee things,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.960
I wouldn't have to make you play
the fortuneteller every time.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.480
You and I have been
through life and death.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.600
I don't want to owe you.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.120
Between two people,

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.000
debts of the heart are inevitable.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.720
Connection breeds debts,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.120
and debts foster connection.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.600
If you desire no further debts at all…

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.640
then we must part for good
and sever all ties.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.280
You're trying to scare me?

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.240
I don't know which of your words are true
and which are false.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.640
I only said what was in my heart.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.400
What I said that day

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.360
was to upset your father.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.960
He really spoke too harshly.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.280
It's fine. It's all in the past.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.080
I knew it. You were
eavesdropping that day!

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.840
You were discussing
our marriage in my house.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.080
How is that eavesdropping?

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.560
You were eavesdropping, anyway.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.520
I…

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.680
Harsh words cut deepest.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.080
You spoke pretty harshly too.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.200
And you pretended you heard nothing

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.560
and acted normal
while solving cases with me.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.560
That was for the bigger picture.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.120
You weren't secretly hurt, were you?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.960
Don't make yourself too important.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.600
Why is your forehead wound
healing so slowly?

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.280
You're not tending to it properly,
just to make me feel pity for you?

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.080
Utter… Utter nonsense!

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.520
Ridiculous.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.880
Fine.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.960
It was my fault. I apologize to you.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.840
No need. I don't accept.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.920
Petty.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.000
Listen!

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.880
See? This tune sounds best
outside the palace.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.880
May we all have fewer regrets.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.640
You look well.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.680
Thanks to Your Majesty's concern,
I recovered this quickly.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.320
After your illness,

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.800
you look even younger and prettier.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.640
I wouldn't dare compete with you.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.080
Today's lip rouge really suits you.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.800
Reward Consort Li
with a pair of golden hairpins.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.280
Understood.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.880
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.600
Would Your Majesty
play a duet with this concubine?

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.840
My beloved consort?

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.440
Quick! Take Consort Li for treatment!

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.920
- Quick!
- Understood!
