[Episode 12]

00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:53.672
It's delicious.

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:56.172
Why aren't you eating?

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:57.638
What brings you here?

00:00:57.638 --> 00:01:00.038
Are you curious about how I got here?

00:01:00.038 --> 00:01:01.438
Not why I came?

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:04.938
It seems my father-in-law
has some grievances against me.

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:07.038
He actually reported me to the police.

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:10.572
I was detained but recently released on bail.

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:11.872
There's no need to be surprised.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:15.205
Your daughter should also know
the family atmosphere to prepare herself.

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:16.338
What are you doing right now?

00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:17.705
I feel upset, Du Jun.

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:20.505
Not even inviting me to this family event?

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:23.005
Oh, am I not considered family?

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.972
Is the dead son's wife not family?

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:30.372
I apologize, Madam.

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:33.105
It seems our eldest daughter-in-law
has some misunderstanding.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:34.338
A misunderstanding?

00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:36.005
Hui Won should also know certain things.

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:39.838
That those without blood ties
like us can be cast out anytime.

00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:41.572
What are you saying now?

00:01:41.572 --> 00:01:43.005
It's a joke.

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:44.405
A joke.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:47.372
It means anyone who becomes

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:51.305
a daughter-in-law of Taehan Group
must have exceptional resolve.

00:01:52.472 --> 00:01:54.305
You understand, right, sister-in-law?

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:01.572
Is resolve really necessary?

00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:05.738
I don't want a marriage
built on fear and caution.

00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:08.905
Marriage is about love, not resolve.

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:11.005
Two people who've lived differently

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.505
accept their differences and adapt,

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:15.905
striving to be happy together.

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:19.205
I believe that's how families are built, too.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:23.372
Not by blood, but with hearts
that genuinely cherish each other.

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:26.572
You're really innocent.

00:02:26.572 --> 00:02:31.272
And that dear family
turned me over to the police?

00:02:31.272 --> 00:02:33.338
Sister-in-law, this is the occasion for us

00:02:33.338 --> 00:02:37.272
to formally greet each other's parents.

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:40.205
And Hui Won doesn't need
any grand resolutions.

00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:41.925
Because she's perfectly fine just as she is.

00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:44.572
Please mind your manners.

00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:47.138
She's the person I'll spend my life with.

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:53.805
Everyone, cut it out.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:01.672
I'm the one you should deal with.

00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:05.505
Come take a little walk with me, okay?

00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:09.172
Madam, I apologize.

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:26.938
I truly apologize again.

00:03:49.238 --> 00:03:50.638
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:52.572
Because I feel pity for you.

00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:58.005
I feel pity for you even attempting
one last desperate act.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:02.405
There was a time when you shone brightest
alongside Han Jun in that very spot.

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:03.572
I don't need your charity.

00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:05.238
You shouldn't have come here today.

00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:06.938
Then where was I supposed to go?

00:04:06.938 --> 00:04:08.205
You haven't even answered my calls.

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:09.605
Think about what you've done.

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:12.405
Not appreciating all the times
I forgave your wrongdoings

00:04:12.405 --> 00:04:14.238
just because you are Han Jun's wife
and Se Hyeon's mother.

00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:18.272
Why can't you see that you're
the one who betrayed our family?

00:04:18.272 --> 00:04:20.072
That position was originally mine.

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.872
I'm just trying to reclaim
what belongs to me and Se Hyeon.

00:04:22.872 --> 00:04:24.672
It was Du Jun who took it away.

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:28.138
Han Jun, the baby in my womb, everything.

00:04:29.238 --> 00:04:31.538
There's no one who doesn't know your pain.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:35.472
How long will you remain chained to the past?

00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:36.938
Don't pretend to care.

00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:39.672
It's because of you, Father,
that I became like this.

00:04:39.672 --> 00:04:41.038
You were worried that I,

00:04:41.038 --> 00:04:42.238
even after losing my husband,

00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:44.638
might shamelessly cling to your family

00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:46.172
and take over the household

00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:48.072
or Du Jun's place.

00:04:48.072 --> 00:04:49.572
That's what you were worried about,

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:51.305
isn't it?

00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:02.238
So in the end, you're
abandoning me like this?

00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:04.472
I won't crumble so easily.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.938
Everyone in this household will regret it!

- Huh?
- I'm leaving.

00:10:47.138 --> 00:10:49.505
- Bye.
- Hey, right...

00:10:50.138 --> 00:10:52.272
Go inside.

00:10:52.272 --> 00:10:53.972
Okay.

00:11:04.238 --> 00:11:06.472
Why is Hwang Mi Ran like this?

00:11:08.872 --> 00:11:10.605
What's this?

00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:15.238
Thank you for your order, valued customer.

00:11:15.238 --> 00:11:16.837
[Gil Soo's Side Dish Shop]

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.781
Jeez.

00:11:21.205 --> 00:11:23.505
Why are you having lunch now?

00:11:23.505 --> 00:11:24.505
What's this?

00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:26.738
This isn't ordinary effort.

00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:29.438
But what is this?

00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:31.938
Is this bought
and packed from a side dish shop?

00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:34.205
She'd be really embarrassed if she knew
there was a note like this inside.

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:37.038
The effort is what matters.

00:11:37.038 --> 00:11:38.405
Look at this one.

00:11:38.405 --> 00:11:39.738
Oh, dear.

00:11:39.738 --> 00:11:42.972
What kind of sincerity is this?
Just delivering food isn't considered effort.

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:45.938
Cooking is about the personal touch.

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.005
It's just tasty.

00:11:47.005 --> 00:11:48.072
She should cook it herself
and give it to you.

00:11:48.072 --> 00:11:50.138
- This is from a side dish shop.
- Please, eat.

00:11:52.405 --> 00:11:53.472
It's delicious.

00:11:53.472 --> 00:11:54.572
What is this?

00:11:54.572 --> 00:11:56.305
I don't know.

00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:04.738
My boy.

00:12:15.072 --> 00:12:16.238
Mom.

00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:18.838
Oh, you're back.

00:12:23.905 --> 00:12:25.138
What's the occasion?

00:12:25.138 --> 00:12:26.805
You invited me to your home.

00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:30.005
I received some good tea as a gift,
and I thought you might like it.

00:12:30.005 --> 00:12:31.738
Please have some.

00:12:33.972 --> 00:12:36.705
Ah, it smells amazing.

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:41.338
By the way, you did properly apologize
to Hui Won's mother, right?

00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:44.772
Yes, she said not to worry about it
and asked me to tell you that.

00:12:44.772 --> 00:12:46.705
Oh, that's a relief.

00:12:46.705 --> 00:12:48.338
I heard from your Dad.

00:12:48.338 --> 00:12:51.338
That Jeong Eum did a lot of
terrible things all this time.

00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:52.772
You've been through a lot
emotionally too, haven't you?

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.005
It's all over now.

00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:57.205
There's nothing more
my sister-in-law can do now.

00:12:57.205 --> 00:13:00.205
But with Hui Won by your side
at times like this,

00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:02.838
I feel so relieved.

00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:06.705
I really like Hui Won.

00:13:11.805 --> 00:13:13.272
Mom, um...

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:16.105
Do you remember Dad's proposal?

00:13:16.105 --> 00:13:17.138
Proposal?

00:13:17.138 --> 00:13:18.805
Of course, I remember.

00:13:18.805 --> 00:13:22.072
That stiff guy's hands were shaking like this

00:13:22.072 --> 00:13:23.372
while he put the ring on my hand.

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:24.905
How could I forget that?

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:27.872
- Dad did that?
- Yes, exactly.

00:13:27.872 --> 00:13:29.772
But why bring that up all of a sudden?

00:13:29.772 --> 00:13:31.072
Are you planning one too?

00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:33.538
Yes, but it's a bit...

00:13:35.072 --> 00:13:36.972
Because of your hand?

00:13:37.672 --> 00:13:39.538
Is it still difficult?

00:13:43.738 --> 00:13:45.738
They say that when someone you love appears,

00:13:45.738 --> 00:13:49.305
courage you never imagined comes out.

00:13:49.305 --> 00:13:51.105
So you end up doing things you hesitate over.

00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:54.138
And you face things you're afraid of.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:58.405
Have you visited Han Jun's grave?

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.272
No, not yet.

00:14:01.272 --> 00:14:05.372
When you had worries before,
your brother gave you solutions.

00:14:05.372 --> 00:14:07.805
Du Jun, look at me.

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:10.538
It wasn't your fault.

00:14:10.538 --> 00:14:14.038
We never blamed you, not once.

00:14:14.038 --> 00:14:16.338
So stop now.

00:14:18.438 --> 00:14:22.005
Come out of that guilt, okay?

00:14:27.272 --> 00:14:30.138
That's what your brother would want too.

00:14:33.105 --> 00:14:34.838
Yes.

00:14:42.472 --> 00:14:45.472
Okay everyone, attention!

00:14:45.472 --> 00:14:48.338
Our Manager Jang won 2nd place in the contest

00:14:48.338 --> 00:14:50.272
and got the opportunity
for an internal launch.

00:14:50.272 --> 00:14:52.238
Everyone, applause!

00:14:52.238 --> 00:14:53.238
Great!

00:14:53.238 --> 00:14:55.205
Manager Jang, say a few words.

00:14:56.005 --> 00:14:57.138
Thank you.

00:14:57.138 --> 00:14:58.638
It really feels like a dream.

00:14:58.638 --> 00:15:00.272
My own beer being launched.

00:15:00.272 --> 00:15:01.672
I'm so happy for you.

00:15:01.672 --> 00:15:03.272
You were trending so much on YouTube.

00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:05.038
So the higher-ups recognized your true worth.

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:07.208
Exactly, I've been checking it out
ever since the comments

00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.938
went absolutely crazy
about non-alcoholic beer!

00:15:08.938 --> 00:15:10.338
Exactly! Who are we?

00:15:10.338 --> 00:15:11.972
New Product Development Team!

00:15:11.972 --> 00:15:13.797
Applause!

00:15:13.797 --> 00:15:17.172
- Yes!
- Okay, everyone dismissed.

00:15:22.072 --> 00:15:23.905
By the way,

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.405
how did he propose to you?

00:15:25.405 --> 00:15:27.938
I can't even imagine how extravagant
his proposal must have been.

00:15:27.938 --> 00:15:29.005
When's the wedding?

00:15:29.005 --> 00:15:30.309
Wait, you don't have the ring?

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:31.505
Oh.

00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:33.405
That kind of proposal would embarrass me,

00:15:33.405 --> 00:15:35.838
so I'd talk him out of it even if he tried.

00:15:35.838 --> 00:15:37.672
What do you mean, that kind of proposal?

00:15:37.672 --> 00:15:39.138
It's every woman's fantasy.

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:42.238
Yeah, it's a meaningful event,
so you should accept it.

00:15:42.238 --> 00:15:43.938
Manager Nah, how did you propose?

00:15:43.938 --> 00:15:46.238
Oh, I proposed by giving her a flower

00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:48.638
every day starting 100 days
before the wedding.

00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:49.972
My wife absolutely loved it.

00:15:49.972 --> 00:15:51.272
She even cried buckets, I tell you.

00:15:51.272 --> 00:15:52.972
Oh, is that so?

00:15:52.972 --> 00:15:57.105
And that person nearly got in trouble
for forgetting the anniversary and going out?

00:15:57.105 --> 00:15:58.672
Why are you bringing that up again?

00:15:58.672 --> 00:16:00.005
I brought flowers when I went back.

00:16:00.005 --> 00:16:01.305
Oh, I see.

00:16:01.305 --> 00:16:02.338
She cried a lot that day too.

00:16:02.338 --> 00:16:04.038
- I also...
- Oh, did you?

00:16:04.038 --> 00:16:06.105
But she was a bit more angry.

00:16:07.605 --> 00:16:09.038
I need to remember next year.

00:16:09.038 --> 00:16:10.038
Oh, Mi Ran.

00:16:10.038 --> 00:16:13.205
Hey, Jang Hui Won, so you really
wouldn't mind not getting a proposal?

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.605
Well,

00:16:14.605 --> 00:16:17.038
there are plenty of people
who live happily without that.

00:16:17.038 --> 00:16:18.205
No, it's not.

00:16:18.205 --> 00:16:20.705
Jang Hui Won, you must have
some expectations, right?

00:16:20.705 --> 00:16:21.772
What's there to expect?

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.805
I wasn't even thinking
about marriage until recently.

00:16:23.805 --> 00:16:24.805
Well, that's true.

00:16:24.805 --> 00:16:25.905
Then again,

00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:28.938
it doesn't cost anything,
so shall we just imagine it once?

00:16:28.938 --> 00:16:30.038
Yeah, tell me.

00:16:30.038 --> 00:16:31.705
Well...

00:16:31.705 --> 00:16:34.505
At a place with a nice atmosphere,

00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:36.838
while we're having a cozy time together,

00:16:36.838 --> 00:16:38.672
music suddenly starts playing,

00:16:38.672 --> 00:16:39.938
and candles flickering.

00:16:39.938 --> 00:16:42.105
Ah, and some balloons would be cute too.

00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:43.638
Well, well.

00:16:43.638 --> 00:16:46.672
In a place like that,
just like everyone else,

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:47.938
hand over the ring and ask,

00:16:47.938 --> 00:16:51.038
'Will you marry me?'

00:16:51.038 --> 00:16:53.005
You've imagined this
more than once, haven't you?

00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:56.138
No, it's just... words.

00:16:56.138 --> 00:16:58.105
You know I don't expect things like that.

00:16:58.105 --> 00:17:00.338
Yeah, just like everyone else, ordinary.

00:17:00.338 --> 00:17:03.238
- Right.
- It's the simplest thing, yet the hardest.

00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:05.338
Anyway, got it. Have a good rest.

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:07.072
Okay.

00:17:08.172 --> 00:17:09.905
What is it?

00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:12.838
You heard that, right?

00:17:12.838 --> 00:17:14.538
'Just ordinary like everyone else.'

00:17:14.538 --> 00:17:16.305
That's actually the hardest answer.

00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:18.905
Wouldn't it be better
to just ask her directly now?

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:21.638
Then, the charm of the surprise
would be lost.

00:17:21.638 --> 00:17:24.438
That's why I'm asking you both for help.

00:17:24.438 --> 00:17:28.505
She'll probably feel more comfortable
talking to you than to me.

00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.638
Here, have some of this.

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:35.838
Got it.

00:17:35.838 --> 00:17:37.938
Then let's start by interpreting the word

00:17:37.938 --> 00:17:39.672
'ordinary' that Hui Won mentioned.

00:17:39.672 --> 00:17:41.638
Exactly, 'ordinary.'

00:17:41.638 --> 00:17:44.238
It's one of the most
important moments in life,

00:17:44.238 --> 00:17:48.005
so wouldn't it be better if it were
a bit bigger and more extravagant

00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:49.872
to make it memorable?

00:17:49.872 --> 00:17:52.138
Actually, I thought the same.

00:17:52.138 --> 00:17:53.605
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.972
so I considered making it
the most luxurious and extravagant.

00:17:55.972 --> 00:17:56.972
Oh, and,

00:17:56.972 --> 00:18:00.805
I thought about holding a mini-concert.

00:18:00.805 --> 00:18:03.072
Huh? Mini-concert?
I was thinking the same thing.

00:18:03.072 --> 00:18:04.072
Huh?

00:18:04.072 --> 00:18:06.505
Hui Won really loves listening to music.

00:18:06.505 --> 00:18:07.505
Oh, really? Is that okay?

00:18:07.505 --> 00:18:08.605
Yeah, it's okay,

00:18:08.605 --> 00:18:10.805
no, I like it.

00:18:10.805 --> 00:18:15.105
But a performance just for one person
could be too much pressure,

00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:18.438
so I thought having
a small audience would be better.

00:18:18.438 --> 00:18:20.238
- Ordinary.
- That sounds good.

00:18:20.238 --> 00:18:22.405
- Huh?
- It shows preparation,

00:18:22.405 --> 00:18:23.605
but isn't overwhelming,

00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:25.672
romantic but not too much.

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:27.638
- That's ordinary.
- Right?

00:18:27.638 --> 00:18:28.905
Wait a minute!

00:18:28.905 --> 00:18:31.972
- What's ordinary about that?
- Huh?

00:18:31.972 --> 00:18:34.338
You two seem like you could charm any woman,

00:18:34.338 --> 00:18:36.272
yet you have no idea
what women are really saying?

00:18:36.272 --> 00:18:37.872
Big and flashy is nice,

00:18:37.872 --> 00:18:39.305
but do you need to propose

00:18:39.305 --> 00:18:42.605
in front of everyone,
being the center of attention?

00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:45.238
No! And what's this concert thing?

00:18:45.238 --> 00:18:46.672
Are you throwing a festival?

00:18:46.672 --> 00:18:47.872
President, listen carefully.

00:18:47.872 --> 00:18:49.538
What you're talking about now

00:18:49.538 --> 00:18:51.572
isn't ordinary, it's excessive.

00:18:51.572 --> 00:18:53.472
It's just that in a place
with a nice atmosphere,

00:18:53.472 --> 00:18:55.205
when your true feelings

00:18:55.205 --> 00:18:57.538
meet the other's unexpectedly, bam!

00:18:57.538 --> 00:18:59.472
That's the proposal.

00:19:01.238 --> 00:19:02.272
Oh, and,

00:19:02.272 --> 00:19:04.905
being big and flashy only works for

00:19:04.905 --> 00:19:07.438
this one thing, you know?

00:19:08.072 --> 00:19:10.838
This is 'the more, the better', got it?

00:19:10.838 --> 00:19:12.572
Huh?

00:19:35.805 --> 00:19:37.438
The trial date is set.

00:19:37.438 --> 00:19:41.272
December 29th at 10 AM,
Seoul Central District Court.

00:19:41.272 --> 00:19:43.238
The lawyer wants to
meet once more tomorrow...

00:19:43.238 --> 00:19:45.738
Got it, now go out.

00:19:46.905 --> 00:19:48.405
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry,

00:19:48.405 --> 00:19:50.638
but this is as far as I go.

00:20:10.405 --> 00:20:12.338
Where are you going?

00:20:12.338 --> 00:20:15.172
Not going to Uncle's again, are you?

00:20:15.838 --> 00:20:17.705
You don't think about me until the end, huh?

00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:19.272
It's for you.

00:20:19.272 --> 00:20:20.405
For us.

00:20:20.405 --> 00:20:22.238
No, that's your greed, Mom.

00:20:22.238 --> 00:20:23.605
I even quit the company because of you.

00:20:23.605 --> 00:20:24.905
Why did you quit there?

00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:26.072
Didn't I tell you?

00:20:26.072 --> 00:20:27.538
Taehan Liquor is yours!

00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:30.005
Have some sense of ownership!

00:20:30.005 --> 00:20:31.472
No, no, no.

00:20:31.472 --> 00:20:33.505
Let's use this chance to contact Grandpa

00:20:33.505 --> 00:20:35.238
and tell him you want management lessons.

00:20:35.238 --> 00:20:37.272
Grandpa will pick up your calls, right?

00:20:37.272 --> 00:20:38.638
Please, just stop!

00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:40.338
Mom, if you don't pay
for your sins this time,

00:20:40.338 --> 00:20:42.338
I'll just live as if I don't have a mother.

00:20:42.338 --> 00:20:43.705
What do you mean by that?

00:20:43.705 --> 00:20:45.338
How could you say that to me?

00:20:45.338 --> 00:20:48.005
After your dad passed, I struggled so hard

00:20:48.005 --> 00:20:50.085
to put you in that position!

00:20:50.085 --> 00:20:51.238
How could you do this?

00:20:51.238 --> 00:20:54.438
I clearly said I didn't need that position.

00:20:54.438 --> 00:20:55.972
It was you who didn't listen to me.

00:20:55.972 --> 00:20:58.038
Is family just about forcing
your own feelings on others?

00:20:58.038 --> 00:21:01.372
If that's family, I don't need you!

00:21:01.372 --> 00:21:03.438
Now, my family is just

00:21:03.438 --> 00:21:05.472
Grandma, Grandpa, and Uncle.

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:07.105
Kang Se Hyeon!

00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:08.105
The trial is coming soon,

00:21:08.105 --> 00:21:09.538
so think carefully until then.

00:21:09.538 --> 00:21:12.638
Whether you truly did nothing wrong.

00:21:24.938 --> 00:21:26.672
Fine.

00:21:29.138 --> 00:21:30.905
Just go.

00:21:32.738 --> 00:21:36.805
I don't need any of you, so go!

00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:53.805
Huh?

00:21:53.805 --> 00:21:55.605
Se Hyeon?

00:22:07.038 --> 00:22:09.105
- Thank you.
- Why didn't you contact me?

00:22:09.105 --> 00:22:10.638
How would you know when I was coming back?

00:22:10.638 --> 00:22:13.072
I was feeling a bit stifled,
so I came out for some air.

00:22:13.072 --> 00:22:14.805
It's cold.

00:22:16.672 --> 00:22:19.205
I quit the company.

00:22:19.205 --> 00:22:20.872
But your internship isn't over.

00:22:20.872 --> 00:22:23.805
Was it because of your mother?

00:22:25.472 --> 00:22:26.838
Don't be like that.

00:22:26.838 --> 00:22:29.005
If it's because you're worried about me,

00:22:29.005 --> 00:22:31.605
I'm really fine.

00:22:31.605 --> 00:22:33.872
I already told Team Leader Bang.

00:22:33.872 --> 00:22:37.972
I didn't want to spend
the last month feeling guilty.

00:22:39.872 --> 00:22:43.505
I guess Mom still really hates Uncle.

00:22:43.505 --> 00:22:47.738
Though now it seems she's just
finding excuses for her actions.

00:22:47.738 --> 00:22:50.638
The trial is coming soon,
so don't worry too much.

00:22:50.638 --> 00:22:54.272
What about you, Se Hyeon?
I'm worried about you.

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:57.138
I'm more worried about Uncle.

00:22:57.138 --> 00:22:59.605
I wish he would put down some of
the burden he carries about Dad.

00:22:59.605 --> 00:23:03.005
He hasn't visited Dad's columbarium
even once since the accident.

00:23:03.005 --> 00:23:04.872
Not even once?

00:23:04.872 --> 00:23:08.572
No. Anyway, he's being foolish.

00:23:08.572 --> 00:23:11.938
But now you are by his side,

00:23:11.938 --> 00:23:13.272
so I'm trying not to worry anymore.

00:23:13.272 --> 00:23:15.338
That's okay, right?

00:23:15.338 --> 00:23:17.038
Of course.

00:23:29.638 --> 00:23:32.572
Why can't you see that

00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:34.238
you're the one who betrayed our family?

00:23:34.238 --> 00:23:36.738
Probably, no one will
come back to you, President Han.

00:23:36.738 --> 00:23:39.672
I thought someone should tell you this.

00:23:40.738 --> 00:23:42.605
I'm sorry, but this is as far as I go.

00:23:42.605 --> 00:23:43.872
I don't need you!

00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:47.105
Now, my family is just
Grandma, Grandpa, and Uncle.

00:23:48.138 --> 00:23:51.038
Ah, no, no, baby.

00:23:51.038 --> 00:23:53.338
No.

00:23:53.338 --> 00:23:57.372
Kang Du Jun, this is all your fault.

00:23:57.372 --> 00:23:59.572
Because of you!

00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:27.872
Yes, Hui Won?

00:24:27.872 --> 00:24:29.605
A date?

00:24:31.805 --> 00:24:33.105
Why that face?

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.572
Don't you want to go on a date with me?

00:24:34.572 --> 00:24:36.938
No, why would you say something so scary?

00:24:36.938 --> 00:24:38.205
I just feel bad

00:24:38.205 --> 00:24:40.938
since you must be tired,
and I'm making you drive.

00:24:40.938 --> 00:24:41.972
I told you I'm driving.

00:24:41.972 --> 00:24:43.505
I said earlier,

00:24:43.505 --> 00:24:45.872
just leave today's date to me.

00:24:45.872 --> 00:24:48.138
Then later, when we return,
I will drive no matter what.

00:24:48.138 --> 00:24:49.838
Absolutely not this.

00:24:49.838 --> 00:24:52.105
Okay.

00:24:52.105 --> 00:24:54.538
But where are we going?
We even took a day off.

00:24:54.538 --> 00:24:56.005
That's a secret!

00:24:56.005 --> 00:24:57.638
It wouldn't be fun if I told you in advance.

00:24:57.638 --> 00:24:59.472
Then, is there at least a hint?

00:24:59.472 --> 00:25:02.538
Hey! President, just trust me
and follow along.

00:25:02.538 --> 00:25:03.538
Ah, so cute, really cute.

00:25:03.538 --> 00:25:06.072
Hey! I'm not cute at all!

00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:08.272
[Flowers]
Welcome.

00:25:08.272 --> 00:25:10.205
Wait, why flowers if we're going on a date?

00:25:10.205 --> 00:25:12.709
It's nice, isn't it? A little mood boost.

00:25:12.709 --> 00:25:13.893
Oh.

00:25:13.893 --> 00:25:15.772
Pretty.

00:25:29.805 --> 00:25:31.638
Aren't they pretty?

00:25:31.638 --> 00:25:32.805
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:25:32.805 --> 00:25:34.138
Because it's beautiful.

00:25:34.138 --> 00:25:35.138
The flowers?

00:25:35.138 --> 00:25:37.138
Well, Hui Won with the flowers?

00:25:37.138 --> 00:25:39.405
Oh, jeez.

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:41.505
Miss, please wrap these up.

00:25:41.505 --> 00:25:42.538
- Yes.
- Pick out more.

00:25:42.538 --> 00:25:43.838
President, what kind of flowers do you like?

00:25:43.838 --> 00:25:44.872
I like the Hui Won flower.

00:25:44.872 --> 00:25:46.138
Oh, jeez.

00:25:46.138 --> 00:25:47.938
It hurts.

00:25:52.505 --> 00:25:55.072
Is cake for changing the mood too?

00:25:55.072 --> 00:25:57.805
On such an important day,
it would feel lacking without cake.

00:25:57.805 --> 00:26:00.005
Important day?
Is today some special occasion?

00:26:00.005 --> 00:26:02.205
Is it our anniversary or something?

00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:04.805
It's not that, so don't worry.

00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:07.272
Ah, they all look delicious.

00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:09.005
President, what kind of cake do you like?

00:26:09.005 --> 00:26:10.472
I'm not really into bread or cake.

00:26:10.472 --> 00:26:11.838
I like whipped cream.

00:26:11.838 --> 00:26:13.138
Yeah?

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:15.038
Well, if we live together,

00:26:15.038 --> 00:26:16.838
there will be more things to celebrate.

00:26:16.838 --> 00:26:18.038
If we live together? More?

00:26:18.038 --> 00:26:19.205
What else do you like?

00:26:19.205 --> 00:26:20.305
I have a good memory.

00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:22.572
You like whipped cream on cake and roses.

00:26:22.572 --> 00:26:24.505
Tell me if there's anything else.

00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:26.738
See? At times like this,
you're totally like a puppy.

00:26:26.738 --> 00:26:27.738
A puppy?

00:26:27.738 --> 00:26:28.938
That's an insult, right?

00:26:28.938 --> 00:26:32.138
I've heard of 'cool guy,' but a puppy?
What does that mean?

00:26:32.138 --> 00:26:35.772
Ugh, it means you're cute, like a puppy.

00:26:36.837 --> 00:26:38.638
Jeez.

00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:40.972
I am a bit cute, I admit.

00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:45.372
I'll take all the whipped cream.

00:26:53.205 --> 00:26:55.438
Wait, here?

00:26:55.438 --> 00:26:56.505
I'm sorry.

00:26:56.505 --> 00:27:00.005
I didn't think you'd come
if I told the truth.

00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:04.305
I greeted your parents,

00:27:04.305 --> 00:27:07.672
but I haven't met your brother.

00:27:07.672 --> 00:27:11.538
I lied because I wanted
to greet him in person.

00:27:11.538 --> 00:27:13.372
I'm sorry.

00:27:14.438 --> 00:27:18.305
If you're uncomfortable,
I'll go quickly alone.

00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:21.638
You'll wait for me, right?

00:27:35.472 --> 00:27:36.972
Hello.

00:27:36.972 --> 00:27:38.738
My name is Jang Hui Won.

00:27:38.738 --> 00:27:41.272
I really wanted to greet you in person.

00:27:41.272 --> 00:27:43.038
Because I've heard a lot

00:27:43.038 --> 00:27:45.205
about how great you were

00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:48.305
and how much you cared for your brother.

00:27:48.305 --> 00:27:52.905
I'll stay with your brother
to make sure you don't worry.

00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:55.238
Please look upon me kindly.

00:28:17.438 --> 00:28:20.005
I need to use the restroom.

00:28:20.005 --> 00:28:22.672
I'll take my time,

00:28:22.672 --> 00:28:26.538
so take your time too, President.

[Late Kang Han Jun's Grave]

00:29:17.672 --> 00:29:19.405
Han Jun.

00:29:20.638 --> 00:29:22.472
Have you been well?

00:29:23.672 --> 00:29:26.838
I've been missing you more than usual today,

00:29:26.838 --> 00:29:29.205
maybe that's why I came here.

00:29:30.172 --> 00:29:32.805
I'm too late, aren't I?

00:29:32.805 --> 00:29:34.538
I'm sorry.

00:29:36.338 --> 00:29:39.438
I thought I didn't deserve forgiveness.

00:29:39.438 --> 00:29:43.338
I often wished it had been me instead.

00:29:44.238 --> 00:29:45.938
But, Han Jun,

00:29:46.938 --> 00:29:48.938
I still...

00:29:48.938 --> 00:29:53.372
I really tried hard to fill your absence.

00:29:53.372 --> 00:29:55.905
I think I messed up, Han Jun.

00:29:59.072 --> 00:30:00.772
I'm sorry.

00:30:03.805 --> 00:30:05.538
But, Han Jun,

00:30:07.072 --> 00:30:09.705
after sending you off like that,

00:30:10.472 --> 00:30:14.172
I've recently started wanting
to be happy for the first time.

00:30:15.905 --> 00:30:18.472
I found someone so precious

00:30:18.472 --> 00:30:21.172
that I want to protect her for life.

00:30:21.172 --> 00:30:22.705
Thanks to her,

00:30:22.705 --> 00:30:25.872
I found the courage to come see you today.

00:30:25.872 --> 00:30:28.038
So

00:30:28.038 --> 00:30:30.238
shameless, right?

00:30:30.238 --> 00:30:32.638
You'll forgive and support

00:30:33.838 --> 00:30:35.972
your terrible younger brother, right?

00:30:35.972 --> 00:30:37.672
Huh?

00:30:42.705 --> 00:30:44.372
Han Jun, I miss you so much.

00:30:44.372 --> 00:30:46.505
I miss you so much.

00:30:46.505 --> 00:30:49.605
I really miss you so much.

00:31:29.372 --> 00:31:31.072
You're back.

00:31:32.272 --> 00:31:34.405
Did you have a good talk with your brother?

00:31:34.405 --> 00:31:36.138
Yes.

00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:40.338
It seems like he's greeting us.

00:31:40.338 --> 00:31:42.038
It does.

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:48.838
Thanks to you, Hui Won.

00:31:48.838 --> 00:31:50.538
Thank you.

00:31:56.772 --> 00:31:58.905
Thank you so much.

00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:12.581
[Will you marry me?]

00:32:15.938 --> 00:32:19.805
Seeing us like this reminds me
of preparing your birthday party.

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:21.705
Me?

00:32:21.705 --> 00:32:24.572
That big birthday party
you and Hui Won threw for me?

00:32:24.572 --> 00:32:27.705
Yeah, we blew up balloons
all day back then too.

00:32:27.705 --> 00:32:31.572
Who knew I'd end up preparing
Jang Hui Won's proposal myself?

00:32:32.972 --> 00:32:35.972
Sounds like you still have regrets.

00:32:37.072 --> 00:32:40.072
Ah, no, not at all.

00:32:40.072 --> 00:32:42.805
If you say so. But why are you so flustered?

00:32:42.805 --> 00:32:45.305
Oh right, that side dish
you made back then was delicious.

00:32:45.305 --> 00:32:47.538
- That one? Was it good?
- Yeah.

00:32:47.538 --> 00:32:49.005
Just say the word anytime,

00:32:49.005 --> 00:32:50.038
I'll make it for you again.

00:32:50.038 --> 00:32:52.805
I didn't know you were
such a good cook. It's surprising.

00:32:52.805 --> 00:32:56.105
I told you, there's nothing I can't do.

00:32:57.472 --> 00:32:59.472
What are you doing after today?

00:32:59.472 --> 00:33:03.438
Today? Well, I don't know when this will end.

00:33:03.438 --> 00:33:05.138
Let's have a meal together.

00:33:08.538 --> 00:33:09.605
It's Christmas.

00:33:09.605 --> 00:33:11.738
If we go home early,
we'll just watch movies, right?

00:33:11.738 --> 00:33:14.738
What? Since when do you suggest eating first?

00:33:14.738 --> 00:33:17.138
Well, since you mention it, how about drinks

00:33:17.138 --> 00:33:18.372
instead of food?

00:33:18.372 --> 00:33:19.905
- Okay.
- Really?

00:33:19.905 --> 00:33:21.872
- Yeah.
- What? Who are you?

00:33:21.872 --> 00:33:24.572
Why are you being so easygoing today,
Cha Min Uk? What's up?

00:33:25.238 --> 00:33:27.405
Being with you is

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:30.572
- fun.
- Same here.

00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:43.638
Oh.

00:33:43.638 --> 00:33:46.372
Seriously, Secretary Go,
you've been putting in a lot of effort.

00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:49.772
That's touching. Even Kang Du Jun
doesn't notice, but you noticed.

00:33:49.772 --> 00:33:52.705
I never thought I'd be wearing
a mascot head at my age.

00:33:52.705 --> 00:33:54.872
Of course, it is something I'm good at.

00:33:54.872 --> 00:33:57.477
Exactly, it's a relief.

00:33:57.477 --> 00:33:58.805
Oh.

00:33:58.805 --> 00:34:00.338
By the way, where did Du Jun go?

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:01.838
You didn't hear?

00:34:01.838 --> 00:34:03.072
He said he forgot the ring.

00:34:03.072 --> 00:34:05.205
Yes, so he's making a quick trip home.

00:34:05.205 --> 00:34:09.038
Jeez, he's so high maintenance.

00:34:09.038 --> 00:34:10.838
Well then, I...

00:34:25.072 --> 00:34:27.472
I forgot the most important thing.

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:34.905
I'm heading out now.

00:34:34.905 --> 00:34:36.638
See you later.

00:34:37.572 --> 00:34:39.205
[Se Hyeon]

00:34:40.972 --> 00:34:42.272
- Yes.
- Uncle, where are you?

00:34:42.272 --> 00:34:43.738
I need to talk to you for a second.

00:34:43.738 --> 00:34:45.438
Now?

00:35:02.238 --> 00:35:04.472
If it weren't for you...

00:35:04.472 --> 00:35:07.005
If it weren't for you...

00:35:07.005 --> 00:35:09.205
If it weren't for you...

00:35:42.538 --> 00:35:45.105
The subscriber you dialed is unavailable...

00:35:45.105 --> 00:35:46.738
Why isn't he answering?

00:35:46.738 --> 00:35:49.038
Did something happen?

00:35:50.105 --> 00:35:51.109
[Secretary Go]

00:35:55.909 --> 00:35:57.445
Ow!

00:35:59.238 --> 00:36:00.905
Oh, Hui Won.

00:36:00.905 --> 00:36:05.205
First, calm down.
I'll check with the front desk.

00:36:06.572 --> 00:36:07.572
President.

00:36:07.572 --> 00:36:09.672
Please look at me.

00:36:09.672 --> 00:36:12.005
My arm hurts so much.

00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:14.205
Please call a doctor.

00:36:17.938 --> 00:36:19.672
I'm sorry.

00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:25.509
It hurts!

00:36:32.672 --> 00:36:33.905
Hui Won.

00:36:33.905 --> 00:36:35.772
Why are you here?

00:36:37.372 --> 00:36:40.138
- What's wrong?
- I thought...

00:36:40.138 --> 00:36:43.105
I'd never see you again.

00:36:44.005 --> 00:36:45.272
I'm sorry.

00:36:45.272 --> 00:36:48.072
I'll never leave Yeol Mu and you again.

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:49.972
Don't worry so much.

00:36:55.038 --> 00:36:56.705
Are you okay?

00:36:56.705 --> 00:36:57.838
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

00:36:57.838 --> 00:37:00.572
Ah, I'm fine. This is nothing.

00:37:02.872 --> 00:37:04.905
That's a relief.

00:37:09.905 --> 00:37:13.505
Anyway, you really do make people worry.

00:37:26.053 --> 00:37:27.845
Oh.

Ma'am! You can't get up so suddenly!

00:37:31.872 --> 00:37:33.172
Where is Se Hyeon?

00:37:33.172 --> 00:37:34.538
Where is Se Hyeon?

00:37:34.538 --> 00:37:35.538
Mom!

00:37:35.538 --> 00:37:37.505
- Se Hyeon!
- I'll get the doctor.

00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:38.938
Se Hyeon! Are you hurt anywhere?

00:37:38.938 --> 00:37:40.705
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:37:40.705 --> 00:37:42.138
I'm okay. What about you, Mom?

00:37:42.138 --> 00:37:44.338
Mom, are you okay?

00:37:44.338 --> 00:37:45.805
Why did you do that?

00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:48.172
Were you really trying to kill Uncle?

00:37:48.172 --> 00:37:49.605
I was wrong.

00:37:49.605 --> 00:37:52.305
How could I... how could I...

00:37:52.305 --> 00:37:55.638
Mom, if not for Uncle, I'd have died.

00:37:55.638 --> 00:37:58.572
Is that what you wanted, Mom?

00:38:01.038 --> 00:38:03.872
I...

00:38:03.872 --> 00:38:05.672
I must have been crazy.

00:38:05.672 --> 00:38:08.605
I must have lost my mind.

00:38:08.605 --> 00:38:09.938
Mom, I...

00:38:09.938 --> 00:38:11.338
I don't care about the company

00:38:11.338 --> 00:38:13.372
or being an heir, it means nothing to me.

00:38:13.372 --> 00:38:16.972
I just want to go to exhibitions
with you like we used to,

00:38:16.972 --> 00:38:19.605
pack lunches and go visit Dad,

00:38:19.605 --> 00:38:22.405
and just live like that.

00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:25.105
What happened to Dad wasn't Uncle's fault.

00:38:25.105 --> 00:38:26.605
You know that too, Mom.

00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:29.905
Uncle raised me so well.

00:38:29.905 --> 00:38:31.672
Now, let him go.

00:38:31.672 --> 00:38:34.472
Uncle deserves to be happy too.

00:38:34.472 --> 00:38:36.172
Mom.

00:38:38.805 --> 00:38:40.805
I'm sorry, Se Hyeon.

You have someone who visits you faithfully.

00:39:03.005 --> 00:39:06.605
Even dead, you're doing better than me.

00:39:09.438 --> 00:39:11.405
How did I end up like this?

00:39:11.405 --> 00:39:13.972
I'm too ashamed to face you.

00:39:14.605 --> 00:39:17.138
I stopped by one last time
before paying for my sins.

00:39:17.138 --> 00:39:19.672
I won't be able to come for a while,

00:39:19.672 --> 00:39:21.705
so don't wait for me.

00:39:21.705 --> 00:39:23.505
Please watch over our Se Hyeon from there.

00:39:23.505 --> 00:39:25.381
I only

00:39:25.381 --> 00:39:27.605
end up hurting her.

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:37.672
Yes, then let's proceed that way.

00:39:37.672 --> 00:39:39.372
Yes.

00:39:44.905 --> 00:39:46.605
Come in.

00:39:58.038 --> 00:39:59.472
You turned yourself in?

00:39:59.472 --> 00:40:02.838
I came here before going
to the police station.

00:40:17.772 --> 00:40:21.438
Thank you for saving Se Hyeon.

00:40:21.438 --> 00:40:24.572
Even though I know so well
the pain of losing someone,

00:40:24.572 --> 00:40:28.205
I almost killed my own daughter
with my own hands.

00:40:28.205 --> 00:40:32.005
If anything had happened to Se Hyeon,
I really couldn't have lived.

00:40:32.005 --> 00:40:34.738
I've been blaming you to save myself.

00:40:34.738 --> 00:40:36.372
The one I truly hate is myself,

00:40:36.372 --> 00:40:38.372
for doing nothing back then

00:40:38.372 --> 00:40:41.805
and failing to protect the baby in my womb.

00:40:43.638 --> 00:40:46.238
So don't blame yourself too much.

00:40:47.638 --> 00:40:49.872
And don't forgive me either.

00:41:06.372 --> 00:41:08.372
Failing to protect the baby

00:41:08.372 --> 00:41:11.205
isn't solely your fault, Jeong Eum.

00:41:11.205 --> 00:41:13.272
So please get up.

00:41:21.338 --> 00:41:22.772
Come to think of it,

00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:26.272
I also failed to give you a proper apology.

00:41:31.438 --> 00:41:33.972
I couldn't protect my brother that day,

00:41:33.972 --> 00:41:36.472
and because of that,
you lost two people you loved.

00:41:36.472 --> 00:41:38.238
I felt like I pushed you and Se Hyeon

00:41:38.238 --> 00:41:40.805
into hell with my own hands.

00:41:40.805 --> 00:41:42.905
I'm truly sorry.

00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:49.405
But the people who are left
behind have to live well.

00:41:49.405 --> 00:41:51.872
So please don't worry too much.

00:41:51.872 --> 00:41:55.205
I'll take good care of Se Hyeon.

00:42:19.205 --> 00:42:22.972
She asked me to tell you
that she was truly sorry.

00:42:22.972 --> 00:42:26.872
She felt she'd ruined our chance
at a good relationship.

00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:28.138
I see.

00:42:28.138 --> 00:42:29.805
But still, it's a relief.

00:42:29.805 --> 00:42:32.172
It seems everything has
finally found its place.

00:42:32.172 --> 00:42:33.705
You went through a lot, Hui Won.

00:42:33.705 --> 00:42:35.405
All because of me.

00:42:35.405 --> 00:42:37.005
I'm fine.

00:42:37.005 --> 00:42:39.738
Because you are by my side.

00:42:39.738 --> 00:42:45.405
Do you know what made me the saddest
after hearing about your accident?

00:42:45.405 --> 00:42:50.272
What if I could no longer
have this everyday life with you?

00:42:50.272 --> 00:42:52.605
For me,

00:42:52.605 --> 00:42:56.472
this moment feels like a miracle.

00:42:56.472 --> 00:42:58.872
You're standing before me.

00:42:58.872 --> 00:43:01.938
I can hear your voice,

00:43:02.572 --> 00:43:05.172
and I can touch you like this.

00:43:06.238 --> 00:43:07.405
Me too.

00:43:07.405 --> 00:43:09.538
It feels like a miracle to me too.

00:43:15.538 --> 00:43:17.738
President.

00:43:17.738 --> 00:43:19.505
Your hand...

00:43:20.838 --> 00:43:24.005
It took me such a long time
to hold your hand.

00:43:24.005 --> 00:43:25.705
I'm so sorry.

00:43:29.772 --> 00:43:31.472
Wait.

00:43:44.638 --> 00:43:49.638

Okay, then tonight let's make it intense.

00:51:29.838 --> 00:51:32.172
Oh my, how embarrassing.

00:51:33.305 --> 00:51:36.472
I still can't forget when they
told us they were dating.

00:51:36.472 --> 00:51:39.038
I sometimes dream of it,
and I wake up startled every time.

00:51:39.038 --> 00:51:40.538
I'm afraid I'll dream of it tonight.

00:51:40.538 --> 00:51:44.172
I haven't even eaten today,
but my stomach feels upset.

00:51:44.172 --> 00:51:47.605
Manager Jang, you've had the baby
and launched the beer.

00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:48.705
Aren't you going to hold
the wedding ceremony?

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:52.805
We were actually trying to set a date
right after the birth, but it's not easy.

00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:54.605
Has the President said anything?

00:51:54.605 --> 00:51:56.638
Lately, he's busier than I am
taking care of the baby.

00:51:56.638 --> 00:51:58.338
Manager Jang really
does things in reverse, huh?

00:51:58.338 --> 00:52:03.038
Baby first, wedding later, soon it'll be
the first birthday before the ceremony, huh?

00:52:03.038 --> 00:52:04.072
Doesn't that bother you?

00:52:04.072 --> 00:52:07.072
My wife says she could give up
everything else, but not the wedding.

00:52:07.072 --> 00:52:11.205
For me, living well together is
more important than the wedding.

00:52:11.205 --> 00:52:13.838
- Right.
- In that case, I'll head out first.

00:52:13.838 --> 00:52:16.938
I have to get my husband settled
after putting the baby to bed.

00:52:18.038 --> 00:52:19.905
What?

00:52:21.338 --> 00:52:23.405
- Oh, thanks for your hard work.
- I'm so jealous.

00:52:23.405 --> 00:52:25.405
Oh, seriously.

00:52:25.405 --> 00:52:27.438
- Here.
- What is it?

00:52:27.438 --> 00:52:29.438
Mi Ran and I bought a coat for Hae Rin.

00:52:29.438 --> 00:52:30.672
Again?

00:52:30.672 --> 00:52:34.305
You bought her tons of
thermal underwear last time.

00:52:34.305 --> 00:52:35.972
Thanks.

00:52:35.972 --> 00:52:39.072
By the way, did you two fight
again after that?

00:52:39.072 --> 00:52:41.072
Why? Did Mi Ran call again?

00:52:41.072 --> 00:52:43.005
Gosh, Hwang Mi Ran.

00:52:43.005 --> 00:52:46.505
Back then she couldn't even say
she liked you to me and just agonized.

00:52:46.505 --> 00:52:48.338
These days, it's nothing but talk about you.

00:52:48.338 --> 00:52:50.372
Loves you to death one minute,
hates you the next.

00:52:50.372 --> 00:52:53.372
Sorry. I should be nicer to her.

00:52:53.372 --> 00:52:54.405
I've got my own guilt, after all.

00:52:54.405 --> 00:52:59.072
Yeah, to appease Mi Ran, you just
have to be extra sweet to her, got it?

00:52:59.072 --> 00:53:00.738
- Okay.
- But it's nice to see.

00:53:00.738 --> 00:53:04.438
Before, you were always
taking care of others and giving,

00:53:04.438 --> 00:53:06.938
but there was nothing left for yourself.

00:53:06.938 --> 00:53:11.872
I used to think you should know the joy
of receiving too, not just giving.

00:53:11.872 --> 00:53:14.705
Seems like you're doing that lately.

00:53:15.338 --> 00:53:17.438
It makes me even happier.

00:53:19.105 --> 00:53:20.272
I'm glad

00:53:20.272 --> 00:53:23.838
you look happy, even though you're busy.

00:53:23.838 --> 00:53:27.038
I definitely sleep less,
and I'm busier than before,

00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:29.538
but having a baby is incredibly healing.

00:53:29.538 --> 00:53:32.472
In the morning, when I try to leave
for work after putting her down,

00:53:32.472 --> 00:53:33.838
I really tear up.

00:53:33.838 --> 00:53:36.605
Ah, working moms are really amazing.

00:53:36.605 --> 00:53:39.505
But you can rest a bit on weekends, right?

00:53:39.505 --> 00:53:41.905
Hey, moms don't get weekends.

00:53:41.905 --> 00:53:45.238
I have to play even harder on weekends
to make up for my time away during the week.

00:53:45.238 --> 00:53:46.905
That's true.

00:53:46.905 --> 00:53:49.772
I'll stop by with Mi Ran
some time to see Hae Rin.

00:53:49.772 --> 00:53:51.105
Give my regards to your husband, too.

00:53:51.105 --> 00:53:53.905
Sure, he said you guys are always welcome.

00:53:53.905 --> 00:53:55.472
Just say the word.

00:53:55.472 --> 00:53:57.172
Okay.

00:54:06.438 --> 00:54:07.493
[Congratulations on launching Wonder Beer]

00:54:09.172 --> 00:54:11.397
[You don't just make beer, you make art]

00:54:12.638 --> 00:54:14.805
What is this, seriously?

00:55:01.372 --> 00:55:04.105
Did the promotion go well?

00:55:05.272 --> 00:55:06.872
Thanks to you.

00:55:06.872 --> 00:55:08.872
You worked hard.

00:55:08.872 --> 00:55:11.172
Well done, wifey.

00:55:16.238 --> 00:55:19.005
But why do you look not so happy?

00:55:20.205 --> 00:55:22.105
Because I'm too happy.

00:55:22.105 --> 00:55:24.038
If it weren't for you, Du Jun,

00:55:24.038 --> 00:55:27.672
I wouldn't have this kind of happiness.

00:55:29.105 --> 00:55:32.738
But even in this moment,
you're calling me 'Du Jun' again?

00:55:34.772 --> 00:55:36.505
Huh?

00:55:47.005 --> 00:55:51.045
Should we put the baby to sleep first
and then finish what we were doing?

00:55:51.045 --> 00:55:52.105
Alright.

00:55:52.105 --> 00:55:53.205
I'll make the formula first.

00:55:53.205 --> 00:55:55.238
I'll handle the diaper.

00:55:55.238 --> 00:55:57.205
- Oh, gosh.
- Oh dear.

00:56:01.505 --> 00:56:03.572
Oh, Hae Rin.

00:56:03.572 --> 00:56:05.305
Grandma's here.

00:56:05.305 --> 00:56:09.005
Oh my, oh my.

00:56:09.005 --> 00:56:12.238
Oh dear, have you been good?

00:56:12.938 --> 00:56:14.438
Oh my, so pretty.

00:56:14.438 --> 00:56:17.372
Wow, you were so tough on your daughter,

00:56:17.372 --> 00:56:18.838
but the granddaughter's adorable, huh?

00:56:18.838 --> 00:56:20.738
What's with that all of a sudden?

00:56:20.738 --> 00:56:23.305
What have you been doing
all this time? Why aren't you ready?

00:56:23.305 --> 00:56:25.038
I was busy watching Hae Rin.

00:56:25.038 --> 00:56:26.405
But will you be okay on your own?

00:56:26.405 --> 00:56:28.805
Or should we come back
and have dinner together?

00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:30.605
You said it's a date after so long.

00:56:30.605 --> 00:56:33.072
I'm going to relax with Hae Rin.

00:56:33.072 --> 00:56:35.272
Don't worry about me,
and come back late. Very late.

00:56:35.272 --> 00:56:36.405
What's gotten into you?

00:56:36.405 --> 00:56:38.605
Did he give you a generous
allowance or something?

00:56:38.605 --> 00:56:41.472
Go get ready.
You said he's waiting downstairs.

00:56:41.472 --> 00:56:43.205
Okay.

00:56:46.638 --> 00:56:48.338
- Mom.
- Huh?

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:49.872
Thanks for watching the baby.

00:56:49.872 --> 00:56:53.205
Call me often. You've been busy lately.

00:56:53.205 --> 00:56:55.905
This is when you get your mom's help.

00:56:58.405 --> 00:57:01.872
Hae Rin, have you been doing well?

00:57:01.872 --> 00:57:03.738
Here, look at this.

00:57:03.738 --> 00:57:06.638
But is it really okay to leave Hae Rin
with your mom and be out like this?

00:57:06.638 --> 00:57:10.181
Yeah, she told us not to worry
and just have fun.

00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:11.938
Oh, it's a fish-shaped bun!

00:57:11.938 --> 00:57:13.638
Do you want some?

00:57:14.838 --> 00:57:16.305
- Hello.
- Welcome.

00:57:16.305 --> 00:57:17.905
We'll take four fish-shaped buns.

00:57:17.905 --> 00:57:19.638
Okay.

00:57:20.538 --> 00:57:22.305
See if it's too hot.

00:57:25.338 --> 00:57:26.472
How is it? Is it good?

00:57:26.472 --> 00:57:28.072
Yeah.

00:57:28.072 --> 00:57:30.038
Du Jun, you should try some too.

00:57:31.805 --> 00:57:33.138
Huh? It's not red bean?

00:57:33.138 --> 00:57:34.338
Red bean is the classic filling
for fish-shaped buns.

00:57:34.338 --> 00:57:38.138
Come on, red bean's just the standard.
Custard filling is amazing.

00:57:38.138 --> 00:57:39.205
Come on.

00:57:39.205 --> 00:57:41.705
So, do you eat it
from the head or from the tail?

00:57:41.705 --> 00:57:45.272
Then let's say it at the same time on three.

00:57:45.272 --> 00:57:47.838
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

00:57:47.838 --> 00:57:48.872
- Head.
- Tail.

00:57:48.872 --> 00:57:50.138
You clearly don't know how to eat one.

00:57:50.138 --> 00:57:52.805
It's all about feeling
that crunch in the tail first.

00:57:52.805 --> 00:57:54.005
Haven't you heard
'the head is the best part of a fish'?

00:57:54.005 --> 00:57:55.772
The head's the best part
for fish-shaped buns.

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:58.505
Gosh, why are you so passionate
about a fish-shaped bun?

00:57:58.505 --> 00:58:01.438
Coming from the person trying
to teach me about fish-shaped buns?

00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:04.405
Lately, I've been counting down
to winter just for fish-shaped buns.

00:58:04.405 --> 00:58:07.172
Hui Won, you've completely changed
my taste buds this past year.

00:58:07.172 --> 00:58:08.738
- No way.
- It's true.

00:58:08.738 --> 00:58:09.838
Ah, since we're on the topic.

00:58:09.838 --> 00:58:12.372
Sir, I'd like to hire you.

00:58:12.372 --> 00:58:13.938
How about selling

00:58:13.938 --> 00:58:16.038
in front of my house all year round
through all four seasons?

00:58:16.038 --> 00:58:18.725
I'll pay you a very generous salary.

00:58:18.725 --> 00:58:19.738
Oh.

00:58:19.738 --> 00:58:21.172
He's just joking.

00:58:21.172 --> 00:58:22.272
I'm serious.

00:58:22.272 --> 00:58:23.705
About 20 million won after taxes.

00:58:23.705 --> 00:58:24.805
Deal.

00:58:24.805 --> 00:58:25.838
How about this?

00:58:25.838 --> 00:58:27.272
Oh, it messes up my hair.

00:58:27.272 --> 00:58:29.472
That's not a couple thing.

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:31.238
It suits you.

00:58:37.538 --> 00:58:41.605
I didn't expect it at all,
but today felt like a complete gift.

00:58:41.605 --> 00:58:44.272
Is there anywhere else
you'd like to go later?

00:58:44.997 --> 00:58:50.538
Oh, I'd like to go back to
that Itaewon pub where we first met.

00:58:50.538 --> 00:58:52.138
The Itaewon pub?

00:58:52.138 --> 00:58:54.038
Don't tell me you don't remember it.

00:58:54.038 --> 00:58:56.005
But that's not where we first met.

00:58:56.005 --> 00:58:58.605
What do you mean, not where we first met?

00:58:58.605 --> 00:59:01.105
Huh? Why is there a church here?

00:59:01.105 --> 00:59:02.772
Shall we go in? I'm bored.

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.138
- Huh?
- Let's go in.

00:59:04.138 --> 00:59:05.838
Come this way.

00:59:43.605 --> 00:59:46.172
Doesn't it suit you perfectly?
You look so beautiful.

00:59:46.172 --> 00:59:47.738
When did you prepare all this?

00:59:47.738 --> 00:59:50.872
I wanted to throw you a huge wedding
after the baby was born,

00:59:50.872 --> 00:59:52.438
but it kept getting delayed.

00:59:52.438 --> 00:59:55.205
It was postponed because I was busy.

00:59:55.838 --> 00:59:58.038
Then, shall we practice
the wedding ceremony in advance?

00:59:58.038 --> 00:59:59.738
Huh?

01:00:07.205 --> 01:00:12.038
Even if it's just practice, you need
a veil for a wedding, right?

01:00:21.238 --> 01:00:22.838
Blessings to you both.

01:00:22.838 --> 01:00:25.138
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:00:27.272 --> 01:00:29.538
By the way, you don't seem
to remember very well,

01:00:29.538 --> 01:00:33.038
but our first meeting wasn't
at an Itaewon pub, but a hotel party hall.

01:00:33.038 --> 01:00:37.338
You showed up with red hair
and in sharp heels and suddenly said to me,

01:00:37.338 --> 01:00:38.437
'Excuse me.'

01:00:38.437 --> 01:00:39.872
Could you back me up?

01:00:39.872 --> 01:00:42.472
Honey, the atmosphere here is amazing.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.238
Then, that person back then...

01:00:44.238 --> 01:00:45.238
You think that's all?

01:00:45.238 --> 01:00:47.772
The woman who cried in the rain.

01:00:47.772 --> 01:00:49.238
Hey! Come out here!

01:00:49.238 --> 01:00:51.272
How could you do this to me, huh?

01:00:51.272 --> 01:00:52.972
What did I do wrong?

01:00:52.972 --> 01:00:54.838
Why are you treating me like this?

01:00:54.838 --> 01:00:56.638
I don't know if you were drunk or dumped,

01:00:56.638 --> 01:00:59.838
but you were a mess, crying, sniffling,
and you even took my check.

01:00:59.838 --> 01:01:03.205
That... 1 million won.

01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:06.238
No, please forget about that.

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:10.805
Why? It's a precious memory
I want to cherish forever.

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:17.405
But have I ever said this before?
