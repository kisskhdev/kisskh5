{\an8}

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:24.918
{\an8}

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:35.178
What the…

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.180
There's nothing in the bag.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.772
You've been digging up this whole mountain
for three months straight.

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.066
Who… are you?

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.151
Where is Hanyang?

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.154
- What?
- I need to get to Hanyang today.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:55.073
So, tell me. Which way is it?

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.329
Hanyang is that way.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.081
Oh, that way?

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.585
But it'll take at least 20 days
to get there.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.382
What?

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:21.892
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.105
Dig that up
and brew it carefully for half a day.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.066
It will help with your mother's illness.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:30.692
What?

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.291
This is an ancient tale.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.878
I found it!

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.089
It is the story
of a nine-tailed fox

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.674
who wished to become human,

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:57.386
spending her days cultivating virtue
on Myohyangsan Mountain.

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.122
Can you leave us for a moment?

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:27.416
Chun-sim stays.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.005
Chun-sim. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.882
That's you!

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:48.228
What did you do with Chun-sim?

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.064
Pardon?

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.066
What do you…

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.110
Look.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.239
It's so obvious.

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.623
You seemed completely human,
yet your cunning is all fox.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:09.583
How did you know?

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.668
Your scent.

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.837
I smell the earth on you.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.132
The scent of Myohyangsan Mountain's soil
that I've known for centuries.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.342
Have you been well?

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:25.474
I was just bored without you around.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.727
By the way, don't worry about Chun-sim.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.188
I bet she's dozing off in the kitchen.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.606
All right.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.484
How do you feel?

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:37.736
It's your long-awaited wedding day.

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.198
It still doesn't feel real

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:45.285
that I've become human
and will be wed to my beloved.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:47.496
Goodness.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.625
Fine, leave me behind
and go live a happy life.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.338
Come here, Eun-ho.
Let me hug you. It's been a while.

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.299
Geum-ho…

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:31.706
This is usually
where old tales end.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:38.046
She finally became human
and married the one she loved.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:42.759
And so, they lived happily ever after.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:44.928
The end.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.015
Get over here!

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.019
Wow, amazing.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.439
Look at this.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.567
These hairpins must be new.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.861
Oh my gosh, they're so pretty!

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:02.988
Don't they look good on me?

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:08.994
- Geum-ho?
- Yes?

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.416
What's got you staring like that?

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.176
Well, look at you.

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:28.263
What?

00:06:29.598 --> 00:06:31.975
So that's why
you wanted to come to the market.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.852
You had an ulterior motive.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.396
It's not like that.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:37.898
If you're done looking, let's go.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:40.442
My lady!

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.824
So we meet again.

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:50.827
Yes, my lord.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.830
What a coincidence running into you.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.843
Be happy, Geum-ho.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.779
But I didn't know then…

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.282
That way!

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.953
…that human life
is endlessly fragile,

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:36.039
and their happiness
shatters far too easily.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.545
That life is hard,
and death is always near.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.883
That was the future that awaited.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:52.973
So in the end,
Geum-ho would not find happiness.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:57.602
All because she loved a human
and chose to become one.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.107
PRESENT DAY

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.529
And so, I became who I am today.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.615
A nine-tailed fox
who refuses to love humans

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.450
and does not seek to become one.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.077
That's who I am.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.044
Why should I want
to become a human?

00:08:23.128 --> 00:08:26.423
So trivial, powerless, aging, sickly,

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.925
and in the end, doomed to die.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.139
Here and now,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.559
one life ends…

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.022
and another begins.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:50.447
And this story began
nine years ago.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.998
EPISODE 1
AN INEVITABLE EVENT

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.626
Here! Over here!

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.919
{\an8}SOSIN HIGH SCHOOL

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:09.049
HYEON WOO-SEOK

00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:10.258
Pass! Over there!

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:11.885
Cover! I'm coming through!

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:12.927
{\an8}NINE YEARS AGO

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.345
{\an8}That's it!

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.140
He's good, isn't he?

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.017
That's Hyeon Woo-seok.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.769
He just became a high school senior.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.443
Since he was
first selected for the U-13 national team,

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.237
he has been the starting striker
across all youth squads.

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:38.286
Hey, Woo-seok! Pass!

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.748
- Pass!
- Cover this side!

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.042
Hey! You crazy idiot!

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.418
Woo-seok was open!

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.921
Stop messing around
and just pass the ball!

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.341
He's asking who that player is.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.759
Which one?

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:57.680
That one.
The one who was messing around earlier.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.225
- That's a foul!
- That's Kang Si-yeol.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.644
Gosh, that kid is just crazy.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:05.188
He's all flash and no substance.
And he never passes.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.315
He tries to do everything himself.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.491
Hey, Si-yeol, you brat! Just tap it in!

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.201
Stop showing off!

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.251
Damn, that little…

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.380
Woo-seok, nice assist.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.132
Assist.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:38.012
You think what a coach says is a joke?

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:41.474
I told you to pass to Woo-seok
whenever you get the ball.

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:47.230
The new youth national team coach
came to watch Woo-seok play today.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.440
The least you could do
is help your friend,

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.526
not get in his way.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.865
How is me scoring a goal
getting in Woo-seok's way?

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:01.119
So why did you have to score a goal?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.080
I told you to play defense today.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.708
When did I tell you to score a goal?

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.586
You got carried away trying to stand out.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:10.795
Straighten up.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:19.053
You've never even paid
your club fees on time,

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.014
and you give me this attitude.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.268
Good work.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:26.853
- Hey, boys.
- Eat up.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.855
Woo-seok's father
is treating us,

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.899
so make sure you thank him
before digging in.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.859
Gosh, Coach.
There's really no need.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.488
- Here, have some more.
- Hey, Kang Si-yeol.

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:38.656
LET'S GO, SOSIN SOCCER CLUB!

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.866
Dad, hold on.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.284
- Sure.
- Hold this.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.871
- Kang Si-yeol.
- It's fine. I don't want any.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.336
Coach.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:53.546
Yes, good to see you.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.590
- Great game today.
- Not at all.

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.968
Here, use this to take the boys out
for a nice dinner next time.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.970
Thank you as always, Mr. Hyeon.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.265
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.269
The contractor for Bannam Zone 2,

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.814
Korea's biggest redevelopment project,
will be named today.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:15.401
With three top-tier construction companies
competing for the contract,

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:19.072
experts say Geumsu Construction,
embroiled in a power abuse scandal,

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.867
is unlikely to win, leaving the other two
as front-runners.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:25.036
- In other news--

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:26.871
Why did you turn it off?

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.707
I was listening to it.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.585
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.
Should I turn it back on?

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:39.342
The real issue isn't abuse of power.
It's subordinates getting out of line.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:42.762
I pay you to drive,
so why aren't you focused on driving?

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.973
Mr. Lee, it's not that--

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:46.474
Are your ears perking up

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:50.228
because they're trashing me on the radio?

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.562
No, sir.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.439
That's not it at all.

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.942
It's a red light.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.653
What the heck?

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:02.073
Watch where you're going!

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.660
2016 SEOUL
BANNAM ZONE 2 PROJECT PLAN

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.456
It fell. What bad luck.

00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:29.392
WELCOME TO THE CONTRACTOR SELECTION
GENERAL MEETING

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.144
Did you drive here yourself?

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.271
I ended up driving myself.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.733
Mr. Lee, there's also
the board's decision to consider.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.109
Are you sure about this?

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:41.070
You mean those old geezers
telling me to stay put?

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.781
There's no need
for you to get involved, sir.

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.659
It was always going to be
a difficult contract to win.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.871
Now there's a risk that
you might have to take all the blame.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.290
This is why you're just an employee.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.379
- Just take off your shirt.
- Yes, sir.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.923
- Should I hire a new driver?
- Sure, whatever.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.718
Just give him some money
so he doesn't run his mouth.

00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:04.927
Yes, sir.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.853
This project is mine.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:17.148
I want every son of a bitch
in the sticks to know

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:20.693
that Lee Yoon of Geumsu Group
personally won a 9.5-trillion-won project.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:24.155
Then those old geezers won't be able
to call me a deadbeat anymore.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:27.241
Mr. Lee.

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:29.869
Now is a crucial time,
with the group's succession on the line.

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.537
If you fail to win the contract--

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:34.540
You know that saying,
"there's nothing money can't buy"?

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.793
I used to think
that was just an expression.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.461
But I was wrong.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.339
There's nothing that money can't solve.

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:44.300
Seriously, anything's possible with money.

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:55.603
Dear fellow members
of the Bannam Zone 2 union,

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.564
To begin, we,
the executive team of Yeoni Construction,

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.275
would like to extend our deepest respects
to the union members.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:04.487
BANNAM ZONE 2 CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PLAN

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.575
What, a deep bow? Give me a break.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:13.871
YEONI CONSTRUCTION

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:22.588
I'm sorry, sir.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:26.843
Hey, what did you do?

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.886
- Aren't they starting?
- What's going on?

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.557
- Jeez.
- What are they doing?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.061
What's this?
Did they hire another celebrity?

00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.271
My dear humans.

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:40.106
Allow me to intrude for a bit.

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.357
What is going on right now?

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:42.733
- What…
- Who's she?

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.193
It's a little noisy.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.947
Don't panic.
Starting now, you will lose your voices.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.952
Now, everyone focus on me.

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:54.162
Don't think of anything else.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.637
Ah, ah.

00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:14.557
I'm sure you're all very busy,
so I'll make this quick.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:19.437
You must all be stressing over
who to vote for to make more money.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.482
But really, does it even matter
who builds the new Bannam-dong apartments?

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.400
Don't overthink it.

00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:28.362
Everyone on the left side,
just vote for Geumsu Construction.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:30.865
As for everyone on the right,
do as you please.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:32.825
Well then.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.496
Oh, right.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:37.955
Honestly, I feel a little bad.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:41.876
I have a general idea of how much
you humans love your apartments.

00:16:42.543 --> 00:16:45.463
But what can I do?
I have to make money too.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.798
I'm sure you all understand
since we all love money.

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.800
Right? Bye then.

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.977
You. Follow me.

00:17:34.345 --> 00:17:36.556
Oh dear.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.310
Goodness.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.895
- Grandma, let me.
- What?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:47.024
All right, let's go.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.780
I scored a goal today.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.991
Oh my, well done.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.911
- Is that it?
- What else should I say?

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.122
I'm just saying "well done"
because you did well.

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:03.749
My goodness, Grandma.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:06.919
If you keep this up,
I won't spoil you when I'm older.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:11.299
I don't care about that.

00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:13.301
Well, I care.

00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:14.802
Just you wait.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.806
By the way, when do we need to pay
this month's soccer club fee?

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.852
I told you not to worry about that.

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:25.980
I'm exempt from the fees.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.773
I'm the star player, you know.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:31.611
Still,
that's not how things should be.

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:34.572
Grandma, haven't you heard
of a full scholarship?

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.658
I don't have to pay a single penny.

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.535
Gosh, really?

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:42.079
Oh, my little boy, I'm so proud of you.

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.759
- Enjoy your meal. Take care.
- Thank you.

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.719
Here you go. Be safe!

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.099
Enjoy your meal.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.517
SPEEDY DELIVERY SERVICE

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.151
Thank you.

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:32.838
What are you doing at this hour?

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:38.010
What about you?
And what's with that outfit?

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.138
I'm working my part-time job.

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:43.724
- What?
- I've got my eye on some cleats.

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:47.186
Jeez, you should be spending
your time practicing.

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.230
Just ask your parents for the cleats.

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:53.693
Hmm?

00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.907
- Hey, wanna make a bet?
- Jeez.

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:03.703
Okay.

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:05.413
What are the stakes?

00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:34.942
Oh!

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.071
- Hey, that was a clear foul!
- Goal!

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.781
You're out.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.165
Goal!

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.375
- Left.
- Right.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:20:59.967
It went in, right?

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:03.053
Goal!

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:09.894
Nice.

00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:14.023
Mm.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:21.280
I was wondering why you were playing
like your life depended on it.

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:23.491
But is that it? A chicken breast?

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:25.242
I wasn't playing like that.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.328
I just crushed you with my skills.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.332
What? Are you hurt?

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.542
Hey, just hurry up and eat.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.795
I want to get a few more deliveries in.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:38.464
Mm.

00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:42.301
What, is this your thing?

00:21:42.384 --> 00:21:43.886
A lazy genius?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.057
I mean, you don't seem to be taking
private lessons like everyone else.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.809
And you're working part-time at this hour.

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:53.854
But seeing you in action…

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.818
You asshole!

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.403
Hey.

00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:03.572
A poor genius.

00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:05.199
What?

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:08.202
You got the genius part right,
but I'm a bit short on cash.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.830
My parents aren't around,

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:12.331
and my grandma's sick.

00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.042
I see.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:18.045
So while you're practicing,
I have to be out making money.

00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:19.755
Hey, I didn't know--

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:21.924
But you know what's really important here?

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:26.887
Despite all that,
without any of those damn private lessons,

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:29.515
I still managed to kick your ass today.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:32.142
You saw the goal I scored
during practice today, right?

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:35.855
Yeah, I saw it, you punk.

00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:38.774
So don't get too cocky
just because you're on the national team.

00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:42.862
When you get called up,
I'm gonna take your spot as striker.

00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:43.904
Mm.

00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:47.575
When you get back, the starting lineup
might be totally different.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.077
Why am I even talking to you?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.036
Jeez.

00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:53.831
Man, that's good.

00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:57.293
You really don't want any?

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:58.836
I don't eat stuff like that.

00:23:10.598 --> 00:23:12.057
Why aren't you eating?

00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:15.311
That poor cow died for nothing.

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:16.770
I don't have an appetite.

00:23:16.854 --> 00:23:19.064
I told you,
there's nothing to worry about.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.275
This is important to me.

00:23:22.902 --> 00:23:25.362
I'm sure it is.

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:27.323
You acted like a deadbeat,

00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.658
and now you're
on your rich father's bad side.

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.410
And now your position as heir is at risk.

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.456
You seem pretty interested
in human affairs.

00:23:35.956 --> 00:23:37.374
Because I've taken a liking to you.

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:41.086
You're rich,
and you look like a troublemaker.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.464
I think you're going to become
a repeat customer.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:45.341
Since we're on the subject,

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:48.594
who are your other clients besides me?

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:53.223
You seem pretty interested
in nine-tailed fox affairs.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.770
Can I have this one too?

00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:03.025
I guess that's a secret.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.988
Then, what exactly are you capable of?

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.951
Judging by the fact that you need money,

00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:14.453
it seems you can't do whatever you want.

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:18.040
Shouldn't I know
what you can and can't do

00:24:19.249 --> 00:24:20.584
if I'm going to hire you again?

00:24:21.877 --> 00:24:23.796
Humans are always like this.

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:27.883
All right, let me explain something.

00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:40.896
What is this?

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:43.941
Where am I?

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:47.277
I guess calling you a "customer"
gave you the wrong idea.

00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:49.989
That if you just give me money,
you can order me to do anything

00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:51.532
and ask for whatever you want.

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:03.585
Simply put,

00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:06.213
think of this less as making requests
and more like praying.

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:10.217
Whether or not I grant your wish
is up to me.

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.970
And how I choose to grant it
is also up to me.

00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:15.389
How much I take,
and what I take as payment,

00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:17.516
is obviously up to me as well.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:20.310
I'm the one who asks questions, not you.

00:25:20.394 --> 00:25:24.273
Even what you're allowed to know,
and how much, is up to me.

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:28.485
Do you understand now?

00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:31.488
I'm telling you not to get cocky.

00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:33.907
You pathetic little human.

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:41.248
But since we're on the subject,
I'll tell you one thing.

00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:43.459
I have only one principle.

00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.794
I avoid doing
even the smallest of good deeds

00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:47.713
and only avoid doing major misdeeds.

00:25:50.966 --> 00:25:53.135
Looks like you didn't get it.

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:55.971
This is important,
so I'll break it down for you.

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:59.141
I don't do good deeds.
No matter how trivial.

00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:03.062
I can't risk cultivating more virtue
and accidentally becoming human.

00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:05.773
As for wrongdoings,
I only avoid major ones.

00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:07.858
Things like…

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.611
killing people.

00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:12.821
That's the only thing I avoid.

00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:16.617
I'm trying to avoid becoming human,
not trying to diminish my spiritual power.

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:20.454
SECRETARY CHOI

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.210
You can go now.

00:26:27.795 --> 00:26:31.048
The voting results are out.
You should go get your picture taken.

00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:33.133
Nothing beats a photo for showing off.

00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:37.179
By the way, I already took the money
from the trunk of your car.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.556
So don't worry about it.

00:27:20.597 --> 00:27:24.601
A human's life
is like swimming in a sea of suffering.

00:27:26.562 --> 00:27:29.648
From the moment they're thrown
into this unfamiliar world

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.317
until they rot away to nothing,

00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:35.529
humans can never find
even a moment of peace.

00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:40.868
Life is a constant competition.

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:44.788
It's a battlefield

00:27:44.872 --> 00:27:47.499
where they can only climb up
by dragging others down.

00:27:50.919 --> 00:27:53.797
And it's a hamster wheel
that never stops turning.

00:27:57.384 --> 00:28:00.888
Human happiness
is but a fleeting illusion,

00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:05.058
and such is the human condition
I have observed for hundreds of years.

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:10.606
But in contrast to that,
my life as a nine-tailed fox

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:13.066
is like a festival that never ends.

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:28.790
Hey.

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:32.127
Yes?

00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:34.630
All the kids these days
seem to dress like you.

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:37.174
I used to dress like that 20 years ago.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:40.010
- I guess it's back in style.
- Excuse me?

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.011
You.

00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:43.347
Come shopping with me today.

00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:44.973
Why should I?

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:47.226
Because I like the way you dress.

00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:50.103
Besides, it's boring to shop alone.

00:28:50.646 --> 00:28:53.774
Think of yourself
as a friend for the day, if you will.

00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:56.026
What the heck?

00:28:56.109 --> 00:28:57.778
What a weirdo.

00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:01.240
Listen to me.

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:04.034
You're going to hang out with me today.

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.037
Yes, of course.

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:11.833
So, you're saying
you're a nine-tailed fox?

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:13.293
Really?

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:15.796
Come on, a nine-tailed fox?

00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:18.048
There's no such thing.

00:29:18.131 --> 00:29:20.467
You'd believe me if I used sorcery
and showed you my tails,

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.219
but I can't be bothered.

00:29:23.387 --> 00:29:26.473
Just believe it. I'm a nine-tailed fox.

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:29.559
Oh, okay.

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:34.273
Oh my! Those look great on you too.

00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:35.649
You think so?

00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:36.775
I'll take these too.

00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:41.697
Hey, I have a question.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.781
What is it?

00:29:42.864 --> 00:29:46.159
"Aren't nine-tailed foxes
supposed to eat human livers

00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:49.246
and seduce men to drain their life force?"

00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:51.123
Yes, how did you know?

00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:53.583
It was obvious.

00:29:53.667 --> 00:29:57.004
Do you think you're the first human
to ask me such questions?

00:29:57.713 --> 00:30:00.340
Do you know how people
in the Joseon era used to speak?

00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:02.843
You think they were like…

00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:04.803
"Your Majesty,"

00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.013
"How insolent"?

00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:08.515
Do you really think that?

00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:09.516
They didn't?

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:12.477
That's all just made up
by those TV people.

00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:16.064
It's not as if they actually
lived through that era like I did.

00:30:16.148 --> 00:30:18.275
So how would they know?

00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:22.070
You make something up,
and humans just believe it.

00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:25.073
Same with the tales
about nine-tailed foxes.

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:27.117
My goodness, that's truly amazing.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.829
Look at everything happening
inside that little box.

00:30:30.912 --> 00:30:33.457
My goodness, how fascinating!

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.916
RETURN OF THE LEGEND
NINE-TAILED FOX

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.169
People didn't think of us in this way

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:39.379
before that damn Return of the Legend.

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:54.102
Oh my gosh.
That scared the life out of me.

00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:59.691
When humans cultivate themselves,
they're called sages,

00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:01.902
while animals that do so
are called spirit beasts.

00:31:01.985 --> 00:31:05.280
So why do foxes cultivating themselves
to become human get treated like monsters?

00:31:05.364 --> 00:31:09.326
Do they think it's easy to self-cultivate
and train until we grow nine tails?

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:11.370
Nine-tailed foxes cultivate themselves?

00:31:11.453 --> 00:31:14.956
Yes, just like how sages self-cultivate
and train to become immortals,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.793
nine-tailed foxes have to self-cultivate
and train to become humans.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:18.752
Think about it.

00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:21.546
Why would a nine-tailed fox,
who's self-cultivating and building karma,

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.048
hunt human livers? If they did that,

00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:25.217
they would lose
all the spiritual power they've earned.

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:28.637
Oh, I see.

00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:31.932
You must have felt so misunderstood.

00:31:32.015 --> 00:31:34.226
Anyway, that's all in the past.

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.853
I'm the only nine-tailed fox
left on Earth now.

00:31:36.937 --> 00:31:40.816
I've lost all desire to be human,
so I have no reason to cultivate myself.

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:42.692
You're not trying
to become human?

00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:44.611
But you're a nine-tailed fox. How come?

00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:46.738
Because I love the way I live now.

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.783
Sometimes, humans get the wrong idea.

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:53.120
They think that living forever
would be tedious and boring.

00:31:53.203 --> 00:31:56.331
But when you actually experience it,
there's never a dull moment

00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:58.500
because the human world changes so fast.

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:02.796
There's always something new and fun.

00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:08.385

00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:29.281
This looks like it'd be fun.

00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:33.201
"I am a girl."

00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:36.413
"I am a girl."

00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:40.083
"You are a boy."

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.419
"You are a boy."

00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:44.629
Okay, you ladies are doing a great job.

00:32:44.713 --> 00:32:47.299
Now, let's practice with each other. Okay?

00:32:49.342 --> 00:32:51.928
What did that Westerner just say?

00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:55.682
Hey, Teacher.

00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:58.643
Speak our language.
I can't understand a single word.

00:33:01.605 --> 00:33:02.981
What did you just say?

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:07.736
How am I suddenly speaking
in Joseon language?

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.571
Oh, Lord!

The main character dies?

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:33.136
What kind of ending is this?

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.554
Hey, you. Comic artist.

00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:36.848
Hey, comic artist!

00:33:39.893 --> 00:33:41.353
Who are you?

00:33:42.979 --> 00:33:44.523
What's with this ending?

00:33:44.606 --> 00:33:46.775
Is this the best you could do?

00:33:47.317 --> 00:33:48.527

Ah, ah! Ah!

Hey, stop it! Stop following me!

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:28.942
Ah!

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:33.488
You're such a cheap player.

00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:36.575
Stop beating me.

00:34:37.242 --> 00:34:38.660
Please, just stop.

00:34:56.678 --> 00:34:58.805
Hey, don't make it so obvious!

00:34:58.888 --> 00:35:00.432
It's no fun now.

00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:02.517
Do your best, okay?

00:35:03.143 --> 00:35:05.186
Play better, but not to win.

00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:07.188
Is that so hard?

00:35:07.272 --> 00:35:08.940
But, seriously,

00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:11.109
is it really fun to live like that?

00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:12.861
What?

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:16.114
I mean, what you're saying is
that in all that time,

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:18.366
you've never actually
accomplished anything.

00:35:19.326 --> 00:35:20.869
What is that supposed to mean?

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:22.621
You don't think
I've accomplished anything?

00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:25.248
I've learned everything
and played every game there is.

00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:29.252
But no matter what you've learned,
you haven't followed through.

00:35:29.336 --> 00:35:32.130
If there's something you don't like,
you just change it all.

00:35:32.213 --> 00:35:34.549
- Or just scrap it.
- It's not like that.

00:35:34.633 --> 00:35:36.968
And you don't have any friends
to shop and chat with,

00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:38.553
so you just grab a random person and--

00:35:38.637 --> 00:35:39.846
I said it's not like that!

00:35:40.597 --> 00:35:42.849
Hey, take my side.

00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:44.017
No matter what.

00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:48.730
I envy you.

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:50.398
I wish I could live like you.

00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:54.778
Just spending money and having fun
without a care in the world.

00:35:56.029 --> 00:35:57.322
What?

00:35:57.906 --> 00:35:59.199
Yes? What is it?

00:36:00.283 --> 00:36:02.952
Forget it. Just finish your food.

00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:05.330
I really chose
the wrong person for this.

00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:09.334
Can't she read the room at all?

00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:29.688
What is it?

00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:32.023
Why did you drag me out on a weekend?

00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:34.526
Pick one. Whichever.

00:36:35.402 --> 00:36:36.319
What?

00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:40.031
You said there were cleats
you wanted to buy.

00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:42.992
Don't save up with your part-time job.
Just pick them now.

00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:47.539
And if I do?
You're going to buy them for me?

00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.249
No.

00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.919
I happen to have
a sponsorship deal with this brand.

00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:55.046
It's a sponsorship
worth 20 million won a year,

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.549
but I can't use all of it
by myself anyway.

00:36:58.299 --> 00:36:59.426
A sponsorship deal?

00:37:00.093 --> 00:37:01.594
But you're not even a pro.

00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:06.433
Dude, I'm a top prospect
for the youth national team.

00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:10.019
They signed me a few years ago.

00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:14.816
Are you going to pick one or not?

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.651
Do you think I'm a beggar?

00:37:17.736 --> 00:37:18.820
What?

00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:20.613
I'm fine.

00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:23.742
I'm leaving.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.495
Hey…

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:29.289
SONGWONGAK CHINESE RESTAURANT

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.376
That was so delicious.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.419
Yeah, I guess you--

00:37:39.132 --> 00:37:42.635
Humans are so pathetically weak.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.393
Get up. Is anything broken?

00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:52.520
No…

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:56.733
No, that's not it.

00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:00.236
What happened?

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.864
But are you okay?

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.158
We ran into each other pretty hard.

00:38:05.241 --> 00:38:08.453
You should try exercising
instead of just burying yourself in books.

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:09.954
You're pathetic for a guy your size.

00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:11.080
Just go.

00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:13.583
Oh…

00:38:16.753 --> 00:38:18.129
My apologies.

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:34.771
KING RAMYEON

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.950
How interesting.

00:38:47.575 --> 00:38:48.493
What is?

00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:50.453
That human over there.

00:38:50.537 --> 00:38:53.665
I think he'll become quite famous
in the near future.

00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:56.084
Famous?

00:38:56.584 --> 00:38:57.544
Which one of the two?

00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:58.920
That one over there.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.758
I see.

00:39:03.842 --> 00:39:06.761
But how do you know things like that?

00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:08.137
I just do.

00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:11.391
I sometimes see fragments of the future.

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.726
I can't see them whenever I want.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:18.398
I don't know when, why, or what I'll see,

00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:22.193
but whatever I see is inevitable.

00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:32.579
That way!

00:39:36.291 --> 00:39:39.794
Even I can't do anything to change it.

00:39:43.172 --> 00:39:46.509
Anyway, that guy will become rich
and famous at some point.

00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:48.720
So he might become one of my clients.

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:49.929
Oh, right.

00:39:50.013 --> 00:39:54.684
You said you grant rich people's wishes
and get paid for it, didn't you?

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.312
Then, maybe you could grant my wish too?

00:39:58.813 --> 00:39:59.939
You think I would do that?

00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:03.318
You don't have nearly enough
to become my client.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.279
But starting today, we're friends.

00:40:06.362 --> 00:40:08.948
Don't you have, like,
a discount for friends and family?

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:11.743
Humans never fail to disappoint.

00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:16.289
This is exactly why I don't bother
with troublesome human relationships.

00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:17.373
I told you earlier.

00:40:17.457 --> 00:40:19.542
You're just a friend for the day.

00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:20.501
What?

00:40:20.585 --> 00:40:22.378
What that means is…

00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:25.465
…you're going to forget

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:28.009
everything you did with me today,
everything we talked about,

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:31.721
and even my very existence.

00:40:31.804 --> 00:40:33.097
Understand?

00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:34.432
Yes, I understand.

00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:36.601
Anyway, I had fun today.

00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:37.936
You should get going too.

00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:50.365
Hey, you guys.

00:40:52.492 --> 00:40:53.785
Come carry this for me.

00:41:12.887 --> 00:41:15.181
You're a beast cultivating yourself.

00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:17.433
What in the world are you doing here?

00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:37.203
Hey.

00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:39.789
Are you really mad?

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.962
Look, it wasn't because
I felt sorry for you.

00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:49.340
Hey, come on.

00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:54.012
I'm sorry.

00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:59.851
I guess now that I think about it,
I did feel sorry for you.

00:42:01.144 --> 00:42:04.564
But it's not because I think
I'm better than you or anything.

00:42:04.647 --> 00:42:08.735
I just wanted to help you out
after what you told me.

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:11.654
Hey.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.657
- What?
- Wanna kick the ball around a bit?

00:42:14.741 --> 00:42:16.117
What?

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:18.703
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:22.623
Sure, bring it on.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.469
At cafés, you have to buy
one drink per person.

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:36.804
That's the rule
in the human world these days.

00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:38.806
I'm…

00:42:39.348 --> 00:42:44.812
…a being far greater
than any rule made by humans.

00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:46.314
I'm sure you are.

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:48.816
After all,
you're the Deity of the Big Dipper.

00:42:50.818 --> 00:42:54.739
What brings you here all of a sudden,
interrupting my hobby like this?

00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:58.034
You call that a hobby?

00:42:58.117 --> 00:43:02.080
Of course. There isn't anything
more human and fun than spending money.

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:09.087
If you enjoy living like a human so much,

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.299
why won't you become one,
while deceiving the eyes of Heaven?

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.552
You're missing the point.

00:43:16.636 --> 00:43:18.554
Who said I want to live like a human?

00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:20.640
Squeezing into the subway to go to work

00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:22.725
and working for over ten hours a day,

00:43:23.351 --> 00:43:25.353
only to collapse into sleep
from exhaustion.

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:29.690
Even if you make a few bucks like that,
you don't have time to spend it.

00:43:30.316 --> 00:43:32.735
That's what it means to be human.

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:36.155
A moment of sweetness,
and a lifetime of bitterness.

00:43:38.324 --> 00:43:42.829
But life as a nine-tailed fox is kind of
like spending money on a pay-to-win game.

00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:46.332
You get to enjoy all the fun stuff
without any of the inconvenience.

00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:51.379
I wonder if the big shots up there
would even understand what I'm saying.

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.339
Since they're just so divine and all.

00:43:54.132 --> 00:43:55.925
You're still wicked and irreverent.

00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:58.678
Oh, whatever.

00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:01.264
Anyway, I don't think we're
on good enough terms to sit and chat.

00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:04.851
Let's just get straight to the point,
Lord Pagun.

00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:05.977
So?

00:44:07.228 --> 00:44:08.646
You want me to become human already?

00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:11.190
Are you asking why I'm still like this

00:44:11.274 --> 00:44:13.693
when all the other nine-tailed foxes
have already become human,

00:44:13.776 --> 00:44:16.195
lived out their lives, and died?

00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:20.658
I refuse.

00:44:20.741 --> 00:44:23.119
If that's all, I can go now, right?

00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:25.830
I'm going to go home
and unbox my new stuff.

00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:27.373
Your scale

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.542
is tipping.

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:38.926
That can't be.

00:44:40.136 --> 00:44:43.306
I put an insane amount of effort
into keeping that balance aligned.

00:44:43.973 --> 00:44:47.768
I even earn my own money
just to appease all of you up there.

00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:49.854
So how could the scale be tipping?

00:44:49.937 --> 00:44:52.982
There will come a time
when you must choose.

00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:55.651
Whether to become human

00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:59.739
or be forever annihilated.

00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:05.828
Don't make me laugh.

00:45:05.912 --> 00:45:09.248
They may be deities,
but how dare they threaten me?

00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:13.628
Let them try.

00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:18.633
Do they still think I'm the same
naive fox who believed everything

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:20.635
the ones above told me?

00:45:21.177 --> 00:45:22.720
They won't get their way.

00:45:22.803 --> 00:45:26.432
Even you guys don't really get
the so-called Law of Heaven, do you?

00:45:26.515 --> 00:45:29.310
Because it's so vague and messed up.

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:32.355
Well, there's one thing
I know for certain.

00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:35.483
"Heaven's net is vast and wide,
yet nothing slips through."

00:45:36.776 --> 00:45:39.695
You may think
you're outside of Heaven's influence,

00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:41.781
but nothing ever escapes notice.

00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:45.368
Ha!

00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:47.745
Save the sermon.

00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.880
That was Daoist teaching, actually.

00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:03.427
Excuse me.

00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:06.847
- Get up!
- Get up!

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:08.182
Mr. Lee!

00:46:08.266 --> 00:46:10.101
We love you!

00:46:10.184 --> 00:46:12.603
You're the only boss we have, sir!

00:46:14.272 --> 00:46:17.525
Lee Yoon!

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.568
What was that? I can't hear you.

00:46:19.652 --> 00:46:20.736
Louder!

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:26.575
Lee Yoon!

00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:28.327
Everyone, drink up!

00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:30.204
Drink up!

00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:48.431
Nice.

00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:57.565
Hey, are you okay?

00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:00.818
Gosh, let's call it a day.

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:02.611
Hey, it's my turn though.

00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:06.198
Damn it.

00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:09.035
Fine.

00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:17.752
Unbelievable.

00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:20.463
I can't believe they're still
trying to boss me around at my age.

00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:21.839
Today just keeps getting worse--

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.593
What? Who was that?

00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:35.770
Wow, it was like a missile.

00:47:35.853 --> 00:47:39.273
Hey, I'll go find the ball.
You go on ahead.

00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:41.859
- I'll come with you.
- It's fine. You go.

00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:43.569
Bye.

00:47:51.035 --> 00:47:52.661
Man, where did it go?

00:47:55.289 --> 00:47:56.624
Was it you?

00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:01.253
Are you the owner of this ball?

00:48:01.337 --> 00:48:02.421
Yes, I am.

00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:03.923
Thank you.

00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:09.095
- Wait.
- No need to thank me.

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.603
- Hey--
- Go. We're done here.

00:48:17.686 --> 00:48:18.938
Excuse me!

00:48:22.525 --> 00:48:24.902
Wait, you're that kid from earlier.

00:48:24.985 --> 00:48:28.114
Were you kicking a ball around this late
because I told you to get some exercise?

00:48:28.197 --> 00:48:30.783
You don't look it,
but you're quite obedient.

00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:32.284
What is she talking about?

00:48:32.368 --> 00:48:35.287
Anyway, you shouldn't go around
popping other people's balls.

00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:37.456
Well, I couldn't pop your head, could I?

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.166
Since I'm a self-cultivated beast.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.793
Unbelievable.

00:48:43.504 --> 00:48:44.547
Hold on.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.382
They don't usually pop that easily.

00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:48.008
It's not some kind of balloon--

00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:50.719
That's because you are a weak human.

00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:52.179
What did you say?

00:48:52.263 --> 00:48:54.765
Wait, who do you keep calling weak?

00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:56.934
Can't you tell just by looking?

00:48:57.017 --> 00:48:57.935
I'm an athlete.

00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.020
Is that so?

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:01.439
I may not be much now,

00:49:01.522 --> 00:49:04.608
but in a few years,
I'm going to be a really famous athlete.

00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:05.943
Right.

00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:08.988
I don't think so.

00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:10.948
- What?
- Famous?

00:49:11.031 --> 00:49:13.534
Which one of the two?

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.453
That one over there.

00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:18.289
Maybe your friend, but not you.

00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:19.540
I saw it earlier.

00:49:20.082 --> 00:49:21.250
What are you--

00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:23.669
Your friend is going to be very famous.

00:49:23.752 --> 00:49:26.338
He'll be a world-class player
and make a lot of money too.

00:49:26.422 --> 00:49:30.301
I'm certain. The future
never changes after I've seen it.

00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:32.094
But as for you…

00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:35.222
Hmm…

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.018
I don't see anything at all.

00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:42.354
Who are you to say that?

00:49:42.438 --> 00:49:44.190
You don't know anything about me!

00:49:44.732 --> 00:49:47.359
You'll just be a nobody.

00:49:47.443 --> 00:49:51.697
You might become a mediocre player
no one remembers,

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.365
but any success beyond that…

00:49:55.075 --> 00:49:56.911
It's just not in your future.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.372
So don't get your hopes up
and dream too big.

00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:02.166
That way, you won't get hurt.

00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:03.459
This…

00:50:03.542 --> 00:50:05.628
This woman is a complete lunatic.

00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:07.838
It's cruel, I know.

00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:11.217
But that's just how human life is.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.636
It's not like life is being
especially cruel to you.

00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:15.054
So don't take it too hard.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:23.437
Man, I did it! Damn it!

00:50:24.146 --> 00:50:27.149
I'm Lee Yoon. Who's going to stop me?

00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:32.863
Move! Damn it!

00:50:32.947 --> 00:50:34.073
Whoa!

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.179
- Did you hear that?
- I don't know.

00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:58.681
Maybe there was an accident.

00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:01.183
It has nothing to do with me.

00:51:09.692 --> 00:51:13.112
Oh no, oh no… What…

00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:21.287
I have to get out of here.

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:28.252
Hey!

00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:30.629
Stop! I said stop!

00:51:31.547 --> 00:51:33.299
Damn it.

00:51:33.382 --> 00:51:36.302
I said stop!

00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:43.475
Woo-seok!

00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:45.394
Woo-seok!

00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:49.023
Woo-seok.

00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:00.451
OPERATING ROOM

00:52:03.245 --> 00:52:04.663
You can't come in.

00:52:14.256 --> 00:52:15.924
PLEASE DISPOSE OF TRASH HERE

00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:17.176
Damn it.

00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:19.595
Jeez.

00:52:23.223 --> 00:52:24.933
Seriously.

00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:29.730
What am I going to do?

00:52:40.282 --> 00:52:41.950
It'll probably be fine.

00:52:48.874 --> 00:52:51.877
He seemed drunk.
He was stumbling when he walked.

00:52:52.628 --> 00:52:56.131
So you suspect
he was intoxicated.

00:52:56.674 --> 00:52:59.218
Okay, we've requested
all the security footage from the area,

00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:00.969
so we'll identify the vehicle owner soon.

00:53:08.227 --> 00:53:10.729
- How may I help you?
- Well, I…

00:53:11.355 --> 00:53:12.564
Yesterday, I…

00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:16.860
ran someone over.

00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:22.658
Bong-chang just went to turn himself in.

00:53:24.493 --> 00:53:27.579
There won't be
any problems for you, sir.

00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:31.041
It's not him.

00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:32.459
It wasn't this guy.

00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:33.961
I saw him.

00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.463
- Sir.
- Yes?

00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:39.717
Are you sure
you were the one driving?

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.929
Yes. I secretly took a company car out,

00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:46.598
- and made a mistake--
- You're lying.

00:53:46.682 --> 00:53:49.268
You weren't the one
who caused the accident.

00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:51.103
I saw everything!

00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:53.814
Why are you lying? Seriously!

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.482
Let go of me!

00:53:55.566 --> 00:53:57.234
Sir, we have a problem.

00:53:57.317 --> 00:53:59.445
Bong-chang just called.

00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:04.199
He said he couldn't bring himself to lie
and asked if we could just forget the deal

00:54:04.283 --> 00:54:06.660
in exchange for returning
all the money we gave him.

00:54:06.744 --> 00:54:09.246
What are you talking about?
Why the sudden change?

00:54:09.329 --> 00:54:10.456
He said there was a witness.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.837
Bring that bastard here right now.

00:54:20.174 --> 00:54:22.593
- There's one more thing--
- What is it this time?

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:25.554
I received a call from the police station.

00:54:25.637 --> 00:54:29.224
They said you also need to come in
for questioning as a witness, sir.

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.776
How the hell are you…

00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:41.737
Damn it!

00:54:43.489 --> 00:54:45.032
How could you handle this so poorly?

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.659
I apologize, sir.

00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:55.417
Get out.

00:54:56.752 --> 00:54:57.878
Pardon?

00:54:59.254 --> 00:55:01.089
I'll handle it myself from now on.

00:55:01.173 --> 00:55:02.257
Get out.

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:05.344
Mm-hmm.

00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:13.268
Jeez.

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.910
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

00:55:51.974 --> 00:55:53.892
Wow.

00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:56.311
It's you again.

00:56:04.361 --> 00:56:08.031
It must be nice to be rich,
summoning me again after just one day.

00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:10.284
Maybe I didn't charge you
enough yesterday.

00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:17.124
This time, it's a very simple job.
But it's urgent.

00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:18.834
What a shame.

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:21.837
I was thinking of taking a break
for about ten years.

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.884
An annoying old geezer
has been pestering me lately.

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:30.387
So, I'm rejecting your request.

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:34.474
I'll pay you double
what I gave you yesterday.

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:38.103
I guess I'll rest
after I handle this quickly.

00:56:38.186 --> 00:56:39.104
What is it?

00:56:39.187 --> 00:56:43.400
URI GARAM HOSPITAL

00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:11.053
Who are you?

00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:16.224
You again?

00:57:16.308 --> 00:57:18.644
It seems we're deeply connected by fate.

00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:21.980
The soccer ball from yesterday, right?

00:57:24.066 --> 00:57:25.651
But how did you know I was here?

00:57:25.734 --> 00:57:26.735
Right.

00:57:29.071 --> 00:57:31.406
I'm here to tweak your memory a bit.

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.616
What?

00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:35.452
Look straight at me. Don't look away.

00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:43.752
About what you saw last night…

00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:08.944
Wait a minute.

00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:11.279
This can't be happening.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.661
No way.

00:58:19.454 --> 00:58:21.707
Their fates have switched?

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:28.338
What is this now?

00:58:28.422 --> 00:58:30.465
You're still wicked and irreverent.

00:58:32.759 --> 00:58:34.928
Your scale

00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:36.763
is tipping.

00:59:58.678 --> 01:00:00.138
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:03.350
{\an8} I said I lost a huge chunk
of my spiritual power.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.811
{\an8}- You're going to help me.

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.229
{\an8}I mean, what are you exactly?

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:08.605
{\an8} This beauty. And this mystique.

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:10.482
{\an8}- A demon?
A nine-tailed fox!

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:13.443
{\an8}But no matter how much
I think about it, I just don't get it.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.070
{\an8}What did I do that was so wrong?

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.781
{\an8}A human has died. Because of you.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.199
{\an8}Who are we?

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.724
{\an8}Kang Si-yeol.
How much does he really make?

01:00:21.815 --> 01:00:23.787
{\an8}Apparently,
he makes 500 million won a week.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.831
{\an8}I'm so proud that I am me.

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:27.249
{\an8}Long time no see, Si-yeol.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.376
{\an8}- Did he seriously not recognize me?

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.669
{\an8}

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:34.089
{\an8}You want to catch that hit-and-run driver
and make him pay, right?

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.842
{\an8}I killed someone!

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:39.427
{\an8}- Jeez!
So, tell me. Whatever it is.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:40.720
{\an8}What's your wish?

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.015
