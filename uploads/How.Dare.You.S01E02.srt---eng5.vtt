[How dare you!?]

[Episode 2]

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.550
[Kunyu Palace]

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.210
Your Highness.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.140
Consort Yu sent a message

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.560
that she'll come to Kunyu Palace
after noon.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.690
Did she mention why?

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:50.280
No.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.430
In the book, Yu Wanyin

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.690
framed others in the harem
and committed all kinds of evil.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.289
Xie Yong'er was completely
under her control.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.310
She was the one behind

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.590
my drowning in the pond earlier.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.080
I haven't yet had the chance
to take revenge,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.280
and now this enemy is delivering herself
right to my door.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.810
Since that's the case,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.079
help me find a way

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.440
to deliver this sachet to Prince Duan.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.420
And after that,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.520
prepare something for me.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.530
No wonder the flowers here grow better

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.280
than other places
in this imperial palace, Yong'er.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.880
So you tend to them yourself.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.590
Lady Yu, how kind of you to come visit.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.790
Please forgive me for

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.630
not welcoming you properly.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.130
Why didn't you announce
Consort Yu's arrival?

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.560
I saw you were so focused on gardening,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.710
so I didn't want to disturb you.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.640
Don't blame her.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.120
I do enjoy tending to
these flowers and plants,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.360
but it's nothing worthy of notice—

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.870
merely a pastime.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.880
Is that so?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.710
We both came here through time traveling.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.040
Why is it that only you speak
with such an affected tone?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.900
This kind of pointless small talk

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.840
is really a bit awkward.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.540
Mei,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.560
a new batch of peonies
has just arrived at the flower house.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.000
Let's go get some to display
in the bedchamber.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.430
But my lady...

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.130
Don't mind me. Go ahead.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.190
I've just made some osmanthus pastries.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.920
Please try some, Lady Yu.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.510
They're not poisoned, are they?

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.079
Logically speaking, the chosen one

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.680
wouldn't resort to something so crude.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.180
If her intelligence is really that low,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.980
then she's hardly worth
trying to turn to our side.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.750
These pastries are perfectly crumbly
without falling apart.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.000
Your skills are truly remarkable, Yong'er.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's just that...

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.760
I've been having a toothache lately

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.290
and can't eat sweet things.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.600
Then, Lady Yu,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.620
please have some more tea.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.840
It seems she does have
some sophisticated moves.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.510
But if I keep testing her like this,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.970
it will never end, will it?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.159
I'd better turn her quickly.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.310
What brings you here today,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.240
Lady Yu?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.290
My dear Yong'er.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.070
Don't even get me started.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.870
All these titles
like consort and concubine,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.590
they all amount to the same thing
in the end.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.390
If His Majesty

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.040
can raise you to the heavens today,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.800
he can cast you into hell tomorrow.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.920
His favor and hatred are nothing
more than a whim.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.430
Lady Yu.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.690
In this palace,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.770
we still have to be careful with
our words.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.710
I trust you won't tell anyone, Yong'er.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.070
In this kind of place, we women

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.040
are nothing more than
pawns to be manipulated.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040
If we don't look out for one another,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.160
wouldn't that just be playing into
those wretched men's hands?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.510
What is she trying to do?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.830
Suddenly cozying up to me for no reason.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.240
Did she get what I meant?

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.610
I thought I made myself clear enough.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.040
Girl,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.890
stop being lovestruck.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.270
Forget about men.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.830
I know

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.820
it's lonely at the top.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.720
I understand that you were just
feeling sentimental

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.950
for a moment, Lady Yu.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.710
What you said just now

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.090
doesn't really count.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.570
How could it not count?

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.510
I've also made some red bean pastries.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.640
I'll go get them now.

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.290
But I haven't finished talking yet...

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.790
All that effort for nothing.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.600
She really is just a mindless
2D character.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.380
She'll never break out of
her programmed settings.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.100
Suddenly cozying up to me for no reason—

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.740
it's nothing but

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.280
an attempt to lull potential enemies
into a false sense of security.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.080
Fortunately, I've read the original work.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.830
My Lady.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.650
This is Prince Duan's return gift.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:45.940
A lover's lock?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.200
Making such big promises

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.890
and failing to deliver.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.860
How embarrassing.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.370
Your Highness!

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Your Highness!

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120
What's happening?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.780
Please don't, Your Highness!

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.930
What's happening?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.340
Your Highness!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.120
I know I was wrong!

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.100
-Please spare me!
-Hurry!

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.760
-Please spare me!
-Grab this!

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.840
Grab this!

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.900
Your Highness!

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.360
Your Highness, please spare my life!

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.040
I won't dare do it again!

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.000
Please have mercy, Your Highness!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.530
What's all this commotion?

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.620
Your Majesty.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:46.950
[Bilan Pavilion]

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.430
I

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.720
have something to report.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.720
How dare you!

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.610
I happened to see Consort Yu

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.200
with a man, doing...

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.790
Judging by his build,
he seemed to be a guard.

00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:59.710
After I caught them, he ran away.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.930
I merely asked Consort Yu about it,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.990
and she pushed me into the water.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.690
I was nowhere near you!

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.240
This frame-up is way too obvious.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.560
I beg Your Majesty to grant me justice!

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.600
Is that so?

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.000
Take away.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.190
Beat.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.600
Your Majesty,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.130
who should we take away?

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.000
Why me?

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.419
You falsely accused me.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:35.669
May I ask Your Highness,

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.480
have you been to the Peony Garden today?

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.280
No, I haven't.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.370
Then why is there Wei Zi peony stain
on the hem of Your Highness's dress?

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.550
Throughout the entire palace,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.030
the only place with Wei Zi peonies
is the secluded southwest corner

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.160
of the Peony Garden.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.550
If Your Highness hasn't been there,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.880
how did you get stained?

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.350
Take him away!

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.150
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.300
Your Majesty, I have a witness!

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.620
[Bilan Pavilion]

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.390
Where?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.550
[Bilan Pavilion]

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.480
Your Majesty...

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.510
Take them both away and beat them!

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.200
Your Majesty!

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.510
I'm telling the truth, Your Majesty!

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.440
Your Majesty, I'm innocent!

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.390
Your Majesty, please spare my life!

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.720
What?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.270
His Majesty actually believed her
so easily?

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.670
Yes.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.200
I watched the whole thing
from behind the rockery.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.240
His Majesty didn't even
question that witnesses.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.900
He just had them dragged away.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.510
She didn't mention me at all?

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.480
No.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.200
And her answers were very affected.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.120
Who do you think was trying to frame you?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.630
Do you have any suspicions, my dear?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.080
I have no idea, Your Majesty.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.410
You really have no idea?

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.720
Your Majesty has so many affairs of state
to attend to every day.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.080
You needn't trouble yourself
with such trivial matters.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.610
Besides,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.060
I have no wish to harm the harmony

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.870
among the sisters of the harem.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.410
Whoever it was,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.420
now that the truth is out,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.120
I'm sure she regrets it in her heart.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.280
Your Majesty,

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.590
please give her another chance.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.360
Is she too stupid,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.460
or does she lack evidence?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.870
Or is what she said actually true...

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.570
In this kind of place, we women

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.790
are nothing more than
pawns to be manipulated.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.790
If we don't look out for one another,

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.370
wouldn't that just be playing into
those wretched men's hands?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:15.750
No.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.570
That's impossible.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.030
In the original story,
Yu Wanyin could make all other concubines

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.630
become stepping stones
on her path to success.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.870
Her words

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.240
can't be trusted at all.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.050
[Yongyan Hall]

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.320
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.510
Well,

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.370
let me say this in advance—

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.080
I've been sleeping here
for several days straight

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.240
purely so we can hold strategic meetings

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.030
without arousing suspicion.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.550
Yes, sure.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.010
I'm honored you think
so highly of me, Wanyin.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.120
That Xie Yong'er

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:19.290
seems to have really hooked up with
Prince Duan.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.250
So the co-option plan failed, huh?

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.870
I was just worried she'd tell Prince Duan.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.840
Otherwise, I would have
confronted her already.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.200
But Xie Yong'er

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.840
seems to have built
high emotional walls against me.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.360
Even if I tell her we're both real people,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.760
she might not believe me.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.820
Who says you're both real people?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.480
You are,

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.320
but she's just a 2D character
from the book.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.450
Her personality and thought patterns

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.750
were predetermined.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.170
If you want her to switch sides now,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.600
it's probably very difficult.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.430
That's right.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.700
How did I not think of that?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.750
Fortunately though,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.960
you're making good progress
turning Xu Yao to our side.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.600
Of course.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.850
Xu Yao is a smart man.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.320
He was just deceived before.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.450
Senior Minister Xu once said,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.360
"the true beneficiary of any matter

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.990
is hidden during the process

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.690
but revealed in the outcome."

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.630
Sometimes by looking through
appearances to the essence,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.480
all mysteries

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.870
can be easily solved.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.630
Although those words of mine

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.390
might not immediately

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.910
turn him to our side,

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:39.960
at least

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.630
I've planted a seed

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.260
of doubt in his mind.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.320
Xu Yao, oh Xu Yao.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.240
Poor you. Even today,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.500
you still think it was that bastard
who killed your father.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.200
Who foresaw everything

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.000
and saved your life?

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.610
And who took you in as his watchdog

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.020
with a face full of false compassion?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320
Good, good.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.570
Let's keep going at this pace.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.470
I've been racking my brain these days
trying to remember.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.390
The officials in your court,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.000
70% belong to
the Empress Dowager's faction,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.120
[Empress Dowager's Faction]

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.250
and the rest 30% to Prince Duan's faction.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.080
[Prince Duan's Faction]

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.240
Empress Dowager is powerful.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.790
Her relatives by marriage
control the court

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.610
and have won over most civil officials.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.030
[Civil Officials]

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.360
[Military Officials]

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.170
The military officials, long oppressed
by the Empress Dowager's faction,

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.550
have quietly pledged allegiance
to Prince Duan.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.610
So the most important thing for us now

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.510
is to make them fight each other.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.000
We have nothing to lose anyway.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.850
We can sow discord freely.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.790
Ideally,

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.240
we'll provoke them into
fighting each other to the death.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.300
Only then can we survive in the chaos.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.880
But as for how exactly to play it out...

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.600
I'll improvise.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.190
Oh no.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.280
I suddenly remembered something.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.270
[Drought]

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:24.800
Drought?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.160
The biggest trigger for your overthrow

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.510
was a drought.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.360
When?

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:34.990
Next year?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600
Or the year after?

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.790
I-I can't remember clearly.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.630
I think

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.120
it was about two-thirds into the book.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.950
When the drought struck,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.380
the national treasury ran dry

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.790
and the people were left destitute.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.600
Many across the country starved to death,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.960
chaos spread everywhere—

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.390
and then you were assassinated.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.590
Who was the assassin?

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.810
When did it happen?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.880
That I actually remember.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.960
It occurred in

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.910
the last dozen or so pages of the book.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.440
Can you try to remember
something actually useful?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.900
Something is better than nothing,
isn't it?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.960
Anyway,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.810
after you were stabbed,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.440
Prince Duan entered the palace
claiming to protect you,

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.860
but your wounds were fatal,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.520
and the officials petitioned

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.730
for him to become emperor
to stabilize the state.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.150
He took the throne in the crisis,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.280
worked diligently,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.550
and eventually became

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.720
a great emperor.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.550
Now I see.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.170
When you were reading the book,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.480
you favored Prince Duan.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.670
It's all about perspective.
Perspective determines your position.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.080
We can start searching for
drought-resistant crops now

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.880
and find ways to encourage
large-scale planting.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.100
No matter what,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.120
we must address the root cause

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.580
to prevent this disaster,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.050
help the people of this country

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.240
avoid famine

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.760
and safely survive the drought,

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.210
and then...

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.250
Punch the Empress Dowager

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.470
and kick Prince Duan!

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.480
You and I

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.640
will have the last laugh.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.790
Even if our fate is already
written in the book,

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.850
we still have to live it—page by page—

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.000
until the end.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.170
General Luo has returned to court!

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.360
The Central Army has returned victorious!

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.790
Look! The Central Army is back!

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.120
General Luo has returned to court!

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.560
-The Central Army has returned!
-This is great!

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.550
[General Luo]

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.810
Long live General Luo!

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.280
Long live Great Xia!

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.000
The Central Army has returned victorious!

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.790
General Luo!

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.740
As expected from General Luo.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.100
He drove back the invading Yan forces
a full 300 li.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.430
[Yang Duojie]

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.160
Finally, something uplifting

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.550
in this turbulent court.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.840
These days,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.270
[Li Yunxi]

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.000
only these military officials

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.660
are still doing real work.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.960
But I've heard

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.160
that Prince Duan once served
as a military officer on the front lines

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.109
and fought alongside the soldiers
through life and death,

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.829
proving himself quite valiant in battle.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.349
Prince Duan's truly a rare talent

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.480
in both strategy and martial prowess.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.849
If he could advance further in court...

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:13.790
[Er Lan]

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.270
Too many people, too much gossip.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.349
I advise both of you
to be cautious with your words.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.680
But these are the facts.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.030
Er Lan,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.560
you're being too cautious.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.490
General Luo, you drove the Yan forces back
a full 300 li,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.160
striking fear into all foreign tribes—

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.900
truly a display of our Great Xia's might.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.270
I am unworthy of such praise,
Your Majesty.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.130
I've heard that you, General Luo,

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.920
have been taking great care of
my brother.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:49.550
I

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.320
was merely doing my duty.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.770
What reward should I give you?

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.880
Your Majesty, I have a matter to report.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.370
General Luo came to collect the provisions
the other day,

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.480
[Chen Dasui]

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.510
but for some reason it was 20% more
than in previous years.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.310
This year's harvest has been poor
across the regions,

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.880
and most of the treasury's grain
has gone to disaster relief.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.920
General Luo has suddenly made
such excessive demands,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.440
leaving us rather unprepared.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.590
Your Majesty,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.350
with the same number of troops,

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.610
the Central Army has always consumed
the most provisions.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.150
I hope Your Majesty
will judge this fairly.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.410
Brother, you've also once served
at the border.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.080
What's your thought on this?

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.880
Since our grain reserves are insufficient

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.640
and Your Majesty cares deeply
for the people,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.700
all the main troops

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.640
should naturally share
Your Majesty's burden.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.350
Besides, Your Majesty's grace is boundless

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.410
and far-reaching.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.670
This matter of
reducing military provisions

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.000
is actually for the benefit of
the people.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:47.200
I believe

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.270
each soldier of the Central Army

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.310
can understand

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.530
Your Majesty's good intentions

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.550
and should be able

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.480
to show some understanding.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.210
I simply don't understand.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.880
The military provisions have been
the same every year.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.480
Why are they suddenly insufficient
this year?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.960
Is it that

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.310
life at the border
has become so comfortable

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.200
that everyone

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.830
has grown fat?

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.750
I'm afraid they've been
lining their own pockets, haven't they?

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:31.550
Your Majesty!

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.750
Please allow me to present something

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.920
so Your Majesty can see

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.800
what our soldiers eat every day.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.930
Bring it in!

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.240
These are the provisions
the Ministry of Revenue sent—

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.840
half of it is mixed with sand and gravel.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.700
Is this even fit for people to eat?

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.920
Nonsense!

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.270
Who knows where you got
this brown rice from?

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.310
And now you dare to twist the truth
and deceive His Majesty!

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.160
His Majesty is discerning.
How could he believe you?

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.520
You mixed in sand and gravel yourselves
to deceive His Majesty.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.350
This is a crime of deceiving the emperor!

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.720
You all know perfectly well

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.110
who mixed in the sand and gravel!

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.680
We've been guarding the borders
all year round.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.750
Only you have the leisure
to do such things!

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.280
This is complete nonsense!

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:15.940
Then why haven't the other two armies
said anything?

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.130
[Grand Tutor Wei]

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.170
How would we know

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.830
if you've been allocating such provisions

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.750
only to the Central Army?

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.720
Absurd!

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.300
Without evidence,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.960
this is pure slander!

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:26.320
Slander!

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.160
Nonsense!

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.960
Treating military provisions as a joke

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.560
equals treating our soldiers' lives
as a joke!

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.750
We risk our lives on the battlefield
year after year!

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.440
Enough!

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.580
[Cao An]

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.640
Your Maj-

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.870
Your Majesty!

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.460
This...

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.070
Your Majesty!

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.040
-Your Majesty, what's this for?
-Stop there!

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.440
Your Majesty!

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.590
W-What is this for?

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.850
I am...

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.790
I am the Minister of Revenue,
Your Majesty!

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.720
I'm Chen Dasui!

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.630
Your Majesty!

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.170
Can Your Majesty please tell me
what this is for?

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.070
Your Majesty!

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.350
Hurry...

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.640
[Jia Zhong]

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.720
Hurry up and stop him!

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
I said stop there!

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.070
Your Majesty!

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.830
Your Majesty!

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.720
Your Majesty, please don't kill me!
Your Majesty!

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.520
Your Majesty!

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.150
Your Majesty!

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.110
What?

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.570
Are you waiting for me to do it myself?

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.640
He was laughing too loudly.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.020
You.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.550
Go collect the provisions from
the Ministry of Revenue yourself.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.950
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.160
[Prince Duan's Mansion]

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.020
Was His Majesty's outburst today

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.810
really a coincidence?

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.160
Whether it was a coincidence or not,

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.590
with the Minister of Revenue dead,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.790
the Empress Dowager's faction

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.270
will surely hold us accountable for this.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.440
His Majesty has always acted
without a clear pattern.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.000
If he's truly gone crazy,
it's hardly surprising.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.200
I'm just worried that

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.040
the Empress Dowager may use this
as an excuse to take it out on us.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.310
Even without today's incident,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.160
the Empress Dowager
would still target us at every turn.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.090
At least for now,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.100
the Central Army's soldiers can
eat their fill—

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.240
that's something to be happy about.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.170
But if the Central Army's well-fed,

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.230
who will still hate His Majesty?

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.480
Exactly.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.380
Look at how joyful General Luo was today,

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:38.480
as if he's forgotten

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.640
[Wu Jiadong]

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.900
who the true culprit is

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.590
behind the chaos in the court

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.240
caused by the Empress Dowager's faction.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.070
The Central Army fought valiantly,

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.000
using their bodies as shields
against enemies,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.530
and just achieved victory.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.350
No matter how fierce
the political struggle,

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.680
they shouldn't be made pawns in this game.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.480
Though we've defeated the Yan State
for the time being,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.210
if we dishearten our soldiers,

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.570
who will defend against
the Qiang and Shu States

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.250
in the future?

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.190
Sir, your righteousness

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.830
puts me to shame.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.280
Sir, you shouldn't put it that way.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.650
His Highness has already
prepared provisions

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.710
to supply the Central Army in secret.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.240
This way, the soldiers can eat their fill

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.400
while His Majesty loses authority
in the ranks—

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.510
a foolproof plan.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.030
The only flaw was that

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.640
no one expected

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.350
a mad emperor to throw everything off.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.540
The true beneficiary of any matter

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.480
is hidden during the process

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.300
but revealed in the outcome.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.350
Your Highness,

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.950
I was hasty and disrespectful earlier.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.270
Please forgive me.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.310
No need for that, Sir.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.550
The truth is exactly what I want to hear.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.200
However, just now you didn't

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.660
comment on His Majesty's unusual behavior.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.350
Perhaps you could share your thoughts now?

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.010
His Majesty

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.460
has been acting rather differently lately.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.190
Could it be

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.320
he's got some skilled strategist
by his side?

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.180
But our palace informants haven't reported

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.170
His Majesty being in close contact with
anyone lately.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.660
Someone he's been close to?

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.070
[Fan Ke]

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.680
I can think of one person.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:24.650
Who?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.480
The demonic consort, Yu Wanyin.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.240
Villain!

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:37.030
An absolute villain!

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.360
No matter what he wears,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.080
he's still a villain!

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.180
He not only washed his hands of it
completely,

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.110
but even claimed

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.240
the soldiers

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.160
all appreciated my painstaking concern.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.790
With a single remark,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.550
he both cemented the fact
that the Empress Dowager's faction

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.750
had been harsh with the army provisions

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.760
and even dragged me into it as well,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.760
as if I had instructed them to do so.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.880
What's more infuriating is

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.130
that on the surface,

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.130
you can't find any fault with him.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.920
It's truly maddening.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.350
How else could he have turned

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.370
a terrible hand into a winning one
in the novel?

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:11.970
That's why

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.240
you need to be even more ruthless
than him.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.040
Four of a kind!

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.410
I can't match that.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.350
That said,

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.440
this stunt of suddenly "losing your mind"

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.480
and taking the Minister of Revenue
out of the picture

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.810
wasn't exactly clever.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.510
Aren't you worried
they'll set their sights on you?

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.030
What's there to worry about?

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.890
I'm the "mad emperor," after all—

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.800
small fits every 3 days,
big ones every 5.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.240
If I weren't acting crazy,
that would be strange.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.770
Besides,

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.830
Prince Duan and the Empress Dowager

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.880
are busy planning their next move
right now.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.960
They have no time to care about me,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.560
a powerless puppet emperor.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:42.890
That's true.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.200
Three.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.970
I'll follow with a four.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.510
Xu Yao should be

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.990
investigating that incident by now, right?

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.970
It's just a pity

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.160
there seems to be no evidence
against Prince Duan.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.510
Evidence is something

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.270
that can be fabricated.

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.670
Didn't you already send people
to pick up Senior Minister Xu?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.790
On the way back,

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.480
deliberately create a few slip-ups

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.540
to make him believe

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.740
the information has been leaked.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.750
Then send someone

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.460
to assassinate his father

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.960
and frame Prince Duan for it.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.950
After that, your people,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.590
against all odds,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.400
save him from certain death.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.510
Xu Yao will be overwhelmed with gratitude.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.720
And from then on,

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.350
he'll be at our disposal.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.070
If only it could go that smoothly.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.400
Just thinking out loud.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.880
Can't we have a little fun fantasizing?

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.170
Let's take it one step at a time.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.960
Didn't we talk about

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.000
preventing the drought before?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.270
I want to go to the library

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.110
and look up materials on
drought-resistant crops.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.770
Go on ahead.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.200
The library has quite a collection.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.000
Those materials won't be easy to find.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.640
I won!

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.510
It's just looking up some information.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.030
Don't underestimate

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.030
the abilities of
a seasoned corporate drudge like me.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.280
These traditional characters
are so hard to read.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.720
The calligraphy conventions
in ancient times

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.180
are completely different from modern ones.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.080
Your Highness Prince Duan.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.340
Your Highness.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.380
Why is he here?

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.550
Mr. Xu.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.880
Mr. Xu?

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.270
Let's split up to search.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:08.880
Xu Yao?

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.270
Okay.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.510
I can't be certain yet

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.160
if this Prince Duan here
is the original character.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.030
To be safe,

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.350
I should recall the original text.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.550
The original text...

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:27.350
Oh, right.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.750
Before Yu Wanyin entered the palace,

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.350
she had met Prince Duan once.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.790
Yu Wanyin fell in love at first sight

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.990
and pined for him after returning home.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.830
Later, Yu Wanyin was forced by her family
to enter the palace with resentment,

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.360
resulting in an unrequited love
throughout.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.950
So it was kind of like a secret crush.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.680
Secret crush, secret crush...

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.490
Where is he?

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.060
Your Highness Consort Yu?

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.810
Your Highness Prince Duan?

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.600
What brings Your Highness here?

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.530
I wanted to look for a book,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.740
but I couldn't find it just now.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.160
I might have remembered it wrong.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.220
Still pretending.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.680
Go on, keep pretending.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:19.760
Well,

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:22.510
what book is Your Highness looking for?

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.040
I can help you search for it.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.300
I'll trouble Your Highness then.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.480
The book is called

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.100
"Classic of Mountains and Seas."

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.270
It contains many rare
and strange creatures,

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.000
one of which

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.170
is called Zhulong.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.800
It can freely travel
between different worlds.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.920
I am quite curious

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.140
and want to find it to read.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.240
What "Classic of Mountains and Seas"?

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.160
All that talk

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:49.690
was just to test me, wasn't it?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
At the palace banquet a few days ago,

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.420
Your Highness was also lost in thought
like this.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.000
It seemed you had

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.410
a lot of doubts on your mind.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:06.510
I wouldn't call them doubts.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.120
I just never expected

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.070
that the gentleman I met
at the Lantern Festival market

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.550
would turn out to be
the renowned Prince Duan.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.480
I was on official business that day

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.370
and couldn't reveal my identity.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.590
I hope Your Highness wouldn't mind.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.480
I understand.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.160
We were both out incognito that day.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.490
Of course we couldn't make
a big show of it.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.700
The details of our first meeting
all line up now, right?

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.310
[Round 1]

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.910
I've been cut off from news
while in the palace.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.240
I wonder whether things are well
at home.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.290
I actually saw your father a few days ago.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.200
Minister Yu

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.330
is in excellent health.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.200
He's even taken up the tea ceremony.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.200
Tea ceremony?

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.000
My father in the original story

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:58.560
wasn't this refined at all.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.030
Also,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.240
he's learned to play card games.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.920
But I heard

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.500
his luck is poor

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.670
and he's lost quite a bit.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.830
Well, gambling harms the body,

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.960
while drinking tea dispels excess heat.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.110
I was almost scared to death.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.180
I thought I remembered it wrong.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.270
[Round 2]

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.410
Your Highness was very shy before.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.320
What exactly happened that

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.240
in just a few months,

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.520
you've become so talkative?

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.320
I've always been like this.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.160
It's just that

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.510
I'd never had a deep conversation
with Your Highness before.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.370
But it's not just your temperament
that's changed—

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.960
even the way you dress

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.250
is completely different now.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.440
It's as if

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.520
you've become a different person.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:54.550
There's a flaw.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.030
Who could remain unchanged

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.810
after entering this locked-away palace?

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.930
After all, with thousands of beauties
in the harem,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.440
I still want to survive.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:12.350
Your Highness, please don't mention
these words to others.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.030
I'll pretend I never heard them.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.880
As expected, at crucial moments,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.680
playing the victim still works.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.670
[Round 3]

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.480
So Your Highness was painting?

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.780
Your Highness, please don't look.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:31.400
This is bad...

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.630
[Round 4]

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.110
[Hungry… all I see is braised pork belly
colorful and dazzling hehe dipping shrimp]

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.990
This painting

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.720
looks charmingly childlike.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.000
I like it a lot.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.310
It's just some random scribbles

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.160
not worthy of being displayed.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.030
Might Your Highness be willing to

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.160
bestow this painting of yours upon me?

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.610
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.050
feel free to take it.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.170
Your Highness,

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:07.880
I've found the book.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.409
Alright.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.000
Then thank you, Your Highness.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.860
I will certainly bring a gift
in return another day.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.860
I take my leave.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.820
Wasn't this sachet

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:29.960
the token

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.219
he and Xie Yong'er exchanged
in the book?

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.190
Seems like they've already
hooked up with each other.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.230
Have you discovered anything?

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.560
Just from this meeting,

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.560
I couldn't detect any scheming.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.120
However,

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.679
her eyes are cunning and shrewd,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.920
suggesting she has many thoughts
hidden away.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.480
No wonder she managed to
win His Majesty's favor.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.010
Was there anything strange

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.850
about her words or actions?

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.710
Strange...

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.800
What do you mean, Your Highness?

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.590
[Hungry… rustic style… braised pork ribs,
colorful, white, yellow and black]

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.440
Go and check

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.590
if she left behind
any calligraphy or paintings

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.190
before entering the palace.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.130
The answer might be found
at the Yu Residence.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.690
Consort Yu is still compiling books
so late at night?

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.630
She must want to share
Your Majesty's burdens.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.200
This kind of devotion

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.150
is so touching

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.280
that even I'm moved.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.870
Have you worked yourself up yet?

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.360
Don't force it if there are no tears,
okay?

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.320
Later, have the Imperial Kitchen

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.780
bring her some nourishing

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.510
and easily digestible late-night snacks.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.570
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.440
Yu...

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.550
I'm about to be late!

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.400
Why didn't I know about this?

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.760
Do we have to go pay respects every day?

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.400
Originally it was
every morning and evening,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.540
but the Empress Dowager
prefers peace and quiet,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.080
so the date of respect paying
was changed to

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.230
only the 1st and 15th of each month.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.690
So everyone will be there?

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.440
My Lady.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.550
This is bad. This is bad!

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.030
My Lady!

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.820
My Lady, please slow down!

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.970
Sister,

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.310
do you think it looks pretty?

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.510
It does.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.970
It's really pretty.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.590
Grand Tutor Wei truly cares for you,

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.510
finding such rare red agate

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.600
as your birthday gift, Lady Wei.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.960
In comparison,

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.420
the gifts we sisters prepared

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.630
seem almost embarrassing to give.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:24.960
Don't say that, Sister.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.630
Gifts are about the thoughts behind them,

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.560
not their value.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.760
About what happened
at the palace banquet last time,

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.220
I haven't thanked you yet.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.330
No need to thank me, Sister.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.230
I did it

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:41.030
mainly to stand up for you, Sister.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:42.840
Why?

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.550
Why else could it be?

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.440
Sister, you have the looks,
the family background,

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.770
and a good temperament,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.360
yet His Majesty doesn't see it.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.320
Instead, he favors

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.280
-that improper Yu...
-Enough.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.320
Stop it.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.960
Now that she has His Majesty's favor,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.000
she doesn't even bother coming to
pay respects to the Empress Dowager.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.150
How could she possibly
care about us sisters?

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.920
Exactly.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.510
We can let it slide,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.590
but you're different, Lady Wei.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.360
Your father is Grand Tutor Wei,
backed by the Empress Dowager.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.880
How could you let yourself
be overshadowed by her?

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.740
So what if His Majesty favors her?

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.920
When she arrives,

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.080
I will discipline her properly
on behalf of the Empress Dowager.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.510
Concubine Yu, you're so late.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.880
Have you forgotten all the rules
you learned when entering the palace?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.540
Sister Wei.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.750
Concubine Yu has been promoted
to Consort now.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.670
No wonder.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.650
Such poor manners.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:52.450
Again with this tasteless trick.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.190
What a headache.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.710
Hold it in. Stay calm.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.360
I took a wrong turn

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:00.610
and lost some time.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.490
Please don't blame me, Sister.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:05.630
What's with that look?

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:06.910
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.150
Did she just roll her eyes at me?

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.960
She did, she definitely did.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.150
I saw it. I saw it.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.880
I didn't.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.250
Yu Wanyin, how dare you!

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.590
I naturally have a scowling face

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.710
and occasional eye twitches.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.280
It's not aimed at anyone in particular.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.280
I hope you can understand, Sisters.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:29.070
You...

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.690
Sister Wei.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.290
Sister Wei, please calm down.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.850
Consort Yu might

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.360
really have been busy with
important matters

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.670
and got held up.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.650
What could be more important

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:45.000
than paying respects
to the Empress Dowager?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.150
I know.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.800
I bet she went to the Imperial Garden

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.670
to meet secretly with some guard again.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.380
Sister.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.590
You'd better not speak recklessly.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.860
She might go cry to His Majesty again,

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.840
and then...

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.660
Then what?

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.550
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.340
Why are you kneeling too, my dear?

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:10.210
I permit you not to kneel
when you see me from now on.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.880
Here.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.100
Be careful not to hurt your knees.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:22.780
Why are you here?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.330
If I hadn't come,

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.550
they would have bullied you to death.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.010
They weren't bullying me.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.600
We were just joking around.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.920
Just now,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.310
who among you was gossiping?

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:43.070
You?

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.800
Me?

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:48.850
Tell me what happened.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.840
I admit my guilt, Your Majesty!

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.670
Very well,

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.850
that saves time.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:55.510
Take her away!

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.150
Your Majesty!

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.630
Throw her into the Cold Palace!

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.840
I admit my guilt, Your Majesty!

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.510
No, please!

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800
I admit my guilt!

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.800
Your Majesty!

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.510
Your Majesty!

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.840
You.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.900
Explain yourself.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:08.060
I...

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.230
I only wanted to remind Consort Yu

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.940
to follow the palace rules

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.150
and serve the Empress Dowager
and Your Majesty properly.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.950
Take her away!

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.670
Your Majesty, please let me explain.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:17.200
I just...

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:18.070
You...

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.960
-She really just gossiped for a bit.
-Your Majesty!

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.710
There's no need for that.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.770
Noble Consort Wei.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.820
Explain yourself.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.950
Your Majesty!

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.400
-It's really not that serious.
-I beg Your Majesty,

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.000
in light of my father's devoted service
to you,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.000
to spare me. Please spare me.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.280
I know your father is Grand Tutor Wei.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:35.440
So what?

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.240
Take her away!

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.370
Your Majesty, I admit my guilt!

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.280
My son, what a show of power.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.160
Here she comes,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.960
one of the main villains of the story,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.960
who's also Xiahou Dan's stepmother,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.160
the Empress Dowager.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.890
This proud and arrogant woman

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.400
is obsessed with power.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.670
Ever since Xiahou Dan started disobeying,

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.510
she resorted to some underhanded methods

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.320
to make him father a young crown prince,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.050
keeping him close as a new pawn.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.120
That's right.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.360
This is Xiahou Dan's

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.150
own son.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.290
Mother.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.820
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.420
Greetings, Father.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.380
[Crown Prince]

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.590
[Empress Dowager]

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:20.800
Rise.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.360
My son.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.440
Not only have you been wreaking havoc
in the court,

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:38.280
but today in my presence,

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.850
you're also showing off your authority?

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.070
Mother, you've learned about

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:44.920
what happened in the court so quickly.

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.520
I'd rather not have learned.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.620
But look at you, acting so crazed.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.500
The whole palace knows by now.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.910
How could I not hear of it?

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.790
They gave me such a headache
with their clamor.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:00.990
Don't they deserve to die?

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.280
You wanted to kill them

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.570
just because they annoyed you?

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:05.310
What else?

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.670
So you mean

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.520
it was all their fault?

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:10.360
Indeed.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.000
Well, that makes sense.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.880
How could the Emperor possibly be wrong?

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:18.280
If there's blame,

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.280
it must lie with someone else.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.670
Impudent Consort Yu!

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.440
Bewitching the Emperor
and deceiving his judgment—

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.500
you deserve death!

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:27.000
Guards!

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.320
Yes!

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.070
Seize this demon consort
who has thrown the court into chaos

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.400
and shows no respect for her elders,

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.510
and drag her away to be buried alive!

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.640
I dare anyone to try!

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.920
How dare you!

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.110
You don't rule this palace yet!

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.320
Seize her now!

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.760
Mother!
