"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 8)

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.160
Yoki, can you hear me? Yoki!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840
Yoki, respond!

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.840
Yoki, respond, Yoki!

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.359
Yoki, respond!

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:42.999
Maybe we should try calling him.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.239
Director!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840
Director!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Director!

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760
Everyone's here.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840
Let's go then.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.519
Director!

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:59.599
We can't reach Yoki.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.639
It's dangerous if we can't reach him.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.760
Then...

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:05.680
What if he doesn't come back?

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.959
What about your variety show?

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.400
Then...

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.759
Qiang!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.520
Where's Yoki?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.160
I don't know, he left, right?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360
Didn't tell me.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.439
You're lying!

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.800
You never went up the mountain!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.680
So what? He's a grown man...

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.080
What did you say?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.919
What's wrong with you?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.680
Calm down, calm down.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.080
Don't be impulsive.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.800
Don't be impulsive.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.479
What did you say?

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.479
Brother Yang.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.640
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.520
Let go of me, give me the bag.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.855
You're sure you didn't see him, right?

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:38.879
Give it to me, hurry!

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.439
Brother Yang.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.280
Then…

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.199
Let's keep waiting.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120
Yoki.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840
Yoki.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.439
Although I'm outstanding,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.960
but even an excellent person

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120
needs to rest sometimes.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.039
Yoki.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.759
Yoki, if you hear me, respond, Yoki.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
Yoki.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.639
Yoki, where are you?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
Yoki.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.639
Yoki.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.878
Yoki, where are you?

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.879
Yoki.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.279
Someone got ahead of me.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.319
How is that possible?

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.120
Yoki.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.560
Can you hear me?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.560
Yoki.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:19.399
Yoki.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:22.879
Yoki.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Yoki.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.879
Yoki.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.399
Yoki.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.800
Yoki.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.120
Yoki.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560
Yoki, don't be scared.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.320
Yoki, not scared, not scared, not scared!

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.000
It's fine, it's fine.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040
Nothing's wrong at all!

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:26.800
Nothing's wrong at all!

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:27.959
Not scared, not scared.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.040
Not scared, not scared.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.720
Who's crying?

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.439
Can't hear, can't hear.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.599
Can't hear, can't hear, can't hear.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.759
Amitabha, Amitabha.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.199
Baby,

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:56.399
so what you just said?

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:57.959
A lamb threw up,

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.319
you took care of the lamb

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.360
then the lamb ran away.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480
You chased the lamb

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.096
and then you got lost while chasing it,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.120
is that right?

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.519
Yes.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800
Baby, don't be scared.

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:09.479
Even though I'm also lost,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.720
but I promise you

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.976
that I'll definitely help
you find your mom,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.399
Okay?

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:16.839
Okay.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.399
Good girl!

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.079
Amitabha, Amitabha.

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:50.759
Baby,

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.279
Come on, follow me.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.199
Yoki?

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.879
Yoki, where are you? Yuxi?

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:07.879
Baby, don't cry.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800
Let's sleep for a bit.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.040
Don't be scared.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.399
I'm here.

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.279
Good, sleep now.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.600
Yoki, I don't like you anymore.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.240
Yoki, just disappear.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:20.799
You're so annoying.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.559
Get out of the entertainment industry!

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.399
Yang Meng!

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840
Yang Meng!

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:40.679
Don't leave me!

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.799
Please don't leave me!

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.080
Don't abandon me like they did.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.639
Don't!

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:26.159
Where am I?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720
You're with me.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.360
I thought I was still dreaming.

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:44.679
How did you find me?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.840
That thing with Qiang,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.560
I'll make him apologize to you.

00:12:01.759 --> 00:12:02.759
He was wrong.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:06.879
It's fine.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080
I'm used to it.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.360
What do you mean you're used to it?

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.679
No,

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.398
can you not do that?

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.440
Defend yourself for once.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.960
My number one fan

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.639
is standing up for me.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.799
Huh? "Your number one fan"?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.639
I'm really curious

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:32.839
when exactly did you

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.840
start liking me?

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:36.799
In high school.

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:39.840
You said on stage you
wanted to be an actor,

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:42.199
everyone in the audience was laughing.

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:45.759
So,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.440
that's when it started.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.559
I just thought...

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320
Thought what?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200
I just thought

00:12:58.799 --> 00:12:59.639
someone who can stay committed

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.720
to their dreams

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840
is really cool.

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.679
So,

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:14.960
you're really just my fan?

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:28.519
It's okay.

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:32.279
I don't want to cause you trouble.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I like you.

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:36.639
That's my business.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:39.639
If you can't accept it,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.320
we can still be friends.

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:07.639
Everyone's waiting for you.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:08.719
They're extremely worried.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.878
The child is lost!

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:38.879
I'm so worried.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.120
Hurry, hurry, come here.

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:41.919
I haven't seen her.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.399
Police officer!

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.678
We're from the TV show.

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:45.158
This is a matter of life and death for us.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.480
Quick, quick, come back.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
They're back!

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:51.039
Mom! Ruirui!

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.039
Where did you go, Ruirui?

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.519
Where did you go?

00:14:57.879 --> 00:14:58.879
What's wrong?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.320
What's wrong, baby?

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:02.399
Here, for you.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.919
So it was with you.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.600
You scared mom to death!

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.120
Don't run off like that again!

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.120
Understand?

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:16.759
It's okay now.

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.480
That's great!

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:23.039
Thank you, thank you!

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:26.759
You win, you little rascal!

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.600
Well,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080
wrap!

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:41.759
Can public figures

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:42.919
really live

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.960
as they please?

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.399
Forget it.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720
As long as he's happy.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.440
I'm so glad Yoki is okay.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240
With brother Yang around,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.759
you don't need to worry.

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:18.879
What's wrong with you?

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960
Ye Ran,

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:25.539
Let's end it here between us.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240
Why?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.240
Looks like you really don't remember?

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:36.279
Two years ago,

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:51.799
Senior Ye Ran.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.279
Senior.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.880
Now even pick-up lines use "senior".

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.079
So you

00:17:05.713 --> 00:17:07.433
want to have another drink with me, senior?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.039
Senior, you're drunk.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.799
Let's drink at my place.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.640
That was my first time.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.400
After that night,

00:17:41.401 --> 00:17:43.000
you completely disappeared.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.200
You think

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:47.880
I really liked you?

00:17:49.759 --> 00:17:50.759
I just wanted you

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:51.799
to also taste

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.119
what it feels like to be played.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200
Feed me.

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:28.519
Drink slowly.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.680
Be careful, it's hot.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400
Still hot?

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:34.599
Not hot.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720
Just kidding.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.480
Are you hungry?

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.880
Want to eat something?

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.960
Then I'll eat the oyster pancakes you make.

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:49.679
Still eating oyster pancakes?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.799
Then add a seafood feast too.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:53.880
Okay.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.520
Anyway, the village seafood

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:56.559
isn't selling.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640
Piled up like a mountain.

00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:59.119
You can eat as much as you want.

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:01.319
Not selling?

00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:02.759
Why?

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.800
Because seafood from outside

00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:06.079
is half our price.

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:08.199
Even though our village's quality is good,

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:09.799
the price is high,

00:19:10.179 --> 00:19:11.298
they're hesitant to try it.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.919
What are you thinking about again?

00:19:17.799 --> 00:19:18.960
I have a good idea.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960
Smile.

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:21.880
Smile.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.280
I'll show you who's smiling!

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:32.279
Dog waist.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.600
Shark Abs(side abdominal muscles).

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.039
Qilin Arms.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.320
(Qilin: a mythical Chinese
creature symbolizing strength)

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:41.559
What the hell are you talking about?

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:45.079
Amazing!

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.920
I, I told you to film the crab.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.279
You filmed that?

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.480
Delete it!

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.640
Wait!

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:55.039
You don't get

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.136
the "traffic key" (what
drives online views), do you?

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.800
I already came up with the title for you!

00:19:58.119 --> 00:19:59.839
The Muscle Hunk's Secret Recipes.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.119
Every fan who tries it says:

00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:03.759
Love it!
