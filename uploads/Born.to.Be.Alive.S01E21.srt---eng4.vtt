[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.220
[Episode 21]

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.470
Did you see any

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.630
suspicious person?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.730
What's wrong?

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.860
Do you know that man?

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.360
He looks familiar.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.310
But I can't remember.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.450
That driver...

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.590
He was

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.070
referring to that driver.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.800
We...

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.420
We saw him

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.250
at the entrance of the copper factory.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.400
Captain,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.990
there must be something wrong
with that factory.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.720
There must be something wrong
with that factory.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.000
Ms. Zhang.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.770
Director Zhang.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.020
-Mayor Duo.
-Mayor Duo.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.970
Let me.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.400
Bai Ju,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.960
you need to rest.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.180
She needs to rest

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.270
for at least a week.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.470
Don't worry.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.780
I'll be off then.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.090
I don't want that.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.270
Chun made the soup for you.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.650
Have some while it's still hot.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.340
Mom...

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.170
don't you have anything to say?

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.780
What should I say?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.110
If you're angry, just let it out.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.680
You weren't exactly

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.740
friendly to Captain Duojie just now.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.060
I am angry with him.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.100
But does it help with anything?

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.800
That kid...

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.090
I tried my best.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.500
A gold mine?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.890
The mechanized kind?

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.420
We don't know yet.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.980
But they're not

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.110
just some random placer gold panners.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.520
More like

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.870
a large-scale gold mining organization.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.150
I haven't heard of it.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.300
Are you sure?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.800
From the mercury

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.540
and other information we collected,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.830
it's very likely.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.960
Bai Ju and Zhang Yang being hit

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.520
is most likely this organization

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.120
trying to take revenge on us.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.300
Have you informed

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.270
the Public Security Bureau

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.030
of this?

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.180
The things we seized

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.060
and the information we gathered

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.630
were all handed over to them.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.490
Shi Long's team

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.830
is investigating this.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.000
If it's confirmed

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.460
that there is large-scale

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.810
illegal

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.810
gold mining

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.240
in the Uninhabited Zone,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.480
we must firmly crack down on it.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.340
The investigation of the copper factory
will require

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.800
cooperation from commerce
and tax departments.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.570
We'll need the county's support.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.300
Don't worry.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.530
I'll coordinate.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.630
Be careful.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.000
No more incidents.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.070
Okay.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:03.950
There's one more thing...

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.800
Go ahead.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.130
Our pickup truck is broken.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.460
It won't start.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.480
I need a car.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.030
I'll figure something out.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.630
If you ask me,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.470
you shouldn't indulge Ju.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.000
She's recovering

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.660
and shouldn't eat spicy food.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.770
I picked these green chili peppers.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.710
They're mildly spicy

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.310
and won't upset her stomach.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.920
Try it.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.640
Let me have a taste.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.860
What do you think?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.770
Should I be honest?

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.570
Of course.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.310
This...

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.930
for a patient meal,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.620
you've added

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.830
too much seasoning.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.120
A bit too strong in flavor.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.810
Try it.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.910
Right?

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.990
This is yours.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.800
We still have time.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.060
I'll make another one.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.830
If you ask me,

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.630
we're wasting our time here.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.580
What do you mean?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.800
Now that

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.950
Fei is back,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.980
he's taking care of Ju

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.240
and doing everything.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.920
We really shouldn't bother.

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:38.230
I reckon

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.960
it won't be long

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.330
before he becomes

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.800
our brother-in-law.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.530
I think they are a good match.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.830
Maybe...

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.600
Maybe

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.850
Ju will move to the provincial capital.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.120
Why don't we open the restaurant

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.650
in the provincial capital?

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.000
Our whole family

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.180
together in the provincial capital—

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.380
how nice that would be.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.100
Ju won't need to cook

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.100
after work.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.820
She and Fei can come over;

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.990
we'll cook for her,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.860
eat together,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.680
it'll be such a lively day.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.010
What do you think, Chun?

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.710
No.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.020
The provincial capital...

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.300
The rent is too expensive.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.360
We can't afford it.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.460
Here.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.110
Try it.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.130
You made it?

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.200
When did you

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200
learn to cook?

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.720
I borrowed the hospital canteen's stove.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.100
I also asked Chef Wang from the canteen

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.429
to teach me.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.230
You sure know how to pick a mentor.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.010
In a bit.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.840
It'll get cold.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.160
I'm not hungry.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:02.820
How's...

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.650
the draft of my article

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.580
looking?

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.730
Boss, could you...

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.480
give me some advice?

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.650
Good.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:11.910
It's good.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.890
I just don't understand it.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.080
These are Chinese characters.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.880
What part don't you understand?

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.260
How come

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.240
you're calling the Mountain Patrol

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.840
"environmental fighters"?

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.740
And...

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.550
"great"?

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.610
This word is a bit

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.800
over the top, no?

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:36.860
Besides,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.000
isn't environmental protection
about managing pollution,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.800
like river pollution and stuff?

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.850
What does that have to do with us?

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.510
Environmental protection isn't just about

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.440
preserving mountains and rivers.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.620
Your efforts to combat poaching

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.390
and protect wildlife

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.450
are also environmental protection.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.610
Let me put it this way.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.440
The environment we live in,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.150
this earth,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.150
is alive.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.820
Alive?

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:02.980
Yes.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.750
The environment has a temperature,

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.840
a pulse,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.870
and a heartbeat.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.340
The earth we live on

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.400
is like a giant body,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.830
home to over eight million species.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.510
Humans are just one of them.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.280
Humans are no different
from Tibetan antelopes,

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.950
sand foxes,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.880
or any other animal.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.930
We're all

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.560
flesh and blood in this body.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.600
We support each other,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.740
work together,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.100
and rely on each other,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.290
collectively sustaining

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.820
the operation of this body.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.500
That's why

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.080
life goes on and on,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.360
cycling over and over.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.530
No one can do without anyone else.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.000
So when we learn that

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.100
endangered species like Xinjiang tiger

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.430
or Chinese Rhinoceros have gone extinct,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.530
we feel

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.910
as if...

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.580
a piece of our heart has been torn away.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.720
We feel sad.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.550
This is actually

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.680
an animal instinct.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.100
Just like

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.430
what you guys are doing.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.800
I think it's really remarkable.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.110
"Great" is not

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.190
big enough a word for summarizing it.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.320
You mean "we," right?

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:45.770
Yes.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.580
I mean "we."

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.750
I came back this time—

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.750
Doing something remarkable

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.410
requires paying a high price.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.090
When you first came here,

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.960
I mentioned this when we talked

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.960
about Dongzhiba.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.820
It might be...

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.250
not heroic at all.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.480
A bullet that comes out of nowhere,

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.440
or...

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.560
a car that suddenly rushes over...

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.700
Right in front of you.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.030
Taking a person away.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.010
Maybe just a second ago,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.070
you were still talking to each other,

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:52.860
laughing...

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.480
Bai Ju,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:55.630
I'm here.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.050
I know.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.000
I'm not blind.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.910
I mean,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.290
I'm here.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.580
I'll be by your side.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.580
I won't leave suddenly.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.180
I'll only show up suddenly—

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.320
when you need me.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.320
After you left,

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.980
how come you never wrote to me?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.130
I was writing

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.910
to Duojie the whole time.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.920
What about me?

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.890
Because...

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.770
It's a series of reports.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.500
I thought we would

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:29.890
see each other again.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:30.740
I thought we could...

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.470
we could...

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.980
talk in person.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.610
Because contacting Duojie

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.010
is part of work.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.150
It's not the same... with you.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.320
How?

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:02.650
I'm hungry.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.390
I want to eat.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:03.870
Okay.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.770
Go ahead.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.230
Got an appetite now?

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.080
Comrade Bai Ju has regained her appetite.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.600
I need to record it.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.380
The lens cap is still on.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.710
What do you think?

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.370
Please comment on my cooking.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.030
Just what you'd expect

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.230
from Chef Wang of the canteen's mentee.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.200
Right?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.720
Well, then...

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.030
dig in.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.240
-Chun.
-Sir.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.700
Already started your meal?

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.550
You're finally here.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.240
What did you cook

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.790
for me?

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.630
Fried pork with chili.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.890
Your favorite as a kid.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.100
It's not spicy enough.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.250
A bit too bland.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:15.790
When you recover,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.920
I'll make you the extra spicy version.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.710
You made that?

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:22.360
I did.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.050
It's my first time, so probably...

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.010
not very good.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.020
Have a taste.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.630
Try it. It's "delicious."

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:31.840
Okay.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.360
Too chewy, huh?

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:41.670
What do you think?

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.510
Tastes like something that would come from

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.040
Wang of the canteen, right?

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.650
He worked hard on this.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.700
Don't say that.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.850
You finish it then.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.310
Film her.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.660
Can you stop filming?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.010
How am I supposed to eat?

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.610
You smoke?

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.510
I...

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.050
I smoke occasionally.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.190
Have one.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.920
I don't smoke.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.990
You go ahead.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.090
Although we haven't had much contact,

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.030
actually...

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.400
I've known about you for quite some time.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.200
You...

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.770
you read my articles too?

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.160
No.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.380
Bai Ju mentioned you

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.530
in her letters.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.010
I see.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:09.050
Well,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.070
your impression of me

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.290
must not be very good.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.660
Not at all.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.590
It's good.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:15.140
Really?

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.610
Because she's always lecturing me,

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:17.400
I thought...

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:18.850
you would think...

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.420
She's always been like that

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.500
since she was a kid.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:25.350
Right.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.400
I have something

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.900
to ask you.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.550
Would you mind?

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.830
No.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.370
Please go ahead.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.680
What's your plan for the future?

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.630
Going back to the provincial capital

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.170
or staying here for Bai Ju?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.550
To be honest,

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.350
I don't really dare

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.810
to think about the future.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.330
I like Bai Ju.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:19.650
So much that...

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.150
So much that

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.140
it scares me.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.290
Especially this time,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.640
when I almost lost her.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.180
Seeing her lying there

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:32.650
with her eyes closed

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:33.500
made me feel like I was back

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.900
in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:37.920
I realized that

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.010
if she didn't wake up,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.840
I would be regretful
for the rest of my life.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.660
For chili peppers,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.370
you should pick these green ones.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.020
It's spicy,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.080
but not that spicy.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:00.810
Okay.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.660
I never thought

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.790
I would be like this.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.060
I never thought I'd meet her.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.410
But she just showed up,

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.140
turning my life,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.880
my plans,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.650
and my mindset

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.170
completely upside down.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.990
Bai Ju once said that

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.810
no matter how much you like something

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.940
or a place,

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.960
if there aren't people you care about,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.090
you won't stay long.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.760
Try to have her eat less mutton.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.680
It's heaty.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.470
Okay.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.380
Have beef instead.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:33.890
Okay.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.130
Do you know what "grass fat" is?

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.500
I've heard of it.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.420
Back then I didn't know

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.350
how to respond.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.480
But now I want to say

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.000
there're things I like here.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.110
And people I like.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.550
I will be good to her,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.390
take care of her,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.960
and protect her.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.920
Crosswise for beef and mutton;
lengthwise for pork.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.250
Or it'll be hard to chew.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:01.070
Okay.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:01.820
Give it a try.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.270
No matter the outcome

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.980
or my abilities,

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.210
I will definitely do my best.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:20.980
Delicious.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.710
Off I go.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:09.350
Chun,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.320
what are you doing there?

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:12.480
Nothing.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.800
Just hanging out here for a while.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.790
Since when do you smoke?

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.440
Just giving it a try.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.240
I wanted to know

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.130
why so many people like to smoke.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:28.860
Let's go.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.660
Let's check out restaurant locations.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:32.880
There's an old noodle restaurant

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.740
next to the trading company,

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.670
do you remember?

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.300
The owner is getting old.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.530
Let's talk to him.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.500
It probably won't cost much.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:39.810
Let's go.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:40.610
I'm not going.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.070
It's your restaurant,

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.760
you can choose the location yourself.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.750
What do you mean, my restaurant?

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.000
It's our restaurant.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.390
You open the restaurant yourself.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.050
I've decided...

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.360
to go to the saltworks.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:05.990
Why?

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.900
No reason.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.790
I just don't want to stay here anymore.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.140
Didn't we agree

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.660
that

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.590
we'd open a restaurant together

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.440
and stay with Mom?

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.280
Why did you change your mind?

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.480
Why are you shouting?

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.350
A breakup?

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:28.340
Don't talk nonsense.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.470
It must be a breakup.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:30.720
Who is the girl?

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.590
Your necklace

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.790
was for her, right?

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.720
Stop asking!

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.580
No use hiding it,

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.580
I saw it.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.600
Smoking up here

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.210
and staring at the necklace.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.530
Did you not gift it out

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.110
or was it rejected?

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.030
Is she your classmate?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.240
Do I know her?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.520
Can you stop asking?

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.740
Fine, I'll stop.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.550
I'll ask Mom to ask you.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.410
Don't you dare.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.680
Bai Ji,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.010
can I trust you?

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:17.920
Of course.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.290
There're some things

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.180
I can't really explain.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.330
But you have to trust me.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.520
I won't do anything stupid.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.370
I've figured it out.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:48.010
Wait...

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.660
What do you mean?

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.790
I don't understand.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.970
What you shouldn't have seen,

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:56.580
what you shouldn't have known,

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.590
just pretend it never happened.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.130
This family will never change.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.140
You must promise me

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.090
you won't ever

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.590
ask me again

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.850
or tell anyone.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.140
Never.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:19.680
Can you do that?

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:23.880
Yes.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.140
Come in.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.460
Mom.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.570
Writing a letter?

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.300
To my comrades.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.980
I asked Bai Ji

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.530
to sleep in Ju's room

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.160
and not to bother you.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.420
It's fine.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.900
I let him down this time.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:00.740
I broke my word.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.770
I should apologize to you too.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.080
I've only just come back,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.540
and now I'm leaving again.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.000
I told you

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.020
your own future

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.650
is your own decision to make.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.310
You don't need to apologize

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.570
to anyone.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.080
I just hope

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.650
you can be true to yourself.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.060
The saltworks is pretty good.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.500
At least it's a state-owned enterprise.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.400
I've always known

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.940
you like Bai Ju.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:49.920
Mom...

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:51.950
You...

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.220
You're my child.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.130
I'm able to tell

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.110
how you feel.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.320
You two have been the closest
since you were little.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.940
I saw

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.560
how you took care of Bai Ju.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.360
You decided to go to the saltworks

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.140
not because you wanted to go,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.030
but because of Bai Ju,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:24.810
right?

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.850
Mom,

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.720
why are you saying all this?

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.510
I've decided to swallow it.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.980
I didn't want anyone to know.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.190
You don't need to keep everything

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.940
to yourself.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:51.940
If you have something on your mind,

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.140
let it out.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.330
Don't keep it bottled up inside.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.290
Many things are no longer the way

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.620
I thought they would be.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.570
I had planned

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.520
to distinguish myself in the army,

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.160
earn a promotion to officer,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.530
and after a few years,

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.240
return with honor,

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.880
and say the words I'd kept unspoken

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.030
to Bai Ju.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.810
But I was wrong.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.130
This idea

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.960
was wrong from the beginning.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:31.880
Bai Chun,

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.600
there's nothing wrong
with you liking Bai Ju.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.780
But it is. Extremely wrong.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:40.380
She's always

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.160
seen me as an older brother,

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.980
trusted me,

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.200
and respected me.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.960
She would only

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.260
confide in me.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.660
I can't just go along with my own wishes.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:00.160
Besides,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.920
she already

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.380
has feelings for Mr. Shao.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.540
They're getting along so well

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.720
and such a good match,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.450
if I tell her,

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.460
it'll only hurt her

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.290
and mess up this family.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:13.940
I know

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.510
you are a sensible child.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.280
I'm sorry you had to

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.110
enlist so young

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.610
back when our family was struggling.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.090
If you had stayed at home

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.380
like Bai Ju,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.140
and went to university...

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.540
It's the same, Mom.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.030
It really is the same.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.420
I've made up my mind.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.500
In this family,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.410
I'll always...

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.640
I'll always be Bai Ju's older brother.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:03.750
Mom,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.050
my future...

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.720
you've let me decide for myself.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.900
My relationship...

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.640
let me decide for myself as well,

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.350
okay?

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.880
Chun,

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.500
we waited for you for so long,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.840
and you finally came back.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.400
But now,

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.010
you're leaving home again.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:40.960
Mom.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.190
Don't cry.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.060
It's not like I'm not coming back.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.570
Mom,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:07.750
I'm off.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.080
Take care of yourself.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.130
Goodbye.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.780
Goodbye.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.700
Bai Ju,

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.660
I've been in the army for six years.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:20.790
I guess I've gotten used to

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.530
[To Bai Ju]

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:23.750
putting my words to you

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.770
in letters.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.350
Let's

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.090
keep doing this.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.660
The saltworks is far from home,

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.130
so I can't go back often.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.400
Please help

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.640
take care of Mom and Bai Ji.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.010
Be careful

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.120
when you enter the mountains again.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:51.730
I remember you said

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.330
people in our life

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.870
will eventually leave.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.200
I saw you had made

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.440
new friends,

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.140
and it gave me

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.950
a bittersweet feeling.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:05.820
So I must go find

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.400
my place in the world now.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.480
And find the meaning of life again.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.280
Mr. Shao,

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.720
Bai Ju has always been

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.050
my most beloved sister.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.850
In her words,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.040
among the four kids in the family,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.730
she and I are the closest.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.750
Since she was little,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.440
I knew she was a brave

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.180
and independent girl.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.160
I once thought

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.510
she would always be free

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.550
and on her own.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:40.900
So,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.450
when I saw

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.240
she had someone she liked,

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.370
I was surprised,

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.980
but I'm also happy for her.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:52.820
After talking to you last time,

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.900
I knew

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.660
why she likes you.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:57.270
You said

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.380
there're people you like here,

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.780
and things you like to do.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.350
To be honest,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.140
I envy you.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.560
Bai Ju is someone who keeps herself busy

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.290
all the time.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.389
Someone who won't

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:09.889
give up easily.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.420
I hope you will stay by her side

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.820
and keep her company,

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.900
just like you are now.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.710
Come down.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:29.560
You'll report to the director.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.730
Hello.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.000
Is the director here?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.929
He's over there.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.130
I'll get him for you.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:38.860
Okay.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.550
Director!

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.710
Director!

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.380
They're here!

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.650
This place?

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.030
Isn't this exile?

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.530
Isn't it good here?

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:24.690
Vast horizons,

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.610
boundless opportunities!

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.200
Boundless opportunities!

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.150
Boundless opportunities!

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.760
Boundless opportunities!

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.290
Boundless opportunities!

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.500
Captain,

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:00.720
there's indeed

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.130
something wrong with this factory.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.650
This is from Chief Shi.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.800
What's wrong?

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.000
Take a look

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.090
at the names on these

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:08.950
two documents.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:10.940
They're both registration documents

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.870
of this factory.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.610
The name of the legal representative
doesn't align?

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.070
Right.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.540
This one here

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:17.760
is information of the legal representative

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.340
of Xinhua Electric Heater Factory.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:19.590
[Application for Business Registration
by a Legal Entity]

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:20.790
His name is Zhao Gang.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.130
He was sentenced for illegally

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:23.330
purchasing mercury.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.840
We knew about this.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.960
Chief Shi also said

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:29.930
Zhao Gang

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.630
has only been in office for three months.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.330
Before him,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.550
there was another legal representative.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.950
His name is Li Yongqiang.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.570
He used to be the legal representative

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.500
of this factory.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.210
He means

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:41.880
this Zhao Gang

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.300
is a scapegoat?

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.420
Li Yongqiang

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.460
is not a local.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.920
He's a merchant from the south.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.400
He also owns

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.670
a freight company.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.190
It's called

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:53.580
"Maji County Hongyuan Freight Company."

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:01.090
Why isn't there

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.220
a copy of his ID card?

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.800
Where's the photo?

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.730
I asked about it.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.050
They said it wasn't in the file.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.860
They lost it.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.650
I suspect that

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.670
it was sneaked out by the person

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.470
who submitted the application.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.620
Keep investigating.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.190
Okay.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.540
Are you done?

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.400
Drive the truck over here if you are,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.300
and load the goods.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:52.940
Wait a little longer.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.400
The driver isn't back yet.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.260
I can drive. Let me.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.710
Not bad.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.750
Nice work.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.070
I used to drive a truck.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.380
I have a driver's license.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.090
So how did you end up as the laborer?

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.540
The company went out of business.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.210
They didn't even pay our wages.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:42.780
Boss,

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.090
can I

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.320
drive here?

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.410
We don't hire Tibetan drivers.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.210
Come on.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.710
I'm a good driver.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.500
I've driven in the Uninhabited Zone.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.140
We don't go to the Uninhabited Zone.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.830
Right.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.530
I'm trying to say

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.360
I can work in harsh conditions.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.390
Go back to work.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.570
Boss!

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.860
The truck is fixed.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:13.570
Thank you.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:14.790
You're welcome.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.170
Thank you.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:19.360
Boss,

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:20.730
I am a Han Chinese.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.050
I have a license too.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:22.760
So...

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.410
can I be a driver here?

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.360
We don't hire non-locals.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.170
I've been here for more than three years.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.630
I know the roads very well.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:31.640
Hire me.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.340
I'll give you 20 more today.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.270
Get back to work.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:39.950
Where have you been?

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.280
We're leaving at midnight.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.210
What's the rush?

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:45.780
Have you been sleeping somewhere?

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.760
Just a nap.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.630
You drank?

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.860
It's tea.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:25.420
My turn?

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:26.230
Your turn.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.500
Can we throw away this stone?

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.610
Captain uses it to support his lower back.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:40.460
He'll be cross with you

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.590
if you throw it away.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.220
But it's so uncomfortable.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.340
People tend to have lower back issues
when they're old.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.110
It's better than nothing.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:53.940
I'll take a nap.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.010
Watch carefully.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.790
Wake me up if anyone comes out.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.110
Okay.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.070
That car?

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.390
The last digits are "158."

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.990
That's it.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.180
I've been discharged for a week.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:40.090
I should go back and say hi
to the patrol team.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:42.040
You can go back

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.730
when you're fully recovered.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.480
Everyone is busy

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.800
investigating the gold mine.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.000
You won't see anyone.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.050
Especially Sangba,

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:50.050
he's the busiest.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.930
He went to take the English exam again.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:53.830
But I'm telling you,

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.090
this time he's definitely going to pass.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.820
He's the one taking the exam.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.150
Why are you so confident?

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.940
I helped him cram for it.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.670
I've gained quite a bit of experience.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.350
What now?

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:08.870
Thinking about switching to
teaching English?

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.170
Well...

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.040
when I have kids,

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.780
I can help with their homework.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.170
You sure think far ahead.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.760
Thinking about kids

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.200
when you haven't even got a wife.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:23.150
You're right.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.660
I should think about wife first.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.330
Have you really never thought
about these things?

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.820
No.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:40.880
Bai Ju,

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:42.750
I remember you said

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:44.350
back in the Uninhabited Zone

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:46.510
that you don't have any goal.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.090
I said you do.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:49.480
You just

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:50.440
don't want to say it out loud.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.700
You're afraid your hopes will be dashed.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.090
So,

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.320
all these years,

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:54.690
was there

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.350
ever even just one time where,

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:58.960
regardless of what other people
might think of you

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.440
or what the outcome might be,

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.710
at the very moment you wanted it

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.370
the most,

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.810
you voiced your expectations?
