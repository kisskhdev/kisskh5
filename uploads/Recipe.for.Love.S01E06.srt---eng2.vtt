00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:01.804
(Child actors were accompanied by a guardian...)

00:00:01.804 --> 00:00:03.534
(and filmed in a safe, supervised environment.)

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:06.234
(Episode 6)

00:00:06.304 --> 00:00:08.404
What? What are you talking about?

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:10.144
What do you mean you're not coming back?

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:12.274
Look, honey.

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:14.344
Leaving? Where are you going?

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:21.014
Please try to understand, honey.

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:23.884
Of course, I understand, honey. I always do.

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:27.124
Thank you for understanding.

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.964
In that case, I guess this is goodbye.

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:31.734
Bye.

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:33.434
Hello?

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.734
Hello? Honey?

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:38.234
Was that Hui Gyeong?

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:42.304
Mom.

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:44.104
What did she say?

00:00:45.174 --> 00:00:48.144
- What? - What did she say?

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.884
It was nothing.

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:54.654
She said she met Seong Mi. Mom, what are you doing here?

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.254
The realtor called.

00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:58.494
The deposit for your new place hasn't come through.

00:00:58.794 --> 00:01:02.524
No way. Hui Gyeong said last night that she'd go to the realtor...

00:01:02.824 --> 00:01:06.294
and pay it. Let me call the realtor.

00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:09.264
Son, is something wrong?

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:11.604
Come on, Mom. Nothing's wrong.

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:13.904
When have I ever given you a reason to worry?

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.574
I have to pop out for a bit, Mom. The brace for Ms. Lee Chun Ja.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:21.074
I said I'd show her how to use it. I'll be right back.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:31.384
The phone is currently off. Connecting to voicemail.

00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:33.424
- Please leave a message after... - Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:36.864
- Mr. Gong. - Yes.

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:38.734
- No answer? - No, it's off.

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:41.164
Nurse Oh, how much of that did my mom hear?

00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:44.264
"Of course, I understand, honey. I always do."

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:45.834
From around that part.

00:01:46.404 --> 00:01:49.244
She didn't hear the part about her not coming back or leaving.

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:50.774
Man, I'm losing my mind.

00:01:51.614 --> 00:01:53.274
What on earth is going on?

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:55.114
Do you think maybe...

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:57.914
she got caught up in a voice phishing scam?

00:01:58.044 --> 00:01:59.054
What?

00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:01.854
It happens a lot these days. People click on one fake link,

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:04.284
get their phone hacked, and lose their life savings.

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:08.094
- Your wife's a little naive. - Right, I... My gosh.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.194
My brain is short-circuiting. My goodness, what should I do?

00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:15.304
What do you mean? You should contact our go-to cop,

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:19.804
- Officer Jung! - Right, yes. I'm on my way.

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:22.704
- I'll see you in a bit. - Yes, see you!

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:29.714
What? When did you see her last? What about your last call?

00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:33.684
I saw her briefly this morning when she was leaving for Seoul.

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:37.624
The last time we spoke was... Thirty minutes ago.

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:42.724
- Thirty minutes ago? - Yes. Please hurry.

00:02:43.464 --> 00:02:47.994
- Hurry. Trace her location. - Well...

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:49.234
Look.

00:02:49.664 --> 00:02:52.704
I know you worry about your wife. I really do.

00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:57.144
Running a trace after 30 minutes is a bit of a stretch, right?

00:02:57.204 --> 00:02:58.644
What do you mean, "a bit of a stretch?"

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:02.844
This isn't like her. She called, said strange things, and hung up!

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:05.014
And when I called back, her phone was off.

00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:08.284
It could be a voice phishing scam!

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:12.994
Hui Gyeong got our security deposit from my sister-in-law today.

00:03:12.994 --> 00:03:16.224
- In cash! It was all in cash! - Cash?

00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:19.164
Yes. And now that I'm thinking about it,

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:21.834
it's strange that she'd want that large sum in cash.

00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:23.934
It felt like someone was there, threatening her.

00:03:24.134 --> 00:03:27.034
She suddenly said she was leaving. Yes, it was so sudden!

00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:31.004
Deposit in cash, loss of contact, possible voice phishing.

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:33.874
It's a scary world out there, Chief.

00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:37.084
Please. I'm begging you. Help me, please.

00:03:37.144 --> 00:03:39.914
Try not to worry. I'll do everything I can to help.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.924
- Help with what? - Sir?

00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:46.024
Calm down. Let's wait a bit longer.

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:50.364
How can I wait? In my shoes, Chief, could you really just wait?

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:54.894
Fine. If you're that insistent, why not go to her work and ask?

00:03:54.994 --> 00:03:56.004
Right.

00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:00.374
Officer Jung. Please, I'm begging you.

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:01.974
You have to find her. Please.

00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:04.974
Yes, sir, I understand. Let me know if you learn more.

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:06.844
Okay, I will. Yes.

00:04:06.844 --> 00:04:08.744
(Reliable Police)

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:15.424
I'm sorry, what did you just say? The designer rentals aren't back?

00:04:15.884 --> 00:04:17.324
No one was home?

00:04:18.254 --> 00:04:20.194
That can't be. My brother-in-law was supposed to be here.

00:04:20.824 --> 00:04:23.394
All right, I get it. I'll call you back.

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:29.834
Auntie.

00:04:30.364 --> 00:04:32.604
Hey, Ji Hu. Yes.

00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:35.744
- Have you seen your dad? - No.

00:04:36.074 --> 00:04:37.144
Why? Is something wrong with Dad?

00:04:37.604 --> 00:04:39.814
What? Well...

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:42.814
(Sunny Korean Medicine Clinic)

00:04:42.814 --> 00:04:46.514
Hey, son. How did your English test go?

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:52.154
Really? Good job!

00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:56.964
Go ask your aunt for a snack. No cookies or anything like that.

00:04:57.024 --> 00:04:59.394
Tell her to give you something with protein.

00:04:59.894 --> 00:05:02.904
Mom, have you heard from Dad at all today?

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:05.904
No. Your dad's on a business trip, remember? Why?

00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:07.374
It's just that...

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:12.044
- I think Dad took Aunt's things. - Ji Hu, please.

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:15.984
What? What do you mean by that? Are you sure?

00:05:17.944 --> 00:05:20.384
Hey, Dong Suk.

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:22.954
What in the world did you say to him?

00:05:22.954 --> 00:05:26.454
What's missing that makes you think my husband took them?

00:05:27.554 --> 00:05:29.624
Go upstairs and study. Go on.

00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:36.404
No, it's not like that. I asked your husband...

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:38.974
to return some designer things I'd rented.

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:43.004
They say the items weren't returned, and I can't find them in the house.

00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:45.144
And his phone is off.

00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:49.514
What? He's on a business trip. Of course, his phone might be off.

00:05:49.714 --> 00:05:52.114
Ji Hu's dad went to a building site in Jecheon.

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:56.354
He went there to sign a contract for a bulk plan for foreign workers!

00:05:56.424 --> 00:05:59.954
How dare you call him a thief to his son without any facts?

00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:01.864
Why don't you try looking for them properly first?

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:04.324
What's with all the shouting?

00:06:04.794 --> 00:06:06.334
Who's accusing someone of being a thief?

00:06:06.594 --> 00:06:08.564
Your sister-in-law? Accusing your husband?

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.364
That's right. She says her designer rentals are lost.

00:06:11.434 --> 00:06:13.404
And she's implying that Ji Hu's dad stole them.

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.274
- Are you sure he didn't steal them? - Dad!

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:18.244
Yes. He probably sold them off...

00:06:18.274 --> 00:06:20.744
- and went to gamble it all away. - I told you, no!

00:06:20.874 --> 00:06:23.684
If he gets into trouble again, I'm kicking all of you out. Got it?

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:27.954
Just kick them out? If he actually stole something,

00:06:28.014 --> 00:06:31.824
I'll have him jailed for theft. That jerk.

00:06:33.594 --> 00:06:36.764
Gosh, I can't believe you guys. Seriously.

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:46.834
The phone is currently turned off and will be forwarded to voicemail.

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:48.974
Charges will apply after the tone...

00:06:50.204 --> 00:06:52.944
No way. It can't be true.

00:06:54.374 --> 00:06:55.514
No way.

00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:04.354
What do you mean, lost? I couldn't have lost them.

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.124
And even if they are, I can just pay for them in full, right?

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:11.864
What? Forty thousand dollars?

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:15.304
It's covered by insurance, right?

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:18.234
Come on, just kidding.

00:07:18.774 --> 00:07:22.844
I'll wire you the extra fee now. Okay.

00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:27.414
Oh, no. What am I going to do?

00:07:31.954 --> 00:07:34.484
Ta-da!

00:07:35.924 --> 00:07:39.694
Sweetie, if you keep this up, your dad will take your credit card.

00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:44.464
I only spent what I was allowed to. That's why I couldn't buy a purse.

00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:48.294
- So? - Let me borrow the limited edition.

00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:49.864
I want to take it on my date with Woo Jae.

00:07:51.534 --> 00:07:54.134
What? Don't even try to stop me. It's no use.

00:07:54.204 --> 00:07:55.604
The heart wants what it wants!

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:57.404
We'll see about that. We'll see if I can stop you.

00:07:57.704 --> 00:08:01.214
Did you know Woo Jae's older sister works at Taehan?

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:03.314
His sister works at Taehan?

00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:05.914
So when they said "a designer at a big company,"

00:08:05.914 --> 00:08:07.614
they meant Taehan.

00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:09.984
Darn, what a useless complication.

00:08:10.084 --> 00:08:14.254
What a weird coincidence. The same department as my brother.

00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:15.794
What? The same department?

00:08:15.864 --> 00:08:18.424
You didn't know? My brother is a fashion director.

00:08:19.094 --> 00:08:21.064
I bet they went to the workshop together today.

00:08:23.464 --> 00:08:26.004
My brother had a huge crush on her before he went to study abroad.

00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:30.244
- I hope they hit it off. - What? What did you say?

00:08:30.304 --> 00:08:33.614
If she and my brother get together, and I get together with Woo Jae...

00:08:34.044 --> 00:08:36.314
My gosh, we'd be double in-laws!

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:39.084
Are you serious? Don't say that. You're unbelievable!

00:08:39.084 --> 00:08:41.354
- How about some pork belly tonight? - Get out.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.054
I could go for some skin-on pork belly, too.

00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:44.624
Neener!

00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:53.294
What is this?

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.344
Surprise!

00:09:09.044 --> 00:09:10.884
It took some effort to book this place.

00:09:11.044 --> 00:09:14.484
Season 2 of "3 Days and 2 Nights."

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:17.924
This house was featured in Episode 35. Isn't it cool?

00:09:18.154 --> 00:09:21.054
Well, this doesn't exactly look like a five-star hotel.

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.924
Come on, a workshop at some predictable hotel...

00:09:23.994 --> 00:09:26.964
or resort is no fun, you know?

00:09:27.564 --> 00:09:31.604
- I happen to like "predictable." - And I dressed for a luxury hotel.

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:35.134
I was excited, thinking we'd have a buffet breakfast.

00:09:35.874 --> 00:09:38.574
Still, it's got a certain charm.

00:09:41.774 --> 00:09:44.514
I guess so. It has its charms.

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:48.514
See? Didn't I tell you it'd be beyond your wildest imagination?

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:52.394
So, what's the plan for food? Should I look up good places nearby?

00:09:52.454 --> 00:09:55.624
Come on, what's the whole point of a workshop?

00:09:56.464 --> 00:10:00.534
- To build some solid teamwork? - Exactly.

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:03.534
Which is why I've prepared...

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:07.704
- a cook-off! - What?

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:10.704
You'll split into two teams to cook, and I'll be the judge.

00:10:10.974 --> 00:10:13.574
There isn't a penalty for the losing team...

00:10:13.644 --> 00:10:16.484
or something like that, is there?

00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:19.684
- I have a bad feeling there is. - Don't tell me...

00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:20.954
We have to sleep outside?

00:10:21.514 --> 00:10:23.954
- Oh, bingo! - Shoot!

00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:28.224
Right. Our team uniforms.

00:10:29.064 --> 00:10:30.064
Come on over here.

00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:31.364
Team uniforms?

00:10:37.464 --> 00:10:38.604
All right.

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:41.734
I've prepared these...

00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:43.804
for the full countryside getaway experience.

00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:46.644
This is what you'd call "granny-chic."

00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:48.984
All right, get changed and come back out.

00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:52.314
I can't wear this. There's absolutely no way.

00:10:52.514 --> 00:10:53.684
I'm going home.

00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:55.054
Come on, let's go.

00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:56.824
Come on.

00:11:00.054 --> 00:11:01.254
Come on, what's wrong?

00:11:03.064 --> 00:11:05.894
- It's kind of cute. - What is this?

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:08.664
Hey, was he always like this?

00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:11.634
I don't think he was this over-the-top.

00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:14.774
I wonder what they were feeding him while he was abroad.

00:11:22.514 --> 00:11:23.684
My gosh!

00:11:27.214 --> 00:11:29.884
What do you think? It's cozy and quaint, right?

00:11:30.684 --> 00:11:34.494
Wow, even this unique country smell is perfect.

00:11:53.274 --> 00:11:55.544
Do we really have to wear these?

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:57.384
Ms. Gong.

00:12:00.914 --> 00:12:02.684
For crying out loud.

00:12:14.864 --> 00:12:17.404
Wow, you guys look great.

00:12:17.634 --> 00:12:20.034
You're all pros, so the fit is on another level.

00:12:20.434 --> 00:12:21.434
What do you think?

00:12:21.834 --> 00:12:23.804
And they're super comfortable to move in, right?

00:12:24.404 --> 00:12:26.974
Speaking as a professional and looking purely at practicality,

00:12:27.144 --> 00:12:30.744
the stretch, airflow, and comfort are the perfect trifecta.

00:12:31.544 --> 00:12:32.554
I knew you'd see it.

00:12:33.384 --> 00:12:35.884
All right, everyone must be hungry.

00:12:36.324 --> 00:12:37.524
So let's get started.

00:12:37.854 --> 00:12:39.354
Are we going to buy groceries?

00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:41.424
We have to source our ingredients ourselves.

00:12:41.824 --> 00:12:44.564
- In the middle of winter? - Out here in the middle of nowhere?

00:12:44.894 --> 00:12:47.794
Actually, over there in that greenhouse,

00:12:47.864 --> 00:12:50.204
we have permission to take and eat whatever we find there.

00:12:50.264 --> 00:12:53.774
Okay, so that's the vegetables, but what about protein?

00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:56.544
Don't tell me you're going to make us butcher a pig.

00:12:56.774 --> 00:12:58.774
Well, you're close.

00:12:59.814 --> 00:13:01.474
No way.

00:13:09.724 --> 00:13:12.024
Behold... Ice fishing!

00:13:12.084 --> 00:13:16.024
Ice fishing!

00:13:18.824 --> 00:13:21.934
See? This is what self-sufficiency is all about.

00:13:22.164 --> 00:13:23.964
Let's catch ourselves some fresh protein.

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:28.434
The feel of the catch on the line, the thrill running through you...

00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:30.374
I've always wanted to experience it. You know?

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.744
Should we just make a run for it?

00:13:35.444 --> 00:13:37.844
Or maybe we should go hide somewhere?

00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:41.614
Does anyone have a tranquilizer gun?

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:43.984
All right, let's go!

00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:48.124
- Let's go! - Let's go!

00:13:51.194 --> 00:13:53.734
(Habi Hair Salon)

00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:00.104
Hui Gyeong quit.

00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:02.074
She quit? When?

00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:04.974
The day before yesterday? Or maybe the day before that?

00:14:05.374 --> 00:14:07.044
Anyway, she quit all of a sudden.

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.614
I thought she was planning to open her own salon,

00:14:10.144 --> 00:14:13.484
since she was looking for a spot right after getting her license.

00:14:14.214 --> 00:14:15.884
She got her license? What do you mean?

00:14:16.284 --> 00:14:19.124
She got it a while back. Didn't she tell you?

00:14:19.694 --> 00:14:22.124
But she always said she was going to her class or to study.

00:14:23.264 --> 00:14:24.964
Where on earth has she been going all this time?

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:27.634
Gosh, Hui Gyeong.

00:14:28.264 --> 00:14:30.634
What are you hiding from me?

00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:33.534
Why are you doing this to me? Really.

00:14:35.304 --> 00:14:36.874
Did I do something wrong?

00:14:37.774 --> 00:14:39.674
There must be something. Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

00:14:40.244 --> 00:14:41.474
Hui Gyeong!

00:14:45.854 --> 00:14:47.554
(All Carriers Welcome)

00:14:54.124 --> 00:14:56.724
Welcome. Looking to get a new phone?

00:14:57.894 --> 00:14:59.164
No, that's not why I'm here.

00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:03.704
I'm Min Yong Gil's wife.

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:06.334
Well, what's gotten into him?

00:15:06.534 --> 00:15:07.604
What?

00:15:07.604 --> 00:15:09.374
He was a no-show, and his phone was off,

00:15:09.374 --> 00:15:10.904
so I figured something was wrong.

00:15:10.974 --> 00:15:12.374
But then, I came in this morning and saw...

00:15:12.644 --> 00:15:15.314
that all of the new merchandise was completely gone.

00:15:16.184 --> 00:15:17.414
You've got to be kidding me.

00:15:18.044 --> 00:15:20.954
You're saying my husband took all of it?

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:25.224
Yes. I checked the CCTV. He came last night and took it all!

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:28.054
How could he just stab me in the back like this?

00:15:28.754 --> 00:15:32.864
Tell him to bring it all back immediately, or I'll call the cops.

00:15:47.874 --> 00:15:52.114
My income covers our living costs, and the money your dad earns...

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:54.984
We're saving it for your tutoring and college tuition.

00:16:01.224 --> 00:16:02.464
(Min Yong Gil, In-branch Withdrawal: 35,286 dollars)

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:07.694
(Balance: 0.78 dollars, Onjeong Branch)

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:32.124
The phone is currently turned off. Connecting to voicemail.

00:16:32.184 --> 00:16:33.254
Charges will apply after the tone...

00:16:35.754 --> 00:16:38.124
- Mom. - Hi.

00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:39.434
- Yes, hey. - Hi.

00:16:39.434 --> 00:16:41.264
So? Have you heard from Hui Gyeong?

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:46.434
Yes. She said she got a call. Her aunt got ill, apparently.

00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:48.504
Is that what happened?

00:16:48.634 --> 00:16:52.974
Yes. She rushed her to the hospital, so she wasn't thinking straight.

00:16:53.414 --> 00:16:57.084
I see. So what's wrong with her? Is she doing okay now?

00:16:57.844 --> 00:17:01.514
Well, her blood... I guess she has high blood pressure.

00:17:01.584 --> 00:17:03.984
Anyway, I'm planning to visit her early tomorrow morning.

00:17:04.354 --> 00:17:08.254
You should. I'll get some vitamins and supplements later,

00:17:08.324 --> 00:17:09.724
so you can give them to her tomorrow.

00:17:09.824 --> 00:17:12.024
Okay, I will. And Mom, one more thing.

00:17:12.294 --> 00:17:14.334
I called the realtor and sorted everything out.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.804
Since the house is vacant, they said it's fine if we're a few days late.

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:20.204
Good. That's a relief.

00:17:20.704 --> 00:17:24.244
I'm going to head to bed. I have to catch the first train.

00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:25.544
Mom, I'm turning in.

00:17:54.104 --> 00:17:55.274
Hui Gyeong.

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:03.214
This is driving me nuts.

00:18:10.984 --> 00:18:11.984
Are you sure?

00:18:13.024 --> 00:18:14.524
You're sure he didn't get into some trouble again?

00:18:14.954 --> 00:18:17.794
I'm telling you, he didn't. I found them and sent them back.

00:18:18.124 --> 00:18:21.534
Honestly, you. I almost blamed him for nothing.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:22.864
I know, right?

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:24.804
Why won't you take it?

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:29.244
Put that on and see Dr. Gong. Ask him about the VP job.

00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:30.974
I said, forget it.

00:18:32.914 --> 00:18:35.344
Fine, then I'm canceling your golf game.

00:18:35.474 --> 00:18:38.144
And forget about running for city council, too.

00:18:42.514 --> 00:18:43.524
Do you want me to help you with that?

00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:48.694
Can't you just ask him?

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:51.424
Didn't you say you'd do anything for me?

00:18:51.924 --> 00:18:56.264
Oh, I could, sure. But you know what he'd say, right?

00:18:56.464 --> 00:18:59.004
"What kind of man hides behind his wife's skirt?"

00:18:59.504 --> 00:19:01.534
He'd say that and then some. That jerk.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:06.414
Plus, he'd tell Dr. Han Seong Mi, wouldn't he?

00:19:08.744 --> 00:19:09.784
Help me with my jacket.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:14.014
The embarrassment will only last a moment.

00:19:14.014 --> 00:19:16.284
You get what you want by asking.

00:19:16.354 --> 00:19:18.784
It won't be the last time we have to swallow our pride.

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:23.364
But that guy... He won't make me VP unless I get on my knees and beg.

00:19:23.394 --> 00:19:26.734
Honey. There's a way to get the same result...

00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:31.204
without actually having to do it. I'll show you how.

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.104
What's that?

00:19:38.444 --> 00:19:41.674
What's up? You stopped me on my way out,

00:19:41.744 --> 00:19:43.484
so spit it out.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:46.884
I know I'm sitting down right now,

00:19:47.814 --> 00:19:49.624
but could you pretend I'm kneeling?

00:19:50.084 --> 00:19:53.754
- What? - If I knelt, they'd stare at you,

00:19:54.554 --> 00:19:56.794
and that would be awkward for you, wouldn't it?

00:19:56.994 --> 00:20:01.194
Wow, you're seeing things now? Who else is here? No one's here.

00:20:04.364 --> 00:20:05.364
Right.

00:20:06.374 --> 00:20:08.604
So you want me to...

00:20:08.934 --> 00:20:11.144
make you the Vice President of the Merchants' Association?

00:20:11.504 --> 00:20:15.814
- Yes. - Why? To pad your council resume?

00:20:16.144 --> 00:20:17.184
Yes.

00:20:17.244 --> 00:20:21.484
Hey, you fool! Then you should've won the election!

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.524
Man, this guy...

00:20:24.154 --> 00:20:25.824
He won by one vote,

00:20:26.454 --> 00:20:28.894
and now he's so full of himself.

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.564
Oh, man. I can hear you, you know.

00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:32.994
Hey, come on.

00:20:33.694 --> 00:20:34.794
I'm asking for a favor here.

00:20:37.034 --> 00:20:41.574
Fine. Then you'll do as I say, right?

00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:44.244
Of course.

00:20:45.774 --> 00:20:50.314
Do morning exercises every day and facility safety checks. Can you?

00:20:50.384 --> 00:20:51.384
Of course.

00:20:52.014 --> 00:20:54.214
Go on patrol in your spare time,

00:20:54.284 --> 00:20:57.184
and handle every civil complaint that comes in.

00:20:57.554 --> 00:20:58.554
Of course.

00:20:58.554 --> 00:21:02.594
Oh, and on weekends, you have to help at busy shops,

00:21:02.654 --> 00:21:06.234
volunteer for the lunchbox program, and visit seniors living alone.

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:08.964
You'll attend the merchant forums, executive meetings,

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.404
and the general assemblies too, right?

00:21:12.164 --> 00:21:13.404
Of course.

00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:17.774
- You promise? - Yes. I promise.

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.844
- Hey, you don't trust me? - Right. I don't.

00:21:20.914 --> 00:21:23.514
Then what? What do you want from me?

00:21:23.714 --> 00:21:25.344
What, you want me to sign a written pledge or something?

00:21:25.714 --> 00:21:26.714
Kneel.

00:21:27.214 --> 00:21:29.724
- What? - Why? You can't do it?

00:21:29.954 --> 00:21:32.554
- Hey, you son of a... - All right.

00:21:32.554 --> 00:21:34.354
The exit is that way.

00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:36.724
Why would I leave?

00:21:42.464 --> 00:21:43.934
I'm all yours.

00:21:45.334 --> 00:21:47.974
All right, okay. Fine. You got it.

00:21:49.544 --> 00:21:50.544
Thanks, man.

00:21:53.174 --> 00:21:55.714
I really didn't think you'd actually kneel, though.

00:21:56.044 --> 00:21:58.214
- I'm surprised. - Hey, it's a great leg workout.

00:21:58.714 --> 00:21:59.714
Hey.

00:22:00.414 --> 00:22:01.654
As your old friend,

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:03.524
do me one favor.

00:22:03.854 --> 00:22:06.924
What? Not to tell Seong Mi about this?

00:22:07.694 --> 00:22:09.464
- Yes. - All right.

00:22:09.764 --> 00:22:12.494
I know you've had a thing for Seong Mi since way back,

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:16.904
so I'll let you save a little pride, man to man.

00:22:17.704 --> 00:22:18.704
Thanks.

00:22:20.534 --> 00:22:21.534
I'm counting on you, then.

00:22:27.174 --> 00:22:30.214
Really? Bucket actually got on his knees?

00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:33.984
Yes. Man, he must have been desperate.

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:39.124
This has his wife written all over it.

00:22:39.824 --> 00:22:42.094
I know, right? Even to me, it was clear...

00:22:42.154 --> 00:22:46.494
- someone told him to do it. - They're quite the pair.

00:22:47.794 --> 00:22:50.264
I did it. I pulled it off. This is for us.

00:22:50.834 --> 00:22:53.574
Honey, well done.

00:22:53.634 --> 00:22:56.344
Soon, you'll be a city council member.

00:22:56.344 --> 00:22:57.544
- Right? - Yes.

00:22:57.904 --> 00:23:00.114
But you managed to do it without kneeling, right?

00:23:00.174 --> 00:23:02.544
Come on. Jeong Han is a pushover.

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:05.544
Your husband is very capable and resourceful.

00:23:05.614 --> 00:23:07.084
Didn't you know you married such an amazing man?

00:23:07.154 --> 00:23:10.824
- Of course. It's why I married you. - Of course...

00:23:11.854 --> 00:23:15.524
Anyway, don't you worry about a thing.

00:23:15.754 --> 00:23:17.024
Just go ahead and schedule your golf games.

00:23:17.794 --> 00:23:19.024
You bet.

00:23:19.864 --> 00:23:20.864
Well done, honey.

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:26.164
Ji Hu, you must be hungry. I'll make you a late-night snack.

00:23:26.334 --> 00:23:27.804
I'm okay, Auntie.

00:23:28.034 --> 00:23:30.804
Really? Then can I get you something to drink?

00:23:31.204 --> 00:23:33.644
I was just getting my mom a glass of cold water.

00:23:34.944 --> 00:23:36.544
I'm worried she'll get dehydrated.

00:23:37.714 --> 00:23:38.714
From crying so much.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.694
How could he do this?

00:23:48.094 --> 00:23:52.624
How could he do this again? How are Ji Hu and I going to live?

00:23:53.364 --> 00:23:56.034
This is just too much. It really is.

00:24:20.224 --> 00:24:22.154
I thought she was packing for our move,

00:24:24.494 --> 00:24:26.224
but it looks like she only took her own things.

00:24:27.294 --> 00:24:28.994
Hui Gyeong, why on earth?

00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:33.604
Who could that be?

00:24:36.304 --> 00:24:38.004
Hello? Hui Gyeong, is that you?

00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:41.274
Yes, Officer Jung.

00:24:42.374 --> 00:24:44.644
No, I haven't heard from her. I still haven't found her.

00:24:44.714 --> 00:24:46.454
(Onjeong Police Substation)

00:24:46.554 --> 00:24:49.454
Mr. Gong. I have the day off tomorrow.

00:24:49.584 --> 00:24:52.484
So, about looking for your wife, if you don't mind,

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:55.554
could I help you on my own time?

00:24:55.824 --> 00:24:56.824
Really?

00:24:58.064 --> 00:25:00.564
Yes, I would be so grateful if you would.

00:25:01.164 --> 00:25:04.564
To be honest, I was frustrated because I had no one to talk to.

00:25:07.074 --> 00:25:08.634
Thank you, Officer Jung.

00:25:09.534 --> 00:25:11.904
Yes. Thank you.

00:25:22.384 --> 00:25:23.384
Here you go.

00:25:25.654 --> 00:25:28.754
Your dad and your sister have never once been like this,

00:25:28.824 --> 00:25:31.964
so who on earth do you take after to be so sweet, son?

00:25:32.024 --> 00:25:33.494
I guess I take after my uncle.

00:25:34.394 --> 00:25:38.564
By the way, Ju Ah let me know she got to her workshop okay.

00:25:39.334 --> 00:25:41.704
Of course, she'd call you, but not me.

00:25:43.144 --> 00:25:44.244
Right, Gong Woo Jae!

00:25:44.974 --> 00:25:48.814
Why do you have to use my full name? It's scary.

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:52.284
Did you know Bucket's son and Ju Ah work at the same company?

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:54.354
Yes, I did.

00:25:54.414 --> 00:25:56.624
And you didn't even tell me. The nerve of you two.

00:25:56.724 --> 00:25:58.254
Wait, are you talking about...

00:25:58.684 --> 00:26:01.694
the grandson from the herbal clinic who studied abroad?

00:26:01.754 --> 00:26:05.264
Yes. But apparently, he pretends not to know Ju Ah.

00:26:05.764 --> 00:26:08.764
Why? What? Has it been so long that he doesn't remember her?

00:26:09.704 --> 00:26:14.174
Our families are tangled in odd ways, even the kids.

00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:16.474
You.

00:26:16.874 --> 00:26:19.944
Stay away from their daughter. Got it?

00:26:20.544 --> 00:26:24.244
Stay away? Please. Their granddaughter wants Woo Jae.

00:26:24.314 --> 00:26:26.584
- What's he supposed to do? - Exactly.

00:26:26.654 --> 00:26:31.084
It takes two to tango. So watch yourself.

00:26:31.154 --> 00:26:34.494
- And draw a clear line. Understand? - Yes, I heard you.

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:36.994
Hey, just eat.

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:41.064
I'm going to my room.

00:26:41.164 --> 00:26:44.434
Hey, wait. You're just leaving after peeling all this?

00:26:49.134 --> 00:26:51.944
What took you so long? I was about to raid your house.

00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:52.974
Why?

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:55.914
What do you mean, why? We have a date to plan.

00:26:55.974 --> 00:26:57.514
We need to make plans.

00:26:57.914 --> 00:27:01.254
Hey, Eun Bin. Did you tell anyone in your family about it?

00:27:01.684 --> 00:27:04.684
What? No.

00:27:05.054 --> 00:27:06.854
You can't tell them. Ever.

00:27:06.924 --> 00:27:11.664
Don't worry. We pinky promised as our first physical contact.

00:27:11.724 --> 00:27:13.064
As if I would ever tell.

00:27:13.494 --> 00:27:15.064
You call that physical contact?

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:19.434
Hey, it's not that complicated. If we touched, it counts.

00:27:20.634 --> 00:27:24.074
You know my brother and your sister work at the same company, right?

00:27:24.074 --> 00:27:26.374
Yes, and your parents know that, right?

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:29.984
Of course. My stepmom's already throwing a fit about it.

00:27:30.284 --> 00:27:31.544
Woo Jae.

00:27:32.114 --> 00:27:35.184
I have a new wish. And that is...

00:27:35.254 --> 00:27:38.384
- Double in-laws! - What?

00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:42.454
My brother marries your sister, and you and I get married...

00:27:43.394 --> 00:27:46.534
Hey! Gosh, I can't believe he just hung up on me.

00:27:47.964 --> 00:27:52.334
If that actually happened, my stepmom would lose her mind.

00:27:53.574 --> 00:27:58.304
I get giddy just thinking about it. Double in-laws!

00:28:00.614 --> 00:28:04.484
You call this a relaxing getaway? This is just hard labor.

00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:08.854
Come on! What are you talking about? This is as real as relaxation gets.

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:12.184
Do you know what it takes for something like this in the city?

00:28:12.554 --> 00:28:15.424
You have to book a farm experience, fight through all the traffic,

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.924
pay an admission fee, and rent boots and a trowel.

00:28:19.024 --> 00:28:23.134
- All just to dig up one potato. - Right.

00:28:23.264 --> 00:28:28.204
Look at us. An authentic location with a real farm and real labor.

00:28:28.274 --> 00:28:30.444
A spicy stew with green onions and potatoes...

00:28:30.444 --> 00:28:32.344
you dug yourself in the cold winter.

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:35.944
That's not just a spicy stew. It's soul-stirring stew.

00:28:36.044 --> 00:28:38.684
Gosh, why did I even open my mouth?

00:28:38.744 --> 00:28:41.854
That soul-stirring stew defines real local food,

00:28:41.914 --> 00:28:44.754
and the ultimate rural food therapy, wouldn't you agree?

00:28:45.124 --> 00:28:46.794
Now, let's go prep these. What do you say?

00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:53.894
How on earth did he become such a chatterbox?

00:28:55.894 --> 00:28:58.964
- Hurry up, Ms. Gong! - Yes, I'm coming.

00:28:59.634 --> 00:29:01.474
He must have eaten something weird.

00:29:18.354 --> 00:29:20.994
Shouldn't we go help them?

00:29:21.394 --> 00:29:22.924
No, let them have their moment.

00:29:24.824 --> 00:29:25.824
Let's just take a break.

00:29:28.564 --> 00:29:29.564
Man, it's cold.

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:31.604
I'm tired, but still...

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:37.874
So you don't just like to eat.

00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:39.474
It looks like you're a good cook, too.

00:29:40.514 --> 00:29:41.514
You too, Ms. Gong.

00:29:42.274 --> 00:29:45.284
I felt you'd be good at anything you do with your hands.

00:29:48.584 --> 00:29:52.424
You're talking like you knew me in the past.

00:29:55.624 --> 00:29:57.724
Was I?

00:30:12.974 --> 00:30:16.244
Gosh, you guys are the worst. Couldn't you just start the fire?

00:30:16.544 --> 00:30:19.284
Hey, the firewood was too damp. It wouldn't catch.

00:30:19.414 --> 00:30:21.554
Then you could've at least tried to dry it out.

00:30:22.514 --> 00:30:24.454
That's what I suggested.

00:30:26.054 --> 00:30:27.654
Gosh, honestly...

00:30:30.424 --> 00:30:31.424
Sorry.

00:30:37.334 --> 00:30:38.334
Unbelievable.

00:30:38.864 --> 00:30:42.134
Sorry. I meant to lie down for a second but passed out.

00:30:42.534 --> 00:30:43.904
It's fine. I'll take care of it.

00:30:44.274 --> 00:30:46.944
So what if the firewood is damp? You think it won't catch fire?

00:30:47.814 --> 00:30:51.044
Director, it's getting really late. Why don't we just order in?

00:30:51.314 --> 00:30:54.254
No. We started this, so we have to see it through.

00:30:55.554 --> 00:30:56.554
All right.

00:30:58.384 --> 00:31:01.124
- What do we do? Director! - No, it's fine. Just let him.

00:31:01.454 --> 00:31:03.594
Just wait. We're already running late,

00:31:04.394 --> 00:31:05.464
so let's just let him do his thing.

00:31:11.964 --> 00:31:14.674
- What should we do? - He's unstoppable.

00:31:34.554 --> 00:31:35.954
Gosh, I'm starving.

00:31:38.294 --> 00:31:39.924
- Oh, wait... - Ms. Gong.

00:31:40.564 --> 00:31:42.934
Isn't he being way too stubborn?

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:46.604
Can't we just order some jjajangmyeon or something?

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:54.344
Come on.

00:32:01.854 --> 00:32:02.884
Gosh, it's freezing.

00:32:04.254 --> 00:32:06.724
- This is all the newspaper we have. - Oh, yes.

00:32:07.424 --> 00:32:08.594
Thanks.

00:32:08.594 --> 00:32:10.994
Honestly, this isn't going to work, is it?

00:32:12.194 --> 00:32:15.034
Tell me about it. Nothing's going according to plan.

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:20.534
This is part of the fun of a trip. The smoke's making my eyes water.

00:32:21.934 --> 00:32:23.004
Should we just call it a day?

00:32:23.744 --> 00:32:25.704
No way. We have to see this through.

00:32:26.674 --> 00:32:30.084
You go in and get some rest. I started this, so I'll finish it.

00:32:32.084 --> 00:32:34.184
- Are you sure? - Yes.

00:32:35.254 --> 00:32:36.254
Good luck, then.

00:32:43.024 --> 00:32:45.064
- Oh, boy. - All right.

00:32:53.534 --> 00:32:54.534
My goodness.

00:33:08.084 --> 00:33:09.084
This hits the spot.

00:33:11.284 --> 00:33:12.284
Oh, my.

00:33:27.034 --> 00:33:28.774
We could seriously sell this.

00:33:29.804 --> 00:33:32.904
Ms. Gong is the one who got the seasoning just right.

00:33:35.774 --> 00:33:39.314
Honestly, I thought it'd be a bust and we'd starve.

00:33:39.514 --> 00:33:42.884
Me, too. Honestly, you really surprised me, Director.

00:33:43.014 --> 00:33:45.224
Same here. I would've just given up,

00:33:45.954 --> 00:33:47.924
but you were incredibly persistent.

00:33:49.024 --> 00:33:51.424
I'm just glad it all worked out.

00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:54.834
Otherwise, I'd have looked like a fool.

00:33:56.794 --> 00:33:58.664
- Team Leader. - Yes?

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:01.604
Oh, I meant Ms. Gong.

00:34:02.074 --> 00:34:05.004
- Oh, yes. - Use surnames to avoid confusion.

00:34:05.144 --> 00:34:06.144
Why, you...

00:34:06.204 --> 00:34:10.944
Hey, instead of that, why don't we all just go by "Pro?"

00:34:11.444 --> 00:34:13.614
Right. There are only a few of us anyway.

00:34:14.014 --> 00:34:16.354
Besides, what kind of leader am I if I don't even have a team?

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:18.554
Would that be all right with you, Director?

00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:23.994
I've always felt our formal titles can create a sense of distance.

00:34:24.624 --> 00:34:27.964
If it encourages everyone to be a top pro in their role...

00:34:29.664 --> 00:34:33.734
- I'm fine with it. - All right then, Pro Gong!

00:34:34.004 --> 00:34:35.674
Pro Jo Seong Min.

00:34:36.304 --> 00:34:37.574
- Cheers! - And Pro Kim!

00:34:37.644 --> 00:34:40.004
- What is it, Pro Jo? - Hey, Pro Shin!

00:34:40.074 --> 00:34:41.614
Pro Choi!

00:34:44.444 --> 00:34:45.444
Hang on a second.

00:34:46.414 --> 00:34:48.454
If that's the spirit behind it,

00:34:48.854 --> 00:34:51.224
does that mean we can call you Pro Yang, Director?

00:34:51.384 --> 00:34:54.394
My goodness. Absolutely not.

00:34:56.824 --> 00:34:59.524
All right, everyone! What a great night.

00:35:00.234 --> 00:35:01.764
To all of us... Cheers!

00:35:02.394 --> 00:35:05.804
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:35:12.644 --> 00:35:15.144
- Director, let me pour you a drink. - Thanks.

00:35:15.774 --> 00:35:18.284
- You worked so hard today. - Thank you.

00:35:18.784 --> 00:35:20.784
- Let me pour you one, too. - Sure.

00:35:21.654 --> 00:35:22.654
Here you go.

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:24.654
I should've helped you out more.

00:35:25.784 --> 00:35:29.054
- Time for our favorite random game - Hey!

00:35:29.054 --> 00:35:31.564
- What's the game? Game on - What's the game? Game on

00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:33.994
- Cheers. - Cheers.

00:35:34.264 --> 00:35:35.694
- Introduce yourselves! - Introduce yourselves!

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:37.434
I'm Strawberry!

00:35:37.904 --> 00:35:38.904
I'm Lemon!

00:35:39.234 --> 00:35:40.234
Watermelon, two!

00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:41.574
Watermelon, watermelon!

00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:43.974
- Grapes, four! - Grapes...

00:35:45.344 --> 00:35:46.874
This is nice. It has a great atmosphere.

00:35:48.114 --> 00:35:50.314
I'm happy.

00:35:52.214 --> 00:35:54.614
Director, you have this energy...

00:35:55.384 --> 00:35:56.984
It's so bright and positive.

00:35:57.424 --> 00:36:02.224
- I do? - Yes. You're always so positive,

00:36:02.294 --> 00:36:04.294
optimistic, and cheerful.

00:36:05.564 --> 00:36:09.164
Your whole approach to life, or your philosophy, I guess...

00:36:09.394 --> 00:36:11.634
Whatever it is, I really envy you for that.

00:36:15.934 --> 00:36:18.304
This is just between you and me, Pro Park.

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:20.714
The truth is, a long time ago...

00:36:22.074 --> 00:36:23.514
I was a total crybaby.

00:36:24.714 --> 00:36:25.714
Really?

00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:29.854
Come on, I find that hard to believe.

00:36:30.584 --> 00:36:32.284
No, I'm serious.

00:36:33.654 --> 00:36:35.454
Back then, I was so miserable,

00:36:36.754 --> 00:36:38.964
it felt like my whole world was crashing down.

00:36:40.994 --> 00:36:44.834
I was so lonely and wretched, and felt like I'd lost everything.

00:36:46.004 --> 00:36:49.234
I felt so helpless, like there was nothing I could do,

00:36:49.904 --> 00:36:50.974
so I cried every day.

00:36:54.914 --> 00:36:56.114
But one day,

00:36:56.744 --> 00:36:59.044
someone said this to me.

00:36:59.814 --> 00:37:01.284
It was the adults' fault.

00:37:01.814 --> 00:37:03.184
It's not your fault.

00:37:06.484 --> 00:37:08.054
And then, guess what?

00:37:08.794 --> 00:37:10.294
That person bought me a pork cutlet.

00:37:12.194 --> 00:37:14.034
Pork cutlet? Now, that's love.

00:37:26.774 --> 00:37:27.774
Yes.

00:37:28.644 --> 00:37:29.874
- All right. - Wait a minute, hold on.

00:37:30.544 --> 00:37:32.944
Was it a woman who bought you the pork cutlet?

00:37:34.914 --> 00:37:35.914
Yes.

00:37:36.984 --> 00:37:38.654
And then, on the day I left Korea,

00:37:41.624 --> 00:37:42.924
she sang me a song.

00:37:44.094 --> 00:37:47.234
I have been so lonely and had such a hard time

00:37:47.864 --> 00:37:51.604
But it's only a rehearsal

00:37:53.334 --> 00:37:56.874
I'm not going to fall down

00:37:57.444 --> 00:37:58.874
I got this

00:37:58.874 --> 00:38:00.004
Goodbye, Yang Hyun Bin.

00:38:00.914 --> 00:38:02.974
Make sure you come back happy.

00:38:03.674 --> 00:38:04.684
Okay?

00:38:06.744 --> 00:38:08.114
I made a resolution then and there.

00:38:08.914 --> 00:38:12.184
I had to be happy. I would never cry again.

00:38:12.254 --> 00:38:14.954
So that if I ever met her again someday,

00:38:16.354 --> 00:38:18.724
she would praise me for having lived a good life.

00:38:27.064 --> 00:38:28.104
So for me,

00:38:28.704 --> 00:38:32.374
that one thought drove me to work hard at being happy.

00:38:36.544 --> 00:38:38.814
Did you meet her again after returning to Korea?

00:38:41.954 --> 00:38:43.214
What was it like seeing her again?

00:38:43.884 --> 00:38:44.954
Do you still have feelings for her?

00:38:48.424 --> 00:38:49.424
I do.

00:38:50.894 --> 00:38:51.894
Cheers.

00:39:05.044 --> 00:39:06.174
This is nice.

00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:36.504
Dae Han. Weren't you taking the first train?

00:39:36.704 --> 00:39:37.704
Time to get up.

00:39:42.374 --> 00:39:43.374
Dae Han.

00:39:47.814 --> 00:39:49.584
Gosh, he's already left.

00:39:50.114 --> 00:39:51.584
I told him to take the supplements with him.

00:39:59.824 --> 00:40:01.194
What on earth is this?

00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:05.534
Hey, Jeong Han. You must've heard from Mom.

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:07.774
Aunt will be okay.

00:40:09.604 --> 00:40:10.804
Sorry to make you worry, Jeong Han.

00:40:11.774 --> 00:40:12.804
Don't be.

00:40:13.304 --> 00:40:15.674
All right. Just travel safe, okay?

00:40:17.074 --> 00:40:18.314
- Nurse Oh. - Yes?

00:40:18.314 --> 00:40:20.754
Can you contact the part-timer who came the other day...

00:40:20.954 --> 00:40:23.954
and reschedule today's manual therapy appointments?

00:40:24.154 --> 00:40:25.154
Got it.

00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:27.394
Why? Is something wrong?

00:40:27.924 --> 00:40:29.094
Why isn't Mr. Gong coming in?

00:40:29.424 --> 00:40:32.594
Apparently, his wife's aunt is not feeling well.

00:40:33.894 --> 00:40:36.064
What? That can't be right.

00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:41.404
And where is this guy? He hasn't even shown up. Goodness.

00:40:41.674 --> 00:40:42.674
Who are you talking about?

00:40:43.604 --> 00:40:45.374
Gosh, seriously.

00:40:47.004 --> 00:40:50.844
The bike-share data breach was found late last month.

00:40:51.414 --> 00:40:53.844
The Seoul Facilities Corp. was sued for violating data privacy...

00:40:53.844 --> 00:40:55.314
Goodness, what now?

00:40:59.584 --> 00:41:00.894
Hey, Dr. Gong.

00:41:01.524 --> 00:41:04.964
Hey! What are you doing? Get your butt over here now!

00:41:05.224 --> 00:41:09.534
I didn't sleep a wink last night. I was coughing all night.

00:41:10.934 --> 00:41:15.504
The election stressed me out. I've come down with a bug.

00:41:15.604 --> 00:41:17.444
(Onjeong Market)

00:41:17.544 --> 00:41:21.014
What? You're the one who brags about never even catching a cold,

00:41:21.074 --> 00:41:24.314
so how come you don't take your family's herbal medicine?

00:41:24.644 --> 00:41:28.414
I know, right? But I can't get other people sick.

00:41:28.484 --> 00:41:29.484
Right?

00:41:33.584 --> 00:41:34.954
Gosh, I have to go. I feel like I'm dying.

00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:42.794
Ouch, that hurts! Dad! What was that for?

00:41:42.864 --> 00:41:44.764
If you're going to do something, do it right, you pathetic fool!

00:41:44.904 --> 00:41:47.704
Who said I wasn't going to? I'll do it!

00:41:48.204 --> 00:41:50.074
I was just messing around.

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:51.474
Get a move on!

00:41:51.674 --> 00:41:54.144
Dad, I just told him I couldn't go because I'm not feeling well.

00:41:54.844 --> 00:41:56.574
If I show up now, I'll look like a fool.

00:41:58.784 --> 00:42:00.914
What? Wait, is that for real?

00:42:01.314 --> 00:42:02.754
Hey, hush.

00:42:03.484 --> 00:42:06.284
But why give the VP position to Dr. Yang?

00:42:06.454 --> 00:42:08.994
If that was the plan, why bother running in the election?

00:42:09.394 --> 00:42:12.124
Well, I only won by one vote.

00:42:12.364 --> 00:42:14.434
It means support is evenly split, don't you think?

00:42:14.664 --> 00:42:19.634
I figured if I gave him the VP spot, I could also absorb his pledges.

00:42:19.764 --> 00:42:22.704
But you didn't predict he'd just blow off work like this?

00:42:24.044 --> 00:42:25.244
Of course, I did.

00:42:25.704 --> 00:42:29.744
But I came fully prepared, so don't you worry.

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:31.414
Prepared, how?

00:42:32.784 --> 00:42:35.784
- Father, come and eat. You, too. - All right.

00:42:45.924 --> 00:42:48.064
Man, this guy doesn't give up.

00:42:48.994 --> 00:42:49.994
What's this?

00:42:50.394 --> 00:42:55.404
Get here right now, or I can't say how far this video will spread.

00:42:55.774 --> 00:42:57.574
What is he talking about? What video?

00:42:57.774 --> 00:43:00.244
(Unfair Gong Jeong Han)

00:43:06.284 --> 00:43:07.614
That crazy jerk!

00:43:08.184 --> 00:43:10.784
No, no way. What do I do?

00:43:11.084 --> 00:43:12.224
Oh, no!

00:43:12.224 --> 00:43:15.024
Two, two, three, four.

00:43:15.454 --> 00:43:18.894
Dr. Yang! Hurry up and join us. Come on.

00:43:19.124 --> 00:43:20.934
Okay, let's do some waist exercises. Put your hands on your hips.

00:43:20.994 --> 00:43:25.034
All right. One, two, three, four.

00:43:26.834 --> 00:43:31.104
Seven, eight. One foot forward,

00:43:31.174 --> 00:43:35.344
and finger hearts. One, two, three, four,

00:43:35.414 --> 00:43:39.084
five, six, seven, eight. Switch feet.

00:43:39.344 --> 00:43:41.854
Two, two, three, four,

00:43:41.914 --> 00:43:46.384
five, six, seven, eight. Great job, everyone.

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:51.524
All right, have a healthy and prosperous day!

00:43:51.624 --> 00:43:53.564
See you all tomorrow morning!

00:43:55.764 --> 00:43:56.764
Good work, everyone.

00:43:58.104 --> 00:44:01.234
- Hey, Gong Jeong Han. - What? I thought you were sick.

00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:03.304
Wow, you have a healthy glow.

00:44:03.734 --> 00:44:05.944
Delete the video.

00:44:06.244 --> 00:44:07.244
No.

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:09.244
Hey, I really was sick!

00:44:10.144 --> 00:44:12.514
What kind of Korean medicine doctor lies about being sick?

00:44:12.714 --> 00:44:15.554
Do you have no ethics as a medical professional?

00:44:15.654 --> 00:44:18.784
Hey, threatening me with CCTV footage...

00:44:19.224 --> 00:44:23.294
- is blatant blackmail. Got it? - Is it? Then feel free to back out.

00:44:23.954 --> 00:44:28.064
I arranged for your VP certificate. I guess I should call and cancel.

00:44:28.434 --> 00:44:30.194
- Wait. - Right.

00:44:30.464 --> 00:44:34.234
The local paper wants an exclusive interview with us.

00:44:34.374 --> 00:44:36.034
I'd better cancel that, too.

00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:37.804
All right, fine! I get it.

00:44:38.504 --> 00:44:40.774
I'll work my butt off for you,

00:44:41.514 --> 00:44:42.814
so just don't release that video. All right?

00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:44.114
Okay.

00:44:45.184 --> 00:44:46.444
Look at that. You're looking even healthier now.

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:49.584
Let's head out for our morning patrol!

00:44:50.784 --> 00:44:55.354
Morning! Hope you sell a lot and have a great day!

00:44:58.364 --> 00:45:00.664
Man, I'm so curious.

00:45:01.334 --> 00:45:03.064
I don't think her aunt is actually sick.

00:45:05.534 --> 00:45:06.534
Nurse Oh.

00:45:07.164 --> 00:45:08.834
Are you talking about Hui Gyeong's aunt?

00:45:09.634 --> 00:45:10.844
Do you know something?

00:45:11.274 --> 00:45:12.844
No.

00:45:13.474 --> 00:45:15.944
I meant my aunt.

00:45:28.154 --> 00:45:30.454
Take care of yourself, Aunt.

00:45:31.024 --> 00:45:32.564
I'll come visit again sometime.

00:45:32.994 --> 00:45:35.764
Tell that brat, Hui Gyeong, to call me once in a while.

00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:38.304
I know she's uneducated, but still.

00:45:38.604 --> 00:45:42.934
How could she just cut me off after I raised her?

00:45:43.434 --> 00:45:44.444
Okay.

00:45:58.454 --> 00:46:00.824
- Can you please hurry up? - I'm all done.

00:46:01.224 --> 00:46:02.794
Are you just going to keep spraying this with water?

00:46:03.154 --> 00:46:06.164
- You need to scrub it. - When I do a job, I do it right.

00:46:06.224 --> 00:46:09.264
You heard the Director and me talking last night, didn't you?

00:46:10.094 --> 00:46:13.264
You knew I heard you and asked him if he still liked me. Is that it?

00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:16.404
Not exactly.

00:46:17.204 --> 00:46:18.204
Anyway, you're grateful, aren't you?

00:46:18.704 --> 00:46:22.174
I guess a guy really can't ever forget his first love.

00:46:22.814 --> 00:46:24.684
That was just the alcohol talking.

No, she hasn't been in touch.

I found something in the locker Hui Gyeong used.

- What? - I thought it was an old newspaper.

00:47:46.394 --> 00:47:49.694

Remember how you'd carry my bag on the way to piano lessons?

You said it dragged on the ground because I was too short,

so you carried it for me every day.

I don't think we're close enough to be reminiscing like this.

00:57:35.784 --> 00:57:37.584
Just because we had a falling-out,

00:57:38.214 --> 00:57:40.584
it doesn't mean the memories just disappear.

What?

00:58:12.884 --> 00:58:16.024
I thought he was scared of getting kicked out,

00:58:16.024 --> 00:58:17.594
but he took off on his own.

00:58:18.424 --> 00:58:19.924
And this time,

00:58:20.624 --> 00:58:21.894

Watch your mouth.

My Hui Gyeong is not like that, you hear me?

00:59:03.704 --> 00:59:04.934
But it's true.

00:59:05.604 --> 00:59:08.744
"It feels like a dream, darling."

00:59:09.414 --> 00:59:10.414
That's what she said.

00:59:12.944 --> 00:59:15.384
When she's with you,

00:59:15.454 --> 00:59:18.154
she calls you "honey," right? But she said...

00:59:18.784 --> 00:59:21.584
"My dear husband has no idea."

00:59:21.954 --> 00:59:25.094
- "See you tomorrow, darling." - Hey!

00:59:25.164 --> 00:59:27.394
- You scared me! - I've had enough of you... Darn it.

00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:29.034
What are you yelling for?

00:59:40.504 --> 00:59:41.844
Yes, Officer Jung.

00:59:41.874 --> 00:59:44.114
Yes, hi. Sorry it took me a while to get back to you.

00:59:44.374 --> 00:59:46.444
I've been canvassing the area all day.

00:59:46.584 --> 00:59:49.984
Don't worry about it. I appreciate you looking into this.

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:54.424
Well, I wasn't able to find your wife.

00:59:54.754 --> 00:59:56.994
But I did find a lead.

00:59:57.394 --> 00:59:58.824
- A lead? - Yes.

00:59:59.024 --> 01:00:01.594
I'm at the convenience store where I shop often.

01:00:01.834 --> 01:00:05.064
Apparently, the owner overheard Ms. Lee Hui Gyeong...

01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:07.064
talking on the phone with someone.

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:10.974
Who was she on the phone with?

01:00:11.034 --> 01:00:13.274
No, I mean, what did she say?

01:00:14.004 --> 01:00:17.344
Well, the thing is...

01:00:17.774 --> 01:00:20.144
It's all right. Just tell me, Officer Jung.

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:23.084
Apparently, this is what she said.

01:00:23.814 --> 01:00:27.184
"Pick me up at the convenience store at Gongsan Junction, darling."

01:00:28.824 --> 01:00:29.824
What...

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.024
- "Darling?" - See?

01:00:33.494 --> 01:00:36.234
I told you she said "darling."

01:00:38.094 --> 01:00:39.264
Well...

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:45.544
- Are you sure? - Yes. The store owner...

01:00:46.174 --> 01:00:49.214
showed me CCTV footage of her getting into a car.

01:00:49.714 --> 01:00:52.614
It's a bit grainy, so you can't see the face, but...

01:00:52.944 --> 01:00:56.454
it looks like she left with a man.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:57.954
I see.

01:00:59.454 --> 01:01:02.594
I understand. Okay, all right.

01:01:16.834 --> 01:01:18.604
You should have known better.

01:01:19.774 --> 01:01:24.614
You're from a family of doctors, and you're a physical therapist.

01:01:25.444 --> 01:01:28.584
Why marry a girl with no background, who's not even in your league,

01:01:28.654 --> 01:01:31.484
all because she's pretty?

01:01:44.364 --> 01:01:45.964
At least I'm better off.

01:01:47.864 --> 01:01:51.274
Ji Hu's dad... At least he never cheated.

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.084
Dae Han?

01:02:00.614 --> 01:02:01.614
- Hey, Seong Mi. - My gosh.

01:02:02.214 --> 01:02:04.054
- What... - I...

01:02:04.584 --> 01:02:07.554
- My goodness. - The person I respect the most.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:12.524
Goodness, you've had a lot to drink. Didn't Hui Gyeong visit her family?

01:02:12.764 --> 01:02:13.764
Yes.

01:02:15.334 --> 01:02:16.334
Seong Mi.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.394
I'm so sorry.

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:20.934
I'm really sorry.

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.634
What are you sorry for?

01:02:24.004 --> 01:02:25.644
I'm pretty sure Hui Gyeong...

01:02:27.674 --> 01:02:29.544
might have run off with the money.

01:02:30.644 --> 01:02:33.384
- What? - I think she was seeing someone.

01:02:34.144 --> 01:02:38.184
- Wait, what are you talking about? - Hui Gyeong was having an affair.

01:02:39.124 --> 01:02:41.254
She had an affair and ran off behind my back.

01:02:42.294 --> 01:02:43.624
She was cheating on me.

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:46.964
She just up and left. Just like my father...

01:02:47.294 --> 01:02:48.324
She just...

01:02:48.324 --> 01:02:49.334
Dae Han.

01:02:52.264 --> 01:02:54.134
Seong Mi, wait. Seong Mi...

01:02:54.964 --> 01:02:56.074
I have a favor to ask.

01:02:57.534 --> 01:03:00.944
Promise not to tell Mom and Jeong Han. Okay?

01:03:01.404 --> 01:03:03.874
If Mom and Jeong Han find out, they'll be heartbroken...

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:10.754
Mom might collapse again, so please just keep it a secret.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.184
Collapse over what?

01:03:47.784 --> 01:03:50.394
(Recipe for Love)

01:03:50.454 --> 01:03:53.794
When I was little, a friend was going to study abroad,

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:55.494
so I made this as a farewell gift.

01:03:55.564 --> 01:03:58.234
By any chance, was that person your first love, Ju Ah?

01:03:59.564 --> 01:04:02.934
Dr. Gong was treating Dr. Yang like a bratty little kid,

01:04:03.004 --> 01:04:04.074
and just bullying him relentlessly.

01:04:04.134 --> 01:04:07.004
That's rich, from the one begging for a job.

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:08.844
You have proof?

01:04:08.914 --> 01:04:12.584
Someone recently taught me the importance of having proof.

01:04:12.784 --> 01:04:15.884
You absolutely have to get Dr. Gong's phone.

01:04:16.154 --> 01:04:18.784
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:21.884
You have to get a divorce. You can't go on like this.

01:04:22.594 --> 01:04:24.024
I don't recognize this number.

01:04:26.224 --> 01:04:27.464
Hello? Who is this?
