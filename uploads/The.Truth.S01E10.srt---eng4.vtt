00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:02.327
Dan Qing,

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.926
you're going too far now.

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.126
Don't forget.

00:02:07.486 --> 00:02:11.246
I gave you everything you have now.
Remember?

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:15.086
Now you regret it?

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:16.806
Yes,

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:18.887
you did give me a new life.

00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:21.206
But don't forget.

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.926
When your ex-father-in-law tried
to put you down,

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.646
who helped you make a comeback?

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:31.887
Gui.

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:33.686
I've sent them that video

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.167
as you instructed.

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:36.607
They've seen it?

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:39.607
What was their reaction?

00:02:41.847 --> 00:02:42.447
Okay.

00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:44.887
Keep watching them then.

00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:47.766
Keep me updated.

00:02:50.447 --> 00:02:51.206
Got it.

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:54.887
I secured the connections
in Wannan this time.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.206
Even if you're jealous for no reason,

00:02:57.887 --> 00:02:59.567
at least wait until the deal's done.

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:34.407
Drop the knife!

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:35.206
Put it down!

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:38.686
Drop the knife!

00:03:46.552 --> 00:03:52.312
(Yunxi Police Department)

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.344
(Come to my office.)

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:19.767
Master.

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:21.167
Here.

00:04:22.047 --> 00:04:26.486
Jiao personally made these stuffed buns.

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:30.047
Try one.

00:04:35.287 --> 00:04:36.047
Come on.

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:40.287
You eat too.

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:45.087
Something's been bothering you lately?

00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:50.207
It's nothing.

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.686
Tell me if something happened.

00:04:57.287 --> 00:04:59.207
You look so troubled.

00:05:03.446 --> 00:05:04.207
Is there something?

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.207
Really nothing, Master.

00:05:12.847 --> 00:05:13.967
When you were little,

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:18.246
you'd cry if a toy broke,

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.566
but not after growing up,

00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:24.126
because you knew it was just a toy.

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:26.087
Similarly,

00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:29.006
all worldly values,

00:05:30.527 --> 00:05:32.886
like reputation,

00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:35.167
praise, criticism,

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.126
being ignored, being noticed,

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:38.407
happiness,

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:40.446
gains, and losses,

00:05:41.287 --> 00:05:42.647
are all just like toys.

00:05:43.607 --> 00:05:45.047
Just like toys.

00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:48.566
Once our wisdom matures,

00:05:49.246 --> 00:05:50.847
they all become toys.

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:55.886
Eat this.

00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:04.047
That's right.

00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:07.926
I've wanted
to kill Wang Xiaole for a long time.

00:06:08.686 --> 00:06:11.647
I started planning
the moment she wanted a divorce.

00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:17.527
Your professors and classmates all said
you were the perfect boyfriend.

00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:19.167
How did it end up like this?

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:20.167
Why did you do this?

00:06:20.527 --> 00:06:23.407
Wang Xiaole's parents
never approved of me from the start.

00:06:23.647 --> 00:06:26.847
I struggled so hard
just to get their reluctant approval.

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:32.527
Our relationship was great
when we first married.

00:06:34.486 --> 00:06:35.886
We'd just started our careers then,

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:37.926
full of hope for the future.

00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:43.446
But as my career kept declining,

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:46.926
she...

00:06:52.407 --> 00:06:55.087
Guess who I ran into
at the hospital today?

00:06:56.287 --> 00:06:56.967
Who?

00:06:57.686 --> 00:06:58.486
Liu Jian.

00:06:59.126 --> 00:07:00.727
He came to our wedding.

00:07:02.607 --> 00:07:05.486
He's a doctor
at a top-tier hospital now.

00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:08.607
Thanks to him,

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:10.207
I skipped the waitlist.

00:07:10.207 --> 00:07:11.486
He even got me a specialist.

00:07:13.446 --> 00:07:14.167
That's good.

00:07:15.126 --> 00:07:16.767
Then just go to him for your checkup.

00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:22.527
You also studied medicine.

00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:24.407
Why is there such a huge difference?

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:27.087
Stop picking fights.

00:07:28.006 --> 00:07:29.287
If you were successful,

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:30.486
would I argue with you?

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:32.486
How am I not successful?

00:07:32.727 --> 00:07:34.767
Do I let you go short
of food and clothes?

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:39.287
Is that what I care about?

00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:40.926
Back when we got married,

00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:42.326
I wanted a venue at a five-star...

00:07:42.326 --> 00:07:43.847
Yes, a five-star hotel.

00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:45.126
But I chose a three-star hotel.

00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:46.566
Got anything new?

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:49.126
Fine, I'll give you something new.

00:07:49.727 --> 00:07:51.246
What did you promise before marriage?

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:53.407
After tough times, I'd live comfortably.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:54.326
And now?

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:57.047
All you do is make empty promises.

00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:00.207
I bought this house.

00:08:00.326 --> 00:08:01.727
I gave you my salary every month.

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:03.167
What more do you want from me?

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:05.047
This is just a secondhand house.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:06.566
And your salary

00:08:06.566 --> 00:08:07.767
is just a few thousand yuan.

00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:08.727
What are you proud of?

00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:10.446
You can't even afford a car.

00:08:10.847 --> 00:08:12.767
Every day,
I take either the subway or the bus.

00:08:12.767 --> 00:08:14.486
How long has it been
since I bought clothes?

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:16.126
And you have the nerve to say that now?

00:08:16.207 --> 00:08:18.006
Aren't you just saying that I'm a loser?

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:18.607
Yes.

00:08:18.727 --> 00:08:20.087
I'm not arguing with you.

00:08:20.326 --> 00:08:22.366
Yes, you're a loser.

00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:23.686
You're a loser.

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:24.407
Not only that,

00:08:24.407 --> 00:08:25.847
you have no decent job or status.

00:08:26.087 --> 00:08:27.207
You have nothing!

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.366
I was foolish enough

00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:29.326
to marry you.

00:08:29.727 --> 00:08:30.806
Are you done yet?

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:32.367
Are you done yet?

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:35.767
She picked on me.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.806
I didn't become a doctor
at a top-tier hospital.

00:08:40.407 --> 00:08:41.487
I have no money or status.

00:08:41.726 --> 00:08:42.527
What about her?

00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:44.527
She just worked at a nursing school.

00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:45.326
Why?

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:46.767
Why did she despise me?

00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:49.926
Officer.

00:08:50.206 --> 00:08:51.367
I'm not bragging.

00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:52.806
With my grades back then,

00:08:52.806 --> 00:08:55.887
I could have picked any top major
at any top university.

00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:58.606
If I had chosen a different major,

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.446
I definitely wouldn't be
like this today.

00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:03.887
I studied medicine for Wang Xiaole.

00:09:04.527 --> 00:09:06.127
She wasn't grateful, fine.

00:09:06.926 --> 00:09:08.686
But she looked down on me more and more.

00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:11.326
Did you ever abuse Wang Xiaole?

00:09:14.367 --> 00:09:16.007
Niu Bosheng told you, didn't he?

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.566
Weren't you afraid
she would call the police?

00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:21.647
Or tell her family and friends?

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:24.326
Her pride wouldn't let that happen.

00:09:25.326 --> 00:09:26.407
She was very vain.

00:09:27.326 --> 00:09:30.926
She wouldn't tell others
about such things,

00:09:30.926 --> 00:09:32.086
especially her parents

00:09:32.086 --> 00:09:32.926
and friends.

00:09:34.527 --> 00:09:35.167
Of course,

00:09:36.846 --> 00:09:37.846
I knew what I was doing.

00:09:38.926 --> 00:09:40.527
I generally wouldn't hit her face

00:09:40.606 --> 00:09:42.726
or other visible parts.

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:45.167
I'd also coax her.

00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:49.887
She probably hadn't decided
to divorce me yet back then.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:52.566
Wasn't hard to placate her.

00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:10.846
Are you sure Ye can take the lead?

00:10:19.407 --> 00:10:20.326
Have some water.

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:23.047
Thanks.

00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:39.407
Tell us about the process.

00:10:44.007 --> 00:10:46.926
I actually planned it for quite a while.

00:10:49.007 --> 00:10:50.926
I knew about Niu Bosheng long ago.

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.647
He was the perfect fall guy.

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:55.926
So I started investigating him.

00:10:56.966 --> 00:10:58.527
He really is a freak.

00:10:59.446 --> 00:11:01.367
His life is way too routine.

00:11:02.566 --> 00:11:04.806
Plus, since he has a disgusting habit,

00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:06.726
he lives like a hermit.

00:11:07.206 --> 00:11:08.726
It didn't take much effort.

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:13.487
About six months ago,

00:11:13.686 --> 00:11:17.047
I stole his clothes
from the community clinic.

00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:19.086
Then I just waited

00:11:20.007 --> 00:11:23.686
for the right time to act.

00:11:25.127 --> 00:11:28.566
Did you contact Wang Xiaole first
on the day of the crime?

00:11:30.926 --> 00:11:35.206
To create the appearance
that we still had ties,

00:11:36.606 --> 00:11:39.047
I contacted her from time to time.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.247
Sometimes, I'd even show up uninvited.

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:43.686
I knew

00:11:43.926 --> 00:11:47.806
she and the guy,
Huang Chong, were already planning

00:11:48.566 --> 00:11:49.647
to get married.

00:11:50.247 --> 00:11:52.247
She wanted me
to go as far away as possible.

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:56.966
(But I didn't want her to have her way,
so I kept contacting her.)

00:11:57.806 --> 00:11:58.767
Don't be like this.

00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:00.566
We've been divorced for so long.

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:06.206
Xiaole.

00:12:07.287 --> 00:12:08.487
Old affections die hard.

00:12:08.726 --> 00:12:10.326
Can't you give me one more chance?

00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:12.247
I'm already done with you.

00:12:14.247 --> 00:12:15.527
Enough. You should go now.

00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:16.767
I have work tomorrow.

00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:17.966
Don't come back again.

00:12:18.487 --> 00:12:20.047
Remember to leave the key when you go.

00:12:21.926 --> 00:12:23.287
No, Xiaole.

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:26.647
Just tonight, just once.

00:12:27.326 --> 00:12:28.767
Please, Xiaole.

00:12:36.206 --> 00:12:37.167
You go shower first.

00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:39.926
Okay.

00:12:47.127 --> 00:12:48.527
After it was done, I left.

00:12:49.086 --> 00:12:52.487
You have pretty much figured out
what happened after that.

00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:56.446
To kill someone
and frame another in such a short time,

00:12:56.966 --> 00:12:58.606
you must be in pretty good shape.

00:12:58.686 --> 00:13:00.647
I trained in secret for a long time

00:13:00.966 --> 00:13:02.167
just for this day.

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:04.647
I never used to drink.

00:13:05.686 --> 00:13:06.767
I was just acting

00:13:07.247 --> 00:13:08.887
at the north gate of the complex.

00:13:08.887 --> 00:13:10.446
I even think it looked fake.

00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:12.127
But they saw it and believed it.

00:13:12.127 --> 00:13:13.167
And they remembered me.

00:13:14.407 --> 00:13:17.047
But after my crime,
I couldn't keep acting,

00:13:17.606 --> 00:13:19.086
especially when facing the police.

00:13:20.206 --> 00:13:24.326
I didn't expect
you'd notice such a small wound.

00:13:26.407 --> 00:13:28.407
That's not the only thing
you overlooked.

00:13:28.726 --> 00:13:31.566
We also found the video
of you stealing Niu Bosheng's clothes.

00:13:35.007 --> 00:13:36.846
Why did you pose the body like that?

00:13:37.606 --> 00:13:38.887
To humiliate her, of course.

00:13:40.407 --> 00:13:41.527
Didn't she look down on me?

00:13:42.446 --> 00:13:46.167
I had to make her see my work,
my masterpiece.

00:13:49.527 --> 00:13:50.887
If I'd had more time,

00:13:51.007 --> 00:13:52.606
I would've cut her head off.

00:13:53.446 --> 00:13:56.726
I'd pry it open
to see why she was so blind.

00:13:57.047 --> 00:13:58.767
Why couldn't she see how good I was?

00:13:58.926 --> 00:14:01.127
You cut Wang Xiaole 17 times.

00:14:01.726 --> 00:14:04.407
Is that also
to pin your crime on Niu Bosheng?

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:09.592
Wang Xiaole and Niu Bosheng
have known each other for 17 years.

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:14.407
That number held meaning
for both of them.

00:14:16.527 --> 00:14:17.247
Officer,

00:14:17.966 --> 00:14:19.726
I practiced those 17 cuts a lot.

00:14:23.127 --> 00:14:26.887
And the writing on the wall?
I copied Niu Bosheng's handwriting

00:14:27.926 --> 00:14:28.966
and practiced for so long.

00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:31.086
Do you hate Niu Bosheng that much?

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:33.527
Not really.

00:14:34.566 --> 00:14:35.367
Jealous of him?

00:14:37.367 --> 00:14:38.167
Jealous?

00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:41.966
Jealous of scum like Niu Bosheng?
A sewer rat?

00:14:41.966 --> 00:14:42.887
I'm jealous of him?

00:14:43.047 --> 00:14:44.446
What's there to be jealous of?

00:14:45.407 --> 00:14:47.606
How did you feel
when you learned the 200,000 came

00:14:47.606 --> 00:14:48.566
from Niu Bosheng?

00:14:48.606 --> 00:14:49.806
I felt ridiculous.

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:51.167
I was blind.

00:14:51.247 --> 00:14:54.086
How could I have fallen for a tramp
like Wang Xiaole?

00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:57.167
She even hooked up
with trash like Niu Bosheng.

00:14:57.527 --> 00:14:59.086
Don't slander the victim.

00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:01.086
Slander?

00:15:01.686 --> 00:15:03.647
If she weren't involved
with Niu Bosheng,

00:15:03.887 --> 00:15:05.240
would he have lent her the money?

00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:08.487
Officer, would you lend money to her?

00:15:08.926 --> 00:15:11.846
You... fine.

00:15:18.887 --> 00:15:19.686
Officer,

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:23.206
I have a question for you too.

00:15:24.287 --> 00:15:26.367
How did you even suspect me?

00:15:30.647 --> 00:15:32.407
You deliberately used the free condoms

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:34.686
to lead us

00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:39.167
to find the tree and Niu Bosheng.

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:41.407
But you didn't know

00:15:42.446 --> 00:15:45.127
Niu Bosheng only ever
used one imported brand.

00:15:46.247 --> 00:15:49.167
And he kept the packaging as souvenirs.

00:15:49.767 --> 00:15:53.127
He has never stopped
since he started spying on Wang Xiaole.

00:15:55.926 --> 00:15:58.606
Even without you
planting those wrappers,

00:16:01.247 --> 00:16:03.726
we would have traced it back
to Niu Bosheng anyway.

00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:06.966
Justice has long arms.

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:09.487
You outsmarted yourself.

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:24.367
Okay.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.206
Stop checking. It's not time yet.

00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:36.806
Qian, we're leaving.

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:37.806
- I'm done.
- Bye.

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:38.407
Bye.

00:16:38.527 --> 00:16:39.287
Just eating now?

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:40.007
Bye.

00:16:40.007 --> 00:16:40.647
Bye.

00:16:46.326 --> 00:16:47.127
Hold on a sec.

00:16:48.726 --> 00:16:50.686
Why's Lei the only one working today?

00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:56.367
Jing took her little darling
to the pet club.

00:16:57.566 --> 00:17:00.086
Jing has been looking much better
these years.

00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:01.007
Definitely.

00:17:01.326 --> 00:17:03.287
To cheer Jing up,

00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:05.086
Lei stays happy all the time.

00:17:05.086 --> 00:17:06.287
It's almost a habit now.

00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:10.247
Here.

00:17:10.927 --> 00:17:12.207
Today's special.

00:17:12.207 --> 00:17:14.007
Sweet and sour pork with fruit. Try it.

00:17:14.447 --> 00:17:15.927
What color is this?

00:17:18.166 --> 00:17:18.967
Lei,

00:17:19.687 --> 00:17:22.326
shouldn't it be pineapple?

00:17:22.846 --> 00:17:24.287
Why is it dragon fruit?

00:17:24.287 --> 00:17:25.406
And the red kind?

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:29.406
Must've bought too much dragon fruit
on sale.

00:17:29.406 --> 00:17:30.406
He had to use it.

00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:32.126
Don't say it out loud.

00:17:32.126 --> 00:17:34.086
You naughty boy! Just try it.

00:17:34.606 --> 00:17:35.047
Lei.

00:17:35.047 --> 00:17:35.767
Try it.

00:17:39.846 --> 00:17:40.767
How is it?

00:17:44.886 --> 00:17:45.606
It's okay.

00:17:46.406 --> 00:17:49.606
So, between Wu Da and Niu Bosheng,

00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:54.646
which one was crazier?

00:17:55.447 --> 00:17:56.806
Wang Xiaole was pathetic,

00:17:56.806 --> 00:17:58.326
getting tangled with those two freaks.

00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:01.207
Tastes good.

00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:08.247
Hello? Chief Xu.

00:18:27.086 --> 00:18:27.886
Chief Xu.

00:18:30.207 --> 00:18:33.304
They're Deputy Commander Lin
and Deputy Director Zhao

00:18:33.304 --> 00:18:35.886
from the Provincial Narcotics Division.

00:18:36.487 --> 00:18:37.287
Come in.

00:19:03.326 --> 00:19:06.286
(They're Deputy Commander Lin
and Deputy Director Zhao)

00:19:06.286 --> 00:19:08.527
(from the Provincial
Narcotics Division.)

00:19:08.967 --> 00:19:11.606
This woman is Huo's mistress.

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:13.007
What do you do?

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.527
I'm running a small business now.

00:19:18.927 --> 00:19:20.566
(The old Chen Yumo is gone.)

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:23.886
(Let's start over.)

00:19:26.487 --> 00:19:27.727
(My name is Dan Qing now.)

00:19:39.126 --> 00:19:40.447
(Our operation this time aims)

00:19:40.967 --> 00:19:45.806
to take down both Huo's
and Bao Hei's drug gangs.

00:20:04.406 --> 00:20:06.166
These two gangs trust each other.

00:20:06.447 --> 00:20:08.406
Right now, it's just a matter of time.

00:20:08.566 --> 00:20:10.527
This is your mission.

00:20:11.007 --> 00:20:12.366
Stay safe.

00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:14.727
(You can handle this as a special case.)

00:20:30.126 --> 00:20:30.927
Master.

00:20:33.247 --> 00:20:34.366
I can't sleep.

00:20:39.606 --> 00:20:41.126
So I want you to come keep me company

00:20:41.886 --> 00:20:42.767
and get some air.

00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:48.487
A drink?

00:20:54.126 --> 00:20:55.447
You can't sleep either?

00:20:56.326 --> 00:20:57.126
No,

00:20:57.767 --> 00:20:58.767
I can't either.

00:21:03.007 --> 00:21:06.447
Have you figured it out?

00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:09.207
Do you know what to do?

00:21:10.846 --> 00:21:13.606
I'll follow orders in all actions.

00:21:32.126 --> 00:21:33.166
You'll back me up.

00:21:33.566 --> 00:21:34.527
It'll be fine for sure.

00:22:05.287 --> 00:22:06.406
Don't be angry.

00:22:22.727 --> 00:22:24.007
Let me introduce.

00:22:24.406 --> 00:22:25.447
This is our boss.

00:22:26.207 --> 00:22:27.007
Wang Yong,

00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:28.967
known in the underworld as Guitoule,

00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:30.007
is also called Gui.

00:22:30.886 --> 00:22:32.447
You were a bouncer in your early years.

00:22:33.487 --> 00:22:35.927
Back when Mr. Bao
and He Liu were fighting over territory,

00:22:36.487 --> 00:22:38.007
you took a bullet for Mr. Bao.

00:22:38.806 --> 00:22:42.566
The bullet hole is
on your second-to-last left rib.

00:22:44.527 --> 00:22:48.166
That bullet earned you Mr. Bao's trust.

00:22:48.447 --> 00:22:49.927
You became his right-hand man.

00:22:52.166 --> 00:22:55.207
You even went this far
and dug up my past.

00:22:56.687 --> 00:22:58.687
Seems Huo doesn't fully trust us.

00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:03.967
Likewise.

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:10.207
Every couple has their fights.

00:23:11.566 --> 00:23:15.606
I heard Huo and Qing
had a fight just days ago.

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:17.646
You even used a kitchen knife.

00:23:18.447 --> 00:23:20.247
How did you two make up so fast?

00:23:24.806 --> 00:23:29.606
I didn't know you were
so interested in our private life.

00:23:30.007 --> 00:23:30.646
No.

00:23:30.927 --> 00:23:32.007
Don't get me wrong, Qing.

00:23:32.927 --> 00:23:36.406
Anyone can see
you're an extraordinary woman.

00:23:36.687 --> 00:23:37.646
I should learn from you.

00:23:40.606 --> 00:23:43.727
Why did Mr. Bao send you to meet us?

00:23:44.047 --> 00:23:46.126
That's because
you have a formidable reputation.

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:50.927
Let's speak plainly.

00:23:52.047 --> 00:23:54.007
Your product quality is good.

00:23:55.007 --> 00:23:59.207
But my boss needs a long-term,
reliable supplier.

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:01.247
To work with us,

00:24:01.646 --> 00:24:04.806
you must prove you have the best supply.

00:24:05.727 --> 00:24:06.767
Additionally,

00:24:07.606 --> 00:24:14.326
you must transport it safely
to Wannan and deliver it to Yunxi.

00:24:19.566 --> 00:24:23.326
Inspections from the border
to Wannan are already tight.

00:24:25.126 --> 00:24:26.326
Then to Yunxi?

00:24:27.487 --> 00:24:28.806
That's challenging.

00:24:29.047 --> 00:24:30.646
That's your problem to solve.

00:24:31.287 --> 00:24:32.166
My boss said

00:24:32.806 --> 00:24:35.527
that if you can do it
and we cooperate well,

00:24:36.247 --> 00:24:40.326
it's possible
to make you our primary supplier.

00:24:43.406 --> 00:24:44.767
Can we trust your word?

00:24:46.687 --> 00:24:47.566
Absolutely.

00:24:50.007 --> 00:24:50.727
Okay.

00:24:51.487 --> 00:24:52.967
Tell Mr. Bao

00:24:53.166 --> 00:24:54.126
I can handle it.

00:24:54.406 --> 00:24:56.406
I just need some time.

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:00.007
What do you mean?

00:25:01.687 --> 00:25:02.806
You'll see.

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:23.727
Come.

00:26:24.326 --> 00:26:25.326
Let me help.

00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:26.527
Careful.

00:26:26.527 --> 00:26:27.166
Thanks.

00:26:33.646 --> 00:26:34.767
The victim is male.

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:37.326
Based on his forearm length
and fat thickness,

00:26:37.326 --> 00:26:39.166
I estimated his height is

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:40.687
between 170 and 175 centimeters.

00:26:40.806 --> 00:26:42.767
His weight is about 80 kilograms.

00:26:43.687 --> 00:26:45.207
I found the third-instar larvae here.

00:26:45.326 --> 00:26:47.007
The victim died about four days ago.

00:26:47.007 --> 00:26:48.687
Due to tissue irregularity,

00:26:48.687 --> 00:26:50.967
the sacks at the scene are full,

00:26:51.406 --> 00:26:52.967
weighing about eight kilograms.

00:26:53.767 --> 00:26:55.566
We've only recovered two sacks so far.

00:26:55.687 --> 00:26:57.447
The rest were likely dumped elsewhere.

00:27:01.485 --> 00:27:03.166
I'm Si Yuanlong,
a trace evidence examiner,

00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:05.566
currently at the primary crime scene.

00:27:06.566 --> 00:27:09.166
Visual detection
of minor bloodstains on the railing.

00:27:09.886 --> 00:27:12.767
I suspect the perpetrator left them
while dumping the remains.

00:27:13.447 --> 00:27:17.126
The specific disposal process
requires further trace analysis.

00:28:00.687 --> 00:28:01.566
I deduce

00:28:01.727 --> 00:28:03.846
that the suspect likely walked
to this spot,

00:28:03.846 --> 00:28:06.447
placed the sacks of body parts
on the railing,

00:28:06.447 --> 00:28:08.846
and then pushed them off
with both hands.

00:28:09.166 --> 00:28:12.126
The disposal distance
suggests a single perpetrator.

00:28:12.126 --> 00:28:13.566
If I'm not mistaken,

00:28:13.646 --> 00:28:17.447
every dump site's railing
has identical marks.

00:28:19.687 --> 00:28:20.287
Go!

00:28:20.527 --> 00:28:22.166
More body parts are found ahead.

00:28:22.207 --> 00:28:23.007
Come on!

00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:56.406
Two sacks are found
five kilometers apart.

00:28:57.007 --> 00:28:58.406
This is the sixth one already.

00:28:59.767 --> 00:29:03.806
Forearms, upper arms, torso,
and some organs have been recovered.

00:29:04.566 --> 00:29:07.207
At this rate, we'll wrap up before dawn.

00:30:13.007 --> 00:30:13.727
Careful, it's hot!

00:30:13.727 --> 00:30:15.207
There's one more. I'll get it later.

00:30:15.487 --> 00:30:16.086
Here you go.

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:17.166
Yours has no scallions.

00:30:18.646 --> 00:30:20.967
You remembered
I don't eat scallions? Thanks.

00:30:20.967 --> 00:30:21.806
You eat first.

00:30:21.806 --> 00:30:22.527
I'll wait a bit.

00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:24.166
Here you are.

00:30:24.326 --> 00:30:25.806
No need to give this to me.

00:30:25.806 --> 00:30:27.967
I'm the boss. You guys eat. Come on.

00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:29.207
I'm going to eat then.

00:30:29.207 --> 00:30:30.086
Go ahead.

00:30:31.527 --> 00:30:34.846
Don't you think
Little Qian's been extra proactive?

00:30:34.846 --> 00:30:36.207
Probably in a good mood.

00:30:37.806 --> 00:30:40.126
Isn't he like this every day?

00:30:40.727 --> 00:30:42.207
Look, Long,

00:30:42.287 --> 00:30:45.047
your girlfriend runs a restaurant.

00:30:45.047 --> 00:30:47.247
Can you ask her to lend me a cook?

00:30:47.247 --> 00:30:48.007
Just a friend.

00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:49.967
Watch your words.

00:30:50.767 --> 00:30:52.927
Besides, you can't afford her chef.

00:30:52.927 --> 00:30:53.967
Extremely expensive.

00:30:54.287 --> 00:30:55.166
How expensive?

00:30:55.447 --> 00:30:56.406
You can't afford it.

00:30:59.326 --> 00:31:00.326
Back to business.

00:31:01.007 --> 00:31:03.326
Judging by the number of body parts,

00:31:03.326 --> 00:31:09.527
the suspect must have
put all the body parts in a vehicle,

00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:11.886
dumping them
systematically along the highway.

00:31:12.366 --> 00:31:15.767
We can rule out low-capacity vehicles
like motorcycles or e-bikes.

00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:16.886
Plus,

00:31:16.886 --> 00:31:19.606
farm trikes aren't allowed on highways,
so they're out too.

00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:20.606
I think

00:31:20.606 --> 00:31:24.487
the suspect was likely driving a car.

00:31:24.886 --> 00:31:27.927
Considering the dump distance
and the scrape marks on the railing,

00:31:28.126 --> 00:31:33.126
I think the suspect probably
didn't toss the parts out while moving,

00:31:33.126 --> 00:31:34.487
but stopped to dump them.

00:31:34.487 --> 00:31:37.687
And each site is less than two meters
from the road.

00:31:38.126 --> 00:31:40.166
I infer the suspect likely acted alone,

00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.366
with no accomplice.

00:31:41.886 --> 00:31:45.166
Also, they're probably
from a farming family.

00:31:45.166 --> 00:31:46.806
We found 11 sacks in total.

00:31:46.806 --> 00:31:48.606
Who still uses sacks these days

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:50.687
and has so many on hand?

00:31:50.687 --> 00:31:52.406
Most likely, a rural farmer.

00:31:53.846 --> 00:31:56.566
Yet we can't rule out manufacturers
or wholesalers.

00:31:57.806 --> 00:31:58.487
Jiao.

00:31:59.207 --> 00:32:02.406
Did you get the footage
from the toll booth?

00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:04.927
I've contacted the traffic police.

00:32:04.927 --> 00:32:06.166
Will get the news before noon.

00:32:08.247 --> 00:32:12.447
Those sacks hold maybe ten kilos max.

00:32:13.406 --> 00:32:14.406
For grain,

00:32:14.406 --> 00:32:15.247
a bit small.

00:32:16.207 --> 00:32:16.846
Ziwu.

00:32:17.247 --> 00:32:21.126
After your meal,
go back and check again.

00:32:21.527 --> 00:32:24.527
Those sacks are all used.

00:32:25.447 --> 00:32:27.886
Turn them inside out.
Search meticulously

00:32:28.967 --> 00:32:31.047
and see what was in them before.

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:34.126
I'll get it done today.

00:33:25.166 --> 00:33:28.047
I found four things
in the bottom of the sacks.

00:33:29.126 --> 00:33:30.487
Crushed peanut shells,

00:33:30.767 --> 00:33:32.047
cotton leaves,

00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:34.566
soil,

00:33:35.207 --> 00:33:36.406
and sesame seeds.

00:33:39.086 --> 00:33:41.527
No signs of repeated use on the sacks.

00:33:42.007 --> 00:33:45.967
Assuming the suspect
has these three crops,

00:33:46.366 --> 00:33:47.886
if they're a farmer,

00:33:48.086 --> 00:33:52.047
there are few places in our province
where farmers grow all three.

00:33:52.247 --> 00:33:55.366
Near Yunxi City,
only the Dongshan District has some.

00:33:56.487 --> 00:33:58.606
The dumping
stretched over 50 kilometers,

00:33:58.806 --> 00:34:00.366
mostly within Dongshan District.

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:04.487
Mining caused collapses
on both sides years ago.

00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:06.326
Many areas are uninhabited now.

00:34:06.886 --> 00:34:09.887
The suspect must know the area
extremely well.

00:34:10.086 --> 00:34:12.327
Highly likely a Dongshan local.

00:34:12.726 --> 00:34:13.527
Dongshan?

00:34:14.566 --> 00:34:18.807
Dongshan's farmland is north
and south of the urban area.

00:34:18.807 --> 00:34:20.447
There's a big river up north too.

00:34:20.967 --> 00:34:22.407
Isn't the north a better place

00:34:22.407 --> 00:34:24.086
to dump bodies?

00:34:24.246 --> 00:34:26.527
Why detour to the old mining zone south?

00:34:27.447 --> 00:34:32.126
And Dongshan has two highway entrances,

00:34:32.407 --> 00:34:33.847
one at the northwest corner of town,

00:34:33.847 --> 00:34:36.047
about 100 kilometers from us.

00:34:36.487 --> 00:34:39.606
The other is west of Yunxi City,

00:34:39.606 --> 00:34:41.766
roughly 30 kilometers away.

00:34:41.766 --> 00:34:44.847
What's it called... My bad memory.

00:34:45.887 --> 00:34:46.686
Oh, Shipu.

00:34:47.646 --> 00:34:50.807
Shipu was famous
for traditional oil extraction.

00:34:50.887 --> 00:34:54.047
They grow peanuts and sesame.

00:34:54.047 --> 00:34:55.766
That matches what Ziwu found.

00:34:57.807 --> 00:35:01.807
The victim is about 50 years old, male.

00:35:02.007 --> 00:35:03.327
He is a bit overweight.

00:35:04.086 --> 00:35:06.447
The estimated time of death is
about four days ago.

00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:09.646
Apart from the dismemberment cuts,

00:35:09.766 --> 00:35:10.726
he has no other wounds.

00:35:12.206 --> 00:35:13.887
The cause of death is still unclear.

00:35:13.887 --> 00:35:15.686
His head has not been found yet.

00:35:16.086 --> 00:35:18.887
There is a birthmark on his left arm.

00:35:19.206 --> 00:35:20.887
This requires key investigation.

00:35:21.646 --> 00:35:24.686
Dismembering the body is
either for ease of handling the corpse

00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:26.407
or to conceal the identity.

00:35:26.407 --> 00:35:28.166
Or for both reasons.

00:35:28.487 --> 00:35:31.367
The exact reason
for the dismemberment is still unclear.

00:35:31.766 --> 00:35:34.327
However,
the head of the body has not been found.

00:35:34.407 --> 00:35:37.327
It is highly likely
that it was hidden by the suspect.

00:35:37.766 --> 00:35:39.927
Identifying the victim's face
might lead us to them.

00:35:39.927 --> 00:35:41.527
The victim might know the murderer.

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.807
Also, I notice
the cuts on the body parts are smooth.

00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:49.086
With a handsaw, the murderer could pause
due to physical fatigue.

00:35:49.286 --> 00:35:53.327
Therefore, the suspect probably
used a more professional electric tool.

00:35:54.286 --> 00:35:55.086
Electric saw?

00:35:56.286 --> 00:35:59.726
It is just a general term.
There are many types of electric saws.

00:36:05.527 --> 00:36:06.606
News from Traffic Police.

00:36:06.887 --> 00:36:09.126
He will soon send the footage
of the highway

00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:11.007
from this week.

00:36:11.487 --> 00:36:11.967
Okay.

00:36:13.447 --> 00:36:14.606
Shipu Village.

00:36:15.286 --> 00:36:16.246
Runs an oil mill.

00:36:16.726 --> 00:36:17.527
Has a car.

00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:19.166
Knew the victim.

00:36:20.047 --> 00:36:22.967
The surrounding substations haven't
received any missing persons reports.

00:36:23.646 --> 00:36:27.286
So the victim is likely a middle-aged
or elderly man living alone.

00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:28.606
Master.

00:36:29.047 --> 00:36:31.086
I'm going
to disseminate the current information,

00:36:31.086 --> 00:36:32.126
issue a bulletin,

00:36:32.367 --> 00:36:34.286
and see if DNA can yield any findings.

00:36:34.286 --> 00:36:35.407
Identify the body first.

00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:38.847
Where are you going?

00:36:40.246 --> 00:36:41.166
Leaving now?

00:36:41.527 --> 00:36:44.166
Now he's starting
to assign tasks to himself on his own.

00:36:44.766 --> 00:36:45.566
He is getting cocky,

00:36:45.566 --> 00:36:46.246
full of himself,

00:36:46.246 --> 00:36:47.686
right after catching Wu Da.

00:36:47.686 --> 00:36:49.007
Ye is proactive.

00:36:49.007 --> 00:36:49.887
That's a good thing.

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:56.327
No.

00:36:57.726 --> 00:36:59.007
It's too dangerous.

00:37:00.086 --> 00:37:01.086
We should think twice.

00:37:02.367 --> 00:37:04.646
After all, he is a police officer.

00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:05.944
If not handled well,

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.367
we'll all be doomed.

00:37:10.367 --> 00:37:12.166
Bao Hei still doubts us.

00:37:13.726 --> 00:37:15.206
If we don't give him a shot,

00:37:15.726 --> 00:37:17.847
he won't choose to work with us.

00:37:35.367 --> 00:37:37.327
Sir, your takeout has arrived.

00:37:40.766 --> 00:37:42.007
Your milk tea has arrived.

00:37:43.927 --> 00:37:44.726
I'll go get it.

00:38:08.246 --> 00:38:10.447
The saber saw doesn't match.

00:38:28.967 --> 00:38:32.807
How is the individualization defined
in forensic science?

00:38:32.967 --> 00:38:34.887
Two events occur by chance.

00:38:34.887 --> 00:38:37.566
They cannot possibly happen
in exactly the same way.

00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:40.286
Two things cannot be constructed
in exactly the same way.

00:38:40.286 --> 00:38:43.286
Two things cannot wear
in exactly the same way.

00:38:43.686 --> 00:38:47.766
Two things cannot be destroyed
in exactly the same way.

00:39:08.407 --> 00:39:08.927
Hai.

00:39:08.967 --> 00:39:10.086
Distribute this to everyone.

00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:10.646
Okay.

00:39:17.286 --> 00:39:18.007
Master.

00:39:18.407 --> 00:39:19.967
According to the local police station,

00:39:19.967 --> 00:39:22.927
there is a man named Chen Daning
in Shipu Village.

00:39:23.007 --> 00:39:25.047
He matches the characteristics
of the victim.

00:39:25.367 --> 00:39:26.646
We're contacting his family

00:39:26.646 --> 00:39:28.327
to see if the DNA can be matched.

00:39:29.807 --> 00:39:33.126
Has the head of the body been found?

00:39:33.447 --> 00:39:34.407
Not yet.

00:39:35.407 --> 00:39:36.367
I'll get back to work.

00:39:38.606 --> 00:39:39.407
Ye Qian.

00:39:42.086 --> 00:39:43.007
Close the door.

00:39:43.007 --> 00:39:44.246
I need to talk to you.

00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:18.407
Wang, there is a call for you.

00:40:25.407 --> 00:40:26.206
Little Qian.

00:40:29.286 --> 00:40:30.327
Qian.

00:40:38.606 --> 00:40:41.847
Why are you ignoring me all the time?

00:40:41.847 --> 00:40:44.086
Little Qian.

00:40:45.007 --> 00:40:47.606
Little Qian.

00:40:52.646 --> 00:40:54.047
No reaction at all.

00:40:57.646 --> 00:40:59.887
What's wrong? What's on your mind?

00:41:01.887 --> 00:41:03.206
What could be on my mind?

00:41:03.686 --> 00:41:05.047
If nothing happens,

00:41:05.047 --> 00:41:06.686
why do you suddenly look different?

00:41:06.686 --> 00:41:07.887
You were quite happy days ago.

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:08.967
You look upset now.

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:10.407
Did your master scold you?

00:41:12.206 --> 00:41:12.807
No.

00:41:15.686 --> 00:41:16.847
Then you must be in love.

00:41:18.086 --> 00:41:18.726
No.

00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:20.047
I see.

00:41:20.047 --> 00:41:21.606
Well...

00:41:22.807 --> 00:41:25.166
Has your first love stolen your heart?

00:41:25.766 --> 00:41:27.246
You seem absent-minded.
