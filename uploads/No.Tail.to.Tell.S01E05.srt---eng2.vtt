WEBVTT

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.317
Thank you.

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:52.783
Are you asleep already?

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:02.959
She must've been really tired.

00:01:40.247 --> 00:01:43.333
Man, what on earth am I thinking?

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:46.545
Hey, wake up.

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:48.088
Hey.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.049
What's this?

00:01:52.175 --> 00:01:53.802
Why am I suddenly…

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.123
- You!
- What's wrong with you?

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:25.917
Didn't you say you lost
that wooden-handled dagger yesterday?

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.171
I didn't lose it. It just wasn't there.

00:02:29.254 --> 00:02:31.173
Then why was it in your hand?

00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:33.175
What? I told you I don't have it.

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:35.844
I saw it. You just used it to--

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:38.013
Just now? What did I do?

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.099
You used it to--

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:44.060
You were dead asleep until a second ago.

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:46.188
Why are you suddenly
rambling about the dagger?

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.398
Did you have a weird dream or something?

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.066
A dream?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.569
I mean, you just woke up
and started talking nonsense.

00:02:52.652 --> 00:02:55.363
It wasn't a dream.
It was more like a prophecy…

00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:57.741
No, no… wait a second.

00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:00.786
I'm not a nine-tailed fox anymore.
I'm just human.

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.039
My spiritual power
and abilities are all gone.

00:03:04.122 --> 00:03:05.707
And I suddenly see the future?

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:07.042
That's impossible.

00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:10.337
So it really was a dream.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:13.507
Seriously, what are you doing?

00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:16.593
I was scared for a second.

00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:19.387
Maybe it's because
I'm running on fumes.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:22.224
What a crappy dream.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.976
What did you dream about anyway?

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.772
None of your business.
I don't even want to think about it.

00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:39.658
Dream or not, I'm still pissed.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:41.785
You've got a lot of nerve.

00:03:47.874 --> 00:03:48.959
Oh my. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:51.670
What's her problem?

00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:58.468
She's something else.
A real piece of work.

00:04:06.852 --> 00:04:07.769
Si-yeol!

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:11.064
Wait for me.

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.736
{\an8}OVERNIGHT WITH THE MOON
GUESTHOUSE

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.531
{\an8}You only have one room left?

00:04:20.073 --> 00:04:22.200
{\an8}Don't be ridiculous.

00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:26.079
{\an8}How could that be?
Who'd even stay in a dump like this?

00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:29.291
{\an8}Only a "dump" like this
would even have a room left.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.793
{\an8}And you came the night
before the long weekend.

00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:33.587
{\an8}Go somewhere else then.

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.381
{\an8}Please give us a moment.

00:04:36.464 --> 00:04:37.674
{\an8}Come with me.

00:04:39.217 --> 00:04:41.386
{\an8}What is it?

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.347
{\an8}We've been looking for hours,
and this is all there is.

00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.808
{\an8}What choice do we have?
Sleep on the street?

00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:50.270
{\an8}Why would I need to?
Instead of this dump,

00:04:50.353 --> 00:04:52.147
{\an8}let's go to a five-star hotel.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.900
{\an8}Jeez, where would we even get the money?

00:04:54.983 --> 00:04:57.652
Let's just stay here for the night.

00:04:58.153 --> 00:04:59.321
- No.
- Why not?

00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:02.991
It's dirty, cramped, and most of all…

00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:06.786
it feels sketchy.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.164
What feels sketchy?

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:11.666
What, me?

00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:14.461
What are you even thinking?

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:18.715
You must be joking.

00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:21.927
You're centuries older than me.
Give me a break.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.596
- No, it's not that.
- Then what?

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:26.389
It's…

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.479
It's just that earlier…

00:05:37.025 --> 00:05:38.610
Fine. Let's take it.

00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:41.154
I just had a bad dream,
but it's probably nothing.

00:05:41.655 --> 00:05:42.656
Let's go.

00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:47.994
Seriously, what is wrong with her?

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:08.515
Why did I suddenly have a dream like that?

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:15.814
With the way Si-yeol picks on me,
no wonder I'm having dreams like that.

00:06:15.897 --> 00:06:17.148
Jeez.

00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:23.613
What… is that?

00:06:24.364 --> 00:06:26.157
What? This?

00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.703
What are you going to do with that?
Get back at me or something?

00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:31.955
What are you talking about?

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:36.084
The owner brought this over
so we could have some fruit.

00:06:40.547 --> 00:06:42.632
Oh, really?

00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:47.053
Oh boy.

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.185
I guess you do have a shred of conscience.

00:06:55.478 --> 00:06:56.479
What?

00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:59.274
I don't know what you dreamed about,

00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:03.403
but it's probably just guilt
over how you treated me.

00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:04.904
That's not it.

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:07.198
Sure it is.

00:07:08.074 --> 00:07:11.244
See? Guilt always catches up with you.

00:07:12.954 --> 00:07:16.291
If it's bothering you,
I guess you really are human after all.

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:22.756
Here.

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:29.137
Could that be it?

00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:32.849
Being human is such a hassle.

00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:38.188
I've lost my appetite.

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:45.820
Oh my gosh.

00:07:46.863 --> 00:07:49.365
Do you really think you're up
for another hike tomorrow?

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.242
I don't know.

00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:00.418
What is that?

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:02.295
Stay still.

00:08:03.922 --> 00:08:05.715
That's part of being human.

00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.927
You get sore when you use muscles
you don't normally use.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.470
You'll get used to it.

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:12.847
I won't need to.

00:08:13.515 --> 00:08:15.934
I'll do whatever it takes
to get my old life back.

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.314
Here too.

00:08:21.397 --> 00:08:23.191
Don't hold back. Put plenty on.

00:08:28.238 --> 00:08:30.907
- Nice and cool, right?
- Yeah.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.367
The soles too.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.954
Not there, you dummy.

00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:39.165
OVERNIGHT WITH THE MOON
GUESTHOUSE

00:09:38.725 --> 00:09:39.642
Oh my.

00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:43.313
You're still up?

00:09:44.355 --> 00:09:46.524
I'm so sore I can't sleep.

00:09:54.073 --> 00:09:57.202
What are you doing out here at this hour,
looking all pathetic?

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:03.666
I've always wanted to try this.

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:06.544
Just having a beer like this at night.

00:10:06.628 --> 00:10:09.839
I won't be able to do this
once I have my life back.

00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:14.052
Why not? Just go for it.

00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:16.971
Life's short enough as it is.

00:10:18.765 --> 00:10:21.684
You know what the human body's like now.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.688
If you just do whatever you feel like,

00:10:26.648 --> 00:10:28.816
you'll never get to do
what you really want.

00:10:30.693 --> 00:10:34.072
It's just one beer.
What difference does it make?

00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:35.573
A big one.

00:10:35.657 --> 00:10:38.451
An athlete's body
is like a finely tuned machine.

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:42.080
Everything you eat,
how often and when you eat,

00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:44.457
and even your sleep cycle all matter.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.960
It all shows
when you're out there on the field.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.671
You're so dramatic.

00:10:52.382 --> 00:10:54.425
Are all other humans like you?

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:56.552
No. That's why I'm the best in the world.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.638
What?

00:11:05.895 --> 00:11:06.771
Give me one.

00:11:07.397 --> 00:11:09.732
Since I'm human now, I want to get drunk.

00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:15.446
Why have you never had a drink before?

00:11:16.572 --> 00:11:19.575
Does alcohol weaken
a nine-tailed fox's spiritual power?

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:20.535
As if.

00:11:21.369 --> 00:11:24.163
No matter how much I drank,
I just couldn't get drunk.

00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:45.518
Have you ever seen
any other nine-tailed foxes?

00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:55.945
That must be lonely.

00:11:58.823 --> 00:11:59.741
I have.

00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.037
So I wasn't really lonely.

00:12:04.746 --> 00:12:07.290
It was just the two of us for a long time.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.002
- Then where is…
- She died.

00:12:12.378 --> 00:12:13.838
After becoming human.

00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:17.133
I see.

00:12:24.223 --> 00:12:26.309
So this is what getting drunk feels like.

00:12:54.712 --> 00:12:56.547
It's a bit cold at night.

00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:04.180
A fragile human,
still trying to act tough.

00:13:05.807 --> 00:13:09.519
You seem to keep forgetting,
but you're just a human woman now.

00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:20.488
Oh, I get it.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.992
This is like a human male hitting
on a female. It's called flirting.

00:13:25.493 --> 00:13:27.495
Flirt… Are you nuts?

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:30.039
Give it back.

00:13:30.123 --> 00:13:31.958
- Give me--
- Hey, no take-backs.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.876
It's nice and warm.

00:13:34.502 --> 00:13:36.879
Look, let me be clear.

00:13:37.505 --> 00:13:39.173
This is not flirting.

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:42.260
It's called manners, okay?

00:13:43.594 --> 00:13:45.430
Don't be shy.

00:13:45.513 --> 00:13:47.432
With my looks and charm,

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:49.892
of course you'd fall for me.

00:13:50.518 --> 00:13:52.645
I am a nine-tailed fox, after all.

00:13:54.772 --> 00:13:56.357
You are unbelievable.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.527
Okay. I'll pretend I didn't notice.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.987
Notice what?

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.989
I shouldn't have given you the jacket.

00:14:03.823 --> 00:14:05.700
It's so warm.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.417
Do you know the name
of that constellation?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.543
No, what is it?

00:14:15.626 --> 00:14:17.253
I'm asking because I don't know.

00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:19.046
It's pretty.

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:24.218
EPISODE 5
THE CHANGER, THE CHANGED, AND THE LACKING

00:14:34.353 --> 00:14:35.396
Woo-seok.

00:14:37.273 --> 00:14:39.150
What are you doing up this late?

00:14:41.527 --> 00:14:43.446
I just couldn't sleep.

00:14:44.655 --> 00:14:46.407
Couldn't sleep? Why?

00:14:49.702 --> 00:14:51.996
Because I'm scared.

00:14:54.499 --> 00:14:56.292
It feels like when I wake up,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.170
everything will just vanish.

00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:02.131
Like a dream.

00:15:02.924 --> 00:15:04.050
Like a mirage.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.940
We'd pass as hikers now, right?

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:23.361
Of course. Let's go get stranded.

00:15:48.344 --> 00:15:50.221
Why are there so many people here?

00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:53.808
The owner said today's the start
of the long weekend.

00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:55.851
We won't get stranded
with this many people around.

00:15:55.935 --> 00:15:58.980
One small scream,
and people will swarm in to save us.

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:00.189
Coming through.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.317
Seriously.

00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:05.152
This isn't going to work.

00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:08.030
We need to go somewhere secluded.

00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:19.834
Man, I'm dying here.

00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:21.252
How much farther?

00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:22.545
In my experience,

00:16:22.628 --> 00:16:25.506
we'll end up deep in the woods
if we go a little farther.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.925
We can rest there until nightfall.

00:16:50.656 --> 00:16:51.532
Are you okay?

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.576
What?

00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:55.411
Yeah.

00:18:09.777 --> 00:18:11.404
I can't take another step.

00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:15.408
I think we're officially stranded.

00:18:15.491 --> 00:18:17.410
I couldn't find the trail even if I tried.

00:18:41.517 --> 00:18:42.768
I'm so sleepy.

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:47.815
You can't sleep out here.
You'll freeze to death.

00:18:47.898 --> 00:18:50.359
- Just a little nap.
- Absolutely not.

00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:53.028
Hang on.

00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:57.450
Try some of this.

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:00.035
It'll wake you up.

00:19:07.418 --> 00:19:10.337
Yes, I think it's working.

00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:11.922
That's good.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.014
When is she going to show up?

00:19:20.931 --> 00:19:22.475
The sun went down ages ago.

00:19:25.186 --> 00:19:28.564
Hey, what if…

00:19:28.647 --> 00:19:31.734
What if there's no nine-tailed fox here?
What happens to us then?

00:19:33.444 --> 00:19:34.361
What?

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.113
I mean, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:38.657
I was just thinking

00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:41.410
that the newspaper article
was from 28 years ago.

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:44.413
Maybe she's become a human like you.

00:19:44.497 --> 00:19:45.498
No way.

00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:49.335
Becoming human isn't that easy.

00:19:50.878 --> 00:19:53.589
Considering I didn't even know
there was a nine-tailed fox here,

00:19:53.672 --> 00:19:55.966
she can't be more than 300
or 400 years old.

00:19:57.718 --> 00:19:59.595
No way she's turned human yet.

00:20:00.304 --> 00:20:01.222
Right?

00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:02.848
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:05.476
But…

00:20:08.187 --> 00:20:09.146
it's freezing.

00:20:09.855 --> 00:20:10.815
Yes.

00:20:15.027 --> 00:20:16.529
- Should we--
- Should we head back?

00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:18.322
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:20.699
Okay… grab your stuff.

00:20:24.912 --> 00:20:27.540
Why do humans have such poor night vision?

00:20:28.374 --> 00:20:30.543
I can't see a single thing.

00:20:30.626 --> 00:20:33.212
Seriously, where are we?

00:20:41.887 --> 00:20:42.805
Oh no.

00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:46.350
Can we call those rangers
from yesterday?

00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:50.688
I haven't had signal for a while.

00:20:53.482 --> 00:20:55.192
Am I really going to die?

00:20:55.818 --> 00:20:58.904
Out here? Right after becoming human?

00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:00.489
We're not going to die.

00:21:01.407 --> 00:21:03.826
I can't die here. I'm Kang Si-yeol.

00:21:07.621 --> 00:21:11.542
Si-yeol! Where are you?

00:21:15.254 --> 00:21:16.130
Si-yeol!

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:19.341
Si-yeol.

00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:23.721
Are you okay? You're not dead, are you?

00:21:23.804 --> 00:21:27.558
I'm not dead, but I think I'm done for.

00:21:28.684 --> 00:21:29.852
What?

00:21:29.935 --> 00:21:31.562
I sprained my ankle.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.903
- Check your phone again.
- Okay.

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:46.201
What?

00:21:46.285 --> 00:21:47.411
No!

00:22:04.553 --> 00:22:05.888
Do you need help?

00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:19.735
Geum-ho?

00:22:33.457 --> 00:22:34.917
Is it really you?

00:22:36.627 --> 00:22:38.003
How can you be…

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.676
All this time, I thought you were dead…

00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:53.102
Hey, what's wrong with you?

00:22:56.438 --> 00:22:57.564
Do you know me?

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.405
What?

00:23:04.488 --> 00:23:05.823
How do you know me?

00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:20.379
Right. I forget this is what they do.

00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:22.923
I was being naive.

00:23:23.507 --> 00:23:26.093
You can't be Geum-ho.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.847
She became human and died of old age.

00:23:33.434 --> 00:23:36.061
What kind of sick joke is this?

00:23:38.564 --> 00:23:40.315
Did I do something wrong?

00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:45.988
Are you pretending not to know,
or do you really not know anything?

00:23:49.575 --> 00:23:51.452
Just who the hell are you?

00:23:53.245 --> 00:23:54.413
Well…

00:23:56.206 --> 00:23:58.542
I'm just a fox cultivating myself
in the mountains.

00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:04.798
Right. Of course.

00:24:04.882 --> 00:24:07.634
This must be the will of Heaven.

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:12.264
And I'm just the fool dancing to the tune.

00:24:14.016 --> 00:24:15.809
Hey, where are you going?

00:24:16.435 --> 00:24:17.728
Don't follow me!

00:24:18.937 --> 00:24:20.689
It's dangerous that way.

00:24:21.315 --> 00:24:22.900
That's not a trail humans use.

00:24:23.484 --> 00:24:26.278
She said it's dangerous.
What's wrong with you?

00:24:28.822 --> 00:24:30.532
I told you not to follow me.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.621
Hey! You--

00:24:37.331 --> 00:24:38.582
That little…

00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:16.286
Show yourself. I know you're watching!

00:25:18.497 --> 00:25:20.415
Come out right now!

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:27.131
Stop hiding like a coward and face me!

00:25:30.634 --> 00:25:32.553
Why do I have to be human?

00:25:33.637 --> 00:25:37.933
And why is a nine-tailed fox that looks
just like Geum-ho showing up now?

00:25:38.016 --> 00:25:40.185
Who the hell is she?

00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:42.563
What do you want from me?

00:25:53.073 --> 00:25:54.533
What are you doing?

00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:56.535
I sprained my ankle earlier.

00:25:56.618 --> 00:25:59.121
I need to catch up to her fast.

00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:06.211
It should feel better now.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.513
Is this fun for you?

00:26:16.597 --> 00:26:19.016
Treating me like your toy?

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:21.852
Right.

00:26:22.394 --> 00:26:25.856
I bet I'm just a pawn on your chessboard.

00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:32.279
Setting up all these schemes
and messing with someone's fate

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:34.364
is just how you do things.

00:26:44.166 --> 00:26:48.754
But you know,
I've got my own way of doing things.

00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:52.883
I just ignore everything you say
and do whatever the hell I want.

00:26:53.467 --> 00:26:54.593
You already knew that.

00:26:55.219 --> 00:26:58.722
I don't know why you turned me human
or what you want from me,

00:26:58.805 --> 00:27:02.726
and I don't even know why you sent
someone who looks just like Geum-ho.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.105
But whatever your plan is,
I'm not playing along.

00:27:08.732 --> 00:27:11.610
I'll fight back with everything I've got.

00:27:18.742 --> 00:27:19.993
Hey!

00:27:22.746 --> 00:27:23.747
Hey.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:27.292
Are you okay?

00:27:27.376 --> 00:27:28.752
Yeah.

00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:33.340
You scared me. Seriously, you're…

00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:36.176
It's cold out.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.014
Hey, you.

00:27:41.974 --> 00:27:43.183
Go start a fire or something.

00:27:45.644 --> 00:27:46.728
Excuse me?

00:27:59.533 --> 00:28:02.160
- Got anything to eat?
- Oh! Just a moment.

00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:12.212
What was that about earlier?

00:28:13.046 --> 00:28:15.382
Nothing. Just a misunderstanding.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.592
A misunderstanding?

00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:21.305
You made a scene like that
over a misunderstanding?

00:28:21.805 --> 00:28:23.015
That's right.

00:28:23.098 --> 00:28:24.516
Oh, come on.

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:27.352
That was way too dramatic.

00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:30.063
If that nine-tailed fox
had a nasty temper like yours,

00:28:30.147 --> 00:28:32.065
we'd be dead by now.

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:33.567
What's wrong with my temper?

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.029
I'm just saying we're the ones
who need help right now.

00:28:37.112 --> 00:28:39.364
Why pick a fight
when we should be sucking up to her?

00:28:39.448 --> 00:28:41.908
You're the one
who needs to suck up to her, not me.

00:28:41.992 --> 00:28:43.994
And I didn't start the fight.

00:28:44.077 --> 00:28:46.496
The ones above are
picking a fight with me.

00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:49.124
What are you talking about?

00:28:50.292 --> 00:28:51.877
I told you last night.

00:28:52.711 --> 00:28:56.423
There was another nine-tailed fox
that I lived with for a very long time.

00:28:57.132 --> 00:28:58.008
And?

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:02.262
That fox is the spitting image of her.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.558
I knew her for centuries,
and yet even I was fooled for a moment.

00:29:08.852 --> 00:29:11.646
Right after I become human,

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.775
I run into a fox
who looks exactly like her.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.154
That's no coincidence.
They must be up to something.

00:29:23.283 --> 00:29:26.078
It feels like they're just
openly toying with me,

00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:28.080
and it pisses me off.

00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:31.792
Well,

00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:35.337
let's not overcomplicate things.

00:29:35.962 --> 00:29:37.172
Keep it simple.

00:29:38.382 --> 00:29:40.759
What? How?

00:29:42.636 --> 00:29:45.180
Let's solve my problem first.

00:29:45.931 --> 00:29:51.895
So even if you're annoyed,
just suck it up and be nice to her.

00:29:51.978 --> 00:29:54.981
If she refuses my wish,
are you going to take responsibility?

00:29:55.065 --> 00:29:57.275
- You little--
- Hey…

00:29:57.901 --> 00:29:59.736
Here, have some of this.

00:30:06.118 --> 00:30:07.536
What is this?

00:30:08.036 --> 00:30:11.206
This is Fischer's ragwort, that's mugwort,

00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:13.500
wild chives, spring cabbage,

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:15.794
coastal hog fennel, shepherd's purse--

00:30:15.877 --> 00:30:17.379
That's not what I mean.

00:30:18.338 --> 00:30:21.591
You want us to eat this raw?

00:30:22.384 --> 00:30:24.428
I washed them in the stream.

00:30:25.011 --> 00:30:28.765
Gosh, I guess you're a vegetarian.

00:30:31.852 --> 00:30:34.855
Is this what you normally live on?

00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:36.231
What are you, a goat?

00:30:37.649 --> 00:30:38.984
I'm a fox.

00:30:40.902 --> 00:30:44.448
I mean, why would a fox
live on just greens?

00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:48.034
Did your mountain god say
you can't self-cultivate if you eat meat?

00:30:48.785 --> 00:30:52.539
Not really. I mean, I've lived
on this mountain for so long.

00:30:52.622 --> 00:30:53.957
So whenever I try to hunt animals,

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.793
it turns out I either know them
or know someone who does.

00:30:56.877 --> 00:30:59.087
I can't exactly eat my friend's
great-great-granddaughter.

00:30:59.171 --> 00:31:00.630
True.

00:31:01.756 --> 00:31:04.759
- What?
- Hey, that's not important.

00:31:05.343 --> 00:31:07.721
This is great. So fresh.

00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:12.559
You know, I eat a ton of salad too.

00:31:12.642 --> 00:31:14.895
Look at that!
We have so much in common.

00:31:16.062 --> 00:31:17.147
Please, eat up.

00:31:22.986 --> 00:31:24.529
All right, enough.

00:31:24.613 --> 00:31:26.948
Stop stalling and tell her why we're here.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.828
Right.

00:31:33.747 --> 00:31:34.956
The thing is,

00:31:35.957 --> 00:31:37.834
we didn't exactly get lost.

00:31:39.377 --> 00:31:41.588
We actually came here looking for you.

00:31:42.756 --> 00:31:45.008
Looking for me? Why?

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:53.517
Because I have a wish.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.950
What is this?

00:32:10.742 --> 00:32:11.910
What's happening?

00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:38.645
You can't just do this all of a sudden.

00:32:38.728 --> 00:32:40.272
How can you do this?

00:32:43.483 --> 00:32:44.484
HYEON WOO-SEOK, MY STORY

00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:09.968
What's happening?

00:33:10.051 --> 00:33:11.011
It didn't work.

00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:14.097
Excuse me?

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.016
I just tried, but it didn't work.

00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:17.684
Why didn't it work?

00:33:18.518 --> 00:33:21.062
Something was just happening!
Why did it stop?

00:33:21.688 --> 00:33:24.232
Well, actually, I--

00:33:24.316 --> 00:33:25.942
Just how old are you?

00:33:26.026 --> 00:33:28.194
How long have you been a nine-tailed fox?

00:33:29.446 --> 00:33:31.531
About 500 years.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.867
Then why can't you pull this off?

00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:38.371
I've never done anything like this,
so I didn't even know it was possible.

00:33:38.455 --> 00:33:40.874
Well, can't you just
teach her how to do it?

00:33:41.916 --> 00:33:44.461
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

00:33:44.544 --> 00:33:46.379
She doesn't have enough spiritual power.

00:33:46.463 --> 00:33:48.048
It's not about technique.

00:33:49.132 --> 00:33:51.217
Come on, that makes no sense.

00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:53.428
She healed my ankle just fine.

00:33:53.511 --> 00:33:55.847
She was teleporting all over the place!

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.682
So why can't she do this?

00:33:58.725 --> 00:34:02.395
You can't compare a fate-altering spell
to those cheap party tricks.

00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:03.605
Jeez. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:34:03.688 --> 00:34:05.690
Beats me why
a 500-year-old nine-tailed fox

00:34:05.774 --> 00:34:08.026
has so little spiritual power.

00:34:09.486 --> 00:34:11.655
Well, the thing is--

00:34:11.738 --> 00:34:15.116
No… no, this can't be real.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.534
Look.

00:34:17.494 --> 00:34:19.454
Just try it one more time. Please.

00:34:20.121 --> 00:34:22.082
Maybe it'll work this time.

00:34:22.165 --> 00:34:23.416
Well…

00:34:24.042 --> 00:34:26.753
It won't matter how many times she tries.

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:29.714
She lacks power. Were you not listening?

00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:33.343
Does this not matter to you?
Whose fault is it that I'm in this mess?

00:34:33.426 --> 00:34:35.762
Do I look like I'm having fun right now?

00:34:35.845 --> 00:34:38.098
I'm in this mess because of you!

00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:39.474
You're blaming me?

00:34:39.557 --> 00:34:40.433
Obviously.

00:34:40.517 --> 00:34:43.353
I should've just let you die back then.

00:34:43.436 --> 00:34:44.688
- Hey!
- What?

00:34:44.771 --> 00:34:46.731
Please don't fight--

00:34:46.815 --> 00:34:49.526
- This is all your fault.
- What?

00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:52.654
You're a nine-tailed fox.
How can you be this useless?

00:34:52.737 --> 00:34:55.865
Well, actually, I'm not a nine-tailed fox.

00:34:57.283 --> 00:34:59.703
What? Come again?

00:35:00.745 --> 00:35:04.624
I kept trying to tell you,
but you kept cutting me off.

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:08.628
What? Then what are you?

00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:12.632
I'm not a nine-tailed fox.

00:35:13.258 --> 00:35:14.759
I'm an eight-tailed fox.

00:35:14.843 --> 00:35:16.177
Eight tails.

00:35:20.974 --> 00:35:22.308
What?

00:35:31.943 --> 00:35:32.986
CALL
SI-YEOL

00:35:35.947 --> 00:35:38.742
The person you are calling is unavailable…

00:35:38.825 --> 00:35:41.202
What? Why is his phone off?

00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:48.918
What the hell is going on?

00:35:52.881 --> 00:35:56.676
Five, six, seven,

00:35:58.136 --> 00:35:59.179
eight.

00:36:00.221 --> 00:36:01.431
There really are only eight.

00:36:01.514 --> 00:36:03.683
I should have known.

00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:06.895
No wonder she seemed a bit lacking.

00:36:08.396 --> 00:36:10.482
What is an eight-tailed fox anyway?

00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:13.026
I've never heard of anything like that.

00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:16.696
If a nine-tailed fox has nine tails,
what do you think an eight-tailed fox is?

00:36:17.238 --> 00:36:18.615
A fox with eight tails.

00:36:19.282 --> 00:36:21.159
You know that's not what I meant.

00:36:22.076 --> 00:36:24.454
They all start out pretty much the same.

00:36:24.537 --> 00:36:28.291
Just an ordinary fox
who suddenly starts thinking.

00:36:33.379 --> 00:36:37.884
"Why are they human,
while I am nothing but a beast?"

00:36:39.844 --> 00:36:43.348
"How can I become something more?"

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.354
Once a fox reaches that enlightenment
and begins to cultivate themselves,

00:36:49.437 --> 00:36:53.066
they start to shed their animal form
and become closer to a human.

00:36:54.108 --> 00:36:55.777
For centuries,

00:36:56.361 --> 00:36:58.279
as their enlightenment grows,

00:36:58.905 --> 00:37:01.825
they gain one tail after another.

00:37:05.662 --> 00:37:10.375
So, since she's missing a tail,
she's still more beast than human.

00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:13.253
She hasn't trained enough
to be a true nine-tailed fox.

00:37:14.587 --> 00:37:17.799
How do you know so much about this?

00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:22.846
Because I went through it myself.

00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.559
All that waiting.
All those years of dreaming.

00:37:31.187 --> 00:37:32.230
Pardon?

00:37:33.606 --> 00:37:36.651
I was a nine-tailed fox
until just a few days ago.

00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:40.613
Though now I'm stuck being human.

00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:43.783
Wait, so what happens now?

00:37:43.867 --> 00:37:46.536
What about me?
Can't I go back to the way I was?

00:37:46.619 --> 00:37:48.454
We'll have to find another way.

00:37:48.538 --> 00:37:49.873
Since she's clearly--

00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:52.375
It's you. The one I've been waiting for.

00:37:53.835 --> 00:37:54.878
What?

00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:58.214
I've been waiting for you to come.
For over 200 years, sis.

00:37:59.924 --> 00:38:01.301
What are you talking about?

00:38:01.384 --> 00:38:04.721
The mountain god told me before he left

00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:06.806
that someone would come
to take care of me.

00:38:08.016 --> 00:38:09.350
You think that's me?

00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:12.812
Yes! Though I didn't think
it'd take 200 years.

00:38:13.563 --> 00:38:16.190
Still, since you came all this way--

00:38:17.025 --> 00:38:19.319
I think you've got the wrong idea.

00:38:19.402 --> 00:38:20.987
Please tell me, sis.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.698
How can I become human like you?

00:38:26.075 --> 00:38:27.535
What?

00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:35.919
I want to become human
as soon as possible.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.775
Wait.

00:39:02.654 --> 00:39:04.405
Where did that nice nine-tailed fox go?

00:39:05.615 --> 00:39:07.158
Or was it an eight-tailed fox?

00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:09.035
"Nice nine-tailed fox"?

00:39:09.661 --> 00:39:11.704
Then am I the bad nine-tailed fox?

00:39:11.788 --> 00:39:13.331
Where did she go, anyway?

00:39:14.415 --> 00:39:16.459
Who cares? She probably went on her way.

00:39:17.502 --> 00:39:19.337
I'm tired. Let's head back down.

00:39:20.213 --> 00:39:22.924
Is it all right to just leave
without saying goodbye?

00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:26.219
I mean, isn't she your kin or something?

00:39:26.302 --> 00:39:28.805
Why say goodbye
when we won't see each other again?

00:39:30.223 --> 00:39:32.183
Are you going to stay and live here?

00:39:33.434 --> 00:39:35.520
Okay, fine. Let's go.

00:39:35.603 --> 00:39:36.896
Man…

00:39:37.563 --> 00:39:40.024
Don't go off alone. It's dangerous.

00:39:40.108 --> 00:39:41.234
Hurry up.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:52.912
Are you changing hotels again today?

00:39:54.831 --> 00:39:56.082
Damn it.

00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:58.584
Yes.

00:39:59.502 --> 00:40:01.004
Today's the chairman's birthday.

00:40:01.087 --> 00:40:03.381
Shouldn't you at least attend the dinner?

00:40:04.382 --> 00:40:07.677
Forget it.
It's not like anyone wants me there.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.021
Did you look into what I asked for?

00:40:18.104 --> 00:40:19.981
Well, Mr. Lee.

00:40:21.149 --> 00:40:23.317
Is what you're looking for

00:40:23.401 --> 00:40:26.154
the name of some organization?

00:40:26.654 --> 00:40:28.865
What the hell are you talking about?

00:40:30.033 --> 00:40:31.451
I said, the nine-tailed fox.

00:40:32.076 --> 00:40:34.996
You know, the fox with nine tails.

00:40:35.538 --> 00:40:38.791
Didn't I tell you to find out everything
about the nine-tailed fox?

00:40:41.794 --> 00:40:44.505
Mr. Lee, those things aren't real.

00:40:45.339 --> 00:40:48.009
What are you talking about? You saw it.

00:40:48.509 --> 00:40:50.053
You were right there with me.

00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:52.972
I was?

00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:58.144
Hey… pull over, you bastard.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.113
Never mind. Just leave.

00:41:10.907 --> 00:41:12.116
Mr. Lee--

00:41:12.909 --> 00:41:14.368
I said get out.

00:41:14.452 --> 00:41:16.746
You probably think I'm crazy too,

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:19.165
and you won't even bother looking into it.

00:41:19.248 --> 00:41:21.751
Mr. Lee, if word gets out

00:41:22.543 --> 00:41:24.420
that you're looking into such things--

00:41:24.504 --> 00:41:28.466
I get it, so please leave
and stop wasting your time on a nutcase.

00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:35.807
Hey, wait!

00:41:38.768 --> 00:41:41.938
Just… hold on.

00:41:44.107 --> 00:41:45.316
Who are you people?

00:41:45.399 --> 00:41:47.735
I've seen that bastard somewhere before.

00:41:52.031 --> 00:41:53.741
Is he actually dying?

00:41:57.995 --> 00:41:58.913
That's it.

00:41:59.872 --> 00:42:01.541
I knew he looked familiar.

00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:03.501
Secretary Choi.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.755
Look into the records of the car accident
from nine years ago.

00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:09.465
Pardon?

00:42:09.966 --> 00:42:12.093
The kid I hit with my car.

00:42:12.176 --> 00:42:17.473
Find out everything about who he is,
where he lives, and what he's doing.

00:42:30.236 --> 00:42:31.362
Hey.

00:42:31.445 --> 00:42:35.116
Did you have to be so harsh yesterday?

00:42:38.244 --> 00:42:40.746
How can I become human like you?

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.665
I want to become human
as soon as possible.

00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:54.677
Shut your mouth before I shut it for you.

00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:59.682
How dare you say that to me
wearing that face?

00:43:00.516 --> 00:43:03.436
- But sis--
- Don't call me that.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.689
I don't know who you were waiting for,
but it isn't me.

00:43:06.772 --> 00:43:09.692
I have no desire to help you in that way.

00:43:11.319 --> 00:43:12.236
But still…

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.323
Whatever you choose to do with your life
has nothing to do with me.

00:43:15.406 --> 00:43:17.241
So leave me out of it.

00:43:17.325 --> 00:43:20.119
I can barely take care of myself as it is.

00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:23.164
Do you understand me?

00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:27.126
You're not the one I've been missing.

00:43:28.044 --> 00:43:31.255
So I don't need to feel
like I owe you anything.

00:43:32.131 --> 00:43:34.717
So don't ever show up
in front of me again.

00:43:36.385 --> 00:43:38.387
She seemed hurt,

00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:40.848
seeing how she left
without a word this morning.

00:43:42.516 --> 00:43:44.644
You don't seem
to understand the situation.

00:43:44.727 --> 00:43:46.646
We just got played.

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:49.315
We came all this way,
suffered through hell,

00:43:49.398 --> 00:43:51.067
and now we're leaving empty-handed.

00:43:52.652 --> 00:43:54.362
I guess so, but…

00:43:56.614 --> 00:43:59.659
True, who am I to worry?
I'm a mess myself.

00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:02.828
So, what's the plan now?

00:44:02.912 --> 00:44:06.207
I'm going to go back
and dig through some old texts.

00:44:06.999 --> 00:44:09.043
"Old texts"? Like, ancient books?

00:44:09.126 --> 00:44:12.505
Yes, there are books on secret methods
for situations like this.

00:44:12.588 --> 00:44:14.924
Oh, really now?

00:44:16.717 --> 00:44:19.136
You don't remember any
off the top of your head?

00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:23.683
How would I remember something
I read centuries ago?

00:44:25.518 --> 00:44:28.896
Man, the international break
is coming up soon.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.690
I really need to switch back soon.

00:44:33.234 --> 00:44:36.153
Who cares about
some stupid ball game right now?

00:44:36.904 --> 00:44:38.614
It is important.

00:44:38.698 --> 00:44:40.908
It's an international match.
A game for the national team.

00:44:40.992 --> 00:44:44.120
Honestly, aren't you
a Korean nine-tailed fox?

00:44:44.203 --> 00:44:45.788
Where's your patriotism?

00:44:49.292 --> 00:44:52.003
I've been around longer than Korea has.

00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:57.341
Look, I don't know if you identify
with Joseon or Goryeo,

00:44:57.425 --> 00:45:00.344
but we're still one people.

00:45:03.306 --> 00:45:07.018
We are different species.

00:45:07.101 --> 00:45:09.186
Don't give me that "one people" crap.

00:45:10.146 --> 00:45:12.148
Come on, Ok-sun.

00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:13.733
What? I'm not Ok-sun.

00:45:15.443 --> 00:45:18.321
But I saw your ID at the police station.

00:45:18.404 --> 00:45:22.783
- Your name isn't Eun-ho. It's Kim Ok-sun.
- I told you, it's not Kim Ok-sun!

00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:27.163
- That damn old geezer just put whatever--
- That's just a typical grandma name.

00:45:27.246 --> 00:45:29.457
Why be embarrassed about it, Ok-sun?

00:45:30.624 --> 00:45:32.543
My grandma's name is Kim Bok-sun.

00:45:34.628 --> 00:45:37.923
I'm not embarrassed.
I'm telling you, Ok-sun is…

00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:43.679
My name is Eun-ho!

00:45:43.763 --> 00:45:46.974
All right, I'll just call you Eun-ho.

00:45:47.558 --> 00:45:49.060
- Ok-sun.
- Hey!

00:45:49.143 --> 00:45:52.021
Why are you yelling, Ok-sun?
You'll burst my eardrums.

00:45:52.104 --> 00:45:53.773
I'm not Ok-sun!

00:45:53.856 --> 00:45:56.317
All right, Eun-ho.
I'll call you Eun-ho, okay?

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.486
- Ok-sun.
- It's Eun-ho!

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.614
That damn old geezer, seriously.

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:08.204
What is it, Si-yeol? What's wrong with it?

00:46:09.747 --> 00:46:10.790
We're out of gas.

00:46:12.124 --> 00:46:13.250
So put some in.

00:46:15.669 --> 00:46:20.216
Look, I was debating whether
to tell you this, but…

00:46:20.966 --> 00:46:21.842
What?

00:46:23.010 --> 00:46:24.595
My wallet's gone.

00:46:25.846 --> 00:46:27.640
- What?
- Listen.

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:31.769
I think it fell out
when I rolled down the mountain.

00:46:34.438 --> 00:46:35.898
Then what do we do now?

00:46:53.582 --> 00:46:56.419
Hey, here comes one.

00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:03.968
What a rude bastard.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:08.472
When I turn back into a nine-tailed fox,
I'll catch him and just…

00:47:09.849 --> 00:47:13.185
We can't even call the insurance company
since my phone's dead.

00:47:17.189 --> 00:47:19.733
Si-yeol, let's just walk.

00:47:19.817 --> 00:47:20.901
What?

00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:23.737
Walk home? Do you know how far that is?

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.866
Then are we just going
to stand here like this?

00:47:26.949 --> 00:47:28.576
Start walking.

00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:32.705
Look, we can't walk there.

00:47:32.788 --> 00:47:34.915
Why not? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:47:35.416 --> 00:47:37.751
In the old days,
even frail little scholars

00:47:37.835 --> 00:47:40.337
crossed mountains and rivers
to take their exams.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.424
- Aren't you an athlete?
- Jeez.

00:47:43.924 --> 00:47:46.844
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about you.

00:47:46.927 --> 00:47:49.305
You can't use skills
like earth-folding anymore.

00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:50.347
Please.

00:47:51.182 --> 00:47:54.602
I've hiked Seoraksan Mountain twice
in this human body.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.646
We must be near Seoul anyway.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.273
It can't be much farther.

00:48:02.026 --> 00:48:03.486
I give up.

00:48:08.574 --> 00:48:11.494
So, what's your plan going forward?

00:48:12.661 --> 00:48:14.121
What do you mean?

00:48:14.622 --> 00:48:16.665
You're completely broke right now.

00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:20.252
In the human world,
you can't do a single thing without money.

00:48:20.336 --> 00:48:21.670
I don't know.

00:48:22.171 --> 00:48:24.590
It's not like
I'll be stuck this way forever.

00:48:25.174 --> 00:48:27.885
What about dinner tonight? And tomorrow?

00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:31.931
- Are you going to let me starve?
- I'm sure there's cash at home.

00:48:32.014 --> 00:48:34.308
I can't be completely broke.

00:48:35.184 --> 00:48:36.185
Wait a second.

00:48:36.977 --> 00:48:38.979
Don't you have a ton of money?

00:48:39.063 --> 00:48:40.022
What?

00:48:40.105 --> 00:48:43.317
Think about how much
you ripped me off just a few days ago.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.778
You couldn't have spent it all already.

00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:46.737
I still have it.

00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:48.572
There we go then.

00:48:49.323 --> 00:48:51.909
Let's just use that for now.

00:48:51.992 --> 00:48:55.204
I'll pay you back
once I switch back to my old life.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.499
- But it's at my house.
- Okay, let's go get it.

00:48:59.542 --> 00:49:03.128
Actually, we can just crash
at your place for a while.

00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:05.130
You saw the state of my place.

00:49:05.214 --> 00:49:07.132
Yours has to be better than that.

00:49:07.216 --> 00:49:09.134
Sorry, but we can't go to my house.

00:49:09.635 --> 00:49:11.971
My house is halfway up
Myohyangsan Mountain.

00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:14.557
Your house is halfway up a mountain?

00:49:15.266 --> 00:49:18.936
Then I guess we'll just grab the cash
and find another place to stay.

00:49:19.562 --> 00:49:21.647
I said, it's on Myohyangsan Mountain.

00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:23.649
Okay, so what?

00:49:24.316 --> 00:49:27.236
Is it really high up?
Higher than Seoraksan Mountain?

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.656
Don't you know where
Myohyangsan Mountain is?

00:49:43.294 --> 00:49:44.837
GWANGHWAMUN

00:49:57.433 --> 00:49:58.559
THE CLEAR WATERS OF BAEKDU

00:50:06.734 --> 00:50:07.818
North Korea?

00:50:08.444 --> 00:50:09.987
Your house is in North Korea?

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.405
Yes.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.908
Myohyangsan Mountain is in North Korea?

00:50:15.451 --> 00:50:17.161
And your house is hidden up there?

00:50:17.786 --> 00:50:18.871
You heard me.

00:50:19.872 --> 00:50:23.125
Why live there when there are
so many decent mountains around?

00:50:23.959 --> 00:50:25.502
I was born there.

00:50:25.586 --> 00:50:27.755
Myohyangsan Mountain
has always been my home.

00:50:28.797 --> 00:50:31.008
It's humans who put up
barbed wire wherever they pleased.

00:50:31.091 --> 00:50:32.468
Why take it out on me?

00:50:32.551 --> 00:50:34.887
But you make all your money in the South.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.056
Why didn't you just buy a house in Seoul?

00:50:37.139 --> 00:50:39.099
Did you forget I could use earth-folding?

00:50:39.183 --> 00:50:41.977
It's a dozen steps from home to Gangnam,
so why would I bother?

00:50:42.061 --> 00:50:43.771
You can't be serious!

00:50:46.815 --> 00:50:48.400
Seriously.

00:50:48.484 --> 00:50:50.277
Isn't there any other way?

00:50:50.986 --> 00:50:53.947
Right, what if we ask
that eight-tailed fox from yesterday?

00:50:54.031 --> 00:50:56.533
We could just ask her to go get the money.

00:50:58.452 --> 00:51:00.245
No one can find that place but me.

00:51:00.329 --> 00:51:01.413
I put up a barrier.

00:51:02.956 --> 00:51:05.918
A barrier painstakingly made
to evade the eyes of the deities.

00:51:06.001 --> 00:51:08.796
You think some dimwitted eight-tailed fox
could get through that?

00:51:08.879 --> 00:51:10.005
Give me a break.

00:51:10.506 --> 00:51:12.341
You're no help at all, ever.

00:51:14.718 --> 00:51:18.889
Gosh, Si-yeol.
How much longer do we have to walk?

00:51:18.972 --> 00:51:20.933
My legs are killing me.

00:51:21.475 --> 00:51:23.644
We haven't even been walking
for 30 minutes.

00:51:24.478 --> 00:51:26.063
We have another 12 hours to go.

00:51:26.146 --> 00:51:29.608
Jeez, this damn human body
is the absolute worst.

00:51:34.488 --> 00:51:36.615
What's going on?
Why does it sting so much?

00:51:37.241 --> 00:51:38.117
Be careful.

00:51:38.742 --> 00:51:42.204
Just because it's not summer
doesn't mean you can't get sunburned.

00:51:42.287 --> 00:51:44.248
We don't even have money for sunscreen.

00:51:59.596 --> 00:52:00.723
Si-yeol, look at this.

00:52:02.474 --> 00:52:04.393
Doesn't this work
just as well as sunscreen?

00:52:06.729 --> 00:52:09.314
Still, you look ridiculous.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:11.900
So you're not going to use it?

00:52:13.402 --> 00:52:15.696
All right, give it here. I'll hold it.

00:52:20.117 --> 00:52:22.286
See? Better than nothing, right?

00:52:22.369 --> 00:52:23.579
I guess so.

00:52:27.082 --> 00:52:28.917
Anyway, how much longer do we have to go?

00:52:29.001 --> 00:52:32.254
You just asked.
Now it's 11 hours and 59 minutes.

00:52:45.392 --> 00:52:46.518
What…

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.940
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
KANG SI-YEOL

00:52:52.024 --> 00:52:54.401
This guy…

00:52:57.446 --> 00:52:58.405
Is that you, sis?

00:53:00.032 --> 00:53:03.202
Is it really you? You came back?

00:53:20.677 --> 00:53:22.471
Are we there yet?

00:53:23.972 --> 00:53:24.890
Almost.

00:53:27.059 --> 00:53:29.645
Good thing we met
a decent human along the way.

00:53:30.145 --> 00:53:31.980
I seriously thought I was going to die.

00:53:32.773 --> 00:53:34.483
When I get back to normal,

00:53:34.566 --> 00:53:37.486
I'll have to bless that human
with a winning lottery ticket.

00:53:39.363 --> 00:53:40.489
That's a good idea.

00:53:41.532 --> 00:53:43.033
I wonder if he likes soccer.

00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:46.578
I was thinking of giving him
tickets to the Champions League final.

00:53:54.419 --> 00:53:55.295
I'm hungry.

00:54:02.928 --> 00:54:04.638
You know, come to think of it,

00:54:05.222 --> 00:54:08.600
you must've made connections
with quite a few humans over the years.

00:54:08.684 --> 00:54:11.979
People may have forgotten me,
but it's not the same for you.

00:54:12.938 --> 00:54:13.939
By any chance,

00:54:14.731 --> 00:54:16.316
isn't there anyone you can ask for help?

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.359
There isn't.

00:54:17.442 --> 00:54:21.029
Why not? There must be people
whose wishes you granted.

00:54:21.113 --> 00:54:22.698
You said you hand-pick your clients.

00:54:22.781 --> 00:54:24.867
Aren't they all as rich as I am?

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:28.328
They're rich.
They've got both money and power.

00:54:28.412 --> 00:54:31.707
So? Let's go ask them for help.

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.834
We can pay them back double later.

00:54:37.629 --> 00:54:39.256
I've felt this for a while,

00:54:39.882 --> 00:54:42.467
but for a human, you sure seem clueless
about your own kind.

00:54:42.551 --> 00:54:44.386
Like how you blindly trusted your friend.

00:54:46.013 --> 00:54:47.431
What are you trying to say now?

00:54:47.514 --> 00:54:49.933
I never trust humans.

00:54:50.017 --> 00:54:52.477
Especially the ones with money and power.

00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:55.480
You know why they grovel
and suck up to me?

00:54:55.981 --> 00:54:58.191
It's only because I have power.

00:55:00.777 --> 00:55:02.905
If they find out I've lost my power,

00:55:03.405 --> 00:55:05.365
they'll try to get back at me somehow.

00:55:06.199 --> 00:55:11.455
Humans forget favors quickly
but hold on to grudges forever.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:14.082
Come on, surely not all of them?

00:55:14.708 --> 00:55:17.794
There must be some
you're on good terms with.

00:55:19.004 --> 00:55:20.756
Do you really think so?

00:55:22.883 --> 00:55:25.177
I guess not.

00:55:25.802 --> 00:55:29.514
You probably bullied them
the same way you did me.

00:55:29.598 --> 00:55:31.058
I tamed them.

00:55:32.017 --> 00:55:33.435
So they're easier to handle.

00:55:35.062 --> 00:55:38.857
Anyway, I have to be more careful
with those who know who I am.

00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:41.360
So watch your mouth, got it?

00:55:42.903 --> 00:55:45.405
That's why you should've been
a little nicer all along.

00:55:47.157 --> 00:55:48.241
What?

00:55:49.618 --> 00:55:50.869
I said I'm hungry.

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.039
Jeez.

00:55:54.122 --> 00:55:56.333
Seriously, what is going on?

00:55:56.416 --> 00:55:59.086
Why isn't Si-yeol at home
or picking up his phone?

00:55:59.586 --> 00:56:00.921
Tell me about it.

00:56:01.004 --> 00:56:04.216
How can he borrow a car
and then ghost us for two days?

00:56:04.716 --> 00:56:07.010
You don't think something happened
to Si-yeol, do you?

00:56:07.094 --> 00:56:08.261
No way.

00:56:08.345 --> 00:56:10.097
I'm the one with the problem, damn it.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.057
I've got early morning
deliveries but no car.

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:16.687
You can take my car again today.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.022
Your car is so embarrassing to drive.

00:56:19.106 --> 00:56:21.191
Everyone stares at it.

00:56:21.942 --> 00:56:23.986
Jeong-bae has a nice car.
Why are you embarrassed?

00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:25.487
That's why it's embarrassing.

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:28.865
If it were just an expensive car,
I wouldn't be complaining.

00:56:28.949 --> 00:56:32.327
But who drives a supercar
for an early morning delivery gig?

00:56:32.411 --> 00:56:34.705
Plus, the gas mileage just sucks.

00:56:34.788 --> 00:56:37.457
After paying for gas,
I make basically nothing.

00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:40.752
But you know
my baby only takes premium, right?

00:56:40.836 --> 00:56:43.547
I know, you jerk. Jeez!

00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:47.592
But seriously,
don't you find that car uncomfortable?

00:56:47.676 --> 00:56:49.845
What kind of car doesn't have a back seat?

00:56:50.554 --> 00:56:55.642
Right? It costs a fortune,
but it's only half a car.

00:56:55.726 --> 00:56:57.144
It's only got two doors too.

00:56:57.227 --> 00:56:58.895
You rich kids…

00:56:58.979 --> 00:57:00.439
Hey, take a look at this.

00:57:08.196 --> 00:57:10.574
It hit the upper limit twice.
Just look at this stock.

00:57:10.657 --> 00:57:12.617
It's going to bottom out,
then bounce back.

00:57:12.701 --> 00:57:15.620
Just tell your grandma
to invest a little until then.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.499
Thank you.

00:57:20.876 --> 00:57:21.918
For now,

00:57:23.336 --> 00:57:24.921
let's go inside and get some rest.

00:57:25.005 --> 00:57:26.089
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:57:38.685 --> 00:57:39.603
Woo-seok.

00:57:44.274 --> 00:57:45.150
I'm sorry.

00:57:46.234 --> 00:57:47.444
It took me so long.

00:57:48.236 --> 00:57:51.448
Wait, how are you even here?

00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:54.618
He probably ran his ass off in a panic.

00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.623
I see you were together.

00:57:59.706 --> 00:58:02.125
Why? Does that make you twice as nervous?

00:58:02.626 --> 00:58:04.711
Seeing me next to Si-yeol?

00:58:09.424 --> 00:58:10.467
Si-yeol.

00:58:11.009 --> 00:58:14.930
I was blinded by greed and crossed a line.

00:58:16.223 --> 00:58:18.475
I should've asked you face-to-face.

00:58:21.561 --> 00:58:22.562
Honestly,

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:25.816
these past few days felt like a dream.

00:58:28.318 --> 00:58:32.864
The life I never even dared to dream of
became mine in an instant.

00:58:33.532 --> 00:58:34.866
- Woo-seok--
- I know.

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:37.285
It's all yours. It's your life.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.329
I know I shouldn't be

00:58:40.288 --> 00:58:42.082
doing this to you.

00:58:42.165 --> 00:58:44.334
But just for one week.

00:58:45.085 --> 00:58:48.088
If a month is too long, how about a week?

00:58:48.171 --> 00:58:50.465
Let me play just one
international match next week.

00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:51.633
Do whatever you want.

00:58:54.886 --> 00:58:55.971
What?

00:58:56.054 --> 00:58:57.722
It's not like we'll stay switched forever.

00:58:57.806 --> 00:58:59.933
Spending a few days in your life…

00:59:01.434 --> 00:59:02.477
wasn't so bad.

00:59:03.395 --> 00:59:05.480
I've never had a chance to properly rest.

00:59:05.564 --> 00:59:07.274
I'll just think of it as a break.

00:59:08.984 --> 00:59:11.611
Really? You mean it?

00:59:11.695 --> 00:59:14.990
Let's keep it like this for now.
That way, you won't have any regrets.

00:59:15.073 --> 00:59:17.993
But when I say we need to switch,
we switch right away.

00:59:18.076 --> 00:59:19.870
You can promise me that, right?

00:59:20.954 --> 00:59:23.081
Yes, of course.

00:59:24.457 --> 00:59:25.750
Thank you, Si-yeol.

00:59:29.462 --> 00:59:32.215
I seriously won't forget this favor.

00:59:33.842 --> 00:59:36.761
Sis, I found a way!

00:59:37.387 --> 00:59:38.847
It's going to take some time,

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.683
but I found a way for you to turn back

00:59:41.766 --> 00:59:43.226
into a nine-tailed fox.

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:46.104
Okay, let's talk about it later.

00:59:46.188 --> 00:59:49.024
That means he can
go back to his life too, right?

00:59:49.107 --> 00:59:50.442
Right?

01:00:28.813 --> 01:00:31.733
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:00:31.816 --> 01:00:33.193
{\an8}You found a way?

01:00:33.276 --> 01:00:35.070
{\an8}What if I become a nine-tailed fox?

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:37.280
{\an8}Then I'll have powers too,

01:00:37.364 --> 01:00:39.282
{\an8}so we can just switch our fates.

01:00:39.366 --> 01:00:42.285
{\an8}I think I should meet this Hyeon Woo-seok.

01:00:42.369 --> 01:00:45.121
{\an8}You've invited quite the ghost in.

01:00:45.205 --> 01:00:47.332
{\an8}So there's a chance we can't switch back

01:00:47.415 --> 01:00:49.209
{\an8}if that method doesn't work?

01:00:49.292 --> 01:00:52.337
{\an8}So doing good deeds
builds up spiritual power, right?

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.506
{\an8}But how long will that take?

01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:57.050
{\an8}- Usually, it takes about 100 years.
- A hundred years?

01:00:57.133 --> 01:00:58.176
{\an8}Brace yourself.

01:00:58.802 --> 01:01:01.304
{\an8}We'll be slammed starting tomorrow.

01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:05.684
