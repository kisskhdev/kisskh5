{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.825
LIULI PALACE

00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:57.505
Look! What is this?

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:06.585
Don't use a shovel. Use something small.

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:09.545
Dig together. Do not damage it.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:18.945
Be careful.

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:36.705
LIULI PALACE

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:43.105
Assistant Director, this is…

00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:45.905
What a treasure
buried beneath the Liuli Palace.

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:47.185
Quick.

00:02:47.265 --> 00:02:49.145
Inform His Majesty at once.

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.545
In two weeks,
Venus will appear during the day?

00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:07.465
I have news.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.665
Your Majesty,
Assistant Director Shen Chuan reported

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:16.145
that he dug up a dragon statue
in Liuli Palace.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:18.505
This could be an auspicious sign.

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:20.505
Please advise, Your Majesty.

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:32.105
This… This doesn't seem like a dragon.

00:03:32.185 --> 00:03:33.105
This is…

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:36.385
- It's a Hou beast.
- It's a Hou beast.

00:03:36.465 --> 00:03:39.105
The ancient beast that preys upon dragons.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.985
We dug up something incredible.

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:44.305
Silence!

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:03.105
Assistant Director!

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:06.985
- Assistant Director!
- Assistant Director!

00:04:07.065 --> 00:04:08.345
Quick.

00:04:09.225 --> 00:04:10.265
- Oh my.
- He fainted.

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:11.025
Careful. Come.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:12.265
- Quick.
- Careful.

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.665
The appearance of Venus
is just a possible outcome,

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:18.504
but it is never observed in our records.

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:21.225
Yet the bamboo message
has made a serious allegation of it.

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:23.465
Deputy Director Xiao,

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:25.825
I've kept the bamboo message with me
after it was sealed.

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:28.705
I never let my guard down
and will never alter the message myself.

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:31.065
I know how meticulous you are,

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:32.465
but from the time you submitted

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:34.905
the bamboo message
to the time it reached His Majesty,

00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:36.065
someone might have tampered
with the message.

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.705
Deputy Director Xiao, what do we do now?

00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:40.385
Even if it was tampered with,

00:04:40.465 --> 00:04:42.105
it is nonetheless negligence on my part.

00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:43.065
If His Majesty finds out…

00:04:43.145 --> 00:04:46.665
The culprit did this because he was sure
that His Majesty would never doubt it.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.265
I will explain to His Majesty personally.

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:51.385
Go now.

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:54.545
Mr. Xiao.

00:04:57.065 --> 00:04:58.665
Gu, are you here for the Venus?

00:04:58.745 --> 00:04:59.945
Yes.

00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:00.905
His Majesty asked
the Court of Judicial Review

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:02.305
to investigate the source
of the nursery rhyme.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.225
It is a major event.

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:04.905
The appearance of Venus

00:05:04.985 --> 00:05:07.465
is only one of the possible outcomes
according to our calculations.

00:05:07.545 --> 00:05:09.425
It doesn't mean it will happen,
and it's pending verification.

00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:11.945
The stars are always changing.

00:05:12.025 --> 00:05:13.465
The bamboo message
delivered to His Majesty

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:15.025
omitted the other possibilities.

00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:17.785
The bamboo message was altered
by someone else after it was sent out

00:05:17.865 --> 00:05:19.225
from the Astronomical Bureau.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:21.425
The culprit has an agenda.

00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:26.545
But who is the intended victim here?

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.625
Gu.

00:05:30.345 --> 00:05:31.545
Please tell the County Princess

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.345
that these sudden cases

00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:36.025
and the nursery rhyme
do not come out of thin air.

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:38.865
Perhaps their goal isn't
to sabotage the Grand Festival,

00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:42.305
but to harm Consort Shu
under the guise of astronomy.

00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:43.385
Mr. Xiao,

00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:45.745
why can't you tell her yourself?

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:52.385
One is bound by the path of Heaven.

00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:54.705
The stars have their own trajectories.

00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:56.065
So do humans.

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:01.785
{\an8}ZICHEN HALL

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:07.905
Your Majesty,

00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:11.305
the appearance of Venus
is only one of the possible outcomes

00:06:11.385 --> 00:06:12.865
according to our calculations.

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:13.785
It doesn't mean it will happen.

00:06:14.425 --> 00:06:16.385
Even someone knowledgeable
like my master cannot predict it.

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:18.785
Please do not be worried about it.

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:20.865
Besides, the mortal affairs

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:23.305
are not determined by the movements
of astrological bodies.

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:25.145
They say

00:06:25.225 --> 00:06:27.785
when Venus appears during the day,
an Empress will rise.

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:28.825
I know that.

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:33.185
You once said
the stars would not wreak havoc,

00:06:33.265 --> 00:06:35.985
but people would use the stars
to create something out of nowhere.

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:39.025
My concerns are not confined
to the stars solely.

00:06:39.105 --> 00:06:42.585
The Hou beast dug out
recently in the Liuli Palace

00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:44.185
is an ominous sign too.

00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:48.185
The Hou beast is indeed
a mythological beast.

00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:49.665
But the discovery of an ancient artifact

00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:51.545
can be interpreted as a harbinger of doom

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:53.705
or a remnant from the previous dynasty.

00:06:57.345 --> 00:06:58.625
Many things have happened lately,

00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:00.465
and the Grand Festival
is around the corner.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.345
I do not want to see another accident.

00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:04.745
Yes.

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:42.985
Your Ladyship!

00:07:51.865 --> 00:07:53.025
Your Ladyship.

00:07:54.465 --> 00:07:55.665
Your Ladyship.

00:07:56.785 --> 00:07:59.065
The ladder has been oiled. It's slippery.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.865
I suppose that's why
the Assistant Director fell down.

00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:03.025
The ladder is in an odd spot.

00:08:03.105 --> 00:08:04.825
Where was the ladder originally?

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:08.625
Sir, the ladder
was in the corner over there.

00:08:08.705 --> 00:08:11.305
Somehow, someone moved it here.

00:08:11.905 --> 00:08:14.705
Many people walk past there.
It is a nuisance.

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:17.265
Someone deliberately put it here.

00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:19.585
Who knows how many people
have touched this ladder?

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.225
We won't be able
to identify who oiled it up.

00:08:21.305 --> 00:08:22.945
Just who is trying to sabotage
the Grand Festival?

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:25.585
Your Ladyship, are you aware

00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:27.505
of the nursery rhyme
that came from the city recently?

00:08:27.585 --> 00:08:29.945
"Five, four, three, two, one.
Fire, water, earth, wood, metal.

00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:31.465
As Venus soars above ground,

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.225
the divine beast's roar
silences the dragon.

00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:36.385
When Venus descends upon the palace,
the world will know true peace."

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:41.185
Is the Hou beast the divine beast
in the nursery rhyme?

00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:42.225
Yes.

00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:43.985
And not only that.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.505
The nursery rhyme
is accompanied by a rumor

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:50.065
that when Consort Shu was born,
Venus appeared during the day.

00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:51.185
And they say it will happen again.

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:55.025
So you're saying the nursery rhyme,
the rumor, and the Hou beast

00:08:55.105 --> 00:08:57.185
aren't trying to sabotage
the Grand Festival,

00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:58.105
but Consort Shu.

00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:11.345
Assistant Director. You're awake.

00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:14.145
But you're heavily injured.
Why are you here?

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:16.185
That's right.
Your health is more important.

00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:19.985
I almost committed a grave error
due to my negligence.

00:09:21.105 --> 00:09:25.065
I must supervise the project personally
to make sure nothing can go wrong.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:26.985
Besides,

00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:30.305
the one who tried
to harm me is still here.

00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:32.225
I can't let him get away.

00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:34.385
Continue.

00:09:35.905 --> 00:09:36.945
Why did you stop?

00:09:41.825 --> 00:09:43.025
Assistant Director, you're awake.

00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:47.825
But you should go back and recuperate.

00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:49.425
It's you!

00:09:50.385 --> 00:09:52.225
You misled me by saying
the Hou beast was a dragon.

00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:55.665
You wanted to kill me
to usurp my position.

00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:58.105
Assistant Director, why would you say so?

00:09:58.185 --> 00:10:00.945
I found the statue first.

00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:04.025
I thought we should dig it up first
before we tell His Majesty.

00:10:04.105 --> 00:10:05.945
But you were eager to take credit

00:10:06.025 --> 00:10:08.265
and decided to inform His Majesty
before we excavated the whole thing.

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:11.025
How could you blame me
and even frame me for that?

00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:12.825
You're denying it.

00:10:13.585 --> 00:10:15.785
I've seen through you
for a long time already.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:16.945
This isn't recent.

00:10:17.025 --> 00:10:18.025
You…

00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:20.185
Given your state of injuries,
I will let this slide.

00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:23.465
Remember the Flower on the Wall?
Your craftiness backfired on you.

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:25.705
This time, instead of learning
from your past mistakes,

00:10:25.785 --> 00:10:28.545
you were keen to impress
His Majesty to earn his favor.

00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:30.265
That is why you end up in this situation.

00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:31.665
His Majesty knows
that you are heavily injured,

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:32.905
so he decided not to punish you yet.

00:10:32.985 --> 00:10:36.865
Instead of repenting,
you came here yelling and framing me.

00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:41.265
You… You… I'll kill you!

00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:43.705
- I…
- Calm down.

00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:44.985
Calm down.

00:10:45.065 --> 00:10:47.185
- Let go of me.
- See if he has the guts to hit me.

00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:49.025
Calm down. Calm down, Assistant Director.

00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:24.465
{\an8}IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO TRIED TO KILL YOU

00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:26.305
{\an8}MEET ME AT LIULI PALACE EAST GARDEN
TONIGHT, AT THE HOUR OF CHOU

00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:58.345
LIULI PALACE

00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:00.665
Dirty tricks.

00:12:02.105 --> 00:12:03.305
He used sand to blind me.

00:12:07.545 --> 00:12:10.145
YU SHISHUN

00:12:10.785 --> 00:12:11.665
Yu Shishun.

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:13.105
I knew it was you.

00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:19.265
We already locked Yu Shishun up.
He refused to answer our questions.

00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:20.585
Mr. Xiao,

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:23.305
how did you figure out
that Yu Shishun is the culprit?

00:12:24.665 --> 00:12:27.385
I wasn't very certain either.
It was just my speculation.

00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:30.145
Initially, I assumed Lisheng
died from the iron caltrops

00:12:30.225 --> 00:12:31.585
because iron caltrops were used.

00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:33.665
But as I ruminate over the nursery rhyme,

00:12:33.745 --> 00:12:35.545
I realized the fire
was the key to the puzzle.

00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:37.345
The culprit must be present at the scene

00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:39.145
and is aware of the palace's layout.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:40.945
He can come and go
without raising suspicion

00:12:41.025 --> 00:12:42.465
and is probably preparing
the Grand Festival.

00:12:42.545 --> 00:12:44.865
But that doesn't mean it's Yu Shishun.

00:12:45.425 --> 00:12:47.985
The craftsmen, palace maids, musicians.
There are a lot of people.

00:12:48.065 --> 00:12:49.345
That's why I asked you

00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:51.625
to disguise as Shen Chuan tonight
and attend the rendezvous.

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:53.465
I want to lure out the culprit
to confirm my speculation.

00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:54.865
Speculation?

00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:56.105
The time.

00:12:57.585 --> 00:13:00.465
That's right. I've always had a theory.

00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:04.105
I believe the culprit is obsessed
with the five stars

00:13:04.185 --> 00:13:05.705
and the five elements.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.545
The two previous cases have
matching elements and stars' positions.

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:11.225
It wasn't until tonight's incident
that I can say for certain

00:13:11.305 --> 00:13:12.385
that not only is the culprit obsessed

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:13.625
with the five elements
and the stars' position,

00:13:13.705 --> 00:13:15.785
the time of his criminal activity
is related to the five elements too.

00:13:16.385 --> 00:13:17.985
- The hour of Chou.
- That's right.

00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:20.865
Lisheng died at the hour of Si,
matching the fire element.

00:13:20.945 --> 00:13:23.145
Su Zhuo'er died at the hour of Zi,
matching the water element.

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:25.465
Shen Chuan fell down at the hour of Wei.

00:13:25.545 --> 00:13:27.505
But the culprit
didn't expect him to survive.

00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:30.865
So we had Shen Chuan make a scene
in the Liuli Palace.

00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:32.585
And indeed, the culprit picked

00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:34.345
the hour of Chou, matching
the earth element, to commit his crime.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:37.185
The culprit is knowledgeable
about the stars and the five elements.

00:13:37.265 --> 00:13:38.185
He is obsessed with time

00:13:38.265 --> 00:13:40.105
and is someone
who can come and go with ease

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:41.545
as we prepare for the Grand Festival.

00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:43.505
The Imperial Time Logger
in charge of the water clock

00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:44.425
is the most suspicious.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:46.625
An Imperial Time Logger
isn't that powerful.

00:13:47.425 --> 00:13:48.785
That means he has a mastermind.

00:13:49.825 --> 00:13:52.305
Yu Shishun has served
longer than I have in the bureau.

00:13:52.385 --> 00:13:53.585
He slowly climbed from the position
of a water-clock apprentice.

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:56.705
It's not far-fetched to assume
that he might collude with someone

00:13:56.785 --> 00:13:57.665
whom I do not know.

00:13:58.825 --> 00:14:01.265
Your Ladyship,
Yu Shishun pleaded for leniency.

00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:02.825
He said if Your Ladyship
could save his family,

00:14:02.905 --> 00:14:04.345
he would confess everything.

00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:07.665
Your Ladyship.

00:14:08.825 --> 00:14:09.665
Your Ladyship.

00:14:10.665 --> 00:14:13.505
Your Ladyship. Please save my family.

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:16.425
Celestial Lord said tonight

00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:17.945
was my last chance.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:19.985
- Celestial Lord? Who?
- Celestial Lord…

00:14:21.785 --> 00:14:24.865
My house is at Chongren Ward,
Southwest Corner, Jia Alley, Chen Lot.

00:14:25.785 --> 00:14:28.305
Chongren Ward, Southwest Corner,
Jia Alley, Chen Lot.

00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:30.945
Your Ladyship!
Your Ladyship, save my family!

00:14:31.025 --> 00:14:31.985
Your Ladyship!

00:14:32.065 --> 00:14:34.705
YU'S MANSION

00:14:39.905 --> 00:14:41.105
We're too late.

00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:51.185
They are dead.

00:14:52.105 --> 00:14:52.945
What happened here?

00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:55.745
Be careful. The culprit
might still be here.

00:14:56.345 --> 00:14:57.345
He has killed so many people.

00:14:57.425 --> 00:14:58.665
If we interrogate him,
he'll give in easily.

00:14:58.745 --> 00:15:00.425
I'll search the ward with my men.

00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:01.665
- Follow me.
- Yes.

00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:04.385
Follow me.

00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:12.905
Five, four, three, two, one

00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:20.865
Fire, water, earth, wood, metal

00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:32.185
YU LAN'ER, YU'S SON

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:37.505
As Venus soars above ground

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:43.825
The divine beast's roars
Silences the dragon

00:15:43.905 --> 00:15:49.865
When Venus descends upon the palace

00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:55.145
The world will know true peace

00:15:58.145 --> 00:15:58.985
Your Ladyship,

00:15:59.705 --> 00:16:00.825
in addition to the three servants
by the door,

00:16:00.905 --> 00:16:02.745
Yu Shishun's wife, parents,

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:04.985
and two other maids are all dead.

00:16:07.745 --> 00:16:09.265
Bring this child back
to the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:16:09.345 --> 00:16:10.345
Ask Yudi to examine him.

00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:11.585
Yes.

00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:35.465
- Celestial Lord.
- Celestial Lord.

00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:57.585
Have some tea, Celestial Lord.

00:17:25.505 --> 00:17:27.385
- Mercy, Celestial Lord.
- Mercy, Celestial Lord.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:34.025
Did you find anything,
Deputy Director Xiao?

00:17:34.785 --> 00:17:36.425
The water is still warm. He has just left.

00:17:36.505 --> 00:17:37.945
It's curfew now.

00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:39.105
So he probably is still in Chongren Ward.

00:17:39.185 --> 00:17:40.025
What does he look like?

00:17:41.105 --> 00:17:42.785
Tall. He can fight.

00:17:43.985 --> 00:17:44.825
He's in white.

00:17:46.945 --> 00:17:49.145
But he probably has changed his robe.

00:17:50.185 --> 00:17:51.905
He's not thin. From an ordinary household.

00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:10.265
There isn't much information.
Identifying him will be difficult.

00:18:11.105 --> 00:18:12.145
All right.

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.865
I'll inform Prosecutor Gu right away.

00:18:25.145 --> 00:18:27.505
They died recently.
The culprit is probably nearby.

00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:30.465
Your Ladyship, Deputy Director Xiao
said the same thing too.

00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:31.785
I am heading to Prosecutor Gu now.

00:18:32.385 --> 00:18:34.825
They died from a needle that pierced
through the back of their brain.

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:37.105
The culprit is therefore a martial artist,
and a strong one at that.

00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:39.625
You there, follow Ma Xiaoran and assist
Prosecutor Gu in locating the culprit.

00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:40.865
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:18:43.505 --> 00:18:45.705
Your Ladyship.
The victim here is different.

00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:49.025
Everyone else died from the needle
that pierced their brain.

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:51.585
But this one died to a blade.

00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:54.625
Oily fingers.

00:18:54.705 --> 00:18:55.945
Alcoholic stench.

00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:57.745
Facing the courtyard.

00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:00.465
He snuck out at night to drink.

00:19:01.065 --> 00:19:03.345
And when he came back,
he bumped into the culprit.

00:19:03.425 --> 00:19:06.025
Before he could run away,
a blade took his life.

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:09.385
The culprit killed the witness
yet spared the child.

00:19:10.865 --> 00:19:13.065
He wanted the child
to sing the nursery rhyme.

00:19:13.145 --> 00:19:15.225
But what if the child manages
to describe his appearance?

00:19:17.425 --> 00:19:19.745
Or could this be a deliberate act?

00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:30.665
The child is young.

00:19:30.745 --> 00:19:32.545
He might not be able
to describe everything.

00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:34.225
Many plants here are burned too,

00:19:34.305 --> 00:19:36.665
creating smoke that obscured his face.

00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:47.185
There is also a small amount
of black powder.

00:19:53.465 --> 00:19:54.785
Shell of a flash bomb.

00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:57.425
No ordinary family
will burn plants to create smoke.

00:19:57.505 --> 00:19:58.345
The culprit probably did this.

00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:00.905
Yu Shishun called him the Celestial Lord.

00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:04.905
He probably used this to scare others.

00:20:04.985 --> 00:20:09.985
PALACE INVESTIGATION BUREAU

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:23.705
There, there.

00:20:25.665 --> 00:20:26.985
What is your name?

00:20:30.345 --> 00:20:31.625
Yu… Yu Lan'er.

00:20:31.705 --> 00:20:33.945
What did you see last night?

00:20:37.905 --> 00:20:38.745
Don't cry.

00:20:45.865 --> 00:20:48.545
What does your family murderer look like?

00:20:51.865 --> 00:20:52.705
Your Ladyship,

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:55.185
you can't ask a child questions like that.

00:20:55.825 --> 00:20:56.665
What do I do then?

00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:18.225
Really?

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:19.985
You're not bluffing, are you?

00:21:20.585 --> 00:21:23.985
I'm not. I did see a deity.

00:21:28.945 --> 00:21:31.345
When I was playing
hide and seek with Wang Ahu,

00:21:32.065 --> 00:21:33.705
I hid inside the rice barrel.

00:21:35.705 --> 00:21:38.185
But he's so dumb.

00:21:38.265 --> 00:21:42.145
He couldn't find me.
I fell asleep accidentally.

00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:43.505
Later,

00:21:44.145 --> 00:21:46.745
there was thunder and lightning.

00:21:46.825 --> 00:21:48.425
It woke me up.

00:21:48.945 --> 00:21:51.785
When I came out, it was already dark.

00:21:52.385 --> 00:21:54.505
Mother and Madam Wang weren't there.

00:21:54.585 --> 00:21:55.945
I was hungry.

00:21:56.025 --> 00:21:57.265
Mercy, Celestial Lord.

00:21:57.345 --> 00:21:58.905
- Mercy.
- Mercy, Celestial Lord.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.985
I heard Grandfather
saying, "Celestial Lord".

00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:03.465
Father always told me
about the Celestial Lord.

00:22:03.545 --> 00:22:06.825
He said Celestial Lord was a deity
who could do anything.

00:22:07.585 --> 00:22:09.865
I wanted to see what he looked like.

00:22:09.945 --> 00:22:12.945
The deity was so powerful.

00:22:13.025 --> 00:22:14.625
He walked on mist.

00:22:25.065 --> 00:22:26.385
Did you see everything?

00:22:28.705 --> 00:22:30.105
Why didn't you run?

00:22:30.705 --> 00:22:31.665
I…

00:22:31.745 --> 00:22:34.145
I want to learn techniques from you.

00:22:37.585 --> 00:22:41.105
Sure. Let me teach you the chant.

00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:42.705
Remember it well.

00:22:43.465 --> 00:22:45.025
I'll only say it once.

00:22:46.585 --> 00:22:49.825
Five, four, three, two, one

00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:53.185
Fire, water, earth, wood, metal

00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:56.065
Five, four, three, two, one

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:58.945
Fire, water, earth, wood, metal

00:22:59.705 --> 00:23:02.505
As Venus soars above ground

00:23:02.585 --> 00:23:05.985
The divine beast's roars
Silences the dragon

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:09.545
As Venus soars above ground

00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:13.265
The divine beast's roars
Silences the dragon

00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:22.585
What's with the smoke?

00:23:23.345 --> 00:23:24.425
Where are they?

00:23:25.225 --> 00:23:26.305
Don't tell me there's another fire.

00:23:37.545 --> 00:23:39.305
A murder. A murder!

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:40.665
A murder! A murder!

00:23:54.425 --> 00:23:56.265
And lastly.

00:23:57.025 --> 00:23:59.705
When Venus descends upon the palace

00:23:59.785 --> 00:24:02.985
The world will know true peace

00:24:06.185 --> 00:24:07.025
Repeat it.

00:24:07.945 --> 00:24:12.985
When Venus descends upon the palace

00:24:13.665 --> 00:24:17.505
The world will know true peace

00:24:20.305 --> 00:24:22.945
Remember it well. Do not forget.

00:24:23.025 --> 00:24:24.545
If you forget it,

00:24:25.665 --> 00:24:27.665
you'll end up like them.

00:24:41.145 --> 00:24:44.305
So, the Celestial Lord killed them.

00:24:44.905 --> 00:24:48.505
Then, he turned into stars and vanished.

00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:52.585
He turned into stars and vanished?

00:24:58.905 --> 00:25:00.065
Mother is dead.

00:25:00.865 --> 00:25:01.785
Grandfather is dead.

00:25:02.305 --> 00:25:03.865
Grandmother is dead.

00:25:06.745 --> 00:25:08.545
He has said enough.

00:25:09.225 --> 00:25:11.185
Let him rest. Take good care of him.

00:25:22.425 --> 00:25:23.385
Your Ladyship,

00:25:23.985 --> 00:25:25.785
he is the only person
who has seen the Celestial Lord.

00:25:25.865 --> 00:25:27.385
The more he recalls,

00:25:27.465 --> 00:25:29.225
the more likely we are
to find the culprit.

00:25:30.105 --> 00:25:31.905
But the more he recalls,

00:25:32.425 --> 00:25:34.145
the more pain he'll suffer.

00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:35.905
I'm sorry.

00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:38.345
Did it remind you of your past?

00:25:40.905 --> 00:25:42.225
No, it's on me.

00:25:43.465 --> 00:25:45.265
If I had been more thorough,

00:25:45.945 --> 00:25:47.865
Yu Shishun's family
wouldn't have been dead.

00:25:48.945 --> 00:25:50.665
He wouldn't have had to go through this.

00:25:51.865 --> 00:25:53.305
Now, he's like me.

00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:57.265
He will live through
this nightmare forever.

00:25:57.345 --> 00:25:58.505
That's not true.

00:25:59.825 --> 00:26:00.745
Boss,

00:26:01.265 --> 00:26:03.225
what happened 15 years ago
wasn't your fault.

00:26:03.305 --> 00:26:05.745
The death of the Yu family
isn't your fault either.

00:26:14.945 --> 00:26:16.025
Thank you.

00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:21.345
Then, let's find the culprit.

00:26:22.985 --> 00:26:24.425
- Let's go.
- Where to?

00:26:25.585 --> 00:26:28.625
Yu Lan'er isn't the only one
who saw the Celestial Lord.

00:26:28.705 --> 00:26:29.745
His father saw him too.

00:26:43.105 --> 00:26:45.105
I searched everywhere in Chongren Ward

00:26:45.825 --> 00:26:46.905
and asked everything I could.

00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:49.745
No one saw the Celestial Lord.

00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:54.345
Did he truly turn into a star
and fly away like the child said he did?

00:27:08.425 --> 00:27:11.585
The culprit put in a lot of effort
for his spectacle.

00:27:11.665 --> 00:27:12.865
But it's not difficult.

00:27:14.465 --> 00:27:16.865
Place some plants around the courtyard.

00:27:16.945 --> 00:27:19.545
Put a candle on that table.

00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:23.345
Hang a copper mirror over there.

00:27:24.065 --> 00:27:25.505
Quick. Get it done.

00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:26.505
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:27:27.225 --> 00:27:28.865
He must have done something

00:27:28.945 --> 00:27:31.185
to convince Yu Shishun's family
that he is the Celestial Lord

00:27:31.265 --> 00:27:32.625
and made them fear him.

00:27:33.145 --> 00:27:34.225
That way,

00:27:34.945 --> 00:27:37.905
it's not difficult for him
to burn some plants

00:27:37.985 --> 00:27:39.385
and have a copper mirror hung.

00:27:39.465 --> 00:27:41.745
He can just say that it's all

00:27:42.345 --> 00:27:44.385
to dispel evil spirits.

00:28:12.305 --> 00:28:14.465
And that's not difficult?

00:28:14.545 --> 00:28:17.505
If an adult sees this,
the cover will be blown.

00:28:18.025 --> 00:28:20.465
But he picked a traumatized child
as his witness.

00:28:20.545 --> 00:28:22.785
That will establish his identity
as the Celestial Lord easily.

00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:25.225
But Chongren Ward
is mostly occupied by officials,

00:28:25.305 --> 00:28:26.225
not citizens.

00:28:26.865 --> 00:28:29.265
If someone is staying here,
others will notice.

00:28:29.345 --> 00:28:31.385
But I searched the whole night

00:28:31.465 --> 00:28:33.105
and even asked every household here.

00:28:33.185 --> 00:28:34.465
No one saw any suspicious person.

00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:36.305
What if he lives in the ward?

00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:40.185
Right.

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:42.465
No ordinary person can spread

00:28:42.545 --> 00:28:44.465
a nursery rhyme like this.

00:28:45.065 --> 00:28:47.825
But that only makes it
more difficult to investigate.

00:28:48.545 --> 00:28:49.465
Unless we have a portrait.

00:28:49.985 --> 00:28:53.465
But among the ones
who saw him, one is too young.

00:28:54.825 --> 00:28:55.785
And one is…

00:29:11.265 --> 00:29:12.705
Stay away!

00:29:12.785 --> 00:29:14.265
I don't know anything.

00:29:14.345 --> 00:29:16.945
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything.

00:29:17.025 --> 00:29:19.105
- He's like this after the hour of Chou.
- I don't know anything.

00:29:19.185 --> 00:29:20.185
Yu Shishun.

00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:23.185
Tell me who the Celestial Lord is
and I'll avenge your family.

00:29:24.105 --> 00:29:25.065
Avenge?

00:29:25.945 --> 00:29:26.825
Avenge?

00:29:29.625 --> 00:29:33.305
The Celestial Lord will kill you and me.

00:29:33.385 --> 00:29:34.945
You're safe here.

00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:37.345
He can't kill you or find you.

00:29:38.625 --> 00:29:40.065
You don't know him.

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:43.225
Wherever I go, he always finds me.

00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:44.945
It's been 15 years!

00:29:45.025 --> 00:29:47.105
And he still found me.

00:29:47.985 --> 00:29:48.825
Why is he looking for you?

00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:52.265
- I did a bad thing.
- What bad thing?

00:29:52.345 --> 00:29:55.265
I… I…

00:29:58.905 --> 00:30:01.065
- Do you recognize this?
- Lan'er.

00:30:02.145 --> 00:30:03.025
Lan'er!

00:30:03.105 --> 00:30:05.465
- Lan'er!
- If you want him to live,

00:30:05.545 --> 00:30:07.945
tell me what you did.

00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:10.385
No, I won't tell you.

00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:12.105
I can't. Or I'll die.

00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:14.945
Tell me, and I'll let you see your son.

00:30:15.545 --> 00:30:18.545
If not, you'll see your child
in the afterlife.

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:19.705
I can't tell you.

00:30:20.225 --> 00:30:22.945
I can't tell you, or I'll die.

00:30:23.745 --> 00:30:25.985
County Princess, if you interrogate him
further, he'll die for real.

00:30:26.585 --> 00:30:28.385
County Princess? County…

00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:31.825
You are the County Princess?

00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.985
You are Li Peiyi?

00:30:35.065 --> 00:30:36.905
You are Li Peiyi?

00:30:37.785 --> 00:30:39.105
You are working with him!

00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:40.825
What are you on about?

00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:43.225
You want to kill me.

00:30:45.705 --> 00:30:46.665
You want to kill me.

00:30:46.745 --> 00:30:50.105
Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Please.

00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:53.505
Don't kill me. Don't kill me…

00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:57.505
What do we do now?

00:30:59.105 --> 00:30:59.945
He's still alive.

00:31:07.305 --> 00:31:08.225
Where is the child?

00:31:08.305 --> 00:31:09.665
In the rear court.

00:31:15.145 --> 00:31:17.705
Die. Die. Die.

00:31:17.785 --> 00:31:18.745
Die.

00:31:19.345 --> 00:31:20.905
Die. Die.

00:31:22.225 --> 00:31:23.865
Lan'er. What are you doing?

00:31:24.545 --> 00:31:28.345
I want to kill the Celestial Lord
to avenge my family.

00:31:46.945 --> 00:31:49.025
That smell won't scare me anymore.

00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:51.265
It'll be the taste of my revenge!

00:31:51.345 --> 00:31:53.785
But I'm afraid you'll have new nightmares.

00:31:53.865 --> 00:31:55.745
I'm afraid he'll drag you down to hell.

00:31:56.425 --> 00:31:57.865
Why wouldn't you let me kill him?

00:31:59.025 --> 00:31:59.865
Why?

00:32:01.145 --> 00:32:03.585
I don't want you to live
with the pain of killing.

00:32:04.465 --> 00:32:06.025
You're not a monster

00:32:06.745 --> 00:32:09.505
who can kill and still sleep at night.

00:32:20.585 --> 00:32:21.425
Lan'er.

00:32:21.505 --> 00:32:24.705
Killing isn't the only way
to have your vengeance.

00:32:24.785 --> 00:32:28.265
I will find the killer
and make sure he is punished.

00:32:28.345 --> 00:32:29.545
And you

00:32:30.145 --> 00:32:33.305
shouldn't see vengeance
as your life purpose.

00:32:33.905 --> 00:32:35.745
But he killed my mother.

00:32:36.465 --> 00:32:38.025
And I don't know where my father is.

00:32:39.065 --> 00:32:40.385
I'm all

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.905
that's left.

00:32:45.425 --> 00:32:47.785
But if you fill your life with vengeance,

00:32:48.385 --> 00:32:50.185
you will hurt those who love you.

00:32:53.945 --> 00:32:55.465
Look at your small hands.

00:32:55.545 --> 00:32:58.225
If you grab the dagger of vengeance,

00:32:58.945 --> 00:33:00.705
there will be no room left for the one
who loves you to hold your hands.

00:33:04.265 --> 00:33:06.865
There was a vendetta in me
for 15 years too.

00:33:08.025 --> 00:33:10.505
When I finally could kill the killer,

00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:12.905
someone stopped me.

00:33:12.985 --> 00:33:15.025
I resented him,

00:33:15.105 --> 00:33:16.225
blamed him,

00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:18.465
and even hated him.

00:33:20.585 --> 00:33:21.905
But looking at you now,

00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:24.625
I understand why he did what he did.

00:33:26.545 --> 00:33:27.465
Lan'er.

00:33:27.545 --> 00:33:29.505
Do not let hatred consume you.

00:33:30.185 --> 00:33:32.785
Do not let your enemy ruin your life.

00:33:32.865 --> 00:33:34.505
What should I do then?

00:33:36.145 --> 00:33:38.385
Can you describe
the Celestial Lord's appearance to us?

00:33:38.465 --> 00:33:41.025
I can avenge you without the dagger.

00:33:44.945 --> 00:33:45.985
Let's go.
