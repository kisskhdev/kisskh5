00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.859
Ministers, I've received

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.539
word of unrest beyond our borders.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.260
I've decided to reinforce the frontier.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.900
Sun Gong, Minister of War,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.379
you're currently
overseeing treasury allocations.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.259
Release fifty million
taels of silver at once

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.939
to purchase arms and warhorses,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.379
and reinforce the frontier.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.899
Your Majesty, this matter

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.099
is of great importance.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.259
It must not be taken lightly.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.699
Whether there is truly unrest

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.219
is still unclear.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.539
Yet Your Majesty now proposes

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.299
to spend tens of millions of taels

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.539
raising troops and horses,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.939
without even an imperial edict.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.980
Isn't that somewhat rash?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.340
My verbal decree is
itself an imperial edict.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.340
Do my ministers
think I am being frivolous?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.700
I don't find it frivolous at all.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.579
Not only should troops
be sent to the frontier,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.299
the imperial guards within the capital

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.579
should also be redeployed.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.819
Your Highness,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.379
with all due respect,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.339
but if you continue
to indulge His Majesty,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.779
it may bring unrest upon the realm.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.900
Sun Gong,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.100
within this court,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.139
even if His Majesty stood
beside the late emperor,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.179
they would be ruler
and subject before father and son.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.300
Sun Gong,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.580
do you understand?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.620
Your Highness, forgive me.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.779
Your Majesty, forgive me.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.299
But I need an imperial edict

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.419
to relay orders
through the chain of command.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.779
Without a written edict,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.619
it can't be carried out at every level.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.819
The situation is urgent.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.459
Have the Directorate
of Ceremonial draft the edict at once.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.939
The Directorate should indeed
draft an edict for Your Majesty.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.859
However,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.499
I do believe

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.660
that Minister Sun makes a valid point.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.660
Your Majesty should reconsider.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.019
This matter is extremely urgent.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.460
What is there to reconsider?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.220
Let the Directorate

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.580
draft the edict at once.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.539
The Directorate will certainly do
all it can to assist Your Majesty.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.660
It's just that...

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.099
the edict requires the Directorate's
seal before it can be enforced.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.699
With layers of review,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.259
it may take some time.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.300
Your Majesty, please wait a few days.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.540
Fine.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.900
Then we'll do as you say, Jia Yi.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.339
After all, my role as the Emperor

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.060
is nothing but a game.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.420
We might as well watch the dancing.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.380
Gentlemen,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.620
you are dismissed.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.886
What happened today was far too obvious.

00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:40.767
The Grand Princess will grow suspicious.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.460
We can't worry about that now.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.403
Chu Wuju rarely
goes along with Chu Ying.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.474
Yet today, she not only
agreed to his absurd request,

00:03:50.475 --> 00:03:52.875
she even wants to send
her guards beyond the pass.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.140
I'm afraid she has other motives.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.940
Whatever her intentions,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.660
we'll move faster.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.180
End this quickly.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.259
In half a month,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.859
the foreign forces will arrive.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.819
I'll personally
lead troops to the frontier

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.059
and let them in.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.899
A unit of imperial guards
within the capital

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.339
was once part of the Xiao Army.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.659
They'll answer to you, Uncle,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.339
and swear loyalty unto death.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.139
We'll strike from within and without

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.580
and wipe out the entire Chu dynasty.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.419
If war breaks out

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.459
at the frontier,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.339
Father and Mother...

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340
Silence!

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.139
I'm your elder brother.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.940
And he is your uncle.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.420
Xiao Man.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.499
If I hadn't stopped you by force today,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.420
would you have sided
with that young emperor?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.500
Take this.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.860
Come to me
every three days for the antidote.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.660
Your brother and I
have already taken it.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.140
I pitied you for being young.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.220
But now, you are already an adult.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.420
Swallow it.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.259
War is approaching.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.220
There is no room for your hesitation.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.899
Don't let your childish
affections ruin the revenge

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.020
I've planned for over a decade.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.660
I have a task for you.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.460
Go to the Imperial Study.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.019
Steal the roster of the officials

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.140
who fanned the flames
of the Zhen clan's wrongful case.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.980
When we make our move,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.619
I want them to taste

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.980
what it means
to lose their families and homes.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.860
Perhaps Father and Mother
wouldn't have wanted this.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.179
They were kind people.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.580
They would never wish
to implicate the innocent.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.979
If their spirits watch from above,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.299
they'd want you
to let go of your hatred, Uncle.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.539
And find some happiness.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.660
Uncle...

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.939
War is fast approaching.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.380
Put away
that soft-hearted mercy of yours.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.340
People like us...

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.019
have no right to kindness.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.420
And even less right to happiness!

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.860
Since we've already come this far,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.579
even if I'm bound
for the depths of hell,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.300
I'll drag them down with me!

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.540
For the sake of vengeance,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.619
I cast aside life and death long ago.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.740
Let alone

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.540
those strangers who mean nothing to me.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.980
Mu Jun.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.380
Mu Yu.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.060
Don't forget

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.380
why I raised the two of you.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.259
Your parents were such good people.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.340
How can you bear
to let them die in vain?

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.340
Xiao Man,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.580
don't resent me.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.380
This isn't what I wanted either.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.460
(I don't hate you, Uncle.)

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.340
(I don't hate you, Uncle.)

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.899
(Yangxin Hall)

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.020
Your Majesty.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.379
After court was dismissed,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.060
Sun Gong and Jia Yi met again
in the private chamber at Yanbo Parlor.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.020
Where's Xiao Man?

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.300
He was there too.

00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:51.745
(Yangxin Hall)

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.299
Are you hurt?

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.140
Here.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.979
I only meant to kick the door open.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.620
I didn't know you were behind it.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.899
I am unharmed.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.460
Thank you for your concern.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.940
I didn't see you just now.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.740
I shouldn't have
entered the Imperial Study.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.580
I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

00:09:24.562 --> 00:09:27.770
(Yangxin Hall)

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.980
(Do you trust me?)

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.540
(I trust you.)

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.060
(Xiao Man,)

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.579
(out of the entire world,)

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.260
(the only person I trust)

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.860
(is you.)

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.619
Eunuch Xiao Man,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.500
His Majesty summons you.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.820
(Xiao Man,)

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.740
(I'm deeply troubled.)

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.900
(I can clearly feel your sincerity,)

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.780
(but you're also helping Jia Yi
in his plot to seize power.)

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.660
(What are you really thinking?)

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.780
Serve the meal.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.660
Your Majesty,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.860
please dine.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.420
(Does it hurt?)

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.940
(I never meant to hurt you.)

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.940
(But what were you doing
in the Imperial Study?)

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.460
(What are you trying to do?)

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.580
(You owe me an explanation.)

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.900
(Are you not
the same person I once knew?)

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.220
(I don't even know how to face you now.)

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.340
Your Majesty, please dine.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.260
Take it away.
