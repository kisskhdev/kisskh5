WEBVTT

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.200
You're really not going back to work?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.439
My mind is made up.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.520
A professor once told me,

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.960
cultivating new domestic varieties matters more than money.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.560
You don't need to eat?

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:46.280
Actually,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.000
my house was demolished.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.920
Seriously?

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:52.920
You're a rich lady!

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.799
You really are!

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.520
Since you're staying, let's get to work.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:58.280
Okay.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.039
The first batch of materials arrives in two days.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.280
Our experiment

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.479
is about to enter the next phase.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.679
Let's do this.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:04.560
Let's just get it done.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.920
Anyway, my mom resigned.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.040
She's dedicated herself to research.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:10.400
As long as she stays as far from that Wanxiang as possible.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.560
We got away with it this time.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.599
But what about next time?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.799
There will be a day we can't hide it.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:17.680
You have to be mentally prepared.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.959
I'll hide it as long as I can.

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.840
What else can I do?

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.079
Someone's coming.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.680
Wait a second.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:31.480
Hello. Who is it?

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.920
Hello, Kong Xiaocan.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.280
I am the boss of Wanxiang Denong, Ma Jianfei.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.000
We might not be very familiar.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.560
But with my right-hand man...

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.959
...A Fu, you must be familiar.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.680
Yes.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.159
Why do you look a bit familiar to me?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.719
The sharing session last time?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.159
It wasn't that time.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.480
I really didn't see you last time.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.480
That shouldn't be.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.159
I'm at the Northeast branch all year round.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.079
I just got transferred back.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.680
You... you are here to...

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:58.879
Did something happen to me again?

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.599
No, no, no.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120
I came for a good thing this time.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:01.920
A good thing?

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.079
Is Ms. Kong Guifang here?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.400
Xiaocan.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.560
Xiaocan.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.599
Xu Rui, stop my mom.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.520
Don't let her come home.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.080
An alien has come to our house.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.520
Is there something you need with my mom?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.360
I came mainly to thank you.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.439
For giving our...

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.360
...Life Energy Exchange business...

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.280
...your strong support.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.120
It's nothing.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.400
After your sharing session last time...

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.159
...our sales just shot up.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.360
I was wondering if good things could come in pairs.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.120
I'll find a pair of spokespersons.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.560
You and your mother together.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.319
Do a sharing session.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.280
My sales would...

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.800
Right?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.199
I can even give you a commission.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.800
That doesn't seem possible.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.680
My mom has devoted herself to scientific research lately.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:44.639
She's super busy every day.

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.479
Even I can't see her.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.240
But I appreciate the good intentions.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.680
I'll accept these flowers on her behalf too.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.840
I'll convey your message to her.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.599
I also thank you on her behalf.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.680
And you must be quite busy too.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.360
You have so much Life Energy Exchange in a day.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.840
You should get busy.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.680
Busy, yes, busy.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.199
Actually, I'm not busy.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
I came today with sincerity.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.159
I want to talk face-to-face.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.879
I can wait.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.199
But some people aren't available just because you wait.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.719
Sorry.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.639
If you're not busy, I am.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.360
You should hurry and...

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.199
...hurry back to the Northeast branch.

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.759
They need you to take charge there.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.280
The Northeast branch already has people arranged.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.680
Why don't you make a call?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.120
I can talk to her on the phone too.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.000
She's doing research right now.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:24.039
She won't answer the phone.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.000
Sorry, right now I...

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:26.439
I'm busy cooking.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.639
I have things to do tonight, right?

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:28.639
What are the odds?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.280
I came to Earth for just two things.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.159
One is to take a bath.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.199
The second is to eat.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.439
Since you've already prepared it...

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.000
I'll have a bite.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.759
No, wait, why are you so...

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.000
Aliens really have no boundaries.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.680
This is the new variety we developed...

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.319
...a while ago that just hit the market.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.360
It's very sweet.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.680
Everyone take two bags home to taste.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.240
Okay.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.960
Thank you, Professor Wang.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.240
Thank you, Professor Wang.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.039
You're welcome.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.439
Don't forget your bags.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.479
Alright.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:52.080
Alright.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.840
What's wrong?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.199
Where's Guifang?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.360
She just left.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.840
Uncle Sun

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.800
Can you give my classmate a ride?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.680
Of course.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.159
Guifang

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.240
Don't take the bus with all that stuff.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.480
Let me give you a lift.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.680
Okay, thanks.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.759
Xu Rui, how's it going?

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:25.360
Did you stop her?

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:26.079
I couldn't stop her.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.800
She got in Wei Mingtian's car.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.959
Make the alien leave, quick.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.600
Then what do I do?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.079
He won't leave.

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.920
He... he can...

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.759
Anywhere Door.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.199
Then he can come out of every door.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.959
Remember when A Fu was in Hainan,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.399
only closed doors could be used?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.079
You're so smart, Xu Rui.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.480
Okay, okay, I'm looking.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.120
Sorry to trouble you, Secretary Sun.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160
Thank you for today, Secretary Sun.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.199
Don't mention it. It's on the way.

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.639
This road is usually jammed for twenty minutes.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.720
It's actually quite smooth today.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.480
Yeah.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.439
Bye-bye.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.040
Is it heavy?

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560
It's fine, it's fine. Let me take it.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.000
It's okay.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.519
Kong Xiaocan, did you handle it?

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:29.600
It's dinnertime.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.759
Everyone's cooking. Smells good.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.519
Are you hungry?

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.639
I'm hungry.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.720
Then let's go up and eat.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.399
Xiaocan should be cooking at home.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.199
Sure.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.879
Let's go.

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.079
What are you doing here?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.399
It's so strange. It's so strange.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:50.839
Why is every door in Xiaocan's house

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:51.879
impossible for me to open?

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.160
I must stop her.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.160
I must stop...

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.439
Kong Guifang from meeting my boss.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.279
Otherwise, it'll be a disaster.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.600
You showing up is the disaster.

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.480
Stand there, don't move. Don't move.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.680
Why?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.160
Why can't I understand humans?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.639
Um...

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.680
We're done eating, right?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.439
You said we're pretty much done.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.000
Didn't you come here just to shower and eat?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.360
After eating, let's... let's take a shower.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.040
Take a shower, right?

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.839
The full service package.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.399
Mom.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.199
Xiaocan, you're here.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:18.800
Perfect, perfect.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.160
Hey, I booked a restaurant.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.319
Let's the three of us go out to eat. Go out to eat.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.040
Don't go out to eat.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.759
Cook at home.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.600
Go out to eat. Eating out is delicious.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.399
Look who I ran into.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.800
My former boss.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.319
She really took care of me back then.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.279
When I was walking just now, Boss was right behind me.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.879
She didn't make a sound.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:31.519
Boss, you don't... you don't need to change shoes.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.600
You, you, you... hurry up.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.360
Make two more dishes.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360
Boss is here, make two more dishes.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.720
Boss.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.439
Pour her some water.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.279
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.800
Um...

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.160
You haven't talked yet, right?

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:39.920
Haven't had time yet.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.079
Xiaotian.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.959
This is Wei Mingtian.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.000
Our neighbor, the big star.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.120
This is my mom's boss. Hello, hello.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:46.360
Your skin is really nice.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.560
Boss is indeed amazing.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.199
Impossible to guard against.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.759
I'll get it, I'll get it.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:53.240
Don't worry about it.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.879
I'll open it. You cook, cook, cook.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.959
Where's the alien?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.120
Darn it, darn it. Xu Rui.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.480
This... everything is happening at once.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.000
What do I do?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.439
Like this, they'll definitely talk.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.000
How do I handle this?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.680
What do I do?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.439
How should I know what to do?

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.959
What do I do?

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.920
Kong Xiaocan, bad news!

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.000
You... you...

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.480
You must not let my boss...

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.759
...meet Kong Guifang. Who is that?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.879
If she discovers...

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:11.680
...that you made a deal with her. Stop talking.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.639
...it will be a disaster.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.680
Quick, stop talking.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.360
If they meet...

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:16.639
...the consequences will be unimaginable.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:17.920
Because she doesn't know... Stop talking.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.839
Kong Guifang doesn't know...

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:20.199
...you exchanged fifty years of Life Energy.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.000
Stop talking.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.240
Dear, you're here.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.600
I'm here too.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.079
I heard everything.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.199
I'm leaving now.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:36.680
Wait a moment.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.399
Take out the contract.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.360
You've got quite a mind of your own.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
There is no signature from Kong Guifang

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.240
Yet this contract is in effect?

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.920
Isn't this a violation of the rules?

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:55.600
Wait a minute

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.000
What does that mean?

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:59.519
What fifty years?

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:00.000
What transaction?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.720
What operation?

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.120
Mom

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.279
You shut up

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:02.839
Go on

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:08.279
The reason I came here

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.720
Is mainly to thank you both

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.120
For the Life Energy Exchange cause

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.079
And the contribution you made

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.000
Your touching story

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.600
Has already become a legend

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:17.920
Throughout the entire universe

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:20.120
Even our sales agents

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.519
Use your story

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.600
As a mandatory case study

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.360
What do you mean by fifty years?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.160
So Kong Guifang doesn't know

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.679
You just wait for your punishment later

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.720
To put it simply

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.039
It was you

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.399
When you had pancreatic cancer

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.600
When your life was nearing its end

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.799
It was your fine son

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.559
Mr. Kong Xiaocan

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.360
Who gave up his own

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.039
Fifty years of life energy to you

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.480
To bring you back from the dead

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.519
And your Rejuvenation

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.840
In other words

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.320
The energy fueling your life now

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.919
Comes from your son's life

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:03.960
This smart, fine son of yours, Xiaocan

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.399
Stole the secret medicine

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:07.039
How else could you be so young?

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.559
How else could you eat healthily?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.000
Walk healthily?

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:12.360
Bathe healthily?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.200
He traded his life for that

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.159
Kong Xiaocan

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:28.600
Is it true?

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:32.000
Mom

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:41.840
Mom

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.639
What's the use of crying?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.480
Why didn't you think carefully back then?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.320
What kind of medicine

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:08.159
Could make you so young all of a sudden?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.559
Xiaocan was just fooling you

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.679
It's my fault

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.159
I was wrong

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:20.879
I...

00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:23.240
I was so stupid

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:25.720
I shouldn't have listened to Xiaocan

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.679
I was wrong

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:30.679
I was wrong

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:31.200
It's me

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.840
It's my fault

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.600
It's all because I got sick

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.679
Xiaocan, in order to save me

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.440
It's all my fault

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.399
I was wrong

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.519
Ma Jianfei! A Fu!

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:03.399
You stand right there!

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:04.480
Don't run!

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:06.600
You violated the rules, didn't you?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.200
Now you've got someone chasing you!

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.720
I'm telling you, the deal is off!

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.919
Cancel it for me!

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:10.840
What do we do now that she found out?

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.399
Stand right there!

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.000
Run!

00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:17.519
Stand still!

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:18.559
Alright, alright, don't pull me!

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:18.960
Okay, okay.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.000
Stand still!

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.559
Okay, okay! Mom, Mom, Mom!

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.679
Why are you pulling me?

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:24.799
Mom, calm down, calm down.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.840
It can't be cancelled.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.320
If you cancel it, won't you turn back?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.440
Are you out of your mind?

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.440
What's this about fifty years?

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:30.559
Why are you acting so crazy?

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:32.039
Who told you to make this deal?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.279
Guifang, calm down a bit.

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:34.639
Did you all know about this?

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:36.399
Just keeping it from me right here?

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:37.080
I didn't know.

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.320
What is going on here?

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:39.559
Where are they?

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.039
Where are they?

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.720
Where did they go?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.000
Mom.

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:43.519
Move out of the way.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.600
Don't let me catch you!

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.639
Where are they?

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.679
Where did you go? Ma Jianfei! A Fu!

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:50.879
Mom, calm down.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:51.440
Stand right there!

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.440
Stand still!

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.120
The Life Energy Exchange...

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.399
...cannot be cancelled.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.759
If Xiaocan gives his life energy to you,

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.240
you cannot give it back to him.

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:01.399
That is how it is designed.

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.039
Why? Why won't you return it?

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.240
Why on earth can't you cancel it?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.279
Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.720
Calm down, calm down. Auntie, Auntie.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.000
Alright, alright, alright.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:08.960
Since it's irreversible,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.120
can't we take someone else's life energy

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.000
and transfer it to Kong Xiaocan?

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.840
Well said! We didn't think of that.

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:14.399
That's so smart!

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:14.840
Yes, yes, we can.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.159
So there is a way after all!

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.120
There is a way. So you go find someone else,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.200
and we'll handle the rest.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:19.799
No problem.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.360
You said it.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.159
It's a deal.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480
You're not allowed to go back on your word.

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:26.080
It's a deal.

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:26.720
It's a deal.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.639
We won't go back on it.

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:28.919
Good.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720
I'll go find someone right now.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:31.799
Go quickly.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.000
Is that even possible?

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:43.039
Um...

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.799
Now that my mom knows...

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:45.960
I definitely didn't say anything.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.159
You can't punish me.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.879
Can't punish.

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:50.919
We don't have that rule.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:51.960
No...

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.879
He said to keep my mouth shut before.

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:54.759
I was even punished.

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:55.200
My hair was gone.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.679
You said you had this rule, right?

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:57.919
No, there is no such punishment.

00:12:58.639 --> 00:12:59.559
Wasn't there a rule?

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:02.519
That was to prevent you from blabbing.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:04.039
Designed specifically for you.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:07.159
You designed a rule for him?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.200
Then I won't design one for him next time.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.639
He says he won't design one for you next time.

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:16.879
Is that it?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.679
It's over, right?

00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:21.600
He... he didn't speak.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.240
Have you no shame?

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.039
You guys...

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.120
And...

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:29.600
My...

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.399
Turtle... Tortoise...

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.559
It's a turtle.

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:36.080
No problem.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.720
Yeah.

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:40.799
Yes.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:41.799
He says...

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.279
You're right, you're right.

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:05.320
And...

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:06.639
See?

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.799
I said not to tell them.

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:09.159
Look at every one of them.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.279
Like they've been frozen.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.919
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.080
Let them accept the truth earlier.

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:17.320
We can figure something out together, right?

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:19.200
Wait a minute.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.120
Wait, wait, wait.

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:23.600
Can you guys not be so casual?

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:25.320
About such a terrible thing?

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:26.879
Can.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.759
Is this true?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.559
Did you really trade Godmother for that...

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:31.519
That Life Energy?

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:32.919
This is the sixth time you've asked.

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:35.759
Yes, it's true, true, true.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.440
So you knew all along?

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.240
Earlier than you guys...

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.279
Just a little bit earlier.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.600
Wait.

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:49.960
Why did you know before me?

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.320
Just by one hour.

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:52.080
That's not okay either.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.240
Is that the point?

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:53.639
I...

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.879
Then how long do you have left to live?

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:00.360
I want to know more than you do.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.919
You haven't seen that alien.

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:02.879
He's too unreliable.

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:03.559
No straight answer.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.879
Maybe I'll croak any moment.

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.120
Knock on wood.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.519
You know you're going to croak?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.480
Then why did you order full-sugar milk tea?

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:11.639
Lose half a day of life.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.759
You drank alcohol too.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.879
Another half day gone.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.600
You ate fried chicken and pickles.

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:16.879
You ate leftovers too.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.600
Can't you cherish your life a bit, Kong Xiaocan?

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.399
From now on, you just drink plain water.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.039
If I cherished my life, I'd stay away from you.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.039
You piss me off every day.

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:24.039
I lose half a day of life every day.

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:25.480
Alright, it's not that bad.

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:26.919
That's the situation.

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:28.080
That's how it is.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.279
Whether you accept it or not, it happened.

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:31.159
If you don't accept it...

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:32.960
But...

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:33.799
But...

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:36.120
What if a kind person gives me a refill?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.120
When will this kind person appear?

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:40.759
Even if he appears...

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
What if he's too late?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.679
What if?

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.799
Stop talking.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.000
Enough.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:49.360
At first, I couldn't accept it either.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600
It takes time.

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:53.120
Let's go back and calm down for today.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.320
And think about what kind of person...

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.039
Would be willing to give Xiaocan Life Energy.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.360
Right, right, right.

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.360
Everyone, go back and rest for today.

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:43.080
Mom.

00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:44.720
If you're angry,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.519
why don't you beat me up?

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.039
Don't... don't hit my face.

00:16:52.039 --> 00:16:52.879
Hit... hitting my face is fine.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.279
Just... go easy. It's okay.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.759
You agreed to the exchange for my sake.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.079
How could I bear to hit you?

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.480
You're not angry anymore?

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.640
For things that have already happened,

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:21.920
what's the use of getting angry?

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:25.880
I might as well think about

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.400
how to give the Life Energy to you.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.240
Alright.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.240
Leave it to Mom.

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:38.799
I'll figure something out for you.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.880
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:43.400
Come on, let's go to sleep.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.599
I'll stay with you for a while.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.359
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.440
Go to sleep.

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:49.839
Hurry up.

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:50.960
Okay, Mom.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.640
What is it? Why so early?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:33.960
Hurry up,

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:35.039
get up and get ready.

00:18:35.279 --> 00:18:37.160
I know who can exchange Life Energy for you.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.119
For this person to exchange Life Energy for you,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.480
it's only right and proper.

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:46.400
Who is it?

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:47.799
Your dad.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.079
Your dad

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.160
No, my dad

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:58.079
I actually have a dad?

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.440
He's ignored you for so many years

00:19:02.759 --> 00:19:03.880
I have to make him take

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.839
Responsibility as a father

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.599
We have to find him

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.079
Didn't he die?

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:09.519
When did I say that?

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:12.559
Your dad...

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.079
Was taken away by aliens

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:16.319
Your dad turned into a crow and flew away

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:17.279
Your dad...

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:19.160
He choked on a fish bone and died

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.440
You don't have a dad

00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:22.359
Mom had you all by herself, remember?

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.200
Mom, are you serious?

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.119
I really have a dad?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.279
Why would I lie to you?

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:28.759
My god

00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:30.759
This early in the morning

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.839
You've really woken me up

00:19:33.519 --> 00:19:34.119
I have to say

00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:36.200
Besides the shock, I'm actually a bit excited

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.799
Lately

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.519
So many TV drama plots

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:40.519
Have happened to me

00:19:40.519 --> 00:19:40.920
Seriously

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.960
I've almost got the lead actor's screen time

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:47.240
What does he look like?

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:48.200
Character?

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.359
Is his surname Kong?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.799
Looks are bad

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:51.559
Character is bad

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.319
And his surname isn't Kong

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:53.640
Can you stop messing with me?

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.200
Mystery solved then

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.359
I was wondering why my eyes kept getting smaller

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:00.799
This... why can't I get through to any of them?

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.039
These are all disconnected numbers

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:03.279
If you can't contact him

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.599
Who are you packing to go find?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.119
He must be in his hometown right now

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:07.200
What if he moved?

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.000
Went somewhere else to make a living?

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:09.720
Don't worry

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:11.279
He definitely doesn't have the money to move

00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:14.200
That bad?

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.359
Give me the address

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:22.400
This is pretty clear

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:24.079
Technology

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:25.200
Slow down, slow down, slow down

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:26.799
Ahead

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:28.759
Turn left, turn left

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.839
Yes, right at this intersection

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:32.079
You...

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:33.599
You remember it that clearly?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.240
When you were little, in this area

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.039
You used to jump around

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:36.920
Back then, I

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.799
Used to chase after you to feed you

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.200
I don't have any memory of that

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:42.799
What can you remember?

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.079
That brain of yours

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:46.640
Apart from eating, it's sleeping

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:48.000
Sleeping like a pig

00:20:49.359 --> 00:20:51.160
You just didn't feed me well when I was little

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.480
That's why I didn't grow tall

00:20:54.079 --> 00:20:54.400
Yes

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.160
Here, here, here

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.000
The one on the right

00:20:56.799 --> 00:20:58.240
This is Mom's old convenience store

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.799
So many years have passed

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:01.720
This place hasn't changed much from before

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.599
Don't say, this place looks...

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.000
Familiar

00:21:05.279 --> 00:21:06.559
The floor is still the same

00:21:07.759 --> 00:21:08.559
Change the angle

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.279
See if you can see the people inside

00:21:11.039 --> 00:21:12.200
You are purely dreaming

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.279
This isn't a game

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.599
Fine, this is not bad

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:16.799
Finding the address means we can contact people there

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:18.079
It counts as some progress

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:19.519
So what now?

00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:21.119
We need to ask for leave from the department for a couple of days

00:21:22.039 --> 00:21:23.119
Yeah, we have to

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.039
Lately so many dramatic things

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:27.960
Have happened to me

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.119
Do you think he might be

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.599
Already croaked?

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.240
Hurry up and spit that out

00:21:33.599 --> 00:21:34.359
If he's going to croak

00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:36.880
He has to do it after giving you the Life Energy

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.759
Hurry up and go eat breakfast

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.359
There are eggs in the kitchen

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.880
Is he tall?

00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:43.960
Tall

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.039
You didn't take after him

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.960
In my earliest memories,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.640
it was our family's convenience store.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.799
Mom and Dad were busy every day.

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:08.000
But I was a very sensible child.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.960
I could study on my own from a young age.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.359
I still remember my childhood dream.

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.720
My dream was to get into university,

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.480
become a scientist,

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:20.759
to study the mysteries of the universe

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:22.160
and the principles of the world.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.000
I thought my future

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.319
would surely be like this vast unknown,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.960
holding infinite possibilities.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.319
However,

00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:33.680
a car accident

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.559
pushed my dream very far away.

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:40.079
Then I changed my dream.

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.200
I thought this dream

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.559
would be a bit easier to achieve.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.000
I'm going to restock.

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:46.519
Wait a moment.

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:53.960
Done. Go ahead.

00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:55.160
Be safe.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.240
Come back early.

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:56.680
Will do.

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:58.279
Just when I thought

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:00.240
this dream was about to come true,

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.319
I realized

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.400
it was still so out of reach.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.880
Hai Ming, you can't go.

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:06.799
You can't go gamble.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.480
This is money for Xiaocan's school.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.039
Get lost.

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:12.160
That's money for Xiaocan's school!

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.119
You jerk.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.920
Mom.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.720
And so,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.359
I left this place devoid of dreams.

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:23.720
For so many years, I thought

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:25.119
my original dream

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.680
could never be realized again.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.759
Don't you want to do something earth-shattering?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.480
Go on.

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:30.720
Go to school and dream.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.359
Go.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.400
Go to school.

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:36.759
It turns out, after the original dream was miraculously realized,

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:39.319
is this the price that must be paid?

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.000
Your fine son, Mr. Kong Xiaocan,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.640
took out fifty years of his own life energy

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.400
and gave it to you,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.160
in exchange for your coming back to life

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480
and rejuvenation.

00:23:51.359 --> 00:23:52.160
Kong Guifang,

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.359
is this your fate?

00:23:58.759 --> 00:24:00.279
I called everyone to my house today

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:01.640
for only one purpose.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.920
We need to, for Xiaocan,

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:05.279
donate life.

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:08.720
We can't watch a young boy in his prime

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.599
die a tragic early death.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:10.880
I propose,

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:12.160
one day isn't too little,

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.160
ten years isn't too much.

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:14.480
Let those with life pitch in with life.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.240
Right.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.319
We can't watch Brother Xiaocan die.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.000
Right.

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:19.920
Come on.

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:21.880
How about this,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.680
I'll donate first.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:25.519
Ten years.

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:26.000
No.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.160
Twenty years.

00:24:27.319 --> 00:24:27.680
No.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.759
Thirty years.

00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:29.920
Yes.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.200
Thirty years it is.

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:38.400
Although

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.319
I couldn't be born with my best brother

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.680
in the same year, month, and day,

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:45.799
but

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.960
we can die in the same year, month, and day.

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:50.119
Enough.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.759
Isn't there a turning point now?

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.000
Guifang said

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.000
she's taking Xiaocan

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.119
to find his dad.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:24:59.119
That biological father of his?

00:24:59.559 --> 00:25:00.960
He abandoned the family and ran off ages ago.

00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:02.119
Would he be that kindhearted?

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.720
He is his biological son, after all.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.839
He wouldn't just watch him die, right?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.880
Besides,

00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:06.920
this is what he owes Xiaocan.

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:07.680
That's still not okay.

00:25:08.759 --> 00:25:10.039
I still have to do something for Xiaocan.

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:12.400
It's just thirty years.

00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:13.759
It's decided.

00:25:14.359 --> 00:25:15.359
I just find Godmother and trade, right?

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:16.519
I'll give her a call.

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:17.640
No.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:21.480
You and Xiaocan dying on the same day...

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:22.680
what am I supposed to do?

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.400
Xiao Yin.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:28.000
Don't be afraid.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.240
When I was little,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.880
my mom had my fortune told.

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:34.000
It said I could live to be eighty.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.079
Losing thirty years doesn't matter.

00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:36.960
That's still not okay.

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:38.359
When that time comes,

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:40.200
if I'm old and sick,

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:41.200
and you're not there,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.359
who will take care of me?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.400
You're right.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.480
Who would take care of you?

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:49.400
Then I can't die at fifty.

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:52.640
I have to be by your bedside.

00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:58.319
What about after that?

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.200
After that...

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.279
You mean...

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.119
we get married,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.359
have kids,

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:05.920
the kids get married,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.200
and the kids have kids?

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.799
I have to help the kids raise their kids.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:11.960
How about...

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.359
I trade five years less?

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:17.079
I'll try to live to fifty-five.

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:23.359
But...

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.440
if I live to fifty-five,

00:26:28.319 --> 00:26:29.200
just nine more years,

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.640
and I can collect my pension.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:37.400
I have to at least experience retirement life.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.279
How about...

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:45.640
I live until sixty-four before dying?

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:46.920
But...

00:26:47.759 --> 00:26:48.799
have you ever thought,

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:50.759
what if that fortune teller

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:52.119
wasn't accurate?

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.759
Then I'll keep a little in reserve

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:04.319
How about

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:07.640
I donate a year first

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.039
Fine

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.200
Alright, alright

00:27:10.599 --> 00:27:11.920
You just stay by Xiao Yin's side

00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:14.119
You all have your own lives

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.119
Xiaocan wouldn't

00:27:15.119 --> 00:27:16.680
accept you sacrificing your life for him

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.039
Sister Rui

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:21.400
Why are you so calm?

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.680
Don't you want to grow old with Xiaocan?

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:29.799
I want to know too

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.240
Don't you want to be with me forever?

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.200
Even without the exchange business

00:27:35.799 --> 00:27:37.680
life is full of accidents

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.559
Like

00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:39.640
traffic accidents

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:40.599
illness

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.400
natural disasters and the like

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.519
No one can predict that

00:27:45.359 --> 00:27:46.039
Besides

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.720
there isn't anyone who

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.480
has to be together for a lifetime

00:27:52.359 --> 00:27:53.519
You're so heartless

00:27:58.119 --> 00:27:59.279
So you mean

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.960
I have to sacrifice my life

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.200
follow you

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:04.720
and die for love

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.880
to be considered devoted?

00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:07.680
No

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.440
that's not what I meant

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.519
I really didn't mean that

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.000
It's just

00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:16.559
I understand the logic

00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:18.079
but

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.400
hearing certain things come out of your mouth

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.680
feels just a little bit

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.400
you know?

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:38.759
What I mean is

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:41.319
we should just cherish the present

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:43.000
Dummy

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:21.759
Taking such a long leave?

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.480
You'll miss a lot of major classes.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.000
It's okay.

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:25.759
Goodbye, Professor.

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:32.000
Guifang.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.920
You're done asking for leave?

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.759
So, you and Brother Xiaocan...

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.720
When will you be back?

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:40.799
I don't know.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.160
Xiaocan's dad is a total scoundrel.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.559
Never mind moral blackmail...

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.119
even if it takes physical kidnapping...

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.480
I have to make him take responsibility.

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:53.440
To exchange some life energy for Xiaocan.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.759
Xiaocan's dad?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.279
You guys never mentioned him before.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.519
If we weren't pushed to this point...

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.079
I wouldn't go look for him.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.799
He's someone I never wanted to see again.

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:08.319
How about...

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.480
I exchange my life energy for Brother Xiaocan.

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:12.279
Don't go looking for that man.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.000
Don't be silly.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.880
Cherish your own life.

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:26.680
You're someone's son too.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.200
You can't make your parents worry.

00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:30.319
Understand?

00:30:34.839 --> 00:30:35.240
Xiaocan.

00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:37.039
We've all discussed it.

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:40.079
Me, Xiao Yin, Mingtian, and Sister Rui.

00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:41.720
We'll each chip in half a year for you first.

00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:46.759
No need.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.880
Don't mention it.

00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:50.759
What did you say?

00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:53.400
I said...

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:54.119
I don't need it!

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:56.440
No...

00:30:56.759 --> 00:30:57.519
What do you guys mean?

00:30:58.599 --> 00:30:59.960
You want me gone so soon?

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.640
Am I in a rush to die right now?

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.279
Am I dying?

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.200
Look at my energy, my physique.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.119
Who knows?

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.359
Even if I gave away that lifespan...

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:08.880
I might still live longer than you guys.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:10.880
Really, no need.

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:11.759
I really don't need it.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.359
Even if I did need it...

00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:16.160
don't I have a damn biological father?

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:17.160
I'll just ask him for it.

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:19.519
Bro... Brother.

00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:22.720
Do you think my half-year is too little?

00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:25.160
Yes.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.559
I know... this half-year isn't much.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.440
But in the future, we'll have elders and kids to support.

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:33.319
Elders need our care.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.559
Kids need our company.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.480
Okay, okay, alright.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.440
I know, I know.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:39.039
But listen to me.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.359
I know what I'm doing.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.079
Really, no need.

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:43.240
How about this.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.599
You keep your half-year for me for now.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.279
When I really need it, I'll come get it.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.279
Okay?

00:31:51.079 --> 00:31:51.480
Okay.

00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:53.400
If you need it...

00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:55.000
come find me anytime.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.359
Brother.

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:03.119
I don't ask for anything else.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.200
I just hope...

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.680
we can always be together.

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:10.480
Grow old together.

00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:12.400
What do you mean "grow old together"?

00:32:12.759 --> 00:32:13.640
I... I just...

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.039
I just hope...

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.319
we can be together forever.

00:32:18.279 --> 00:32:19.440
If you were gone...

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.960
and I arrange a fight later...

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.799
who would go with me?

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.920
We still have to play basketball together.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:24.839
Xiaocan.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.079
You can't die.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.720
I still need to mooch meals at your place.

00:32:39.599 --> 00:32:40.920
You absolutely cannot die.

00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:52.480
So, so... it's that street, right?

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:53.720
Okay.

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:55.200
Thank you, Sister Ma.

00:32:55.799 --> 00:32:56.440
No problem.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.519
Let's meet up when we're back.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.200
Okay, thanks.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.799
Got a lead.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.039
Sister Ma said...

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:06.119
It's at Nanhong Noodle Shop on the next street over.

00:33:06.119 --> 00:33:07.000
You can see him there often.

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:07.680
What's it called?

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.599
Nanhong Noodle Shop.

00:33:08.599 --> 00:33:09.119
Check it out.

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:13.400
Found one.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:14.440
This one?

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.599
Yeah, that's it.

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:18.279
Okay, then... then I...

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:19.200
I'll connect to this...

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.119
See if I can find a phone number.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.160
I'll ask if anyone has seen this guy.

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:23.640
Your dad is named Hai Ming. Hai Ming.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.799
The "Hai Ming" from Hemingway?

00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:27.799
Zoom in on this again, let me see.

00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:29.440
Why zoom in?

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.599
The text is pretty clear.

00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:31.519
Wait, wait, wait.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.319
That's the one.

00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:37.880
What "this"?

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.400
Is this the guy?

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200
It's so blurry, can you see clearly?

00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:47.200
I'd recognize him even if he turned to ash.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.519
The silhouette looks...

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.519
Indeed.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.400
He's pretty tall.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.280
They just left like that?

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.719
Didn't even offer to clean up.

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:17.320
Leader, should I call them back?

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.079
Make them clean up.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:20.159
I don't think that's necessary.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:21.519
Let's clean it up ourselves.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.199
Tell me...

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.039
About what he said just now regarding the violation...

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.159
Could he... our secret...

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.280
Leak it to more people?

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.960
And cause a security risk for us?

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:32.880
It's possible.

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:34.119
Then I'll call them back.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.440
You can talk to them privately.

00:34:35.519 --> 00:34:36.199
I don't think that's appropriate.

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:36.960
Forget it.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.239
Leader.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.360
That hesitation you just showed...

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.599
And being afraid of trouble...

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:44.000
Is a human emotion.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.159
Called "being a wimp".

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:46.559
Wimp.

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:47.079
You're a wimp.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:47.840
I'm a wimp.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.519
You are now a wimp.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.280
I wimped out.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:49.920
You wimped out.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.239
This feels pretty good.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:51.519
Yes.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:53.880
I just thought of something.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.440
If they really find someone else...

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.480
To exchange Life Energy...

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:00.039
We didn't have to lift a finger.

00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:01.800
And we got a commission.

00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:03.639
And finished our KPIs ahead of schedule.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.760
I think it's a good thing for us.

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:08.000
Leader.

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:09.760
This mentality of only benefiting yourself...

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.800
Is called "crafty".

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.239
Crafty.

00:35:11.239 --> 00:35:11.760
You're crafty.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.400
I'm being crafty again.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.039
Very crafty.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.199
By the way.

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:15.599
I said I was going to punish you.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.719
Come here, let me pluck one off.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:17.800
Leader.

00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:20.679
This state of going from happy to punishing...

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:22.599
Is called "hiding a dagger in a smile".

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:23.800
I'm hiding a dagger again.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.880
Hiding a dagger in a smile.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.000
And us running around just now...

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.760
Was just fear.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.960
Being scared is still "wimping out".

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:29.960
I was scared.

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:30.559
That's being a wimp.

00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:44.000
I reckon...

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:45.800
We should still call them back to clean up.

00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:47.079
Leader.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.800
This behavior seems to be called...

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.840
Slapping your own face.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.199
Aren't we piecing together faces right now?
