{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:39.894
AUTHORIZATION LETTER

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:41.813
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
HONG JANG-MI

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:48.486
I am indeed Hong Jang-mi.

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:51.447
Yes, we've confirmed your name and face,

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:54.826
but we should be extra careful
with such a large sum of money.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:57.203
Just a moment.

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:15.221
Madam Choi.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.143
Let's talk in my office.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.501
My goodness. Nora!

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:48.838
This is…

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:51.633
This is exactly why
I didn't want to work here!

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.093
Do you think anyone
in this building welcomes me?

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:56.596
They're always whispering when I walk by,

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.723
so I can't even get water
or go to the bathroom!

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.100
My poor Nora.

00:02:02.018 --> 00:02:04.437
This place is bringing out a side of you
I've never seen.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.355
Oh dear.

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:18.409
Hello, you've reached Song Ju-ran.

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:24.499
That's correct.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.293
I can verify Ms. Hong Jang-mi.

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:29.879
We're in urgent need of those funds,

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:31.589
so please proceed without delay.

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:34.467
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:40.890
Did you confirm with her?

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:44.102
Yes, I did.

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:56.322
YEOUIDO PIRATES

00:02:57.115 --> 00:02:58.950
EPISODE 11: THE MASKED PIRATE

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:02.161
CHRISTMAS SUPPLIES MEGA SALE

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.793
{\an8}Why didn't you answer your phone?

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:10.920
{\an8}I passed out
as soon as I got on the train to Seoul.

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:12.588
{\an8}Did you get it? Is it done?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.341
{\an8}Withdrawal complete.

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.427
{\an8}I got it all in checks,
just like you told me to.

00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:28.563
{\an8}You couldn't have
pulled this off without me.

00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:30.523
{\an8}I was sweating bullets earlier.

00:03:31.024 --> 00:03:33.484
{\an8}But still, Ms. Kang
definitely pulled her weight.

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:36.237
{\an8}She only cooperated
because she didn't exactly know our plan.

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:38.156
Let's take care of this first.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.701
They could stop payment on these checks,
so we need to cash them quickly.

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:42.618
Let's go.

00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:54.547
ALWAYS READY TO HELP OUR CLIENTS
LIKE WE'RE FAMILY

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.007
IOK DEVELOPMENT OFFICE

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:01.471
How did you find out about this place?

00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:03.014
You sure we'll be okay?

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:04.682
Of course we'll be okay.

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:07.268
The Bank of Korea
is right across the street.

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:10.813
Sometimes what's closest
is the hardest to notice.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:33.419
CASHIER'S CHECK
10 MILLION WON

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:46.641
The service fee is 20%.

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:51.437
It's supposed to be 15%.
I already checked.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:54.649
It's 20%
with the late-night surcharge included.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.653
Eighteen…

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:01.531
percent.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.991
You really are something else.

00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:05.618
Look at you trying to save every penny.

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:07.995
I'm not just doing this
for my own sake, am I?

00:05:16.337 --> 00:05:18.131
Would that be enough to change your mind?

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:21.384
Let's settle on 17%
with a bulk discount included.

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:50.496
I've stolen my fair share,
but I never felt butterflies like this.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.956
I feel angry.

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.458
Look how much
these greedy bastards have stashed away.

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:57.837
This isn't even a tenth
of Chairman Kang's slush fund.

00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:07.180
It's dirty money.

00:06:07.263 --> 00:06:09.390
When I was a teller,
I used to get so annoyed

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:11.684
when my fingers got irritated
from handling so much cash.

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:12.602
Why?

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:14.937
Because all that cash I touched
was never mine.

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:17.732
But now,

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:22.195
I don't think I'd mind
having all ten fingers irritated.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.280
I want to count every single bill.

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:26.324
Remember, this still isn't your money.

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:28.284
I know that.

00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:30.536
Oh right.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.872
Did I tell you
that Nora got caught by the president

00:06:32.955 --> 00:06:34.332
while filling in for you today?

00:06:34.415 --> 00:06:35.249
She did?

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:36.792
Why are you only telling me this now?

00:06:57.104 --> 00:06:58.981
I need an explanation
for yesterday's incident

00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:00.608
from the one responsible, Ms. Hong.

00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:04.195
Mr. Cha has banned days off
since the restructuring.

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:06.530
That's why I helped her out.

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:08.324
Why did you need to take your day off?

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:11.786
It was for personal reasons.

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:13.955
As the guardian
of her hospitalized roommate--

00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:15.748
I want you to speak for yourself.

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:19.126
You should know
that repeated unexcused absences

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.087
may be grounds for termination.

00:07:29.262 --> 00:07:31.639
I was indeed absent without prior approval

00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:35.142
and foolishly attempted to rectify it
by involving a third party.

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:37.520
I will make sure this never happens again,

00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:38.563
and I'll be more mindful.

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:40.273
We'll be more mindful.

00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:50.449
You may leave.

00:08:13.097 --> 00:08:16.642
President Shin just let us go
because you're such a smooth talker.

00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:20.396
He just couldn't grill us further
because you were there, Ms. Kang.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.275
I'll do even better next time.

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:25.985
Thank you for your help.

00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:29.739
This is the address where Bom is.

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:31.532
It's my parents' place.

00:08:35.703 --> 00:08:37.580
1001 SINJANG-DONG, YEOGOK-GU, INCHEON

00:08:50.676 --> 00:08:53.512
When I show up to work
dressed like this as Kang Nora,

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:55.264
people find me intimidating.

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:57.391
But the moment
I put the uniform back on yesterday,

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:59.935
they treated me just as badly
as when I was Kang Eun-joo.

00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:03.731
But I've been the same person
all this time.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:08.611
I wondered if this was
how you'd been feeling too.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:14.158
We should have lunch
with Queen Bee sometime.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:15.910
We'll go to that place we used to--

00:09:15.993 --> 00:09:16.869
The burger place!

00:09:17.453 --> 00:09:18.704
I'd love to.

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:19.622
Totally.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.124
I'll get going then.

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:40.351
"Ullala Chicken"?

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:43.562
This is so good.

00:09:43.646 --> 00:09:45.022
ULLALA CHICKEN

00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:46.816
Is this the same delicious fried chicken

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:48.943
that Queen Bee treated us to last time?

00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:51.362
HONG KEUM-BO'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY INVITATION

00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:53.155
Did you fold this star, Bom?

00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:58.828
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:00.788
Auntie!

00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:03.082
Bom!

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:05.292
How have you been?

00:10:05.835 --> 00:10:08.963
Oh my gosh. I missed you so much!

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:13.384
Hello.

00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:19.598
I missed you so much.

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:20.725
Have you been well?

00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:25.020
Here we go.

00:10:25.104 --> 00:10:27.148
Open up.

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:30.693
Give me one too.

00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:33.362
Open up.

00:10:35.573 --> 00:10:36.907
It's so good.

00:10:41.996 --> 00:10:44.665
Why didn't you say goodbye
before you left?

00:10:44.749 --> 00:10:45.791
Sorry.

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:49.170
I had to move in with my mom and dad
all of a sudden.

00:10:49.253 --> 00:10:50.963
With your mom and dad?

00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:54.550
Lucky you.

00:10:57.595 --> 00:10:59.180
It's okay.

00:10:59.263 --> 00:11:02.725
I live with Grandma and Grandpa here.

00:11:03.267 --> 00:11:06.812
Even today,
Grandma and I went to see Mommy.

00:11:08.397 --> 00:11:09.565
Here we go.

00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:14.278
Enjoy.

00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:15.988
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:19.658
Bom.

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:21.869
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:11:23.746 --> 00:11:25.623
So she used to live with Keum-bo?

00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:28.667
Man, she sure smells of money.

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:30.669
Be quiet.

00:11:31.337 --> 00:11:33.047
- It's good.
- It's good!

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:36.884
Eat up.

00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:45.518
Sir, I'm here to pick up…

00:11:49.438 --> 00:11:50.606
FULL-SERVICE SHOE REPAIR

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:53.484
After you went silent, I even went to
Seoul Station to look for you,

00:11:53.567 --> 00:11:54.902
afraid that you'd become homeless.

00:11:58.155 --> 00:12:00.324
I delayed processing your resignation.

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:02.409
You still haven't processed it?

00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:04.370
Why you little…

00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:06.580
I clearly did it for your sake.

00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:11.752
Remember the 24 billion won
in Hong Jang-mi's accounts?

00:12:12.503 --> 00:12:14.255
I withdrew everything in checks,
and they're being cashed.

00:12:17.883 --> 00:12:19.552
Have you lost your damn mind?

00:12:19.635 --> 00:12:21.971
It's not like
I can claim that money anyway,

00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:24.723
so I'm going to buy up
all the Hanmin stocks.

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:27.810
I'll buy the company with the slush fund.

00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:30.396
I sent you undercover
to catch the big crook,

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:31.730
and now you'll become one yourself?

00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:32.815
Then what?

00:12:32.898 --> 00:12:35.067
Should I just let
those foreign invaders loot it all?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.696
DK Ventures isn't looking
to invest in Hanmin,

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:41.073
but to stage a hostile takeover
of its management rights.

00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:43.784
It's true that Chairman Kang
is a jerk and all,

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:45.869
but we can't lose the company to them.

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:54.628
You shouldn't underestimate
DK Ventures like that.

00:12:54.712 --> 00:12:56.297
I looked into them,

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.133
and it turns out they've swept through
Southeast Asia's corporate world

00:12:59.216 --> 00:13:00.634
since the start of the year.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:05.723
OMURA SECURITIES CO., LTD

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:13.272
DK Ventures specializes in hostile M&As.

00:13:13.897 --> 00:13:19.111
Guess who was behind almost every
corporate control dispute in Asia

00:13:19.194 --> 00:13:21.614
over the past five years?

00:13:21.697 --> 00:13:22.740
"DK."

00:13:25.993 --> 00:13:29.204
I wonder why you did all that research
when I never asked you to.

00:13:29.288 --> 00:13:32.166
Believe it or not,
I was just as passionate at your age.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.294
I looked into it out of curiosity,
that's all.

00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:43.135
Their endgame might be to take over
Hanmin Investment & Securities,

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:47.473
but unless they make a clear move,
we don't have grounds to act.

00:13:47.556 --> 00:13:50.851
I'm sure they're not here
just to take over Hanmin.

00:13:51.935 --> 00:13:54.980
If you think about
why Shin Jung-woo joined Hanmin,

00:13:56.023 --> 00:13:59.735
it's the quickest and easiest way
to get intel on Korean companies.

00:14:02.613 --> 00:14:03.989
That's true, but…

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:06.325
President Shin

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.495
seemed like a good guy.

00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:12.998
Just hurry up and process my resignation.

00:14:16.835 --> 00:14:19.797
I intended to catch Yehppee
within 100 days and return,

00:14:21.298 --> 00:14:23.258
but I guess I got to know
too many people here.

00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:28.055
Sometimes…

00:14:30.224 --> 00:14:32.434
it feels like Hanmin is my company.

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:40.025
Hong.

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:44.405
It's not your fault.

00:14:46.407 --> 00:14:49.535
It's a shame your roommate
made the choice she did,

00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:52.663
but try not to blame yourself too much.

00:14:57.001 --> 00:14:59.670
You said the same thing nine years ago,

00:15:00.587 --> 00:15:01.964
at his funeral.

00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:11.598
It'll be different this time.

00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:13.475
See you.

00:15:19.982 --> 00:15:21.108
Hong.

00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:22.359
Don't ignore my calls!

00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:24.778
Take care of yourself!

00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:27.573
And keep all your receipts!

00:15:30.909 --> 00:15:31.827
Who knows?

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.246
If you return safely,
they might expense them for you.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.334
Sir!

00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:42.921
Is this man smoking the whole pack?

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:49.762
Let's look for more Korean firms
that desperately need to secure financing.

00:15:49.845 --> 00:15:51.388
{\an8}ANALYSIS OF INDUSTRY TRENDS
AND MARKET COMPETITIVENESS

00:15:52.097 --> 00:15:53.557
Did you rank them yourself?

00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:55.225
Yeah.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:58.020
Category C covers firms
subject to IMF-led restructuring,

00:15:58.103 --> 00:16:01.565
Category B covers firms whose finances
declined sharply due to liquidity issues,

00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:04.526
and Category A covers firms
with weak ownership structures.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.111
Have the head office cross-check them.

00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:08.697
Okay.

00:16:13.118 --> 00:16:14.495
Coryo Investment & Securities has become

00:16:14.578 --> 00:16:16.747
the first financial institution
to go bankrupt today.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.333
The long-held belief
that financial institutions are

00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:21.668
"too-big-to-fail" has proven false.

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:24.838
{\an8}Coryo Investment & Securities
has finally collapsed

00:16:24.922 --> 00:16:28.592
{\an8}after failing to cover
270 billion won in promissory notes

00:16:28.675 --> 00:16:30.219
{\an8}that came due between December 13 and 15.

00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:31.720
The immediate cause was

00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:34.014
its partner banks' refusal
to provide funding

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:37.768
as they grew increasingly risk-averse
under the IMF program.

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.020
The government convened
an emergency meeting tonight

00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:43.315
to confirm Coryo Investment & Securities'
final insolvency

00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:45.442
by suspending its business operations
starting tomorrow.

00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:47.569
CORYO IS DONE FOR
COULD MY FIRM BE IN TROUBLE TOO?

00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:48.904
RUMORS IN YEOUIDO:
COMPANIES ON THE BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY

00:16:48.987 --> 00:16:50.405
THE RUMOR GOING AROUND TODAY…

00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:53.492
EUNBON CONSTRUCTION, NEX ACE INDUSTRIES,
HOJO TRADING, HEOBONG CONSTRUCTION…

00:16:53.575 --> 00:16:55.452
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:16:56.161 --> 00:16:57.037
Come on, Big Al.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.289
Hasn't Executive Director Oh
told you anything?

00:16:59.373 --> 00:17:02.501
Hanmin was mentioned
in that rumor post on Yeouido Pirates.

00:17:02.584 --> 00:17:03.961
I haven't heard anything.

00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:06.421
Besides, aren't you closer buddies
with my dad?

00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:08.340
Have you joined his side already?

00:17:08.423 --> 00:17:10.050
What are you talking about?

00:17:10.134 --> 00:17:11.969
He's actually pretty hard to befriend…

00:17:12.052 --> 00:17:14.596
My goodness.

00:17:15.097 --> 00:17:17.224
You see, I…

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:19.101
I respect Executive Director Oh.

00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:22.062
My dad would be pleased to hear that.

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:26.441
The chairman favoring the president
has him feeling excluded lately.

00:17:26.525 --> 00:17:27.651
I see.

00:17:28.902 --> 00:17:32.281
I wonder if that rumor about the firms
soon to go bankrupt is really true.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.533
Who started spreading it?

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:40.372
Where did you even find this?

00:17:40.873 --> 00:17:43.250
I subscribed as soon as I got to Seoul.

00:17:44.168 --> 00:17:45.544
Nobody just reads the newspaper anymore.

00:17:45.627 --> 00:17:48.630
I hear the Yeouido Pirates community
is influential around here,

00:17:49.214 --> 00:17:50.424
but you need an invite to join.

00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:12.029
What happens if Hanmin goes under
before we're ready to go on our end?

00:18:12.613 --> 00:18:14.406
Who do you think started that rumor?

00:18:15.908 --> 00:18:16.909
I did.

00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:20.537
That's how we put
that categorization work to good use.

00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:24.082
It needs to get beaten up out there
for it to accept our hand.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:25.500
And you know what happens next.

00:18:25.584 --> 00:18:26.668
Yeah.

00:18:26.752 --> 00:18:29.880
Express intention to invest
and set up a formal meeting.

00:18:31.632 --> 00:18:34.968
It feels like you're working
even harder in your homeland.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.224
These companies are only useful
for lining the owners' pockets.

00:18:40.307 --> 00:18:42.100
What reason do they have to exist?

00:18:42.184 --> 00:18:44.102
Hanmin is no different.

00:18:44.186 --> 00:18:45.938
They've been lucky for far too long.

00:18:49.524 --> 00:18:53.403
President Shin and the CEO of DK
were talking about that rumor earlier.

00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:56.031
This company might go under
before we even get started.

00:18:57.032 --> 00:18:57.950
It won't just yet.

00:18:59.201 --> 00:19:00.244
How can you be so sure?

00:19:00.327 --> 00:19:01.662
They're all dropping like flies.

00:19:02.246 --> 00:19:03.872
Look at Nora's mama and Al's papa.

00:19:04.498 --> 00:19:06.500
Would they go to such lengths
to inherit a company

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.210
that's about to go belly up?

00:19:08.293 --> 00:19:09.503
{\an8}DIRECTOR KANG NORA

00:19:09.586 --> 00:19:11.171
Madam Choi, known as Nora's mama,

00:19:11.255 --> 00:19:14.466
is busy making her rounds
on the executive 12th floor.

00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:17.427
This is my son,
an alum of your school in the US.

00:19:18.011 --> 00:19:19.680
Executive Director Oh, known as Al's papa,

00:19:19.763 --> 00:19:23.517
is running around, parading Albert
and networking with high-level officials.

00:19:24.184 --> 00:19:25.102
Thank you very much.

00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:27.562
- Yes, thank you. That's right.
- Enjoy.

00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:37.614
You should head home,
not eat dinner in someone else's office.

00:19:39.074 --> 00:19:41.493
It hurts when you treat us like outsiders.

00:19:42.411 --> 00:19:45.247
This place feels more like home,
even when I'm just eating noodles.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:47.541
Home is where the heart is, right?

00:19:51.878 --> 00:19:53.380
Following my dad around

00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:55.757
to hang out with middle-aged men
is no fun at all.

00:19:55.841 --> 00:19:57.342
I guess he's building your network?

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.803
He wouldn't be where he is
if he had a decent one.

00:20:01.013 --> 00:20:03.515
Executive Director Oh
must not want to see his son

00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:06.893
lose ground in the succession battle
against Kang Nora.

00:20:06.977 --> 00:20:07.811
Don't you think?

00:20:07.894 --> 00:20:08.979
I've already lost ground.

00:20:09.062 --> 00:20:10.856
Already? How much ground?

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:14.943
I think the chairman
was inspired by The Godfather,

00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:17.446
because he suddenly set up family lunches.

00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:19.364
- "Family lunches"?
- "Family lunches"?

00:20:19.448 --> 00:20:20.282
Yeah.

00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:24.328
He wants the whole family
to gather for lunch every Saturday.

00:20:25.078 --> 00:20:26.204
But guess who also joins.

00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:30.167
President Shin.

00:20:33.545 --> 00:20:35.005
You must have missed it, Ms. Hong.

00:20:35.088 --> 00:20:37.924
President Shin and Director Kang Nora
are getting engaged.

00:20:38.842 --> 00:20:42.220
The scales are now
tipping heavily in favor of

00:20:42.304 --> 00:20:43.513
my auntie and my future uncle.

00:20:45.098 --> 00:20:47.100
You need to try harder, Mr. Oh!

00:20:47.851 --> 00:20:48.769
Me?

00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:50.270
At what?

00:20:52.689 --> 00:20:55.150
Are you just going to
let her take everything?

00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:57.486
It was never mine to begin with.

00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:00.447
This stays between us three,

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.240
but to describe my situation, it's like…

00:21:03.075 --> 00:21:04.368
Hangover soup without dried pollock,

00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:06.745
soybean paste stew without tofu,
and seaweed soup without beef.

00:21:09.498 --> 00:21:10.832
It'd be nice if I were included,

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:13.085
but it wouldn't be upsetting if I weren't.

00:21:13.668 --> 00:21:16.630
Of course you should be upset
if it's intentional like that.

00:21:16.713 --> 00:21:19.883
If you move up the chain of command,
you'll gain authority over personnel.

00:21:20.384 --> 00:21:22.302
Then you could revive
the Risk Management Division

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:24.846
and Mr. Bang Jin-mok
could return to the company!

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.723
I wholeheartedly concur, Ms. Hong.

00:21:30.727 --> 00:21:33.188
You need to become
either the president or the chairman.

00:21:49.204 --> 00:21:52.124
Do you know why
I decided to stay at the company?

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:54.584
Like Mr. Bang said,

00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:57.337
I'd only be left with regrets
if I got forced out.

00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:59.881
And there was also the promise I made you.

00:22:05.637 --> 00:22:06.513
On that note,

00:22:07.347 --> 00:22:09.015
wipe down the table.

00:22:28.994 --> 00:22:31.830
Chairman, we have
quite a spread for you today.

00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:35.167
No need for all that. My goodness.

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:40.213
Seaweed is good for you.

00:22:44.509 --> 00:22:46.469
President Shin, eat up.

00:22:46.553 --> 00:22:47.929
I will, thank you.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.226
To describe my situation, it's like…

00:22:54.227 --> 00:22:55.353
seaweed soup without beef.

00:22:56.521 --> 00:22:59.566
It'd be nice if I were included,
but it wouldn't be upsetting if I weren't.

00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:02.652
Of course you should be upset
if it's intentional like that.

00:23:05.864 --> 00:23:07.949
You must be enjoying work
in the Trading Division.

00:23:08.742 --> 00:23:10.202
It's nice to see you smiling.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.122
I'm not exactly thrilled
about my new division.

00:23:14.706 --> 00:23:15.999
But if I wasn't transferred,

00:23:16.082 --> 00:23:18.585
I would've never realized
how great my old team

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:20.503
truly was.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.173
Did you hear that, sir?

00:23:24.007 --> 00:23:27.969
It sounds like our Albert is
finally realizing how vital personnel is

00:23:28.053 --> 00:23:31.765
and what role management must play
in an organization like ours.

00:23:32.807 --> 00:23:33.642
Is that so?

00:23:33.725 --> 00:23:35.894
That's a bit of a stretch.

00:23:35.977 --> 00:23:38.647
He's basically saying
it's tough for him to adjust,

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.273
even after being made a general manager.

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:42.692
Well, someone's been made
a whole director.

00:23:42.776 --> 00:23:44.027
He's leagues ahead of that someone

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.655
who does nothing
and doesn't know any better.

00:23:47.155 --> 00:23:48.573
Goodness.

00:23:50.825 --> 00:23:54.704
Perhaps we should've sent
our Nora to a division

00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:58.333
where she could socialize
with some colleagues.

00:23:59.251 --> 00:24:01.127
Ms. Song, look into that.

00:24:02.128 --> 00:24:03.255
Yes, sir. I'll look into it.

00:24:03.338 --> 00:24:04.589
Don't, Ms. Song.

00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:08.551
- Chairman.
- My word.

00:24:08.635 --> 00:24:10.845
I'm just trying to find her a good fit.

00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:13.265
Good luck finding that.

00:24:26.027 --> 00:24:28.321
- Did you enjoy the meal?
- Yes, I did.

00:24:29.155 --> 00:24:30.240
President Shin.

00:24:30.323 --> 00:24:31.283
You understand, right?

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.910
It's all for my Nora's sake.

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:38.206
Ma'am, you should refrain
from visiting the offices for now.

00:24:40.792 --> 00:24:41.793
Refrain?

00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:43.420
You want me to stay away?

00:24:43.503 --> 00:24:44.337
Yes.

00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:46.339
The restructuring resulted
in massive layoffs,

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:48.633
so the office isn't too thrilled
about welcoming

00:24:48.717 --> 00:24:50.760
the owner's daughter as a director.

00:24:50.844 --> 00:24:53.471
The appearance of
a succession battle taking center stage

00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:54.931
only fuels staff resentment.

00:24:55.015 --> 00:24:58.059
For the sake of the company's image,
please refrain for the time being.

00:24:58.893 --> 00:25:02.814
But Albert has Mr. Oh by his side
all day in the office.

00:25:03.982 --> 00:25:05.817
Who's going to look after my Nora?

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.819
- I'm…
- I'll be sure

00:25:09.154 --> 00:25:10.322
to look after Nora.

00:25:15.535 --> 00:25:18.246
That would certainly put my mind at ease.

00:25:20.206 --> 00:25:21.333
Thank you.

00:25:21.875 --> 00:25:23.001
I'll see you next time.

00:25:23.585 --> 00:25:25.295
- You too…
- Goodbye.

00:25:29.591 --> 00:25:30.967
She can be so shy.

00:25:31.051 --> 00:25:32.177
I wonder who she takes after.

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:36.431
- Goodbye now.
- Take care, ma'am.

00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:45.899
{\an8}BLOWOUT SALE
PROBIOTICS: 50 WON, GIMBAP: 1,000 WON

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:54.115
- I'll take a roll of gimbap.
- Yes.

00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:55.575
That'll be 1,000 won.

00:25:56.576 --> 00:25:57.535
Thank you.

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:03.291
Wow, you sound so different.

00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:04.918
"Thank you."

00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:06.294
I have to make a living.

00:26:09.214 --> 00:26:11.007
You didn't tell the others
about me, right?

00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:12.509
I didn't. You told me not to.

00:26:12.592 --> 00:26:13.635
Good.

00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:20.600
Mr. Bang.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.645
Should I become president?

00:26:26.064 --> 00:26:28.274
You've suddenly turned into
a walking ball of ambition.

00:26:28.358 --> 00:26:31.611
If I moved up,
I'd gain authority over personnel,

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:34.114
I could bring back Risk Management,

00:26:35.073 --> 00:26:36.324
and you could--

00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:37.784
- I'll take a roll of gimbap.
- Sure.

00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:40.370
That will be 1,000 won. There you go.

00:26:40.453 --> 00:26:41.454
Thank you!

00:26:43.706 --> 00:26:44.624
Ms. Hong told me

00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:49.504
she decided to stay at the company
because of what you said.

00:26:50.964 --> 00:26:52.382
She didn't want lingering regret.

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:56.636
It probably has more to do with
what she wants than anything I said.

00:26:58.638 --> 00:27:00.640
Besides, stop coming here
to talk about work.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.768
You're my diary, Mr. Bang.

00:27:05.395 --> 00:27:07.230
Then buy all this for me, will you?

00:27:08.148 --> 00:27:09.232
How much is it?

00:27:09.315 --> 00:27:10.275
It's 5 for 50,000 won.

00:27:13.903 --> 00:27:14.737
Twenty thousand?

00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:20.827
I think it'd be best

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.663
to use Yeouido Pirates
to shape public opinion.

00:27:23.746 --> 00:27:26.416
Unlike Ms. Song and Madam Choi,
who utilize the press,

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:27.917
you can reach a younger demographic

00:27:28.001 --> 00:27:30.128
and deliver a stronger message
in cyberspace.

00:27:31.129 --> 00:27:32.714
After all, Yeouido Pirates is

00:27:32.797 --> 00:27:36.468
the number one source
for public opinions, intel, and rumors.

00:27:38.052 --> 00:27:39.095
"Yeouido Pirates"?

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.806
What is that?

00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:44.058
You don't know?

00:27:46.895 --> 00:27:47.729
YEOUIDO PIRATES

00:27:47.812 --> 00:27:50.315
REGISTER NEW USER

00:27:53.735 --> 00:27:55.945
Nam Dong-gi, that punk.

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:59.991
So this is what he was talking about,
the pirates, premium intel, or whatever?

00:28:00.074 --> 00:28:03.703
The thing is,
you need an invite to register.

00:28:04.287 --> 00:28:06.080
But I'll gladly use my one and only invite

00:28:06.664 --> 00:28:08.541
on you, sir.

00:28:12.879 --> 00:28:13.713
{\an8}Done.

00:28:15.798 --> 00:28:16.841
{\an8}- It's done?
- Yes, sir.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.304
What?

00:28:22.972 --> 00:28:24.599
Referral from "SexyGuy"?

00:28:24.682 --> 00:28:26.768
Oh, that's my username.

00:28:29.354 --> 00:28:32.148
It appears I've claimed your title
before you could.

00:28:34.943 --> 00:28:36.736
Jeez. Mr. Cha.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.155
I get that it's
an anonymous forum and all,

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:42.325
but you should still maintain
some class and act your age.

00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:43.910
Seriously, what is that?

00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:47.622
Jeez. Sexy, my foot.

00:28:49.749 --> 00:28:51.167
Let's see here.

00:28:53.294 --> 00:28:54.963
HANMIN CHAIRMAN'S EX-WIFE
HAS BEEN CAUSING A STIR IN YEOUIDO

00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:56.256
{\an8}I SAW THAT WEIRD WOMAN TOO
WHO IS IT? A CELEBRITY?

00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:58.633
They know what they're talking about.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.224
Time to churn that rumor mill.

00:29:08.142 --> 00:29:14.107
"My peers in their twenties and thirties
are always talking

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:18.278
so much smack about Nora's mama."

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.614
"They say she's crass

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:23.575
and flippant."

00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:27.495
Nice.

00:29:27.579 --> 00:29:29.038
YOUNGFIFTY: MY PEERS
IN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES…

00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:31.666
What's this?

00:29:31.749 --> 00:29:34.043
EXPOSING THE ALLEGED BACKROOM TIES
BETWEEN HANMIN AND DK VENTURES

00:29:34.127 --> 00:29:36.880
SOURCES CLAIM HANMIN AND DK'S TIES
GO BEYOND A SIMPLE INVESTMENT…

00:29:44.053 --> 00:29:47.015
President Shin,
have you heard of Yeouido Pirates?

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:53.062
It's a cyber community that's considered

00:29:53.146 --> 00:29:56.566
the top source for public opinion
and sentiment in Yeouido.

00:29:57.233 --> 00:30:00.278
And someone posted
that scandalous allegation there.

00:30:00.361 --> 00:30:01.821
I thought it'd be best for me

00:30:02.447 --> 00:30:05.658
to discuss this matter with you,
before the chairman finds out about it.

00:30:07.702 --> 00:30:11.164
I mean, we can't have
such baseless claims going around.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.458
Perhaps it wasn't baseless,

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:16.836
but written by a whistleblower
who knows something.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.504
It must be shut down without warning.

00:30:19.088 --> 00:30:23.468
Don't you think that'd make it
too obvious that we stepped in?

00:30:23.551 --> 00:30:26.471
You said it was the top source
for public sentiment.

00:30:26.554 --> 00:30:28.139
There must be others lying in wait.

00:30:28.806 --> 00:30:31.309
We must give them a warning
and make an example.

00:30:34.729 --> 00:30:37.690
Do you know people at the Ministry
of Information and Communication?

00:30:38.858 --> 00:30:41.486
When it comes to government agencies,

00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:43.154
I have a direct line.

00:30:49.118 --> 00:30:52.622
I'll entrust you with
shutting down Yeouido Pirates then.

00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:55.458
Considering the seriousness of this task,

00:30:56.042 --> 00:31:00.088
I believe it would be best to have someone
as trustworthy as you handle this swiftly.

00:31:01.047 --> 00:31:03.716
I also lack knowledge
when it comes to domestic affairs.

00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:05.426
Don't worry.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.762
I can absolutely take care of it.

00:31:09.847 --> 00:31:14.268
Perhaps you'd like to join
and take a look before it's shut down?

00:31:15.103 --> 00:31:17.355
You need an invite to join,

00:31:17.438 --> 00:31:19.023
and I'll use my one and only--

00:31:19.107 --> 00:31:21.067
I'm fine.

00:31:23.277 --> 00:31:24.112
Okay.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.304
EXPOSING THE ALLEGED BACKROOM TIES
BETWEEN HANMIN AND DK VENTURES

00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:05.611
Any updates on Ms. Song?

00:32:06.237 --> 00:32:07.822
I don't think she knows yet.

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:10.408
She's busy dealing with
that post on Yeouido Pirates.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.244
She'll be on your tail
once she realizes the funds are gone.

00:32:13.327 --> 00:32:15.538
Even with Kang Nora helping us out,

00:32:15.621 --> 00:32:18.207
the three of us aren't enough
to make a play for the 12th floor.

00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:28.676
Let's stop here and split it in half,
fair and square.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.013
If we stop now,
we'll be nothing but thieves.

00:32:32.096 --> 00:32:35.224
Not at all.
We'll live our lives in riches.

00:32:35.808 --> 00:32:37.769
We can't stay in Korea anyway.

00:32:37.852 --> 00:32:39.312
Let's go to the US together,

00:32:39.395 --> 00:32:41.814
to Santa Monica Beach.

00:32:42.607 --> 00:32:45.777
Queen Bee, I've been meaning to tell you…

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.070
Yes?

00:32:48.237 --> 00:32:49.447
Gwangalli Beach is nicer.

00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:51.616
Don't ruin my fantasy.

00:32:54.202 --> 00:32:57.455
Anyhow, I think
that "Captain" knows something.

00:32:57.538 --> 00:32:58.790
Who could it be?

00:33:03.377 --> 00:33:05.338
About President Shin…

00:33:07.423 --> 00:33:09.634
It seems he and the CEO of DK Ventures

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:13.012
are unusually close.

00:33:13.096 --> 00:33:16.474
The CEO of DK does frequent the office,

00:33:16.557 --> 00:33:20.269
but I believe he's just seeking
investment advice on Korean companies.

00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:25.274
It appears that DK Ventures does,

00:33:25.358 --> 00:33:28.861
in fact, have ample cash reserves.

00:33:29.904 --> 00:33:30.863
Right.

00:33:31.656 --> 00:33:34.450
What does President Shin
get up to after work?

00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:40.206
I asked him to mentor Albert a while ago.

00:33:40.289 --> 00:33:42.125
I'd say he's gotten closer

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:45.503
to Ms. Kang than to Albert.

00:33:46.921 --> 00:33:47.755
Is that so?

00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:52.885
Well, if that's what he has decided…

00:33:56.055 --> 00:33:56.889
Sir.

00:33:57.431 --> 00:34:00.601
We're receiving inquiries from politicians
who had specifically entrusted us

00:34:01.144 --> 00:34:02.478
with managing their funds.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.690
A Yeouido tabloid

00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:10.236
mentioned Hanmin in a list of companies
on the verge of bankruptcy.

00:34:12.363 --> 00:34:13.447
What the…

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.452
Goodness.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.582
We'll need to do some client management.

00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:31.215
Busan Seagull

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:34.844
- Busan Seagull
- Gwangalli Beach is nicer.

00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:38.306
Have you really forgotten--

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.850
{\an8}COMMUNITY
YEOUIDO NEWS

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:42.852
Why can't I log in?

00:34:42.935 --> 00:34:44.854
Maybe you got banned
for writing something inappropriate?

00:34:44.937 --> 00:34:46.480
I only read posts nowadays.

00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:55.531
{\an8}THIS WEBSITE HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN

00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:57.241
It's being shut down?

00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:03.456
You know Yeouido Pirates
has been shut down, right?

00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:06.918
This is an attack on the free press.

00:35:09.295 --> 00:35:10.671
We're talking about real people.

00:35:10.755 --> 00:35:13.049
They're behind those monitors,
on PC communications, and online.

00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:16.260
We must expose the perpetrator
behind that heinous deed and--

00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:17.887
My dad and President Shin did it.

00:35:19.138 --> 00:35:19.972
What?

00:35:20.806 --> 00:35:21.849
I see.

00:35:22.433 --> 00:35:25.144
When my dad saw a post
that was critical of both Hanmin and DK,

00:35:25.228 --> 00:35:27.605
he immediately made a call
and shut them down.

00:35:28.606 --> 00:35:30.233
It was upon
President Shin's special request.

00:35:30.316 --> 00:35:32.652
So President Shin ordered him to do it.

00:35:32.735 --> 00:35:35.404
Was it the post
that discussed the backroom ties

00:35:35.488 --> 00:35:36.322
between Hanmin and DK?

00:35:36.405 --> 00:35:38.824
They felt guilty because it's true.
That's why they shut it down.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.535
I will never forgive them.

00:35:44.121 --> 00:35:45.665
I get it, but let's eat for now.

00:35:46.165 --> 00:35:47.500
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:35:50.753 --> 00:35:52.797
That Captain definitely knows something.

00:35:57.927 --> 00:36:01.305
{\an8}Yeouido Pirates is back
with a must-read announcement!

00:36:07.144 --> 00:36:08.604
The Captain posted a new announcement!

00:36:12.483 --> 00:36:14.235
"If you keep coming after us,

00:36:14.318 --> 00:36:17.321
we will expose the details
of Hanmin's slush fund."

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:19.282
The slush fund?

00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:20.241
Hold on.

00:36:20.783 --> 00:36:24.036
"Pildong, general counsel, shell company."

00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:28.124
Pildong was a new law firm
that was established only last November,

00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:31.460
but they ended up
representing Chairman Kang.

00:36:31.544 --> 00:36:32.378
Why?

00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:34.171
Because its senior managing partner

00:36:34.255 --> 00:36:36.507
worked as general counsel
for Hanmin until October.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.093
Subsequently,
they were appointed as counsel

00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:40.928
for three well-capitalized
shell companies.

00:36:41.012 --> 00:36:44.098
We also suspect Hanmin
to be the source of their funds.

00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:45.391
Wait, I know this.

00:36:45.474 --> 00:36:46.809
This was what I was investigating.

00:36:46.892 --> 00:36:48.019
It's an insider.

00:36:48.644 --> 00:36:51.355
The Captain is someone inside Hanmin.

00:36:52.064 --> 00:36:55.860
What if they have
more up-to-date intel than our ledger?

00:36:58.279 --> 00:36:59.864
We must find them
and get them on our side.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.783
Because the enemy of my enemy is an ally?

00:37:20.009 --> 00:37:24.305
YEOUIDO PIRATES IS BACK
WITH A MUST-READ ANNOUNCEMENT!

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.892
This "Captain"…

00:37:29.727 --> 00:37:30.895
I wonder what their deal is.

00:37:33.773 --> 00:37:38.069
You see, I checked it out
to monitor the situation,

00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:39.695
and it seems they're very well-informed.

00:37:40.404 --> 00:37:44.033
They might not be bluffing
about exposing our slush fund.

00:37:45.242 --> 00:37:48.037
What if they really do have
cards up their sleeve?

00:37:54.627 --> 00:37:56.462
The slush fund must be
quite a formidable amount.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.091
Yet you managed to safely avoid
the prosecutors' investigation.

00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:01.842
Well…

00:38:02.593 --> 00:38:04.720
I wouldn't know anything about that.

00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:07.848
Must we work so hard to preserve something
we know nothing about?

00:38:09.683 --> 00:38:10.559
Well…

00:38:11.352 --> 00:38:12.853
The slush fund…

00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:14.814
Ms. Song would know.

00:38:14.897 --> 00:38:16.482
She's always by his side, after all.

00:38:16.565 --> 00:38:17.441
I know nothing.

00:38:18.692 --> 00:38:21.654
First, we must find
the Captain of Yeouido Pirates.

00:38:21.737 --> 00:38:23.697
Right, we should.

00:38:23.781 --> 00:38:24.824
We must.

00:38:24.907 --> 00:38:25.741
Mr. Oh.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.660
I'll leave it to you again.

00:38:28.869 --> 00:38:30.955
Me? Again?

00:38:31.038 --> 00:38:34.208
You've been spearheading
the task up until now,

00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:36.335
so me taking over now would be a bit…

00:38:37.169 --> 00:38:39.213
It would be unideal, right?

00:38:39.296 --> 00:38:40.172
Probably.

00:38:40.256 --> 00:38:42.383
Right. I should handle it.

00:38:43.092 --> 00:38:44.135
- I'll take care of it.
- Yes.

00:38:46.429 --> 00:38:47.930
That jerk.

00:38:52.852 --> 00:38:54.061
Jeez, you scared me.

00:38:54.728 --> 00:38:57.690
Ms. Lee, tell Cha from Research
to come to my office immediately.

00:38:58.274 --> 00:38:59.525
And bring two cups of tea.

00:38:59.608 --> 00:39:00.609
Yes, sir.

00:39:04.822 --> 00:39:08.909
Maybe Executive Director Oh was provoked
by President Shin and Nora's engagement?

00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:12.913
He's become a total henchman
for the president.

00:39:12.997 --> 00:39:14.957
He keeps coming back with updates,

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.751
and the president told him
to find the Captain of Yeouido Pirates.

00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:19.044
See? I was right.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.338
We need to find them first.

00:39:24.258 --> 00:39:25.217
Could the Captain be

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.178
the same person?

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.351
The whistleblower who sent
the slush fund ledger to the president.

00:39:36.103 --> 00:39:38.272
I don't think so, because Yehppee is…

00:39:42.485 --> 00:39:43.486
See?

00:39:43.569 --> 00:39:45.279
You still don't trust me.

00:39:45.362 --> 00:39:48.282
It's not that.
It's just that I need to protect them.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.869
Well, although they abandoned me and left.

00:39:58.918 --> 00:40:00.044
ACCESS PROHIBITED

00:40:00.127 --> 00:40:01.462
ACCESS PERMITTED

00:40:01.545 --> 00:40:02.588
DISCUSSION BOARD

00:40:02.671 --> 00:40:03.506
Here's a preview.

00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:07.343
These are classified documents from Hanmin
for your reading pleasure.

00:40:07.426 --> 00:40:08.427
Roar.

00:40:08.511 --> 00:40:11.222
PREVIEW: CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS
FROM HANMIN EXPOSED

00:40:11.805 --> 00:40:14.058
{\an8}INTRANET DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT
IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL

00:40:17.311 --> 00:40:19.355
We most certainly took care of it.

00:40:19.897 --> 00:40:22.608
But this document was only briefed today.

00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:26.237
It's a classified document
that only an insider would have access to.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.073
These jerks weren't bluffing.

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:32.284
Should I report this to President Shin?

00:40:32.368 --> 00:40:34.662
That would only stir up trouble,
don't you think?

00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:38.123
What is it?

00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:40.251
You suspect someone, don't you?

00:40:42.545 --> 00:40:43.921
Well…

00:40:44.004 --> 00:40:45.339
If it wasn't an insider…

00:40:45.422 --> 00:40:46.257
Yes?

00:40:47.341 --> 00:40:50.386
An outsider must have done it?

00:40:55.057 --> 00:40:56.058
Are you saying

00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:58.644
that the whole country is a suspect?

00:41:01.397 --> 00:41:03.524
Perhaps you should consult
the head of the IT Division?

00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:06.777
Data systems.

00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:08.988
- Networks.
- Yes.

00:41:17.997 --> 00:41:20.040
Mr. Lee from the IT Division told me

00:41:20.124 --> 00:41:22.334
that Executive Director Oh
summoned the head of IT

00:41:22.418 --> 00:41:24.753
and asked who could've leaked
the classified document.

00:41:25.254 --> 00:41:28.674
Then he flipped out and ordered him
to see if there were signs of hacking.

00:41:28.757 --> 00:41:30.968
If it were a hacker,
they would've demanded money,

00:41:31.051 --> 00:41:31.927
not played mind games.

00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:35.639
That classified document
was the intranet improvement proposal.

00:41:35.723 --> 00:41:38.392
The president went straight
to Mr. Lee to take care of it,

00:41:38.475 --> 00:41:39.810
bypassing the head of IT.

00:41:40.394 --> 00:41:42.062
Lee Yong-gi produced it,

00:41:42.146 --> 00:41:45.608
and Albert Oh of Trading
and Cha Jung-il of Research were CC-ed.

00:41:45.691 --> 00:41:47.067
Shin Jung-woo was the recipient,

00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:49.403
and I also snuck a peek.

00:41:50.487 --> 00:41:53.240
Only those five people
had access to that document.

00:41:53.324 --> 00:41:56.410
Then those are
our five Captain candidates.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.414
It's not you, is it?

00:42:01.457 --> 00:42:02.666
Of course it's not me.

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:04.793
Would I be here if I had such talents?

00:42:05.753 --> 00:42:06.587
What about Shin Jung-woo?

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:07.921
It's not him, either.

00:42:08.005 --> 00:42:10.007
Yeouido Pirates was created a year ago.

00:42:11.592 --> 00:42:15.346
Mr. Lee was in the breakroom with me
when that post was uploaded,

00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:16.513
so he's ruled out.

00:42:18.098 --> 00:42:19.558
My gut tells me

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:22.269
that Cha is perfectly capable
of such obnoxious cockiness.

00:42:22.853 --> 00:42:25.898
Gosh, I really hope it's not that jerk.

00:42:30.152 --> 00:42:31.779
Let's try leaking something else.

00:42:39.828 --> 00:42:40.829
Mr. Cha.

00:42:40.913 --> 00:42:42.498
Do you know what happens
when God gets angry?

00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:45.501
He gets cross.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.712
There are two primary Captain candidates.

00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:51.924
Albert Oh and Cha Jung-il.

00:42:59.973 --> 00:43:01.558
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:03.143
Thank you.

00:43:11.902 --> 00:43:14.613
Make it seem like
it was mixed up at the copier,

00:43:14.697 --> 00:43:16.031
and the bait is cast.

00:43:16.115 --> 00:43:18.492
DOMESTIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUTLOOK,
GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUTLOOK

00:43:19.076 --> 00:43:21.161
Hot off the press,

00:43:21.245 --> 00:43:23.789
Hanmin's preliminary budget
for next year unveiled!

00:43:25.833 --> 00:43:27.918
1998 CONTINGENCY BUDGET PLAN

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.840
HANMIN'S PRELIMINARY BUDGET
FOR NEXT YEAR UNVEILED!

00:43:32.923 --> 00:43:36.093
OPERATION COSTS, LABOR COSTS, EXPENSES…

00:43:36.176 --> 00:43:38.178
Do they match up? Do you know who it is?

00:43:39.847 --> 00:43:41.348
This punk…

00:43:49.648 --> 00:43:50.566
Let's get started.

00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:10.669
What are you doing?

00:44:18.802 --> 00:44:20.137
This won't take long.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.221
Try moving your hands.

00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:25.100
It doesn't hurt, right?

00:44:25.184 --> 00:44:27.102
This is for everyone's safety.

00:44:27.895 --> 00:44:29.688
Everyone in Research is gone for the day,

00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:31.982
and Mr. Lee can't come
because he's busy working overtime

00:44:32.065 --> 00:44:33.442
on the last leak by himself.

00:44:34.943 --> 00:44:37.154
Just do as we say, and you'll be fine.

00:44:41.492 --> 00:44:43.285
This sort of genre isn't my thing.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.515
I bought those noodles.

00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:08.685
You just need to answer my questions,

00:45:09.394 --> 00:45:11.396
Captain of Yeouido Pirates.

00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:14.775
What? Me?

00:45:14.858 --> 00:45:16.318
I'm the Captain?

00:45:16.401 --> 00:45:18.237
Yes. You.

00:45:19.363 --> 00:45:21.448
You seem overly confident
about that, Ms. Hong.

00:45:23.116 --> 00:45:24.326
How could I not be?

00:45:29.748 --> 00:45:31.959
GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUTLOOK

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.089
1998 CONTINGENCY BUDGET PLAN

00:45:37.172 --> 00:45:38.549
{\an8}Hanmin's confidential documents

00:45:38.632 --> 00:45:40.759
{\an8}were consistently uploaded
to Yeouido Pirates.

00:45:43.011 --> 00:45:44.388
Based on that,

00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:47.558
we leaked next year's budget plan
to you and Mr. Cha Jung-il,

00:45:49.017 --> 00:45:50.978
our two Captain candidates.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.525
And today,

00:45:56.608 --> 00:46:01.905
a post appeared on Yeouido Pirates
with Hanmin's budget plan for next year.

00:46:01.989 --> 00:46:05.325
Sure. I think I saw
a budget plan or whatever.

00:46:05.409 --> 00:46:06.827
But I don't know how to read that.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:08.370
And why just me?

00:46:08.453 --> 00:46:10.747
Based on that logic,
Mr. Cha should be tied up next to me.

00:46:11.707 --> 00:46:14.459
Because you were the one
who uploaded today's post.

00:46:14.543 --> 00:46:16.920
No, I didn't. I swear it wasn't me!

00:46:18.005 --> 00:46:19.381
It is you.

00:46:20.799 --> 00:46:22.926
We gave different reports to each suspect.

00:46:23.927 --> 00:46:25.971
The new post on Yeouido Pirates

00:46:26.054 --> 00:46:28.932
contained information
that was leaked to you alone.

00:46:29.016 --> 00:46:30.809
The numbers were different, you see.

00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:38.609
Come to think of it,
I was able to join Yeouido Pirates

00:46:39.401 --> 00:46:40.736
with your referral.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.195
Remember?

00:46:43.363 --> 00:46:44.740
Why didn't you ask me?

00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:47.826
- Pardon?
- For an invite to the Yeouido Pirates.

00:46:48.535 --> 00:46:49.411
I can do that for you.

00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:55.417
Really?

00:46:58.211 --> 00:46:59.171
You're right.

00:47:01.214 --> 00:47:02.966
I am the Captain of Yeouido Pirates.

00:47:03.842 --> 00:47:04.676
Oh my.

00:47:05.385 --> 00:47:07.012
Why would the chairman's grandson
do such a thing?

00:47:07.095 --> 00:47:09.181
That's what I'd like to ask you two.

00:47:09.264 --> 00:47:11.725
Why would you two do something like this?

00:47:20.734 --> 00:47:22.527
Big Al. It's me, Yong-gi.

00:47:23.236 --> 00:47:24.696
You're in there, right?

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.073
Let him in.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.909
He's my one and only crew member.

00:47:30.118 --> 00:47:31.662
Mr. Lee is a crew member?

00:47:33.163 --> 00:47:34.289
You two are accomplices?

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:55.769
My dad found out I was in film school,
and he forced me to return to Korea.

00:48:01.066 --> 00:48:03.944
Watching movies all day
eventually got old.

00:48:09.157 --> 00:48:11.326
It felt like I'd been exiled
to an island called Yeouido.

00:48:13.787 --> 00:48:15.914
But some people around me
loved their jobs,

00:48:15.997 --> 00:48:17.791
like Uncle Myeong-hwi.

00:48:19.334 --> 00:48:21.628
I guess I wanted
to do something worthwhile.

00:48:24.131 --> 00:48:26.508
That's when Mr. Lee caught my eye.

00:48:27.843 --> 00:48:30.387
He was a genius hacker geek,
clearly ahead of his time.

00:48:31.972 --> 00:48:35.308
And I picked up top-tier insider intel
at home and at work.

00:48:35.851 --> 00:48:38.145
Since Mr. Lee was serious
about his cyber world,

00:48:38.228 --> 00:48:39.604
I proposed working together.

00:48:48.321 --> 00:48:49.448
{\an8}OPERATION COMPLETE!

00:48:51.825 --> 00:48:52.784
YEOUIDO PIRATES

00:48:52.868 --> 00:48:56.246
- Is it done?
- Now, this is the main page.

00:48:57.581 --> 00:49:00.208
Try writing a post or something.

00:49:00.292 --> 00:49:01.209
- A post.
- Yeah.

00:49:02.586 --> 00:49:05.088
Let's enter the discussion board…

00:49:05.922 --> 00:49:07.090
We need a title.

00:49:08.383 --> 00:49:09.468
"It's finally here."

00:49:10.761 --> 00:49:14.473
"Introducing Yeouido Pirates,
the complete intel collection of Yeouido."

00:49:14.973 --> 00:49:15.974
DISCUSSION BOARD

00:49:16.641 --> 00:49:20.645
"We look forward to a vibrant
and active community of members."

00:49:20.729 --> 00:49:22.063
PUBLISH

00:49:24.733 --> 00:49:25.567
Ta-da.

00:49:27.444 --> 00:49:28.320
It's done.

00:49:29.362 --> 00:49:31.031
- It's up.
- Wow, this is…

00:49:31.114 --> 00:49:32.407
We did it.

00:49:34.326 --> 00:49:35.952
You're the Captain now.

00:49:40.916 --> 00:49:44.669
Here, the members
can freely post whatever they wish.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.675
How did Big Al convince you?

00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:55.263
"Let's become a band of pirates
that sails the sea of information."

00:49:55.347 --> 00:49:57.641
"Let's democratize access
to monopolized information."

00:49:58.141 --> 00:50:00.143
"Let's make a world
where the people of Yeouido

00:50:00.227 --> 00:50:02.103
can call a spade a spade without fear."

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:08.652
How grandiose.

00:50:09.319 --> 00:50:12.030
There was a reason
why you two were attached at the hip.

00:50:12.531 --> 00:50:15.951
That's why you met up here after work,
even after the restructuring.

00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:18.161
Why are you digging into Yeouido Pirates?

00:50:19.329 --> 00:50:20.455
Did Ms. Song put you up to it?

00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:22.833
Maybe my dad?

00:50:22.916 --> 00:50:25.085
Or maybe President Shin?

00:50:25.168 --> 00:50:27.587
As if we'd tie someone up
because someone ordered us to.

00:50:28.171 --> 00:50:30.257
Then why are you doing this?

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:34.219
President Shin and Executive Director Oh
are looking for the Captain.

00:50:34.302 --> 00:50:37.264
We found you first before things got ugly.

00:50:37.347 --> 00:50:38.515
Why?

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.102
We're hoping to make a deal.

00:50:42.602 --> 00:50:44.437
You said in a post on Yeouido Pirates

00:50:45.438 --> 00:50:47.524
that you'd expose the slush fund
if provoked further.

00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:52.112
What's this now?

00:50:52.195 --> 00:50:54.114
What's with that sigh?

00:50:54.197 --> 00:50:56.074
Regarding the slush fund's size
and whereabouts…

00:50:58.451 --> 00:50:59.286
we know nothing.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.331
We just reworked what Uncle Myeong-hwi
let slip when he was drunk.

00:51:03.415 --> 00:51:05.542
They kept coming after us,
so we swung big.

00:51:06.751 --> 00:51:08.837
Can you untie me now?

00:51:10.714 --> 00:51:12.132
Untie me!

00:51:22.017 --> 00:51:25.478
They wouldn't tell on us, would they?

00:51:26.146 --> 00:51:27.981
Who would they tell, and about what?

00:51:28.064 --> 00:51:29.357
We asked about the slush fund.

00:51:30.233 --> 00:51:31.860
But nothing about stealing it, right?

00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:35.447
If anything, they're the ones
shaking in their boots.

00:51:41.995 --> 00:51:44.956
Ms. Hong and Ms. Go
wouldn't tell on us, right?

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.750
Of course not.

00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:49.169
Then why did they ask
about the slush fund?

00:52:01.473 --> 00:52:04.017
I'll go back and ask Ms. Hong about it.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.060
No, don't.

00:52:05.602 --> 00:52:06.770
Go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:52:08.021 --> 00:52:08.855
Okay.

00:52:10.398 --> 00:52:11.358
Have a good night.

00:52:47.852 --> 00:52:48.895
It's been a while,

00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:50.105
Mr. Auto Repair Shop.

00:53:05.537 --> 00:53:06.538
That hurts.

00:53:06.997 --> 00:53:09.582
Let's talk this out, all right?

00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:11.459
At least tell me what you want.

00:53:16.131 --> 00:53:17.007
Hong Keum-bo.

00:53:17.549 --> 00:53:18.383
Hong Keum-bo?

00:53:18.466 --> 00:53:20.343
The woman you came with
to my auto repair shop.

00:53:20.427 --> 00:53:22.220
Just tell me how you know her.

00:53:34.941 --> 00:53:38.236
Do you think I could go
to a birthday party I wasn't invited to?

00:53:38.319 --> 00:53:41.197
To be precise,
another friend did invite me.

00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:42.574
When's their birthday?

00:53:42.657 --> 00:53:44.868
It's December 24th, on Christmas Eve.

00:53:46.536 --> 00:53:49.289
Is it your former roommate's birthday?

00:53:49.956 --> 00:53:51.166
How did you know?

00:53:53.209 --> 00:53:56.046
You mentioned you didn't have
many friends in Seoul.

00:53:58.048 --> 00:54:00.717
You remembered that?

00:54:02.427 --> 00:54:03.511
Yes, well…

00:54:04.512 --> 00:54:06.723
I would've forgotten
if it hadn't been a special day,

00:54:07.307 --> 00:54:09.976
but someone I dated long ago
was also born on December 24th.

00:54:11.686 --> 00:54:13.563
Whenever Christmas carols
played in the streets,

00:54:13.646 --> 00:54:16.107
she'd say it was like
a preview of her birthday.

00:54:28.745 --> 00:54:31.164
Let's help the less fortunate!

00:54:33.917 --> 00:54:36.294
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:54:36.377 --> 00:54:38.213
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

00:54:38.296 --> 00:54:39.798
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:42.217
- A sleighing song tonight
- A sleighing song tonight

00:54:45.136 --> 00:54:48.223
CLOSED ON THE 24TH FOR OUR DAUGHTER
25TH FOR BABY JESUS

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:55.271
{\an8}ULLALA CHICKEN

00:55:17.877 --> 00:55:20.755
Ma'am, this is
way too much food for just us.

00:55:20.839 --> 00:55:22.298
Not at all.

00:55:23.967 --> 00:55:25.802
- Take the leftovers home.
- Okay.

00:55:25.885 --> 00:55:28.221
Honey, you packed the kimchi
and ginseng chicken soup, right?

00:55:28.304 --> 00:55:30.557
Of course I did.

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.977
Bom, Grandma and I are going
to the nursing home to volunteer,

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.603
so have fun with your aunties, okay?

00:55:35.687 --> 00:55:36.604
Okay!

00:55:40.275 --> 00:55:41.442
Auntie!

00:55:48.283 --> 00:55:50.118
Let me check your invitations.

00:55:55.039 --> 00:55:58.418
HONG KEUM-BO'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY INVITATION

00:56:06.426 --> 00:56:07.552
Here you go.

00:56:07.635 --> 00:56:09.179
Thank you!

00:56:09.262 --> 00:56:10.138
It's Christmas Eve.

00:56:10.847 --> 00:56:12.307
Don't you have a date with the president?

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:14.225
He said he had important plans today.

00:56:15.059 --> 00:56:16.686
That's suspicious.

00:56:16.769 --> 00:56:18.855
Could he have another woman?

00:56:19.647 --> 00:56:23.443
You know, like his first love,
an ex-girlfriend, or a secret lover?

00:56:24.444 --> 00:56:25.278
And what if

00:56:26.237 --> 00:56:27.739
she's someone we know?

00:56:33.244 --> 00:56:34.871
Someone at the president's level…

00:56:35.872 --> 00:56:37.248
would probably date an actress, right?

00:56:38.666 --> 00:56:39.792
Maybe Shim Eun-ha from The Last Match?

00:56:39.876 --> 00:56:41.336
Or Kim Hee-seon from Propose?

00:56:42.795 --> 00:56:44.714
Jeez, I'm just kidding.

00:56:45.673 --> 00:56:47.759
How many candles do you want? All 35?

00:56:48.509 --> 00:56:49.928
Just one.

00:56:50.595 --> 00:56:52.764
Is it her first birthday or something?
Right, Bom?

00:56:57.393 --> 00:56:59.312
Sure, it's not like it costs extra.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:03.608
Pink?

00:57:12.075 --> 00:57:13.117
Okay.

00:57:13.201 --> 00:57:16.287
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:57:16.371 --> 00:57:19.290
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:57:19.374 --> 00:57:21.793
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Hong
- Happy birthday

00:57:21.876 --> 00:57:23.670
- Dear Hong Keum-bo
- Dear Auntie Jang-mi

00:57:23.753 --> 00:57:27.048
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:57:34.681 --> 00:57:35.515
Good job.

00:57:38.893 --> 00:57:39.894
Ta-da!

00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:42.313
I wanted us to watch it together.

00:57:42.397 --> 00:57:45.191
They're videos I took
when we were living in the dorms.

00:58:12.927 --> 00:58:14.012
Did you buy that camcorder?

00:58:14.512 --> 00:58:15.805
It looks really expensive.

00:58:17.348 --> 00:58:18.558
Jang-mi!

00:58:19.642 --> 00:58:20.893
What are you doing?

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.481
Cucumber.

00:58:25.565 --> 00:58:27.483
- Cucumber.
- Cucumber.

00:58:30.528 --> 00:58:31.988
Congratulations!

00:58:37.702 --> 00:58:38.870
Have some. It's good.

00:58:40.622 --> 00:58:41.581
Is it good?

00:58:42.999 --> 00:58:44.167
It's so sour.

00:58:44.959 --> 00:58:47.045
- Ta-da.
- Can you do it?

00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:56.387
- Smile.
- Smile.

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.769
Look over here, Bom. Isn't that so cool?

00:59:03.269 --> 00:59:04.646
Look at that!

00:59:07.774 --> 00:59:08.691
It's not easy.

00:59:08.775 --> 00:59:11.486
You broke it!

00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:14.364
It's okay. It's nothing to cry about.

00:59:14.906 --> 00:59:15.948
Sorry.

00:59:16.532 --> 00:59:19.535
My goodness. Should we try again, Bom?

00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:21.287
Do you want a taste?

00:59:21.371 --> 00:59:23.998
Isn't it so good?

00:59:24.624 --> 00:59:25.833
It's good, isn't it?

00:59:27.168 --> 00:59:28.127
Let's have some more.

00:59:30.838 --> 00:59:33.508
Hey, turn on the TV or play some music.

00:59:34.842 --> 00:59:36.010
Let's play some Christmas carols.

00:59:38.513 --> 00:59:39.347
I'm in.

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.516
Whenever Christmas carols
play in the streets,

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:43.476
it's like a preview of my birthday.

00:59:45.603 --> 00:59:48.523
Someone I dated long ago
was also born on December 24th.

00:59:49.857 --> 00:59:51.567
Whenever Christmas carols
played in the streets,

00:59:52.151 --> 00:59:54.320
she'd say it was like
a preview of her birthday.

00:59:58.908 --> 01:00:00.118
We're closed today.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.884
It's so cold.

01:00:19.887 --> 01:00:21.764
What happened to your lips?

01:00:25.435 --> 01:00:27.353
How did you know about my parents' place?

01:00:27.437 --> 01:00:29.897
Wait, are you here to pick up your aunt?

01:00:29.981 --> 01:00:32.358
Aunt Nora and I aren't even that close.

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:36.237
But you two are much closer
than I expected.

01:00:37.947 --> 01:00:39.323
We're not that close.

01:00:43.411 --> 01:00:44.746
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

01:00:46.205 --> 01:00:48.416
That I'm the Captain of Yeouido Pirates.

01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:50.835
I didn't.

01:00:51.627 --> 01:00:53.379
Then I'll keep your secret too.

01:00:55.465 --> 01:00:57.508
Inspector of the Capital Market
Investigation Division at the FSS…

01:00:59.719 --> 01:01:00.970
Hong Keum-bo.

01:01:16.027 --> 01:01:17.069
When did you find out?

01:01:18.279 --> 01:01:20.072
It doesn't seem like
you feigned ignorance.

01:01:20.656 --> 01:01:21.866
Remember Horang Auto Repair Shop?

01:01:23.326 --> 01:01:25.286
A few days ago, I ran into that scary man

01:01:25.912 --> 01:01:27.205
in front of our office building.

01:01:28.998 --> 01:01:30.374
He asked about Hong Keum-bo.

01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:34.754
Hong Keum-bo.

01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:36.506
Hong Keum-bo?

01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:38.466
The woman you came with
to my auto repair shop.

01:01:39.842 --> 01:01:41.427
Just tell me how you know her.

01:01:54.023 --> 01:01:55.900
Fine, I'll tell you!

01:01:55.983 --> 01:01:56.859
I will tell you!

01:02:00.279 --> 01:02:01.447
That pretty highway ghost?

01:02:02.365 --> 01:02:03.574
I haven't seen her since.

01:02:04.784 --> 01:02:06.369
I'm telling you the truth!

01:02:06.953 --> 01:02:08.246
She told me to just go home

01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:10.498
if I didn't want to get beaten up
in some random place!

01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:11.666
Sir.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.089
Damn it, that seriously hurts.

01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:20.299
Why are you so violent?

01:02:21.217 --> 01:02:22.760
He says he doesn't know her.

01:02:25.721 --> 01:02:28.432
Hong Keum-bo might've acted alone.

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:32.854
What should I do with the boy?

01:02:32.937 --> 01:02:34.522
Let Albert go for now.

01:02:51.372 --> 01:02:52.373
Hong Keum-bo.

01:02:55.459 --> 01:02:56.544
"HONG KEUM-BO" SEARCH RESULTS

01:02:58.629 --> 01:03:01.465
{\an8}HONG KEUM-BO, THE FSS WITCH OF YEOUIDO…

01:03:03.342 --> 01:03:04.635
SHE LOOKED INTO HANMIN'S SLUSH FUND…

01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:07.054
"Hanmin's slush fund"?

01:03:07.847 --> 01:03:09.682
You said in a post on Yeouido Pirates

01:03:10.683 --> 01:03:12.768
that you'd expose the slush fund
if provoked further.

01:03:12.852 --> 01:03:14.770
Regarding the slush fund's size
and whereabouts…

01:03:15.646 --> 01:03:16.480
we know nothing.

01:03:26.866 --> 01:03:28.242
I'm looking for someone,

01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:30.745
and I need a clear picture of her face.

01:03:51.474 --> 01:03:53.017
1989 FSS NEW HIRE TRAINING CENTER

01:03:58.481 --> 01:03:59.857
After Uncle Myeong-hwi's accident,

01:04:00.441 --> 01:04:03.903
I once overheard Ms. Song
and my grandfather talking.

01:04:04.487 --> 01:04:07.281
And the demoted FSS inspector
they mentioned then

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:10.326
lied to get a job in my division?

01:04:12.745 --> 01:04:15.206
Did you tie me to a chair
and ask about the slush fund

01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:16.540
as part of your undercover operation?

01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:18.793
That's right.

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.753
I was doing my job the whole time.

01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:26.467
It's too dangerous for you
to continue working at Hanmin.

01:04:28.552 --> 01:04:30.888
Danger and disappointment
can't be reasons for me to give up.

01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:33.849
There's a job I must finish.

01:04:36.936 --> 01:04:39.063
I knew Hong Keum-bo
wouldn't listen, either.

01:04:42.441 --> 01:04:44.235
I'm not sure if you'd accept this deal,

01:04:45.277 --> 01:04:48.698
but you can't be exposed
as the Captain of Yeouido Pirates either.

01:04:50.449 --> 01:04:52.118
Forget being the successor,

01:04:52.201 --> 01:04:53.703
you'd be disowned.

01:04:55.538 --> 01:04:56.956
So how about we both feign ignorance?

01:04:58.332 --> 01:05:00.001
I don't want to feign ignorance.

01:05:00.084 --> 01:05:01.293
I still think

01:05:02.128 --> 01:05:04.213
we're on the same team.

01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:10.052
Don't you need me for your operation?

01:05:11.303 --> 01:05:12.596
Of course, it won't be for free.

01:05:14.515 --> 01:05:16.225
Do you even know what I'm after?

01:05:17.852 --> 01:05:20.229
Would you be willing to turn over
your entire share in Hanmin

01:05:20.813 --> 01:05:22.106
to me?

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.735
If you'd like.

01:05:26.318 --> 01:05:27.194
In return,

01:05:28.112 --> 01:05:30.740
I need to find the culprit who instigated
Uncle Myeong-hwi's accident.

01:06:09.987 --> 01:06:13.574
A lady invites you to dinner,
and you bring toilet paper?

01:06:13.657 --> 01:06:16.077
It's the best housewarming gift.

01:06:17.787 --> 01:06:20.664
Also, the Ms. Hong I know
is incredibly practical.

01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:24.794
We should've asked Mr. Bang to join.

01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:30.549
He wouldn't be able to handle the truth.

01:06:32.301 --> 01:06:33.135
What truth?

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.013
Mr. Lee.

01:06:37.139 --> 01:06:38.182
Take a deep breath with me.

01:06:38.724 --> 01:06:39.558
Inhale deeply.

01:06:40.684 --> 01:06:41.727
Exhale deeply.

01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:45.314
{\an8}1989 FSS NEW HIRE TRAINING CENTER

01:06:48.651 --> 01:06:49.944
You're with the FSS?

01:06:50.486 --> 01:06:52.446
I resigned, so not anymore.

01:06:53.322 --> 01:06:54.490
And you're older…

01:06:54.573 --> 01:06:55.741
Yes, she is.

01:06:58.536 --> 01:07:00.830
Mr. Lee, you look like
you have a lot of questions.

01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:03.332
I do, but I can wait.

01:07:03.415 --> 01:07:04.291
Just come and sit.

01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:12.842
I'll get right to the point.

01:07:12.925 --> 01:07:15.553
This is what Uncle Myeong-hwi compiled
to blow the whistle with…

01:07:15.636 --> 01:07:17.054
It's the slush fund ledger.

01:07:17.138 --> 01:07:19.557
The FSS does not want to investigate,

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.143
and Hanmin is being targeted
by both internal and external forces.

01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:23.769
You mean DK Ventures and President Shin?

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:25.563
We figured out as much.

01:07:26.063 --> 01:07:28.732
Our ultimate goal is to
steal the slush fund, buy up the stock,

01:07:28.816 --> 01:07:31.318
and become the major shareholder
to protect the company.

01:07:35.906 --> 01:07:38.534
Our first target is
the domestic slush funds.

01:07:40.035 --> 01:07:40.870
Who manages them?

01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:47.418
DOMESTIC SLUSH FUNDS

01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:49.253
{\an8}"Managed by Executive Director
Oh Deok-gyu?"

01:07:50.754 --> 01:07:51.589
My dad?

01:08:34.298 --> 01:08:36.133
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:08:36.842 --> 01:08:38.802
{\an8}You keep so many secrets from me, Dad.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:41.430
{\an8}If I become the successor,
it won't be an issue.

01:08:41.972 --> 01:08:43.766
{\an8}Have you heard of the old banknote scam?

01:08:44.266 --> 01:08:47.353
{\an8}- Hong!
- I need the rumor to spread like wildfire.

01:08:47.436 --> 01:08:49.438
{\an8}This must stay between us.

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:52.358
{\an8}Why take such a big gamble, Big Al?

01:08:52.441 --> 01:08:54.318
{\an8}How can we know you're serious?

01:08:54.401 --> 01:08:55.778
{\an8}Do you know who I am, punk?

01:08:56.695 --> 01:08:59.448
{\an8}Reality is definitely different
from what I anticipated.

01:09:00.199 --> 01:09:01.617
{\an8}Let's go for it. Let's do it.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.993
{\an8}This is Song Ju-ran.

01:09:03.077 --> 01:09:04.411
{\an8}Can you check on something for me?

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:05.955
{\an8}Let's get started.

01:09:08.165 --> 01:09:13.170
