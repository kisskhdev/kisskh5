before the accident.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.430
My dad?

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.110
Haven't we reached the farm yet?

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.670
We're almost there, Rose.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.490
But I don't think this is the way back to the farm.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.230
It's a shortcut. We can get there.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.880
You haven't been back for a long time, so you don't know.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.880
Rose, are you okay?

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.170
Din!

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.540
Open the door.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.120
Open the door!

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.710
Open the door!

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.740
Open the door!

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.980
Open the door!

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.760
Go down and talk.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.450
Rose, come with me.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.270
Where are you taking Rose?

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.280
Where are you taking her?

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.790
I'm taking her home.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.660
Are you sure this is the way home?

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.600
I'll take her for a ride.
She hasn't come back for a long time.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.420
But I don't want to see anything.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.800
I think you should go back to your farm.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.220
If you don't want any trouble,
Don't interfere with my relationship with Rose.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.530
Let go of Rose.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.460
No.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.160
If you want to do your best, try it.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.620
Come on.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.480
Uncle Thep told me to take care of Rose.
I won't let go no matter what.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.880
Let go of Rose.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.880
No.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.940
Enough.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.940
It's been years. Din and Wasu.
Why are you still fighting like a kid?

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.340
Then shoot.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.400
Shoot me.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:28.780
Are you not going to shoot?

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.600
For the sake of Rose,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.460
I'll let you go today.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.540
Get in, Rose. I'll give you a ride.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.910
Thank you, but I want to go back by myself.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.190
Rose, come back with me.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:52.940
Rose.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.680
Get in.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.600
Din.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.820
Oh.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.720
Rose.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.190
Don't cry. It's just a minor injury.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.490
Sister Din, it hurts.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.540
Let me take you to apply the ointment.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.240
Move. I'll take care of Rose.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.410
Rose, ride on my back.
I'll carry you home.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.460
Brother Wasu.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.840
I won't fall down like Din did.
You fell and got hurt.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.600
Sister Din didn't hurt me.
I tripped myself.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.580
Sister Din, what's wrong?

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.500
I blame myself for not being strong enough.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.260
I can't carry you.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.520
You're not as tall as Wasu,

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.280
but you're the gentlest and kindest person in the world.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.330
One day, I will become strong.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.530
I'll protect you. I swear.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.370
I promise.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.360
Why are you looking at me?

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.280
Well...

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.730
Am I not like when I was a kid

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.280
I still look the same.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.830
But his personality changed a lot.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.640
What?

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.940
You were different when you were young.
How dare you resist Wasu like that?

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.140
People change when they grow up. That's normal.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.110
I moved to America when I was ten.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.820
We haven't met...
14 years

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.720
Then why?
You can recognize me as Rose.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.600
Uncle Thep.
You always brag about your photos.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.840
I've been watching you.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.130
Rose.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.760
Sister Din, what are you doing?

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.290
I'm sorry.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.300
It'll hurt a little.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.910
I'm sorry.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:52.790
The swelling will go down soon.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.020
I can put it on my own later.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.080
I heard from Most Dang that
You went to the police station?

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.970
How's Dad's case going?

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.650
The police checked the file and said it was an accident.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.530
The police told me

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.770
the driver was careless.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:09.830
But I don't believe it.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.870
Why? Why don't you believe me?

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.890
I think it's strange.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.000
The memory card in the dashcam is gone.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.610
Did someone steal it?

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.560
I'm not sure.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:27.470
When I arrived at the scene of the accident,

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.480
I was shocked, so I didn't notice.

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.370
Maybe I lost my memory card before that.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.370
Maybe it was lost later.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.090
So you were at the scene

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.350
you were there?

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.360
Yes, I was the first one to get there.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.670
I called an ambulance and called the police.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.070
and made a statement at the police station.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.540
Din,
Do you think anyone is suspicious?

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.890
I can't accuse anyone yet.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.070
But before the accident,

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.350
Uncle Thep called me.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.110
He mentioned the owner of Wasperson.
to propose to you on behalf of Wasu.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.260
But he refused.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.660
I never knew about this.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.000
At that time,
I was investigating something very important.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.540
He told me to take care of you

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.660
he asked me to take care of you for him.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:32.210
What?

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.360
It's only temporary until he wakes up.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.420
Rose.
I hope you can go back and think about it.

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.960
Tell me if you have an answer.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.160
Okay.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:14.970
Rose, you know what?

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.090
The whole farm will be yours.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.040
I can't take care of such a big farm alone.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.940
I'm a girl. How can I beat others?

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.550
Rose, you know?

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.870
why dad named you Rose?

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.560
Rose is beautiful and fragile,

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.860
but roses have thorns.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.460
It's for protecting ourselves.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.900
to prevent others from hurting us.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.080
And I believe

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:01.240
my daughter.
you will grow into a strong rose.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.340
Yes Rose will be strong

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.760
You can protect yourself like a rose.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.880
I'll be strong.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:28.840
Take good care of this farm for dad.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.130
Miss Rose.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.200
Did something happen?

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.990
Miss Din called me to come back to see you.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.530
Didn't Din tell you what happened?

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.480
Miss Din and Wasu had a fight.
Did she pull her gun out on the street?

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:50.340
I was surprised too.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:54.960
Din and Wasu
You still don't get along with each other like when you were young?

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.430
Something like that.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.150
NUBANNUN Farm.
Sam Rak Farm and our farm

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:00.310
These three lands are all next to each other.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.860
So it's inevitable to have some friction and arguments.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.900
But it's not just occasional. It happens often.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:12.290
Miss Din's farm workers.
I often fight with the workers at Mr. Wasu's farm.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.400
How are they now?

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.580
Tell me everything.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.300
Are you talking about Din and Wasu?

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:20.980
Yes.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.280
Both of you are pretty.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:28.409
Most Dang. I mean personality.
Not their looks.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.699
Talking about personality, they are two extremes.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.969
Miss Din is a quiet person.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.389
She likes to be alone and doesn't hang out with others.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.030
And Mr. Wasu is a standard fighter.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.449
Mr. Wasu.
He's a big shot here.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.510
Because his father
The owner of Wasperson.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.170
is the chairman of the Cheong-Lai Entrepreneur Association.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.010
So everyone respected him.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.330
The villagers were afraid of him.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.080
Hello.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:58.610
Hello.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.170
How have you been, sir?
Hello, Master.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.070
Have you recovered?

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.280
I'm fine. I don't have a fever.

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.030
Tell me if you need anything.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.930
Thank you, Master.
It's okay You're welcome

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.590
This is my granddaughter.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.050
You’ve grown up.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.700
Say hello to the Lord, you know?

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.530
Hello.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.150
Right

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.000
Oh.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.740
Yeah this

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:26.970
Buy some snacks.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:30.590
I'll leave some for you.
You can use it if you see a doctor again.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.090
Tell me if it's not enough.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.280
Okay thank you
Okay.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.240
Study hard.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:37.560
Okay.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.270
I’m leaving. Bye.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.590
Take care.
He’s kind and everyone loves him.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.940
Bye.
But he is also powerful.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.620
Whatever he says, no one dares to refute.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.020
Even the county head and village head have to give him some respect.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:51.690
What about our farm?

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.350
Our land and Sam Rak Farm.
NUBANNUN Farm is next to it.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.480
Have you ever had a conflict with those two families?

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.110
There's nothing wrong with Sam Rak's farm.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.400
Master and Miss Din are close.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.370
Since Miss Din's father passed away,

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.470
Master has been taking care of Miss Din.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.820
In Miss Din,
After taking over his father's farm,

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.740
Master has been teaching him how to run the farm.
Like this.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.200
How can she do business planning?
It can...

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.260
the nutrients of vegetables.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.780
It will be high, you know?

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.690
When the leaves grow,

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.510
you have to plant them in order.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.140
When something happens
Two at a time.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.770
Miss Din will come to ask you for advice.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.550
Hello, uncle.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:16.650
Oh, Din.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.640
Hello. Have a seat.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.730
Why are you here?

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.500
I'd like to know which type should I use.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.510
Sure.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.920
And whenever Master is in trouble,

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:28.140
Miss Din always helps.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.530
Miss Din...
as the elder of the family.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:34.140
Master also loves Miss Din very much.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.510
After the accident,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.410
since Master's accident.
he was taking care of our farm.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.290
Din is really trustworthy, right?

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.720
She's different from the Din I knew before.
It's different.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.090
Of course she's trustworthy.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.150
What about Nubanun Farm?

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.160
Are you close with their family?

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.290
No problem.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.890
These two farms usually walk around each other.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.910
Before the accident,
They even came to the farm to look for Old Master.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.080
What is he doing here?

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.080
I overheard it.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.390
I heard it when I was passing by.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.890
I think it's about you and Wasu.
Marriage.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.290
Din told me about it too.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.480
But if Dad...
She really wanted me to marry Wasu.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.490
why didn't Dad ever tell me about this?

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.730
I think it's a little strange.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.930
Thank you.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.750
I will find a way to pay you back, Master.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.540
Without your help,
My mom must be in a bad situation.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.080
Wait, don't return it.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.420
We're friends.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.060
Tell me if you have any difficulties.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.490
Go, go.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:09.390
Thank you.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.800
Did they come to ask for money again?

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.350
Dad, you're really enjoying the money.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.160
Just give it to them.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.320
These people

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:35.110
Just give them some money.
will be obedient like dogs.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.460
It'll be easier for us to order them around.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.310
Yes.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.970
Yes.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.160
I heard you went to the hospital.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.360
Did you see Rose?

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.720
Yes dad

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.220
Rose

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.330
It's pretty. I like it.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.700
What's her attitude towards you?

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.380
Is our plan possible?

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.580
Rose is still worried.
About Uncle Thep,

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:11.580
So I didn't dare to take the initiative.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.570
We don't have much time.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.510
You have to make Rose fall in love with you.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.920
I'm afraid it won't be that easy, dad.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.270
I wanted to buy some time with my car

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:27.130
so I could talk to Rose for a while.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.670
In the end, Din had to get involved.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.270
She said,
Uncle Thep told her to take care of Rose.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.890
I wonder if Rose will believe her.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:40.080
Just tell Rose.
She said you're her fiance.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.310
It's a marriage arranged by two elders.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.550
Will Rose believe me?

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.880
If I said Rose would believe me.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.460
Kaeyew, you can go back first.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.100
I’ll stay here for a while.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:33.670
Okay.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.870
Is something bothering you lately, Din?

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.130
I have something to deal with.
I have a lot to think about.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.350
Because...
Is it about the Lord of Theakon?

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.120
Yes.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.750
I'm sure it wasn't an accident.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.240
But we have no evidence.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.800
And the dashcam is gone.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.470
I must find out the truth.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.530
But for the time being,

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.940
for Uncle Thep.
I'm going to work at Choomhan's farm.

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.470
Please take care of our own farm.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.990
Don't worry, Miss Din. Go ahead.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.570
Although Miss Rose is back,
But she might not be able to help much.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.510
Thank you so much.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.910
With you, my work is much easier.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.400
But Din,
You have to go to Chiang Mai to talk about work.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.620
Okay.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.550
I’m leaving.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.230
Hello, Lom.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.810
I need your help.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.550
Your men must have destroyed all the evidence.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.090
Tell your men to get ready.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.020
If everything goes well,

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:35.640
we'll be in big trouble soon.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.600
That old man knows everything.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.740
If we just leave him like this,

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.740
What if he wakes up?
we'll be in trouble, Dad.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:52.120
If we do it now,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.570
the police will immediately notice it wasn't an accident.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.540
That's too risky.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.020
Why don't you just die?

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.110
What a tough life.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.580
When he wakes up, he'll die.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.670
Yes, Miss Din.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.600
[Did everything go well?]
How's Rose?

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.310
Is everything going well?

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.800
Yes.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.070
Miss Rose went to bed

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.400
and went to bed as soon as it got dark.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.400
Is there anything unusual?

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.590
No.

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.120
Before you go to bed,

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.550
before you go to bed.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.850
Call me if anything happens.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.050
Don't bother me.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:03.490
Okay.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.130
Miss Din, if you're so worried,

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.980
why don't we move in together?

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.380
Don't worry, Din.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:19.170
I'll patrol and check every hour.

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.510
Thank you.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.110
Okay.

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.900
My mouth is so annoying.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.550
You can check again.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.400
My mouth is so fast.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:33.700
Ah, ghost.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.530
I've never been in a relationship before.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:37.200
Don't do anything to me. I'm scared.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.970
It's me, Most Dang.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.480
Oh, it's Miss Rose.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:43.600
You scared me.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.330
I can't sleep. I'm hungry.
So I came down to find something to eat.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:48.560
Maybe the jet lag didn't reverse.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.610
Then why didn't you turn on the light?

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:53.750
Why are you sneaking around?

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:55.930
Actually, you can tell me.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:57.430
I'll bring it up for you.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.520
It's okay.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.100
But

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.980
Why is the fridge full of my favorite food?

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.450
I didn't buy it.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.150
When Miss Din knew you were going back to Thailand,

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:13.520
she bought a lot of cakes.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.810
The cake you were going to eat

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.650
was also bought by Din.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:20.530
Why are you so nice to me?

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.910
Did you drug me?

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.980
No. Trust me.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.940
Miss Din is so pretty.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.450
She must be a good person.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.250
Do you want anything else?

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.780
Yes.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.200
Where is the locker I used to have?

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.070
I couldn't find it in my room.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.140
I think it's in the storage room.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:49.560
I'll get it for you

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:50.050
Okay.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.840
Okay.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:13.610
I haven't been back for a long time.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.070
So I want to recall some old memories.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:19.150
But this is dirty.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.880
Should I clean it up for you?

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.370
It's okay.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.700
It's still here.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.280
Dad left everything for me.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.070
What kind of doll is this?

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:42.770
The stitches are ugly.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:45.560
It's a doll from childhood.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.690
It broke its arm when I was young.

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:51.650
I wrapped it with tape, but it didn't get fixed.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.290
So Din took it to fix it for me.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.650
It's like this now.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.020
Ah, Miss Din did it.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.610
Can I take back what I said just now?

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.830
I fixed it for you.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.100
Sister Din is amazing.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.320
What do you want to play today, Rose?

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:19.510
I want to play Princess Prince's game.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.510
But Brother Wasu has gone home.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.260
Now there's only a princess and no prince.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.110
Sister Din will be my prince.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.500
But I'm a girl.
How can a girl be a prince?

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.870
So what?
A girl can be a prince too.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.940
Sister Din is so handsome.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.830
I've dressed you up as a prince. What's next?

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:06.180
The princess and the prince are getting married.

Huh?

If the prince is willing to accept the princess,

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:34.700
please accept this rose.

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:30.200

Do you know what I said

00:51:55.790 --> 00:52:00.940
I said I'll always take care of you

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:08.750

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.550
You know what I mean, right?

In any case, we'll be a family.

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.250
I want to fulfill my promise to your father.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.460
Rose, what do you think?

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.270
Move to Sam. Rak's farm is with me.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:31.350
You want me to move to Sam Rak's farm?
