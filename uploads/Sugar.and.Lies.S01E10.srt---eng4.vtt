00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.600
Sorry about that.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.040
It's fine, really.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.320
Not a big deal.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.800
Oh, that won't do.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.920
How about this?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.520
This coffee's on me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.160
And I'll find a dry cleaner

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.580
and have your clothes cleaned.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.760
Do you honestly feel that guilty?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.800
Then stay with me for five minutes.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.320
Because...

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.880
I feel a bit uneasy.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.960
What's going on?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.760
Are you feeling unwell?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.520
Let me you to the hospital?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.400
Not sure which hospital

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
treats loneliness.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.520
Your way of starting a conversation

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.760
is pretty unique.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm Miaomiao.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.080
Miao with six water strokes.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.920
Wanna get to know each other?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.280
I'm Hu Yitong.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.960
Your parents must love playing mahjong.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.520
Hu.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.400
Yi.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.240
Tong.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.120
That is

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.520
how we met.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.960
We had some amazing times together.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.080
But we broke up soon after.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.300
Miaomiao was great in every way.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.880
She just got a little too clingy.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.400
When I was with her,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.960
I often felt trapped underwater.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.520
Even breathing felt like a crime.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.140
(Even you turned your back on me.
Leaving is my only choice.)

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.040
In my whole life,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.720
everyone keeps leaving me behind.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.440
Dad walked away from me.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.240
Then Mom left me too.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.140
My brother turned his back on me.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.280
And now you're leaving me as well.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.200
Leaving is the only choice I have.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.400
Miaomiao.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
Chen Miaomiao.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.280
You're losing it.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.990
We've been together for barely half a year.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.720
And things like this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.080
happen almost every month.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.440
I'm honestly exhausted.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.920
I'm drained.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.360
Then I met Ding Daang.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.400
That's when I realized there are

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.980
still people in this world like her,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.760
open-hearted,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.560
reasonable,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.880
and genuinely lovely.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.760
That's enough!

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.880
Shut up.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.720
Yu Kun.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.480
What are you so afraid of?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.720
If something really happens to Miaomiao,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.590
you should take responsibility.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.120
Because the one who hurt her the most

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.760
is you, her own brother.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.440
Brother.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.880
It's me.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.120
Miaomiao.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.920
Brother.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.200
Hold on.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.120
All visitors must register
with the company.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.040
Unrelated individuals

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.200
are not allowed to enter here.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.480
Don't disrupt our work.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.440
Is that really your excuse for cheating?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.360
I have more than enough evidence

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.520
to prove that

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.600
you were dating

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.960
Ding Daang

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.560
and Miaomiao at the same time.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.080
You're just a jerk
who played both sides.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.800
So

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.480
what do you want?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.200
It was Miaomiao who kept clinging to me.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.000
You came back trying every trick

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.540
to break me and Ding Daang apart,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.390
but it didn't bring me and Miaomiao together.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.240
Enough!

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.560
So you came back

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.400
to run away with me

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.520
for Miaomiao's sake?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.440
Of course not.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.600
I just wanted you to see
what kind of guy he really is.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.280
You knew everything all along,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.320
but you never told me.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.240
What do you take me for?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.680
Some tool to get back at Hu Yitong?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.800
Miaomiao is my sister.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.840
I can't just stand by

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.640
and watch her slipping deeper
into the dark.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960
Then what about me?

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.040
Ding Daang.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.360
I already gave you a choice.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.440
Now,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.840
it's up to you.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.840
A choice?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.600
How am I supposed to choose?

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.920
Should I choose him,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.720
a two-timing jerk,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.120
or should I choose you,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.840
the liar who used me all along?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.080
Get out of my shop.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.160
Out.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.640
Ding Daang, listen to me.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.480
Ding Daang.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.280
Ding Daang.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.480
Get out of my shop!

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.760
Get out of my shop!

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.920
Get out!

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.100
(Suga Love)

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.280
Yu Kun.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.120
Your data can be inaccurate sometimes.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.680
Keep working.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.960
How I handle things

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.120
is not your business.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.680
You know exactly

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.800
what you've done.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.500
If you dare to stop

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.040
my engagement ceremony with Ding Daang,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.040
the one paying the price

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.200
might be your Keep Love.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.320
So you're threatening me?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.040
If I'm not mistaken,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.880
my chance encounter with Miaomiao

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.840
was your setup, wasn't it?

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.880
Miaomiao was one of your subjects too.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.240
My breakup with her

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.160
made the success rate of your experiment

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.440
fall short of 100%.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.640
You next round of funding could fail.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.640
So,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.320
you came to Ding Daang

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.400
purely for your career, right?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.960
Hu Yitong,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.880
Please stop making things up.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.280
Honestly, I'm glad

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.400
I didn't end up being a family

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.120
with someone like you, who'd turn

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.690
their back on their own blood.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.240
Boss,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.280
Chen Miaomiao is

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.880
our twenty-third volunteer.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.680
She's a perfect subject.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.760
Xibei,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.520
how's the matching result?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.420
(Name: Hu Yitong. Basic Information)

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.660
Where am I supposed to find him?

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.120
Always trust Keep Love.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.560
It can create a thousand different ways

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.760
to bump into him by chance.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.600
Keep Love

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.080
even scripts your encounter,

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.200
so you can say exactly

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.280
what he's longing to hear.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.640
Congratulations,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.200
Miaomiao.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.520
You're about to start

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.040
your love journey
under the help of Keep Love.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.200
I'm Miaomiao.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.960
I'm Hu Yitong.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.720
Is it really worth it?

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.480
When he left back then,
you were like this too.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.600
It's been so many years.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.920
Why can't you just let yourself move on?

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.080
Ding Daang,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.640
you're still defending him.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.320
You're defending this jerk?

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.640
Let go.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.680
Believe it or not, I might hit you too.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.360
Come on then, do it.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.000
It's not like you haven't before.
