WEBVTT

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.572
Now, we must decide
which prince to place on the throne.

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:52.699
We must establish a new ruler

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:55.577
so that we can persuade
and rally the other scholar-officials.

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.955
The prince we will place on the throne
is Yi Yeol,

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:00.665
Grand Prince Dowol.

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.625
They're plotting against the king.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.043
We must move up the plan.

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:05.670
We'll gather the exiled officials and…

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.089
Lady Sukeui,
Chief State Councilor Han Seung-rok…

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:10.592
If we raise an army, there is a chance.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.969
We act for what is right,
not for the odds.

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:15.388
Delay will only bring more suffering
to the people.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:17.265
We must rally the officials first.

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:19.475
Without a settled court,
this turmoil will continue

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:20.935
even under a new ruler.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:23.563
That can be discussed
once the throne is secured.

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:25.231
Using force is not an option.

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:27.483
Power can only be checked
by greater power.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.652
I agree. Bloodshed is inevitable.

00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:32.322
Bloodshed? We are not like
the military officials of late Goryeo.

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.824
Even if it ends in failure,
what we stand for will remain.

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:37.744
That's right.
Somebody will continue the fight.

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:41.164
{\an8}That was quite heated, wasn't it?

00:01:45.293 --> 00:01:46.419
{\an8}Why…

00:01:47.337 --> 00:01:48.838
{\an8}Grand Prince Dowol?

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:52.383
{\an8}A scoundrel, an idler,
a philanderer, a wastrel.

00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:54.677
{\an8}That's what they call him.

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.389
{\an8}He must have had to hide his true self
behind those disgraceful nicknames.

00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:02.685
{\an8}Until his final moments,

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:05.021
{\an8}the late king sought
to depose the Crown Prince,

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:07.232
{\an8}and establish Grand Prince Dowol
as the rightful heir.

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:09.692
{\an8}And now, I understand why.

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:11.861
{\an8}He must have seen the makings of a king

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:13.154
{\an8}in the young prince.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.866
The makings of a king?

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.410
His kind heart for the people.

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.830
It's what the current king doesn't have.

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.501
You've seen it too.

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:29.629
When you were stealing for the sick,

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.547
when you brought
corrupt officials to justice,

00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:34.384
and when you were helping
the people at the leper camp,

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:38.012
the Grand Prince was always by your side.

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:43.268
It was also deeply moving

00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.895
when he stepped forward before the king
to save your brother.

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:48.606
It's the power of love.

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:02.912
As you said,
I know Grand Prince Dowol well.

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:05.206
So I know he will not join your plot.

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:10.378
We will keep our existence hidden
from the Grand Prince.

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:14.465
We will offer him the throne
once we succeed in overthrowing the king.

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:16.050
May I ask why?

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:20.013
If we include the Grand Prince in the plot
and fail,

00:03:20.596 --> 00:03:22.306
he will be beheaded immediately.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.100
And that must not happen

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:26.352
so that there will be another chance.

00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:29.981
So the Grand Prince must remain alive

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.775
until the next attempt
because he is meant to become king?

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:43.077
From what I saw today,
with so few officials and scholars,

00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:44.662
this is bound to fail.

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:46.289
There will be nothing but death ahead.

00:03:46.372 --> 00:03:47.665
We will fight regardless.

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.084
Even if all that awaits us

00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:52.086
is death.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.382
Is this not your resolve as well,
Gil-dong?

00:04:17.362 --> 00:04:19.280
You're wrong, Lady Sukeui.

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:21.157
I won't let this body

00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:23.451
die like that.

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:29.749
Let's go.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.042
Somewhere far from the palace,

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:32.168
somewhere far from Joseon.

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:44.847
I…

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:47.350
can't go.

00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:53.523
You already

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:56.192
knew.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.616
You already made up your mind.

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.327
You were already

00:05:06.994 --> 00:05:08.454
with them.

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:20.341
Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:24.053
I needed time to understand

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:26.431
why they are trying to change the world,

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:28.224
and why my lord challenged His Majesty,

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:30.393
risking his own life.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:31.853
And?

00:05:32.478 --> 00:05:34.647
Those people are fighting to survive.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.482
And my lord

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:39.902
probably tried to help
people like them survive.

00:05:41.654 --> 00:05:42.488
And?

00:05:42.572 --> 00:05:44.365
If we go back to our own bodies,

00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.075
I'll join them as Gil-dong.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.035
They're using you
because you're a commoner.

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.953
I know.

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:51.998
Once you're caught as a traitor,
you'll be torn limb from limb.

00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:53.457
I'm prepared for that.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.420
How can you

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:01.549
speak of your death
so lightly in front of me?

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:09.348
Because the new king they want

00:06:10.725 --> 00:06:12.018
is you.

00:06:15.438 --> 00:06:16.689
So you should also--

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:17.607
No.

00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:21.277
You're wrong.

00:06:22.862 --> 00:06:23.696
What do you mean?

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.240
If you choose
to become a traitor as Gil-dong,

00:06:26.324 --> 00:06:28.576
I'll stand with the royal family
as the Grand Prince.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.996
They're defying the royal traditions
upheld for generations

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.999
and trying to overthrow the realm
and its king.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.335
I can't let them do that.

00:06:37.418 --> 00:06:39.128
So I have learned.

00:06:41.881 --> 00:06:42.924
But--

00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:45.509
I will never be the traitors' king.

00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:47.261
Which means this plot

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:49.472
is bound to fail.

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.184
That is my decision.

00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:15.289
Eun-jo, it's your mother. I'm coming in.

00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:21.087
You must be tired.
Finish up and go to bed.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.005
After this.

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:25.216
What are you writing about?

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:28.844
We will fight regardless.

00:07:29.262 --> 00:07:30.429
Even if all that awaits us

00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:32.139
is death.

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:37.019
I'm trying to give your daughter
a long and healthy life.

00:07:38.813 --> 00:07:41.148
How long do you want to live?

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:44.819
Until "happily ever after"

00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:48.781
becomes her ending.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.517
Remove her.

00:08:58.601 --> 00:08:59.685
I beg Your Majesty's mercy.

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:01.646
I beg Your Majesty's mercy!

00:09:02.605 --> 00:09:04.732
I will reorganize the courtesans.

00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:08.653
Geum-nok's cold has lasted quite a while.

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:11.906
She's getting her strength back now.

00:09:26.587 --> 00:09:28.631
I was really worried
after you left like that.

00:09:28.714 --> 00:09:29.882
You must be conflicted, but--

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:31.676
No, my head is clear.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:34.804
I'm only thinking about
how I can bring the plotters down.

00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:39.392
What is it?

00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:47.650
The names of the plotters
I saw with your eyes last night.

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.403
What will you do with this?

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:55.241
What do you think will happen
if I take this to the king?

00:09:57.535 --> 00:09:58.703
They'll all be killed.

00:10:02.623 --> 00:10:03.874
That's not like you.

00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.710
If you want me to stay as I am,

00:10:05.793 --> 00:10:07.545
then stop me.

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:13.884
If you change your decision
to stand with them,

00:10:13.968 --> 00:10:15.428
no one needs to die.

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:19.098
I'll give you one day.

00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:20.891
You make the decision.

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:36.073
One day?

00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:54.759
Thanks.

00:10:55.342 --> 00:10:56.260
Take care.

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:01.515
I must follow him.

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:15.196
This is…

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.780
Is this Chief Secretary Im's house?

00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:20.618
Why did Chief Secretary Im's guard

00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:23.329
approach the fake Gil-dong's body?

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:28.542
One. The Chief Censor
wrote Gil-dong's name before he died.

00:11:28.626 --> 00:11:31.879
Two. The fake Gil-dong was killed
by an arrow before he was arrested.

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:35.341
Three. The person who approached
the fake Gil-dong's corpse

00:11:35.424 --> 00:11:36.717
was Chief Secretary Im's guard.

00:11:39.637 --> 00:11:40.471
But why?

00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:43.140
Wait.

00:11:44.558 --> 00:11:47.019
What if there was intent
behind their actions?

00:11:47.102 --> 00:11:50.147
One. The murderer of the Chief Censor
had to be Gil-dong.

00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:53.567
Two. The fake Gil-dong
had to be arrested after his death.

00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:57.905
Three. Chief Secretary Im's guard had
to get rid of the fake Gil-dong's body.

00:11:57.988 --> 00:11:58.989
Why?

00:11:59.907 --> 00:12:01.784
Because the Chief Censor was murdered by…

00:12:06.038 --> 00:12:07.665
Chief Secretary Im.

00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:15.589
Did you do as I said?

00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:21.220
What kind of incense is this?

00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:29.645
It will

00:12:30.354 --> 00:12:32.690
bring peace to the king.

00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:48.664
Wouldn't it be better
if I went to find him?

00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:51.584
I know this house well.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:54.211
And I'm a pretty elusive thief, you know.

00:12:54.795 --> 00:12:56.422
I seriously can't get used to this.

00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:59.550
Whether you are His Highness or Hong-si,

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:01.468
when I give you the signal,
come out at once.

00:13:05.764 --> 00:13:08.767
If the secret had to be kept
at the cost of the Chief Censor's life,

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:10.144
it must be a pretty serious one.

00:13:10.227 --> 00:13:11.770
At least in Joseon…

00:13:20.904 --> 00:13:22.573
What is taking so long?

00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:28.704
I'm sorry.

00:13:28.787 --> 00:13:30.122
You'll wake up soon.

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:51.352
Your Highness?

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:52.519
What are you doing here?

00:13:52.603 --> 00:13:54.229
Please help me.

00:13:54.313 --> 00:13:55.731
I must head to the palace now.

00:14:04.948 --> 00:14:08.077
What are you stealing
from my family's annex?

00:14:12.414 --> 00:14:13.582
Lady Jang?

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:15.167
Put your sword down.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.253
I forgot to shout

00:14:18.337 --> 00:14:20.172
that I found a thief.

00:14:20.923 --> 00:14:23.509
This woman is not an object
that can be stolen

00:14:24.009 --> 00:14:26.470
or an animal to be hung or mistreated.

00:14:28.263 --> 00:14:29.264
Hung?

00:14:30.099 --> 00:14:32.101
Tell the Chief Royal Secretary

00:14:32.184 --> 00:14:34.436
that this woman went
where she wished to go.

00:14:37.773 --> 00:14:38.899
Put that down.

00:14:48.325 --> 00:14:49.702
Let's go.

00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:02.339
Wait.

00:15:04.133 --> 00:15:05.551
Before we reach the palace…

00:15:05.634 --> 00:15:07.511
Why were you held at his house?

00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:11.598
Apparently, he can't stand a lowborn

00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:14.268
having ideas of her own.

00:15:15.978 --> 00:15:17.354
Is that it?

00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:19.023
She had been tortured for days.

00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:19.940
Later.

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:25.237
You look even paler now.
Are you all right?

00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:29.533
This won't do.

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:32.161
Let's get a horse from the constabulary.

00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:33.328
Yes, Your Highness.

00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:42.504
A house call at this late hour?

00:15:42.588 --> 00:15:44.006
They said it's urgent.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.558
It looks pretty bad.

00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:00.981
- What are you doing?
- I…

00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:03.400
I think I should leave.

00:16:03.484 --> 00:16:05.778
I refuse to be in a women-only area.
It's inappropriate.

00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:07.154
What are you saying?

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:08.697
Start from there.

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:11.950
You see, I know you wouldn't understand,

00:16:12.034 --> 00:16:15.871
but I'd be out of my mind to stay here.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.040
Pull yourself together, will you?

00:16:18.123 --> 00:16:20.459
I know you haven't
quite been in your right mind

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:22.336
since what happened to your lord.

00:16:22.419 --> 00:16:24.421
So I overlooked all the mistakes you made.

00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:27.382
But I can't do that now.
Can't you see how bad things are here?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.021
Could you go a little lower?

00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:45.150
Here?

00:16:45.234 --> 00:16:47.152
Can I just take it off?

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:48.362
I'm a bit uncomfortable.

00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:49.655
I'm uncomfortable.

00:16:51.907 --> 00:16:52.991
Here?

00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:56.703
How is it now? Does it feel better?

00:16:56.787 --> 00:16:58.539
You've got the strength of a man.

00:17:00.124 --> 00:17:01.500
You've got good instincts.

00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:03.293
Pardon?

00:17:04.086 --> 00:17:05.796
Does it hurt anywhere else?

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:08.382
The horse is not for His Highness?

00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:11.343
It's a long story.
Lady Jang will ride the horse.

00:17:13.178 --> 00:17:14.138
Geum-nok.

00:17:14.596 --> 00:17:17.182
Lady Jang is here?

00:17:22.688 --> 00:17:23.689
Your Highness.

00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:53.468
It's been a while.

00:17:55.637 --> 00:17:56.638
Do you know each other?

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.644
We once held each other's hands

00:18:03.854 --> 00:18:05.063
and eloped together.

00:18:10.027 --> 00:18:11.195
Here.

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:14.114
I should get going.

00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:29.421
It was before I started wearing
the courtesan wig.

00:18:30.505 --> 00:18:33.717
Why did you choose
not to elope with Aide Park?

00:18:34.343 --> 00:18:36.178
I wanted to become

00:18:36.762 --> 00:18:38.555
the most powerful woman in Joseon.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.099
Your dream came true.

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:42.684
You're now His Majesty's woman.

00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:44.186
Let's run away.

00:18:44.269 --> 00:18:45.479
Somewhere far from the palace,

00:18:45.562 --> 00:18:46.772
somewhere far from Joseon.

00:18:48.315 --> 00:18:51.318
You chose not to run away
with the man you loved.

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:52.402
Have you ever

00:18:53.362 --> 00:18:54.446
regretted that?

00:18:55.906 --> 00:18:56.865
Never.

00:19:08.293 --> 00:19:09.211
One day,

00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:11.755
I may be able to repay this debt.

00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:38.115
Is the cold messing with your mind too?

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:40.993
Could we speak in private?

00:19:42.494 --> 00:19:43.662
Geum-nok?

00:19:44.246 --> 00:19:45.831
I could not stop the Grand Prince.

00:19:51.837 --> 00:19:53.964
How much does the Grand Prince know?

00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:09.479
Go and tell Seung-jae that

00:20:09.563 --> 00:20:13.692
if something bad happens to me,
he should do as I previously ordered.

00:20:14.276 --> 00:20:16.028
Something bad? What will you do?

00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:19.906
Nothing.

00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:30.083
I will do nothing
but wait here for His Majesty's order.

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:34.963
Is this perhaps related
to the bedchamber matter you mentioned?

00:20:37.424 --> 00:20:39.509
What are you plotting?

00:20:55.192 --> 00:20:57.569
His Majesty has granted you an audience.

00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:18.590
Your Majesty.

00:21:24.054 --> 00:21:25.138
Sit.

00:21:27.474 --> 00:21:28.433
Sit on the throne.

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:40.695
It's a royal order.

00:22:19.568 --> 00:22:20.944
Breathe it in

00:22:21.528 --> 00:22:22.863
deep into your lungs.

00:22:27.951 --> 00:22:29.077
Your Majesty.

00:22:40.338 --> 00:22:42.966
Everything I did was for Your Highness.

00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.760
Same old excuse.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.015
Your role was to be my loyal dog.

00:22:53.059 --> 00:22:54.436
That is why

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:57.022
I became the greatest flatterer in Joseon.

00:22:57.105 --> 00:22:59.733
You've enjoyed enough power
pulling the strings.

00:22:59.816 --> 00:23:01.109
Now,

00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:03.612
humbly accept your death.

00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:22.505
This is what you wanted me to be.

00:23:24.758 --> 00:23:28.762
You surrounded yourself
with ministers who bowed to you,

00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:31.765
and brought all the worldly pleasure
into the palace for yourself.

00:23:31.848 --> 00:23:32.682
Am I wrong?

00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:36.853
What lame final words.

00:23:38.188 --> 00:23:40.273
Your trembling hands are your curse.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.610
When did you quit that poison?
A few hours ago?

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.488
Tonight, your body
will be wracked with pain and tremors,

00:23:46.571 --> 00:23:49.532
and you will beg for the poison
before dawn,

00:23:49.616 --> 00:23:50.825
just as you always have!

00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:52.452
Soon, all of Joseon

00:23:53.036 --> 00:23:54.913
will witness your madness.

00:23:56.206 --> 00:23:58.041
To the ministers
who have turned against you,

00:23:58.124 --> 00:23:59.960
your madness will serve

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:01.628
as the perfect justification.

00:24:07.634 --> 00:24:09.261
I'm talking about your fall.

00:24:10.428 --> 00:24:11.888
Do you understand?

00:24:11.972 --> 00:24:13.765
In all of Joseon,

00:24:13.848 --> 00:24:16.059
there's only one person
who wants you on the throne!

00:24:16.643 --> 00:24:18.019
It is I!

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.023
I am the only loyal subject you have!

00:25:23.626 --> 00:25:24.919
The Chief Secretary?

00:25:25.003 --> 00:25:27.505
It seems like he locked Lady Jang up
to manipulate her,

00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:30.175
since he couldn't kill
His Majesty's concubine.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.179
The king's favorite concubine
and the sycophant are at odds now?

00:25:34.262 --> 00:25:35.388
I wonder why.

00:25:41.853 --> 00:25:43.104
You know what?

00:25:43.188 --> 00:25:45.273
I also wonder why you did this.

00:25:45.774 --> 00:25:46.900
What?

00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:49.486
So, last night,

00:25:49.944 --> 00:25:51.571
you broke into Chief Secretary Im's house

00:25:51.654 --> 00:25:54.240
instead of making the decision
you're supposed to make.

00:25:54.991 --> 00:25:56.743
You don't care about what I say, do you?

00:25:57.619 --> 00:25:58.536
I don't think so.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.913
I warned you.

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:01.956
If I don't get your answer today,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.250
I'll hand over
the list of traitors tomorrow.

00:26:07.128 --> 00:26:08.588
Do you think I can't do it?

00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:13.301
One day is too short.

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:15.261
What?

00:26:15.345 --> 00:26:17.764
I thought about it over and over
before making that decision.

00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:20.392
I can't go back on it overnight. I won't.

00:26:21.935 --> 00:26:22.936
Fine.

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:25.980
If you can't do it, I'll stop it myself.

00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:33.238
Let go.

00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:36.741
I can't.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.343
I can't let you go either.

00:27:03.393 --> 00:27:04.644
There's no reason to rush yet.

00:27:04.727 --> 00:27:07.188
I can't do anything
while our bodies are switched anyway.

00:27:07.272 --> 00:27:08.940
Right now, I'm the Grand Prince.

00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:12.569
I know. Right now, I'm Gil-dong…

00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:15.113
Exactly.

00:27:15.822 --> 00:27:19.033
We can talk about it
once we're back in our own bodies.

00:27:21.244 --> 00:27:23.329
Then I wish we never go back.

00:27:23.413 --> 00:27:24.956
Because I will never do anything

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:27.375
under that famous name of yours.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.170
Let's do that.

00:27:30.879 --> 00:27:32.547
I'll live as you for the rest of my life.

00:28:03.745 --> 00:28:06.164
Tonight, your body
will be wracked with pain and tremors,

00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:09.125
and you will beg for the poison
before dawn.

00:28:09.209 --> 00:28:11.127
Play the music louder!

00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:12.504
My ears are ringing!

00:28:44.285 --> 00:28:47.288
I am the only loyal subject you have!

00:28:47.997 --> 00:28:49.916
They are your people, Your Majesty.

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:53.044
Please remember his sincerity.

00:28:53.127 --> 00:28:55.004
That's the only thing I wish for.

00:28:59.092 --> 00:29:00.885
Bring her in.

00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:02.679
May I ask whom, Your majesty?

00:29:05.223 --> 00:29:06.975
Hong Min-jik's daughter.

00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:54.022
I hear you are
Min-jik's concubine's daughter.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.028
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:30:07.827 --> 00:30:10.371
Your spirit isn't that of a lowborn.

00:30:11.414 --> 00:30:12.665
It must come from your father.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.460
That must have been his teaching.

00:30:16.544 --> 00:30:18.630
From what I know,

00:30:18.713 --> 00:30:21.883
he was a man who treasured people,

00:30:21.966 --> 00:30:24.677
never judging them
by their birth or learning.

00:30:27.305 --> 00:30:28.389
He was.

00:30:29.974 --> 00:30:33.436
That's why he treated me,
a dethroned queen's son,

00:30:34.437 --> 00:30:36.230
like a human being,

00:30:36.314 --> 00:30:38.232
unlike my other teachers.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.530
Why did you send me for, Your Majesty?

00:30:48.034 --> 00:30:50.286
To remember

00:30:51.329 --> 00:30:52.580
his sincerity.

00:31:11.724 --> 00:31:13.059
Is this what someone

00:31:14.143 --> 00:31:15.311
who remembers him would do?

00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:26.155
Your Highness,

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.324
even at this very moment,

00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:31.369
the capital is filled with
the cries of people being exploited.

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.579
Outside the capital,

00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:36.457
the sick cry out in anguish
suffering from the plague,

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:40.003
and the streets are filled
with the tears of orphaned children.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.422
Please listen to them.

00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:44.173
Listen to the people, not the flatterers.

00:31:44.924 --> 00:31:47.176
That is the duty of the throne.

00:31:49.137 --> 00:31:50.555
You're right.

00:31:51.723 --> 00:31:54.017
My teacher sent you here.

00:31:55.351 --> 00:31:57.895
I still have a loyal subject!

00:32:03.484 --> 00:32:05.194
I told you not to stop!

00:32:05.278 --> 00:32:06.779
Please stop!

00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:10.199
They can barely stand.
Their bodies are worn to the bone.

00:32:10.783 --> 00:32:13.244
For my new loyal subject,

00:32:14.954 --> 00:32:17.457
I shall throw a feast!

00:32:26.966 --> 00:32:28.634
Physician Hong?

00:32:45.109 --> 00:32:46.444
The music sounds nice.

00:32:47.612 --> 00:32:49.113
It sounds so nice that

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:51.157
I can't hear anything from outside.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.075
Your Highness!

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.789
Hong-si was in His Majesty's bedchamber.

00:32:57.872 --> 00:32:58.748
What?

00:33:26.109 --> 00:33:28.945
We were locked in the palace,
not allowed a single drop of water.

00:33:29.028 --> 00:33:31.364
We had to dance like that all day.

00:33:35.076 --> 00:33:36.702
I broke a bone,

00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:40.039
and His Majesty didn't even care.

00:33:58.724 --> 00:34:00.226
I've been looking for you.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.562
You went to His Majesty's bedchamber.

00:34:06.524 --> 00:34:07.441
Are you all right?

00:34:09.235 --> 00:34:10.111
No.

00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:14.073
What's wrong?

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:17.493
Let's steal them.

00:34:18.077 --> 00:34:18.911
Steal what?

00:34:20.788 --> 00:34:22.331
His Majesty's women.

00:34:27.253 --> 00:34:28.254
I need you to meet

00:34:28.337 --> 00:34:30.464
my mother and the Queen Consort for me.

00:34:31.048 --> 00:34:32.508
If this continues,

00:34:32.592 --> 00:34:34.802
all the courtesans
will die by tomorrow night.

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.180
I need Your Majesties' help.

00:34:40.558 --> 00:34:41.642
I'm sorry.

00:34:43.728 --> 00:34:45.813
If things go wrong,

00:34:45.897 --> 00:34:47.023
tell him it was my order.

00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:50.985
I'm his mother by law.
He won't go so far as to kill me.

00:34:51.068 --> 00:34:52.236
Let it be my order.

00:34:54.405 --> 00:34:56.991
I ordered the women be kicked out,
blinded by jealousy.

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:00.745
I'm his wife in name only,

00:35:00.828 --> 00:35:02.580
but he won't cast me aside.

00:35:03.873 --> 00:35:04.707
Your Majesty.

00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:09.212
Please go now.

00:35:09.295 --> 00:35:11.797
You must save those women.

00:35:19.472 --> 00:35:22.475
I need you to discreetly get the clothing
of the eunuchs and court ladies.

00:35:22.558 --> 00:35:24.060
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.193
Do as I said.

00:35:50.253 --> 00:35:51.504
Who are you

00:35:51.879 --> 00:35:53.256
right now?

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.592
Unfortunately, it's still me.

00:35:57.969 --> 00:35:59.845
Your Highness, please sit here.

00:36:01.722 --> 00:36:03.557
I have something important to tell you.

00:36:06.102 --> 00:36:08.980
Why don't we go see the moon?
We didn't get to see it last time.

00:36:58.446 --> 00:36:59.280
Get out of here.

00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:04.702
I'm here to help you.

00:37:54.043 --> 00:37:56.045
This is as far as I can go. Escape safely.

00:37:59.131 --> 00:38:00.174
Let's go.

00:38:24.198 --> 00:38:26.409
Where are the courtesans?

00:38:27.326 --> 00:38:29.203
We are going
to His Highness' private villa.

00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:36.210
Intruders! Close the palace gates!

00:38:44.301 --> 00:38:46.053
Try to stay in the palace if possible.

00:38:51.058 --> 00:38:53.352
I received the message. What happened…

00:38:53.811 --> 00:38:55.855
- A sword? Why--
- I'll explain on the way.

00:39:08.159 --> 00:39:09.034
I must stop here.

00:39:09.618 --> 00:39:10.953
Please take care.

00:39:11.036 --> 00:39:12.329
Physician Hong.

00:39:16.292 --> 00:39:17.877
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:39:20.629 --> 00:39:21.589
Let's go.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.388
They are nowhere to be found.

00:39:33.642 --> 00:39:36.645
If this was planned,
they must be outside the capital by now.

00:39:38.606 --> 00:39:40.608
- We will go to the port.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:39:53.704 --> 00:39:55.539
- Clear the way!
- Yes, sir!

00:39:56.123 --> 00:39:57.333
Move!

00:40:05.466 --> 00:40:09.178
Your Majesty, I'm Shin Hae-rim,
the Queen Consort's niece.

00:40:09.261 --> 00:40:11.972
I saw Your Majesty at the your wedding.

00:40:13.015 --> 00:40:14.892
Yes, I remember.

00:40:16.936 --> 00:40:19.396
I'm out to see the moon today.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.858
May I ask where you are headed,
Your Majesty?

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.821
Oh, dear. The beautiful moonlight
must have distracted me.

00:40:28.614 --> 00:40:31.242
What are you doing? His Majesty is here!

00:40:32.368 --> 00:40:33.244
His Majesty?

00:40:33.327 --> 00:40:34.828
His Majesty!

00:40:35.663 --> 00:40:38.082
His Majesty!

00:40:43.963 --> 00:40:45.464
Clear the way at once!

00:41:18.664 --> 00:41:19.748
Physician Hong!

00:41:32.803 --> 00:41:33.762
Get down.

00:41:50.779 --> 00:41:51.614
Listen to me.

00:41:51.697 --> 00:41:54.908
The boat won't leave
until you're all aboard.

00:41:54.992 --> 00:41:57.286
So run for your life. Don't look back.

00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:04.418
I'll run till I collapse.

00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:06.462
If I get caught, I'll die anyway.

00:42:06.545 --> 00:42:09.506
I would've died tomorrow anyway
from all the dancing.

00:42:10.799 --> 00:42:13.969
I might as well die
running around here like a lunatic.

00:42:16.096 --> 00:42:17.181
All right. One.

00:42:19.558 --> 00:42:20.893
Two.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.274
Three.

00:42:51.382 --> 00:42:52.841
Over there. Fire.

00:43:05.104 --> 00:43:06.313
Stop them!

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:27.167
Hurry.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:38.804
It's an archer!

00:43:39.388 --> 00:43:41.098
Stay in formation!

00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:43.183
Watch out for the archer's arrows!

00:43:43.267 --> 00:43:44.309
Yes, sir!

00:43:46.937 --> 00:43:47.980
Physician Hong.

00:43:48.063 --> 00:43:49.356
Over there.

00:44:06.707 --> 00:44:09.543
You had to come, after all.

00:44:18.927 --> 00:44:19.928
Physician Hong!

00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:21.180
Come on! Run!

00:44:21.263 --> 00:44:22.306
Now!

00:44:25.392 --> 00:44:28.020
Come on! Run over here!

00:44:52.419 --> 00:44:53.545
It's over.

00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:15.794
Stop them at all costs,
even if it means killing them!

00:46:16.295 --> 00:46:18.630
Kill them all!

00:46:27.014 --> 00:46:27.973
Your Majesty.

00:46:35.022 --> 00:46:37.399
"If you chase those women,

00:46:37.482 --> 00:46:40.902
the next arrow will pierce your heart."

00:46:46.658 --> 00:46:48.577
How did he aim from this distance?

00:46:54.082 --> 00:46:55.876
It's the assassin from that day.

00:47:20.651 --> 00:47:22.778
If you leave now,
you'll at least save your life.

00:47:47.302 --> 00:47:48.595
Please run.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.812
Leave me be.

00:47:57.604 --> 00:47:59.648
I will not beg for my life.

00:47:59.731 --> 00:48:01.149
I'll be the one who begged.

00:48:02.484 --> 00:48:04.486
I appreciate your intention,

00:48:05.779 --> 00:48:07.447
but I do not have a reason to run.

00:48:07.531 --> 00:48:09.616
Are you going to die like a dog here?

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.535
Like some lowborn?

00:48:23.213 --> 00:48:24.840
Tell Seung-jae that

00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:27.008
I am

00:48:28.552 --> 00:48:29.928
coming back soon.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:59.958
There's only one person
who wants you on the throne!

00:49:00.041 --> 00:49:02.043
It is I!

00:49:36.411 --> 00:49:37.579
Bring

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.290
the Chief Secretary.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.180
His Highness said
it would just be for a while.

00:49:55.263 --> 00:49:56.765
Don't worry.

00:49:56.848 --> 00:49:58.058
They may search all of Joseon,

00:49:58.141 --> 00:50:00.310
but this is the last place they'd come.

00:50:00.393 --> 00:50:03.605
A courtesan named No-eul was with us,
but she was left out.

00:50:04.272 --> 00:50:05.857
We don't know if she's alive.

00:50:07.484 --> 00:50:08.693
Go look for her.

00:50:08.777 --> 00:50:09.945
Yes, Your Highness.

00:50:11.738 --> 00:50:12.864
I mean, yes, I will.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.825
Thank you so much.

00:50:14.908 --> 00:50:17.285
Thank you. Thank you.

00:50:21.373 --> 00:50:23.875
Since the courtesans
vanished into thin air,

00:50:23.959 --> 00:50:25.544
I hear the investigation has stalled.

00:50:25.627 --> 00:50:28.922
It is probably beyond their imagination

00:50:29.005 --> 00:50:30.757
that the Grand Prince
would ever help them.

00:50:33.426 --> 00:50:34.553
Thank you.

00:50:35.095 --> 00:50:37.138
It wasn't the most pleasant night
to see the moon.

00:50:39.766 --> 00:50:41.393
I was just so excited

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.479
that I could do something for them
as the same woman.

00:50:50.861 --> 00:50:54.239
His Highness once told me here

00:50:54.865 --> 00:50:57.659
that there was a woman
he could never forget.

00:50:58.827 --> 00:51:00.036
I have always wondered

00:51:00.537 --> 00:51:03.540
how one could be so deeply etched

00:51:04.541 --> 00:51:05.959
in a man's heart.

00:51:08.169 --> 00:51:09.504
But I think I know now.

00:51:14.384 --> 00:51:16.720
It's because that woman is you, Eun-jo.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:22.642
It's Your Highness in there now, right?

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.644
It's just a formality.

00:51:26.396 --> 00:51:28.732
Should I say "no more formality" too?

00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:30.108
It is Your Highness.

00:51:31.276 --> 00:51:33.820
Whoever did this, ghost or god,

00:51:33.904 --> 00:51:36.948
I wonder why they tied you to this fate.

00:51:39.034 --> 00:51:41.494
I asked myself the same question
the other night.

00:51:49.711 --> 00:51:52.255
It happened every time
my life was threatened.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.051
Does that mean that,
if you were to return to your bodies,

00:51:56.134 --> 00:51:58.011
one of you would have to be
in danger again?

00:51:58.094 --> 00:52:00.347
It's just an assumption for now.

00:52:02.182 --> 00:52:03.433
For now, at least.

00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:16.112
One night,

00:52:17.072 --> 00:52:19.574
I searched for an answer

00:52:20.825 --> 00:52:22.535
as to why our souls had to be switched.

00:52:23.203 --> 00:52:24.913
If that's the reason,

00:52:24.996 --> 00:52:26.206
why would we…

00:52:27.707 --> 00:52:29.417
Perhaps I knew it then.

00:53:18.967 --> 00:53:20.510
Do you still feel the same way?

00:53:21.636 --> 00:53:23.221
- What do you mean?
- About them and--

00:53:23.304 --> 00:53:24.556
No.

00:53:25.265 --> 00:53:26.975
My answer hasn't changed.

00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:29.352
I should get going.

00:53:32.689 --> 00:53:34.107
Why won't you be honest with me?

00:53:35.108 --> 00:53:36.860
You're just running away

00:53:37.527 --> 00:53:38.361
from the world.

00:53:39.529 --> 00:53:40.613
Just be honest with me.

00:53:40.697 --> 00:53:42.490
You're avoiding me now.

00:53:44.534 --> 00:53:45.493
Because you're scared.

00:53:46.202 --> 00:53:47.328
Because you're scared.

00:54:00.925 --> 00:54:02.469
You're right, I'm scared.

00:54:03.219 --> 00:54:04.179
I'm scared to lose you.

00:54:08.475 --> 00:54:09.517
Even now,

00:54:10.602 --> 00:54:12.687
the palace is filled with music every day.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.231
In the past,

00:54:16.024 --> 00:54:20.278
when others said that the world
was indifferent to our suffering,

00:54:20.904 --> 00:54:22.697
I held onto a faint hope that

00:54:23.448 --> 00:54:25.742
those high in the palace
must surely be doing something

00:54:25.825 --> 00:54:27.994
to make the world a better place.

00:54:28.995 --> 00:54:30.080
But I know I was wrong,

00:54:30.914 --> 00:54:32.499
now that I've lived your life.

00:54:34.667 --> 00:54:36.461
It wasn't the world that was indifferent.

00:54:37.545 --> 00:54:38.630
It was

00:54:40.673 --> 00:54:42.383
the man on the throne.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.806
Now, you know

00:54:47.889 --> 00:54:50.266
the very things I wished
you didn't know about my life.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.022
You have lived my life too,
so you must know

00:54:56.106 --> 00:54:57.565
that in a world like this,

00:54:58.066 --> 00:54:59.818
I have no choice but to live as a thief.

00:55:01.945 --> 00:55:02.946
No.

00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:05.824
You're wrong again, Hong Eun-jo.

00:55:12.831 --> 00:55:13.998
I…

00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:18.503
I…

00:55:26.427 --> 00:55:28.388
I will never let you live as a thief.

00:56:03.298 --> 00:56:04.382
Have you made up your mind?

00:56:06.384 --> 00:56:07.760
I will make a world

00:56:10.013 --> 00:56:12.891
where I don't need to live

00:56:13.474 --> 00:56:14.601
as a thief.

00:56:34.454 --> 00:56:37.665
The Left State Councilor,
Im Sa-hyeong, is entering.

00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:01.397
Your Highness,

00:57:02.398 --> 00:57:05.109
there is a reception for envoys
hosted by the royal relatives today.

00:57:07.528 --> 00:57:08.780
Right.

00:57:15.578 --> 00:57:16.746
It's pretty far away.

00:57:17.163 --> 00:57:19.624
They're holding the banquet
in a place with a beautiful view.

00:57:32.136 --> 00:57:34.347
Have the royal relatives not arrived yet?

00:57:34.973 --> 00:57:36.099
They have all arrived.

00:58:08.923 --> 00:58:10.049
It can't be…

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:33.781
No.

00:58:38.286 --> 00:58:39.662
One night,

00:58:39.746 --> 00:58:41.789
I searched for an answer

00:58:41.873 --> 00:58:43.458
as to why our souls had to be switched.

00:58:46.044 --> 00:58:47.879
Perhaps I knew it then.

00:58:48.713 --> 00:58:50.340
Ever since our souls were switched,

00:58:50.882 --> 00:58:52.383
perhaps I knew that…

00:58:52.467 --> 00:58:55.470
Look at that shameless face of yours,
just like your father's.

00:58:59.515 --> 00:59:01.059
…fighting against your ordeals…

00:59:01.434 --> 00:59:02.644
Thank you.

00:59:03.019 --> 00:59:04.646
Thank you!

00:59:04.729 --> 00:59:05.980
Stop!

00:59:08.608 --> 00:59:10.193
…protecting your people,

00:59:17.158 --> 00:59:19.661
and taking the world with you
was the fate laid out before me.

00:59:21.996 --> 00:59:24.248
Perhaps I also knew that one day,

00:59:26.459 --> 00:59:28.294
I would die for you as well.

00:59:33.091 --> 00:59:34.050
And if that's my fate,

00:59:36.469 --> 00:59:37.679
I will gladly accept it.

01:00:16.551 --> 01:00:18.219
{\an8}Are you here?

01:00:18.302 --> 01:00:19.929
{\an8}If you can hear me, answer me!

01:00:20.012 --> 01:00:21.347
{\an8}Please!

01:00:21.973 --> 01:00:23.224
{\an8}Don't sleep for too long.

01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:27.562
{\an8}Congratulations.

01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:29.814
{\an8}Since I am to succeed Father
as Chief Royal Secretary,

01:00:29.897 --> 01:00:32.775
{\an8}I would like to begin
in Father's court robes.

01:00:32.859 --> 01:00:33.943
{\an8}It's a royal order.

01:00:34.026 --> 01:00:35.945
{\an8}Anyone who sees Gil-dong

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:38.573
{\an8}is to kill him on the spot.

01:00:38.656 --> 01:00:41.993
{\an8}Your Highness and I
are no longer protecting the same thing.

01:00:42.076 --> 01:00:43.494
{\an8}Do your best.

01:00:43.578 --> 01:00:45.830
{\an8}What I protect has never changed.

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:49.167
