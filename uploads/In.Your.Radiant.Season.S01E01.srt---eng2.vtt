WEBVTT

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.302
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:35.014
CHARACTERS, EVENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND PLACES IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:36.308
ALL CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.319
EPISODE 1

00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:52.366
Hold on. Let me start over.

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:03.835
The song that starts like that.

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:08.548
I heard it a few days ago on the radio,
and they said it helps with insomnia.

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:10.758
You said your sleep pattern
has been off lately.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.220
Try listening to it
when you can't sleep. Okay?

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.643
This is Seoul.

00:01:20.644 --> 00:01:22.020
Boston, please respond.

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.482
Hey, engineering student.

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:29.152
Chan.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.154
Hey, Chan!

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.968
Is it a gift?
I could engrave it if you'd like.

00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:07.274
The design contest winner is…

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:09.067
Song Haran!

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:11.819
Me? You're kidding, right?

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.404
Well, this is unexpected.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:14.905
The second-year newbie won.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.282
Congratulations, Haran.

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:17.533
- Congrats, newbie!
- Really?

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:19.452
- Congrats! You deserve it!
- Congratulations!

00:02:19.453 --> 00:02:21.203
Thank you!

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:22.747
I can't believe it!

00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:23.873
Chan! Chan! Chan!

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:27.376
The pen you sent me for my birthday…

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:31.130
I used it to draw a design,
and it won in our company contest!

00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:34.049
- Let's go!
- It won?

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.052
Thank you so much!

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:38.429
You know,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.765
you're my savior.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.615
Hey, it smells like rain.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.380
You know that particular smell
before it rains?

00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:15.634
I love that smell.

00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:19.888
But it disappears so quickly,
so I just stand there smelling it.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.599
That's the smell
of organic matter diffusing.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.767
It's called petrichor,

00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:27.311
and it's when plant-derived
organic matter spreads--

00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:29.731
- Hey, nerd. Stop.
- The pores in rock crevices…

00:03:31.024 --> 00:03:34.110
Stop ruining my joy
with science talk, you nerd.

00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:40.575
Anyway, smelling the rain
puts me in a good mood.

00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:43.578
You should try it sometime.
I recommend it.

00:04:32.294 --> 00:04:35.797
But the catch is that
you always end up with a nasty cold.

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:41.845
ACHOO!

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:56.192
Hey, it's a vapor trail.

00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:59.779
I wish I could get on a plane
and go see Chan.

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:02.698
The boyfriend who's studying in Boston?

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.910
I heard Chan's too busy with research
to come during vacation.

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:08.037
Eunchan, you know Haran's boyfriend?

00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:09.121
A bit.

00:05:09.122 --> 00:05:10.331
He's my little brother.

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:12.291
- What?
- Really?

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:16.211
Let's enjoy our four days off
and work hard for our next season.

00:05:16.212 --> 00:05:17.546
Yes, ma'am!

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:20.550
Four days?

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.220
Hey, Yujeong!

00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:26.932
We're getting together later.
You free?

00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:28.849
Why are you running?

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.728
I'm going to Boston to meet Chan.

00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:33.813
I'll tell you everything later.

00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:12.852
Tsk.

00:06:17.023 --> 00:06:19.441
Chan, I saw a vapor trail earlier.

00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:22.027
But that made me want
to get on a plane to go see you.

00:06:22.028 --> 00:06:23.279
So…

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:27.533
Ta-da! I'm at the airport!

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:28.867
Isn't that crazy?

00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:31.286
I'll have to come back
after only a few hours,

00:06:31.287 --> 00:06:33.415
but I wanted
to tell you something in person.

00:06:34.124 --> 00:06:37.711
I'll be there at about 1:00 p.m.
in Boston, so just hang in there.

00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:39.212
Wait.

00:06:39.963 --> 00:06:43.049
I changed my mind.
I'm going to say it now. Hang on.

00:06:45.885 --> 00:06:47.344
Chan.

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:48.680
I love you.

00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:51.558
I love you, Chan.

00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:12.912
BIT, please.

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:35.601
5 MINUTES, 0.7 MILES

00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:37.312
Just five minutes left.

00:08:06.132 --> 00:08:07.133
Hey!

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:10.946
EUNCHAN

00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:14.825
Hello?

00:09:14.826 --> 00:09:17.495
Haran, what do I do?

00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:22.083
Chan…

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:25.085
Chan is…

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:14.487
SEOUL, SEVEN YEARS LATER

00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:22.662
Let's begin.

00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:24.414
One, two, three.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.541
Awesome.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:29.543
- All right.
- Let's take a few more and call it.

00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:30.586
Okay.

00:11:43.725 --> 00:11:45.476
Excuse me. Coming through.

00:11:49.647 --> 00:11:51.815
- Hi.
- Hey. The outfits…

00:11:51.816 --> 00:11:53.900
I like how the texture shows here.

00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:03.118
Nice.

00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:05.078
- Nice! You look great.
- Perfect.

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:07.248
Dart. 0.5.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.880
Ms. Kim is here.

00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:27.559
Let's fix the darts by 0.5 inches
before resuming.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.354
Start pinning right away!

00:12:33.024 --> 00:12:34.192
Lights.

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:39.112
Dim the backlight by 10%
and adjust the fill lights.

00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:40.198
Everyone, move.

00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:42.784
- All right.
- Hurry!

00:12:44.077 --> 00:12:45.203
Quickly, everyone!

00:12:49.123 --> 00:12:50.124
All right.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.043
Two, three.

00:12:53.544 --> 00:12:54.545
Okay.

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:57.714
Okay. Great work, everyone.

00:12:57.715 --> 00:12:59.384
Great work, everyone.

00:13:01.177 --> 00:13:03.679
The Korean queen of fashion,

00:13:04.347 --> 00:13:06.515
the head of Nana Atelier.

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:08.600
Give a round of applause
to our queen, Nana.

00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:09.935
It's fine.

00:13:09.936 --> 00:13:11.853
Clap for the person in charge, not me.

00:13:11.854 --> 00:13:15.440
Ah, the person who oversaw it all,
from the outfits to the shoot.

00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:18.151
Let's give a hand
to our lead designer, Song Haran!

00:13:23.783 --> 00:13:25.117
Excuse me…

00:13:25.118 --> 00:13:27.662
I'm sorry, but I don't think she's here.

00:13:28.454 --> 00:13:29.539
Where did she go?

00:13:30.706 --> 00:13:32.082
She's not here?

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.166
What's going on?

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:34.168
She was just here.

00:13:35.002 --> 00:13:37.672
She even approved the final select shots.

00:13:38.214 --> 00:13:39.215
Ghosting…

00:13:39.632 --> 00:13:42.718
She disappeared again,
like always.

00:13:44.846 --> 00:13:47.973
Ms. Song's routine never changes.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.144
She's like my salary.

00:13:52.145 --> 00:13:53.354
She disappears every time.

00:13:53.896 --> 00:13:55.772
Right.

00:15:06.761 --> 00:15:08.803
Mr. Yeon's coming to our hotel.

00:15:08.804 --> 00:15:10.890
The car rental…

00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:13.142
Where did he go?

00:15:15.436 --> 00:15:17.521
Did he wander off again?

00:15:20.608 --> 00:15:22.943
Do you guys remember what I just told you?

00:15:22.944 --> 00:15:24.110
Yeah!

00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:25.988
Okay, let's go.

00:15:31.577 --> 00:15:33.036
What's one plus one?

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:35.957
- Two!
- Two!

00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:40.211
Ben, look.
Didn't it come out nice?

00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:43.588
I bet
you're the only one in this world

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:47.759
who always makes friends
with everyone on the plane.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.053
You think so?

00:15:51.931 --> 00:15:54.599
Mm!
This taste brings back memories.

00:15:57.144 --> 00:15:58.771
When was the last time you were in Korea?

00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:01.523
It's been about seven years.

00:16:01.524 --> 00:16:03.692
Isn't your family in Korea?

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:05.151
Why didn't you come--

00:16:05.152 --> 00:16:07.570
Ben. Let's go to Hangang River
after the meeting.

00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:10.573
No, wait. Maybe Namsan?

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:11.575
Oh!

00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:14.203
I got a list, man.

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:20.042
Okay. Let's look through
my Seoul destinations list.

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:22.127
First…

00:16:22.128 --> 00:16:23.962
No, I can't hear you! I'm going to sleep.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.382
Then, I'll have fun by myself.

00:16:27.383 --> 00:16:29.260
Great. Go do that.

00:16:39.437 --> 00:16:40.980
I really did come back.

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:11.927
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:14.763
Nice to meet you. I'm Yeon Taeseok.

00:17:14.764 --> 00:17:16.890
It's nice to meet you,
Mr. Yeon!

00:17:16.891 --> 00:17:18.808
I really wanted to see you.

00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:20.685
After communicating through just emails,

00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:21.895
I knew I'd be happy,

00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:23.897
but I can't believe how excited I am.

00:17:23.898 --> 00:17:26.733
Well, I'm not that excited…

00:17:26.734 --> 00:17:28.651
Just think of him

00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:31.154
like a golden retriever
who loves people.

00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:32.990
I see. A golden retriever.

00:17:33.699 --> 00:17:35.116
But your Korean is really…

00:17:35.117 --> 00:17:36.910
Ah. I'm Ben.

00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:40.330
My wife's Korean,
and my in-laws live in Pangyo.

00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:42.207
- Ah. Right. Ben.
- Yes.

00:17:43.417 --> 00:17:45.669
Stand over here, Ben.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:46.962
Let me formally introduce myself.

00:17:47.755 --> 00:17:49.382
I'm the one who proposed this project

00:17:50.132 --> 00:17:52.802
and a supervisor
with CAN Animation Studio, Seon…

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:58.765
Well, many people get confused,
so let me tell you in advance.

00:17:58.766 --> 00:18:01.143
My name's Seonu Chan, not Seon Uchan.

00:18:02.478 --> 00:18:04.063
- This too?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:18:04.772 --> 00:18:07.190
Wait. Hang on. I can't carry this alone.

00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:08.817
You can do it, baby.

00:18:08.818 --> 00:18:11.736
- Great work, guys.
- Great job.

00:18:11.737 --> 00:18:14.531
- Great work, everyone.
- Good job.

00:18:14.532 --> 00:18:17.534
After checking if we have everything,
let's clean up and go.

00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:20.370
We should go now
if we want to make it to the afterparty.

00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:21.372
What's going on?

00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:24.666
I guess Ms. Song didn't arrive first.

00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:27.043
- I should text her to come to the party.
- Stop!

00:18:27.044 --> 00:18:29.130
Sol, our rookie intern.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:31.215
You're still clueless about her.

00:18:32.007 --> 00:18:35.343
Honey, have you ever had lunch
with Ms. Song before?

00:18:35.344 --> 00:18:37.638
- Yes or no?
- No, never.

00:18:38.347 --> 00:18:42.183
She always leaves first during lunchtime,
so she must be busy meeting people.

00:18:42.184 --> 00:18:45.520
- Not at all.
- Every day, all the time.

00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:48.273
Do you think it makes sense
to always have plans?

00:18:48.274 --> 00:18:51.901
Gosh. Are you saying
she's avoiding us on purpose?

00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:53.653
That's right.

00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:57.073
She loves to brood on her own.

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:58.867
She really isn't my vibe.

00:18:58.868 --> 00:19:02.037
Where is she
always disappearing to?

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.806
PARK GENIUS

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.876
Two points.

00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.335
Three points.

00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:52.629
Three points.

00:19:55.382 --> 00:19:56.467
I got it!

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:01.931
It looks so good.

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:04.183
Mmm.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.393
CHAN SENT PHOTOS

00:20:18.656 --> 00:20:20.406
Oh, God.

00:20:21.659 --> 00:20:24.411
What sort of Korean
enjoys Korea this much?

00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:01.240
Sorry about that.

00:21:02.157 --> 00:21:05.661
The ice machine
is acting up today.

00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:07.329
Be quiet.

00:21:09.832 --> 00:21:10.833
Quiet!

00:21:12.418 --> 00:21:14.669
Good boy.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.963
This is AI.

00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:20.300
Oh, those.

00:21:20.301 --> 00:21:22.427
If you're interested, check them out.

00:21:22.428 --> 00:21:25.471
One of my regulars here
organized an exhibit,

00:21:25.472 --> 00:21:28.933
and they're showing paintings
for each season.

00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:31.686
You can take a bunch of those
and go with friends.

00:21:31.687 --> 00:21:34.397
One is enough. Thank you.

00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:36.025
Ah. Really?

00:21:38.277 --> 00:21:40.154
Going by yourself will be nice, too.

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:45.325
RADIANT SEASONS

00:21:48.871 --> 00:21:51.789
Proceed through
the four seasonal rooms in order.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.791
Okay.

00:21:55.002 --> 00:21:58.047
"SHIM"
Coffee House

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:02.468
SPRING ROOM, THE WONDER OF LIFE

00:22:17.399 --> 00:22:20.068
WINTER ROOM, DEEP SILENCE

00:22:48.931 --> 00:22:50.431
A lone woman

00:22:50.432 --> 00:22:53.435
stands with her back turned
in a white, snowy landscape,

00:22:54.186 --> 00:22:57.189
quietly conveying
a sense of sorrow and emptiness.

00:22:59.566 --> 00:23:02.152
Rather than sharp tension,
the artist's brush captures

00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:06.447
the gentle air
and subtle tremble of light.

00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:18.335
No way…

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.281
Chan.

00:23:48.032 --> 00:23:49.199
I love you, Chan.

00:24:04.548 --> 00:24:05.549
I'm sorry.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.239
You idiot.
What will you do if it really is her?

00:25:13.492 --> 00:25:15.160
Huh?

00:25:17.246 --> 00:25:18.497
Hey, watch out.

00:25:21.917 --> 00:25:23.502
Watch out!

00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:26.130
Song Haran!

00:25:37.141 --> 00:25:39.809
Are you okay?

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.060
That was close.

00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:42.770
Are you all right?

00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:44.814
Gosh. That was close.

00:25:44.815 --> 00:25:46.482
Are you okay?

00:25:46.483 --> 00:25:48.609
Should we call emergency services?

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:49.944
Are you all right?

00:25:49.945 --> 00:25:51.362
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

00:25:51.363 --> 00:25:53.114
- Come quickly!
- Yes, I'm okay.

00:25:53.115 --> 00:25:54.448
- Are you okay?
- Is anyone hurt?

00:25:54.449 --> 00:25:55.908
Get down here!

00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:57.410
- Are they okay?
- It's dangerous.

00:25:57.411 --> 00:25:58.661
You should all come down.

00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.122
- That was so close.
- Come on.

00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:06.419
Hey, Too Much.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.463
Why is a Korean so busy touring Seoul?

00:26:09.464 --> 00:26:10.507
Right?

00:26:11.175 --> 00:26:13.093
Maybe I overdid it.

00:26:14.887 --> 00:26:17.097
I fled seven years ago

00:26:18.307 --> 00:26:21.018
because I thought I'd see her
everywhere I went.

00:26:21.977 --> 00:26:24.146
Seoul seems so big,

00:26:24.813 --> 00:26:27.607
but it was actually really small.

00:26:27.608 --> 00:26:29.401
Are you saying it's big or small?

00:26:31.195 --> 00:26:32.196
Hey, Chan.

00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:34.907
Did something happen?

00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:37.576
Mmm…

00:26:40.412 --> 00:26:42.414
Something did happen…

00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:47.628
but I'm going to pretend it didn't.

00:26:49.129 --> 00:26:52.423
I'll think about this today
and forget about it tomorrow,

00:26:52.424 --> 00:26:54.759
so don't worry and go to bed.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.886
Bye.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.700
RADIANT SEASONS

00:27:21.954 --> 00:27:22.955
Song Haran!

00:27:27.084 --> 00:27:29.419
I'm sure they called my name.

00:27:30.796 --> 00:27:31.922
Who was it?

00:27:34.758 --> 00:27:39.178
Of the three, I'm in charge of designing
and planning the Korean character…

00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:40.972
CHARACTERS
NIA, WON, FIN

00:27:40.973 --> 00:27:44.685
Just think of me
as the guy in charge of Won.

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:47.895
To highlight the identities
of each character,

00:27:47.896 --> 00:27:51.066
we planned collaborations
with designers from each country.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.484
I made the collaboration offer

00:27:53.485 --> 00:27:57.948
because I really wanted you
to design the Korean character's outfits.

00:27:59.282 --> 00:28:00.534
What do you think, Ms. Kim?

00:28:06.081 --> 00:28:07.082
Ms. Kim?

00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:12.045
So why should I do this?

00:28:13.422 --> 00:28:14.715
I was curious.

00:28:15.257 --> 00:28:18.092
To be honest, I was excited.

00:28:18.093 --> 00:28:21.346
I thought your roots
were similar to Won's.

00:28:22.222 --> 00:28:25.975
Won isn't someone who shines like the sun.

00:28:25.976 --> 00:28:28.978
Instead, she gives light

00:28:28.979 --> 00:28:30.981
to those in the darkness,

00:28:31.857 --> 00:28:32.858
like the moon.

00:28:33.483 --> 00:28:35.152
"Douceur lunaire."

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:39.531
What's that?

00:28:40.615 --> 00:28:42.241
"Soft moonlight."

00:28:42.242 --> 00:28:44.869
The first collection you put out
when you were 22.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.371
I saw it myself.

00:28:47.497 --> 00:28:51.126
You reinterpreted Korean traditional silk
through moonlight.

00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:55.379
You saw it yourself?

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.216
It was on display at the fashion school
you attended in France.

00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:01.887
Thanks to you,

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.890
I got to see the Eiffel Tower, too.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.271
So, what if you expressed Won
with roots like that?

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.277
Just imagining that made me so excited.

00:29:26.411 --> 00:29:27.412
So?

00:29:29.164 --> 00:29:30.248
What should we do first?

00:29:32.375 --> 00:29:33.668
Yes!

00:29:34.961 --> 00:29:35.962
Unbelievable.

00:29:36.505 --> 00:29:39.257
Then, let's take a selfie first
to celebrate this day.

00:29:39.966 --> 00:29:42.135
Sorry, but you really shouldn't…

00:29:43.845 --> 00:29:46.098
Was I being rude, by any chance?

00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:47.724
Very rude.

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:52.354
You know,

00:29:54.397 --> 00:29:55.816
my left side is prettier.

00:29:58.652 --> 00:30:01.612
Then, I'll take one from the left.

00:30:01.613 --> 00:30:03.948
One, two, three.

00:30:08.995 --> 00:30:11.956
Should we show you the story reel first?

00:30:11.957 --> 00:30:14.500
- The video will be pretty helpful.
- Sure.

00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:16.920
The USB is in my car,
so I'll go and get it.

00:30:22.968 --> 00:30:24.051
CHARACTER "WON"

00:30:24.052 --> 00:30:25.220
It's strange.

00:30:25.804 --> 00:30:27.596
- She looks familiar.
- Pardon?

00:30:27.597 --> 00:30:30.558
It's an original character
that Chan created.

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:31.560
No…

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:34.311
I'm sure I've seen that face before.

00:30:50.245 --> 00:30:51.246
Hmm?

00:31:30.118 --> 00:31:31.119
Huh.

00:32:00.607 --> 00:32:01.941
Ms. Song.

00:32:01.942 --> 00:32:03.108
Right.

00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:06.613
This character looks like
our lead designer, Song Haran.

00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:20.502
I'm sorry.

00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:23.380
I dropped my pen by accident.

00:32:29.844 --> 00:32:31.221
May I help you?

00:32:34.641 --> 00:32:36.685
Are you here for the collaboration?

00:32:39.562 --> 00:32:40.563
No…

00:32:43.066 --> 00:32:44.276
Oh.

00:32:45.068 --> 00:32:46.069
Yes, I am.

00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:50.073
It's nice to meet you.

00:32:50.824 --> 00:32:52.325
I'm Song Haran, the lead designer.

00:32:54.953 --> 00:32:56.079
"It's nice to meet you"?

00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:00.875
- Excuse me?
- Right.

00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:05.088
It's nice to meet you.

00:33:08.758 --> 00:33:10.175
I'm Seonu Chan.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.143
My pen…

00:33:18.977 --> 00:33:20.478
Ah… Here.

00:33:23.273 --> 00:33:24.524
Thank you.

00:33:34.326 --> 00:33:35.785
Do you have something to say?

00:33:37.245 --> 00:33:38.246
No.

00:34:14.282 --> 00:34:16.868
NANA ATELIER DESIGNERS
LEAD DESIGNER SONG HARAN

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.511
Hey, Chan.

00:34:35.512 --> 00:34:38.014
- What happened to you?
- It's fine.

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:46.188
I'm sorry.

00:34:46.189 --> 00:34:48.107
My prior engagement
ran longer than expected.

00:34:48.108 --> 00:34:49.234
No need for excuses.

00:34:49.818 --> 00:34:50.943
Say hello.

00:34:50.944 --> 00:34:52.528
This is Lead Designer Song Haran,

00:34:52.529 --> 00:34:55.447
who will be the main support
for this collaboration project.

00:34:55.448 --> 00:34:57.909
She'll be working with you
for the entire three months.

00:34:58.993 --> 00:35:00.202
Let's continue.

00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:02.288
Then,
let's watch the story reel together.

00:35:03.123 --> 00:35:04.332
Wait.

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:07.043
Mr. Seonu.

00:35:07.669 --> 00:35:09.087
That character.

00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:10.839
Was it based on someone?

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.175
No, it just came to mind.

00:35:15.176 --> 00:35:16.510
My grandmother…

00:35:16.511 --> 00:35:19.638
I mean, Ms. Kim said that
Won resembles my sister…

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:23.517
I mean, Lead Designer Song Haran.

00:35:24.811 --> 00:35:26.270
- Ooh!
- Oops.

00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:27.981
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:30.066
I…

00:35:31.818 --> 00:35:33.277
I can't stand those messy clothes.

00:35:33.278 --> 00:35:35.571
- Remy, get him a new shirt.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:35:35.572 --> 00:35:37.031
We'll resume in 10 minutes.

00:35:37.657 --> 00:35:39.742
Why don't you wait
in the fitting room?

00:35:39.743 --> 00:35:41.911
I'll pick out a pretty shirt for you.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.620
It's on the fourth floor.

00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:45.414
- I'll do it.
- No, it's fine.

00:35:45.415 --> 00:35:47.500
It's all right.
Just head to the fourth floor.

00:36:03.808 --> 00:36:06.894
Can you deliver this to the animator?

00:36:06.895 --> 00:36:11.774
I mean, seeing you
brooding like this by yourself again…

00:36:11.775 --> 00:36:15.987
You look very, very…
free right now.

00:36:46.851 --> 00:36:48.603
I'll leave your shirt here.

00:36:57.737 --> 00:36:59.321
I'm sorry! You weren't answering.

00:36:59.322 --> 00:37:00.532
Right.

00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:03.618
Ah…

00:37:05.578 --> 00:37:07.746
Here's your shirt.

00:37:07.747 --> 00:37:08.790
Thank you.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.061
What's with you today?

00:37:31.229 --> 00:37:32.480
You've been acting weird…

00:37:33.648 --> 00:37:34.649
What are you doing?

00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:38.152
I'm sorry, Ben.
I'm stepping out of this project.

00:37:38.987 --> 00:37:40.279
What?

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.905
You stick to the schedule.

00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:42.949
I'll head back to the US.

00:37:46.911 --> 00:37:48.705
This isn't funny, Chan.

00:37:49.747 --> 00:37:52.458
I'll call you as soon as I find
a replacement supervisor.

00:37:54.127 --> 00:37:55.419
What on earth…

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.170
Are you serious right now?

00:37:57.171 --> 00:38:00.340
You know the director's coming here
with the EA team soon, right?

00:38:00.341 --> 00:38:03.218
Hundreds of people have been working
on this project for years

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:04.636
because they believed in you.

00:38:04.637 --> 00:38:06.556
Not to mention the expenses.

00:38:07.223 --> 00:38:08.641
Seonu Chan.

00:38:10.184 --> 00:38:12.437
The Seonu Chan I know wouldn't do this.

00:38:13.187 --> 00:38:14.355
No, he can't.

00:38:15.857 --> 00:38:16.940
Tell me the reason.

00:38:19.944 --> 00:38:21.194
Because I'm scared.

00:38:21.195 --> 00:38:22.280
I shouldn't be here.

00:38:23.698 --> 00:38:24.949
What do you mean?

00:38:26.659 --> 00:38:28.369
Sorry, Ben. Not now.

00:38:29.245 --> 00:38:30.663
Let's talk about it later, man.

00:38:39.255 --> 00:38:42.592
You said
drawing made you so happy.

00:38:43.551 --> 00:38:45.177
When you became a supervisor,

00:38:45.178 --> 00:38:47.680
you asked me to smack you
because it felt like a dream.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.017
Now I see
just how little it really means to you.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.021
Fine. Go.

00:38:55.563 --> 00:38:58.775
I don't need a supervisor
who gives up so easily on his work.

00:39:09.202 --> 00:39:10.787
WON COSTUME COLLABORATION PROPOSAL

00:39:34.727 --> 00:39:35.770
Memento mori…

00:40:00.128 --> 00:40:01.546
He sure left quick.

00:40:06.009 --> 00:40:07.968
Morning, Ben. How are you?

00:40:07.969 --> 00:40:10.637
Wait, actually. It's probably
nighttime there, right?

00:40:10.638 --> 00:40:12.431
Anyway, I was just wondering

00:40:12.432 --> 00:40:15.058
how the first meeting went
for the fashion collaboration.

00:40:15.059 --> 00:40:17.644
Uh, yeah, it went well, but…

00:40:17.645 --> 00:40:23.316
Before we get into that,
there's been a bit of an issue with Chan.

00:40:23.317 --> 00:40:26.487
- Um…
- Hey, am I late?

00:40:27.697 --> 00:40:30.074
Sorry. I was taking a shower.

00:40:31.534 --> 00:40:33.911
I thought I should get dressed
before hopping on.

00:40:36.372 --> 00:40:37.790
Let's share it.

00:40:38.291 --> 00:40:40.001
Okay.

00:40:41.586 --> 00:40:43.545
Okay, um…

00:40:43.546 --> 00:40:45.547
I've sent the materials to Ms. Kim,

00:40:45.548 --> 00:40:50.260
and we're meeting in a couple of days
to discuss the concept.

00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:51.720
All right. Sounds great.

00:40:51.721 --> 00:40:54.724
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Uh…

00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:58.143
- Seonu Chan.
- Yeah?

00:40:58.144 --> 00:40:59.811
- What was that?
- What?

00:40:59.812 --> 00:41:00.979
Your clothes were gone.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.024
Oh. I dropped them off at the cleaners.

00:41:03.816 --> 00:41:05.109
They were all crumpled.

00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:08.279
- Let's go get some soy-marinated crabs.
- Soy-marinated crabs?

00:41:08.821 --> 00:41:09.947
It's midnight.

00:41:11.949 --> 00:41:14.494
Don't you know shops are open
24 hours a day in Korea?

00:41:15.328 --> 00:41:19.122
We need to eat well
in order to work hard, you know.

00:41:19.123 --> 00:41:21.542
- Right, Producer Ben?
- Seonu Chan.

00:41:22.794 --> 00:41:25.505
- You're buying.
- No, I'm not. Last one out is buying.

00:41:41.062 --> 00:41:42.355
Three months…

00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:45.149
Just three months.

00:41:49.612 --> 00:41:51.989
I'm sure nothing will happen.

00:42:24.605 --> 00:42:27.482
Grandma.

00:42:27.483 --> 00:42:30.152
- Hey.
- I'm here.

00:42:30.153 --> 00:42:32.362
How was your day?

00:42:32.363 --> 00:42:34.239
Mmm. It was tough.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.368
It's hard being a high school senior.

00:42:38.202 --> 00:42:39.537
But…

00:42:41.873 --> 00:42:43.290
Ta-da!

00:42:43.291 --> 00:42:45.376
I got a perfect score
after all that studying.

00:42:46.377 --> 00:42:50.088
Gosh, you did a great job.

00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:52.174
These brains and these looks.

00:42:52.175 --> 00:42:55.552
I got so many good genes
from you, Grandma.

00:42:57.638 --> 00:43:00.473
But what did I say
was just as important as studying?

00:43:00.474 --> 00:43:01.934
Managing my health.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.561
Here.

00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:08.190
I've been taking the tonics
that Mr. Yeon gave me to help me focus.

00:43:08.191 --> 00:43:09.983
I'll go get some rest.

00:43:09.984 --> 00:43:11.485
Good night, Grandma.

00:43:12.278 --> 00:43:13.279
Good night.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.712
How are you busier
than a high school senior?

00:43:32.381 --> 00:43:33.966
Where on earth have you…

00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:37.762
Forget it. Go upstairs.

00:43:39.263 --> 00:43:40.264
Good night.

00:43:57.448 --> 00:44:00.284
Why leave your perfectly fine room
and go into that cave?

00:44:02.703 --> 00:44:03.704
Come to my study.

00:44:04.205 --> 00:44:05.288
What?

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:06.915
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:44:06.916 --> 00:44:08.167
Meet Photographer Yoon.

00:44:09.001 --> 00:44:11.169
He's been interested in you
for a long time.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:13.338
He's talented and has great character.

00:44:13.339 --> 00:44:15.507
Someone like that is rare.
Give him a chance.

00:44:15.508 --> 00:44:18.636
- No, I'm not interested in dating--
- I know.

00:44:19.136 --> 00:44:20.346
Just change your mind.

00:44:21.138 --> 00:44:23.349
I'll set a date, so meet with him.

00:44:29.355 --> 00:44:30.398
I'm sorry.

00:45:03.055 --> 00:45:05.349
FAREWELL TO MY FORMER LIFE

00:45:32.835 --> 00:45:34.669
Good morning.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.212
"Good morning"?

00:45:36.213 --> 00:45:37.839
When did you get home last night?

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.467
Just a little after midnight.

00:45:40.468 --> 00:45:42.470
I suddenly got a bunch of plans.

00:45:43.846 --> 00:45:47.599
Why is everyone
in this household so extreme?

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.476
I wish I could mix the two of you.

00:45:49.477 --> 00:45:52.437
What? Me and who?

00:45:53.606 --> 00:45:55.524
My lonely eldest sister?

00:45:57.777 --> 00:46:00.403
At a construction site in Seoul,

00:46:00.404 --> 00:46:02.947
a large tower of scaffolding

00:46:02.948 --> 00:46:05.116
begins to tilt toward the sidewalk.

00:46:05.117 --> 00:46:09.662
The scaffolding was a second away
from falling on a woman passing by.

00:46:11.165 --> 00:46:12.957
What's with all this fuss again?

00:46:16.921 --> 00:46:18.213
What are you doing?

00:46:18.214 --> 00:46:19.215
Well…

00:46:21.509 --> 00:46:23.968
I'm trying to protect

00:46:23.969 --> 00:46:28.181
my beautiful grandmother's skin
from all the electromagnetic waves.

00:46:28.182 --> 00:46:31.518
It's a display of touching devotion
from your second granddaughter.

00:46:31.519 --> 00:46:35.648
I'll go get ready for work now.

00:46:44.448 --> 00:46:46.491
She still hasn't sobered up yet.

00:46:46.492 --> 00:46:47.910
Haran!

00:46:48.953 --> 00:46:50.538
What? Where is she?

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.705
Are you in there again?

00:46:52.706 --> 00:46:54.917
Come out here right now!

00:46:56.627 --> 00:46:57.628
What is it?

00:47:03.801 --> 00:47:04.802
What?

00:47:06.512 --> 00:47:10.515
This woman passing by who almost
got hurt at a construction site.

00:47:10.516 --> 00:47:11.767
This is you, isn't it?

00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:13.144
It is.

00:47:14.228 --> 00:47:16.396
What?

00:47:16.397 --> 00:47:20.358
Even I was startled by this.
What if Grandma had seen this?

00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:24.946
Please, keep your head on straight
when you're outside. Okay?

00:47:24.947 --> 00:47:26.031
I'll keep that in mind.

00:47:29.493 --> 00:47:31.744
The woman stopped just in time

00:47:31.745 --> 00:47:33.330
when someone urgently called her name.

00:47:37.168 --> 00:47:38.960
Fortunately, that stopped

00:47:38.961 --> 00:47:40.546
- what could've been a terrible…
- Hang on.

00:47:42.882 --> 00:47:43.883
What?

00:47:44.341 --> 00:47:45.425
This shirt…

00:47:47.011 --> 00:47:48.721
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:47:49.805 --> 00:47:52.975
Wow. If it weren't for him,
you would've been a goner.

00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:56.769
- Hmm? That shirt…
- You recognize it too, right?

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.982
Yeah. We remember every color
and texture that people wear.

00:48:00.983 --> 00:48:01.984
Isn't that…

00:48:02.485 --> 00:48:04.235
the animator's shirt?

00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:06.779
- It is. He wore it at the meeting.
- What on earth?

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.657
Then, does that mean he was passing by

00:48:09.658 --> 00:48:11.784
and shouted when he saw
that you were in danger?

00:48:11.785 --> 00:48:13.578
He called out my name.

00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:15.371
That's before we even met.

00:48:15.372 --> 00:48:19.043
What? How did he call you by your name
when he doesn't know it?

00:48:20.544 --> 00:48:23.171
Ah. I get it.

00:48:23.172 --> 00:48:25.883
He must be someone in the industry
who knows you.

00:48:26.884 --> 00:48:28.384
You're known for your looks.

00:48:28.385 --> 00:48:31.263
Plus, plenty of people
wear the same clothes.

00:48:31.847 --> 00:48:32.972
You think so?

00:48:32.973 --> 00:48:34.975
That's the only way it makes sense.

00:48:36.477 --> 00:48:39.021
So who could this savior be?

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:40.981
Right?

00:48:41.607 --> 00:48:42.775
Who could it be?

00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:48.614
Oh. Hello, Ms. Song.

00:48:49.365 --> 00:48:50.448
Good morning.

00:48:50.449 --> 00:48:51.825
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:49:01.293 --> 00:49:02.669
Yes?

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:05.673
Ms. Song, the black dress sample is here.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.677
The measurements are perfect.

00:49:10.678 --> 00:49:12.136
Let's see it on a mannequin…

00:49:12.137 --> 00:49:13.304
I'll wear it.

00:49:13.305 --> 00:49:15.181
That will be easier to check.

00:49:15.182 --> 00:49:16.809
- Okay. Thanks.
- No problem.

00:49:19.895 --> 00:49:21.897
WORK ORDER

00:49:22.648 --> 00:49:23.649
Oh?

00:49:25.776 --> 00:49:27.193
Ms. Song.

00:49:27.194 --> 00:49:28.820
What's with this men's shirt?

00:49:28.821 --> 00:49:31.281
Just give that to me
and change into the dress.

00:49:31.282 --> 00:49:32.283
Okay.

00:49:41.959 --> 00:49:44.878
I'm sure it's the same shirt.

00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:49.592
Plenty of people
wear the same clothes.

00:50:03.647 --> 00:50:04.731
The art exhibit.

00:50:04.732 --> 00:50:06.482
RADIANT SEASONS

00:50:06.483 --> 00:50:10.070
I went to the exhibit
on the day of our lookbook shoot…

00:50:12.448 --> 00:50:13.449
It was the 16th.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.661
He was at the exhibit
on the same day as me.

00:50:18.412 --> 00:50:19.413
Then…

00:50:19.997 --> 00:50:22.082
he really was the one who called my name?

00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:25.794
SEONU CHAN

00:50:26.754 --> 00:50:28.213
Seonu Chan.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.174
Seonu Chan…

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:38.599
It doesn't ring a bell.

00:50:39.725 --> 00:50:42.061
How did he know my name?

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.276
SEONU CHAN

00:50:55.866 --> 00:50:57.367
It's nice to meet you.

00:50:57.368 --> 00:50:59.953
I'm Song Haran, the lead designer.

00:51:03.582 --> 00:51:06.209
Chan. Chan.

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:07.543
I love you.

00:51:07.544 --> 00:51:09.212
I love you, Chan.

00:51:43.997 --> 00:51:45.623
Ms. Song.

00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:48.168
- Something weird was delivered to you.
- What a nutjob.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.548
What are you going to do?
I'm the one who received this delivery.

00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:55.007
I'm going to be traumatized

00:51:55.008 --> 00:51:57.760
after seeing something that sickening
with my pretty eyes.

00:51:57.761 --> 00:51:59.929
Do you have any idea
who could've done this?

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:01.139
Not at all.

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.057
Did you have a bad breakup recently?

00:52:03.058 --> 00:52:05.393
Those kind of exes turn into stalkers--

00:52:05.394 --> 00:52:08.396
It's fine. This is a personal matter.
Please get back to work.

00:52:08.397 --> 00:52:11.315
We don't know what these weirdos
might do if we leave them be.

00:52:11.316 --> 00:52:15.528
He's right. A crazy stalker like this
could pop out of nowhere and do something…

00:52:15.529 --> 00:52:17.948
Thanks for your concern,
but I'll deal with it myself.

00:52:22.453 --> 00:52:25.080
- We're just worried…
- Ms. Song…

00:52:27.416 --> 00:52:30.084
That darned glass.
She's always turning it…

00:52:30.085 --> 00:52:32.795
My pretty hands…

00:52:32.796 --> 00:52:34.923
What kind of crazy jerk would do this?

00:52:37.634 --> 00:52:39.343
Hang on…

00:52:44.057 --> 00:52:46.268
Haran. I mean, Ms. Song
since we're at work.

00:52:46.977 --> 00:52:48.728
The stalker who sent those photos…

00:52:48.729 --> 00:52:52.149
Maybe it's the same guy
who called your name in the street.

00:52:53.609 --> 00:52:54.942
Right, ma'am?

00:52:54.943 --> 00:52:56.986
He could've been following you,

00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:59.907
and he could've yelled your name
by accident when you were in danger.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:07.246
- If you're done, get back to work.
- Work isn't important right now.

00:53:14.379 --> 00:53:17.216
All right, Ms. Song.

00:53:22.971 --> 00:53:26.015
- What are you doing?
- There's a smudge on it.

00:53:26.016 --> 00:53:27.017
Just a second.

00:53:27.726 --> 00:53:28.769
I'll excuse myself.

00:53:34.399 --> 00:53:36.235
If the stalker who sent the photos

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.987
is the same guy who called my name…

00:53:40.072 --> 00:53:41.364
Seonu Chan?

00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:51.833
WON CHARACTER CONCEPT

00:53:51.834 --> 00:53:54.168
Ms. Kim said that
Won resembles my sister…

00:53:54.169 --> 00:53:56.713
I mean, Lead Designer Song Haran.

00:53:57.714 --> 00:54:00.008
If the character
is based on the type of girl he likes,

00:54:00.551 --> 00:54:03.594
maybe he saw that I looked similar
when he came to Korea

00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:05.556
and learned my name after stalking me.

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.309
Then, he followed me to the art exhibit
and witnessed the accident.

00:54:11.144 --> 00:54:13.313
I bet he didn't know
we'd be working together.

00:54:15.691 --> 00:54:17.150
Is that why he reacted like that?

00:54:17.734 --> 00:54:20.112
Right.

00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:22.030
It's…

00:54:23.282 --> 00:54:24.615
It's nice to meet you.

00:54:24.616 --> 00:54:27.286
It's because it wasn't
his first time seeing me.

00:54:28.203 --> 00:54:31.455
Emergency ice water for you.

00:54:31.456 --> 00:54:35.209
You seemed frustrated
about something.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.713
The ice machine
stopped acting up.

00:54:38.463 --> 00:54:42.342
One of my regulars who's really handy
dropped by and fixed it instantly.

00:54:42.843 --> 00:54:44.176
Thank you.

00:54:48.473 --> 00:54:50.391
There's an urgent meeting
with a client.

00:54:50.392 --> 00:54:54.396
Come to Grand Lumiere Hotel
by 7:00 p.m. tonight.

00:54:57.232 --> 00:54:58.984
WON CHARACTER CONCEPT

"SHIM"
Coffee House

00:55:15.417 --> 00:55:17.543
- Hello.
- Hey!

00:55:17.544 --> 00:55:20.630
My VVIP regular who fixed my ice machine.

00:55:20.631 --> 00:55:22.590
Come on in.

00:55:22.591 --> 00:55:24.050
Welcome.

00:55:24.051 --> 00:55:25.968
Hi, Genius.

00:55:25.969 --> 00:55:28.180
Here. Sit down.

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.139
I'll make you some coffee.

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:31.767
Okay. Thank you.

00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:33.310
Genius, wait.

00:55:37.731 --> 00:55:40.191
Did you go to the art exhibit?

00:55:40.192 --> 00:55:42.569
You said you'd go right away
when I gave you the ticket.

00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:44.112
Uh…

00:55:44.738 --> 00:55:47.074
Yes. Thank you for the ticket.

00:55:47.908 --> 00:55:51.787
But for someone
who always smiles so handsomely,

00:55:52.412 --> 00:55:54.705
why do you look so gloomy today?

00:55:54.706 --> 00:55:56.624
Uh…

00:55:56.625 --> 00:55:58.668
Right?

00:55:58.669 --> 00:56:01.254
I'm usually really handsome,

00:56:01.963 --> 00:56:05.175
but I didn't get much sleep,
so I guess I look less handsome today.

00:56:05.967 --> 00:56:07.635
Why didn't you get much sleep?

00:56:07.636 --> 00:56:10.096
Did you have a nightmare?

00:56:14.810 --> 00:56:15.976
Oh.

00:56:15.977 --> 00:56:17.478
Do you play the harmonica?

00:56:17.479 --> 00:56:18.689
Oh, that.

00:56:19.272 --> 00:56:21.358
I found it while cleaning out my clutter.

00:56:22.401 --> 00:56:26.195
I get out of breath easily now,
so my chest hurts.

00:56:26.196 --> 00:56:27.822
I can't play it so well anymore.

00:56:27.823 --> 00:56:29.407
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:56:29.408 --> 00:56:33.202
I used to play that often
in my neighborhood when I was little.

00:56:33.203 --> 00:56:34.745
Where's your hometown?

00:56:34.746 --> 00:56:36.455
Chuncheon.

00:56:36.456 --> 00:56:38.708
All I did was find one old object,

00:56:38.709 --> 00:56:42.086
but it reminded me of my old hometown

00:56:42.087 --> 00:56:43.462
and my childhood friends.

00:56:43.463 --> 00:56:50.470
It came with a full package
of old memories.

00:56:52.514 --> 00:56:54.349
Memories…

00:56:56.852 --> 00:56:59.812
are kind of like sausage links.

00:56:59.813 --> 00:57:01.606
What? Sausage links?

00:57:02.566 --> 00:57:03.567
Yes.

00:57:04.443 --> 00:57:06.610
Even if you think
you've forgotten everything,

00:57:06.611 --> 00:57:08.530
recalling just one memory…

00:57:10.615 --> 00:57:12.325
seems to bring everything else along.

00:57:13.201 --> 00:57:14.411
Like sausage links.

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.501
Hey.

00:57:22.294 --> 00:57:23.545
Wait just a moment.

00:57:25.964 --> 00:57:27.048
- Okay.
- Hang on.

00:58:35.617 --> 00:58:37.326
What kind of meeting is it?

00:58:37.327 --> 00:58:38.536
I should at least know…

00:58:38.537 --> 00:58:41.121
I told you I'd set you up
on a date with Photographer Yoon.

00:58:41.122 --> 00:58:42.123
No.

00:58:44.835 --> 00:58:47.337
If that's what this is, I'm not attending.

00:58:48.088 --> 00:58:49.089
I'm sorry.

00:58:50.298 --> 00:58:52.467
How long do I have to see you
act like this?

00:58:57.722 --> 00:58:59.223
It's been seven years.

00:58:59.224 --> 00:59:02.602
Everyone gets back up and lives
after going through immense pain.

00:59:03.103 --> 00:59:04.479
You're the only one who refuses to.

00:59:05.355 --> 00:59:08.567
Are you going to keep running away
from everything like a coward?

00:59:10.443 --> 00:59:12.862
You can survive
with at least one person to rely on.

00:59:12.863 --> 00:59:14.990
But with no one, you'll crumble.

00:59:16.616 --> 00:59:20.619
Mr. Yoon can be someone like that for you.
He's a good man, so--

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.622
I don't need a good man!

00:59:24.291 --> 00:59:26.001
How can you…

00:59:26.585 --> 00:59:28.712
Of all people, how can you do this to me?

00:59:30.547 --> 00:59:32.132
I'm the one who wants to live like this.

00:59:32.674 --> 00:59:34.593
I feel comfortable this way.

00:59:36.136 --> 00:59:39.806
I know, okay?
I know I shouldn't live like this.

00:59:40.682 --> 00:59:43.435
I know I'm being stupid and weird.

00:59:44.269 --> 00:59:45.520
But…

00:59:46.897 --> 00:59:48.272
I'm too scared.

00:59:50.442 --> 00:59:54.613
I don't want to end up
being anxious and worried every day

00:59:55.238 --> 00:59:58.825
that something might happen
to someone I care about.

00:59:59.951 --> 01:00:02.078
So just let me live like this.

01:00:03.705 --> 01:00:07.292
If there's no one by my side,
at least nothing bad will happen.

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:57.216
Dad! Mom!

01:00:57.217 --> 01:00:59.219
Dad! Dad!

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:02.096
Dad! Mom…

01:01:02.097 --> 01:01:05.057
Mom, get up! Mom!

01:01:05.058 --> 01:01:06.767
Oh, my God!

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:08.644
Help!

01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:09.853
No, Mom…

01:01:09.854 --> 01:01:12.649
Mom!

01:01:22.242 --> 01:01:23.367
Haran.

01:01:23.368 --> 01:01:25.620
I can't believe what happened. Hmm?

01:01:28.873 --> 01:01:30.041
Grandma.

01:01:31.459 --> 01:01:32.961
Mom, Dad,

01:01:34.045 --> 01:01:35.296
and Chan…

01:01:36.256 --> 01:01:37.716
Even Chan is gone.

01:01:39.968 --> 01:01:42.804
Chan is dead, too.

01:01:49.352 --> 01:01:52.355
Haran, let's go home. Okay?

01:01:53.523 --> 01:01:57.193
Chan is dead too, Grandma.

01:02:00.113 --> 01:02:01.906
Chan…

01:02:02.532 --> 01:02:04.367
Chan is dead, too.

01:02:06.953 --> 01:02:08.621
Grandma…

01:02:34.064 --> 01:02:36.483
At least show Mr. Yoon
some basic courtesy.

01:03:16.064 --> 01:03:17.065
Oh.

01:03:17.649 --> 01:03:20.484
I'm sorry. I played without permission.

01:03:20.485 --> 01:03:22.320
Bravo!

01:03:22.904 --> 01:03:25.573
Will you have
some wine with me?

01:03:28.618 --> 01:03:31.246
There's some sediment in this wine,

01:03:31.871 --> 01:03:34.665
so let's drink this
after it settles in a bit.

01:03:34.666 --> 01:03:35.667
Okay.

01:03:36.251 --> 01:03:39.211
By the way, I guess you like Bach.

01:03:39.212 --> 01:03:40.629
No.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:43.090
I just happened to hear about the song.

01:03:43.091 --> 01:03:47.094
Someone told me it's good for insomnia.

01:03:47.095 --> 01:03:49.096
Seeing your expression,

01:03:49.097 --> 01:03:51.099
I'm guessing today's the kind of day

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:54.477
when your memories come flooding back.

01:03:56.104 --> 01:03:58.273
From the way they're coming back to me,

01:04:00.024 --> 01:04:02.109
I guess I haven't forgotten about them.

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:04.696
They were just…

01:04:05.613 --> 01:04:07.115
buried for a while.

01:04:08.533 --> 01:04:09.909
Mmm.

01:04:10.618 --> 01:04:14.289
The thing about memories
is that sometimes…

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:19.209
they're really rebellious.

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:23.172
The more you try to forget,
the more vivid they become.

01:04:23.173 --> 01:04:27.927
And when you want to remember,
they run away from you.

01:04:29.929 --> 01:04:31.930
So don't strain yourself.

01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:34.809
Just try leaving them be.

01:04:35.435 --> 01:04:39.564
Just like this wine,
memories get cloudy if you disturb them.

01:04:40.064 --> 01:04:45.278
But if you leave them be,
they'll eventually become clearer.

01:04:52.118 --> 01:04:53.119
All right.

01:04:53.953 --> 01:04:57.372
I'll try to just leave them be.

01:04:57.373 --> 01:04:58.499
- Let's drink.
- Okay.

01:05:04.631 --> 01:05:06.173
I'm sorry.

01:05:06.174 --> 01:05:10.385
I'll talk to Ms. Kim and make sure
this mistake doesn't happen again.

01:05:10.386 --> 01:05:14.349
I came to say that you don't have
to waste your time on me.

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:16.768
Yes, I know.

01:05:17.727 --> 01:05:21.188
I know you don't have any feelings for me,
but I really am sincere…

01:05:21.189 --> 01:05:22.356
Are you kidding me?

01:05:22.357 --> 01:05:25.442
Right. I understand
you don't want to hear it.

01:05:25.443 --> 01:05:27.194
But I really am sincere--

01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:29.696
I'm sincerely sorry,
but something urgent came up.

01:05:29.697 --> 01:05:31.657
- I'll get going. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?

01:05:31.658 --> 01:05:34.452
Ms. Song!

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:52.470
What?

01:05:53.096 --> 01:05:54.388
Why are you…

01:05:54.389 --> 01:05:56.474
Could you say my name?

01:05:57.183 --> 01:06:00.269
- What?
- You're the one who called my name

01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:02.855
in front of the art museum
on the 16th, right?

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.609
I met you for the first time
a few days ago.

01:06:07.527 --> 01:06:09.195
How long have you known me?

01:06:12.991 --> 01:06:15.785
Tell me how you know me.

01:06:16.786 --> 01:06:18.371
What are you hiding?

01:06:23.084 --> 01:06:24.960
Someone I have to meet…

01:06:28.464 --> 01:06:31.342
Someone who brought me back to life

01:06:33.136 --> 01:06:34.137
and seems to hold…

01:06:35.388 --> 01:06:38.266
the keys to my life.

01:06:47.942 --> 01:06:51.404
The seasons of life
don't always come in order.

01:06:52.322 --> 01:06:54.907
Sometimes, the moment
you feel like it's spring,

01:06:57.493 --> 01:07:00.538
a harsh winter suddenly arrives.

01:07:04.334 --> 01:07:05.418
Seven years ago,

01:07:07.462 --> 01:07:09.005
in the midst of my coldest winter,

01:07:09.756 --> 01:07:12.216
she came into my life
like a warm spring breeze.

01:07:13.009 --> 01:07:14.594
And now, she's here again.

01:07:15.928 --> 01:07:18.598
And that day, we had no idea

01:07:19.265 --> 01:07:22.685
whether our future seasons
would be warm like spring

01:07:23.436 --> 01:07:26.105
or harsh like winter.

01:07:33.112 --> 01:07:34.697
Seonu Chan…

01:07:37.158 --> 01:07:38.201
who are you?

01:07:40.453 --> 01:07:41.621
I love you, Chan.

01:07:43.373 --> 01:07:44.540
I love you,

01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:47.085
Kang Hyeokchan.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.219
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

01:08:20.326 --> 01:08:23.537
Mr. Seonu.
Why are you stalking me?

01:08:23.538 --> 01:08:25.331
It feels like
it's hard to get close to her.

01:08:25.873 --> 01:08:28.333
She never talks about herself.

01:08:28.334 --> 01:08:30.252
How did you know
I don't like eggplants?

01:08:30.253 --> 01:08:33.255
There's another guy who speaks like him.

01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:34.714
Why does this keep happening?

01:08:34.715 --> 01:08:35.925
It's scaring me.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.427
What are you doing here?

01:08:38.428 --> 01:08:39.886
I'm going to live here.

01:08:39.887 --> 01:08:42.514
They look good together.

01:08:42.515 --> 01:08:45.517
Keep an eye on Ms. Song

01:08:45.518 --> 01:08:47.395
and Seonu Chan.

01:08:59.532 --> 01:09:00.615
IN YOUR RADIANT SEASON

01:09:00.616 --> 01:09:01.617
