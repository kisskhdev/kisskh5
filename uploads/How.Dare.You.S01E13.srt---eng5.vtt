the Empress Dowager's faction's power
step by step.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:59.510
Just wait—

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.850
the court is going to get lively again.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.900
But there's one more problem.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.480
Ever since you confined me to
the Cold Palace,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.390
Prince Duan has been sending letters
frequently, trying to win me over.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.360
He still hasn't given up on

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.690
finding out who the expert
by your side is.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.590
Here, Your Highness.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.460
Have some tripe.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.920
It's okay. Help yourself.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.010
That's omasum.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.430
This is tripe.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.450
They taste similar.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.480
Right.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.840
Since they taste similar,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.280
when he wants tripe,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.800
I can just give him omasum instead.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.880
So you mean

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.520
a bait and switch?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.920
Exactly—a classic decoy maneuver.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.620
There's a secret guard
by the Empress Dowager's side

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.880
with a scar on his face.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.980
And Mr. Bei knows the Disguise Art.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.540
-What a coincidence, isn't it?
-What a coincidence, isn't it?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.380
Are you two

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.950
speaking in riddles?

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.390
I don't understand a single word.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.390
You're not supposed to.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.230
Just eat.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.800
That's right.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.480
Yet he

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.590
dreads anyone else gaining my support,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.250
so he's kept me imprisoned
the Cold Palace all this time.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.840
These hopeless, miserable days...

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.440

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.440
Once you step beyond these palace walls,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.110
you can

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.970
gallop freely on horseback, unrestrained.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.960
Wouldn't a life like that

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960
be exhilarating?

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.300
Your Highness.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.530
Think it over for yourself.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.440
Since you've come into this world,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.750
what is it that you truly want?

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.400
-In my dream, I saw that
-"In my dream, I saw that

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.200
-on the eighth day of October,
-on the eighth day of October,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.750
-the expert rode alone to Zhangtai,
-the expert rode alone to Zhangtai..."

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.410
to that entertainment house.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.960
In front of him was a high platform,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.530
behind him a crescent moon,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.580
and it looked like
he was watching a variety act.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.270
The eighth day of October is tomorrow.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.530
Do you believe her words, Your Highness?

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.370
Not completely, of course.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.240
So...

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.920
Make the arrangements—

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.770
I'll pay a visit to the palace tonight.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.850
Yes.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.320
Yong'er.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.690
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.550
You've just recovered from
a serious illness

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.480
and recently experienced a shock.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.030
No need for formalities between us.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.920
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.880
I'm fine now.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:42.310
Zhao Wucheng has successfully taken over
as commander of the Imperial Guards.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.370
I must thank you
for your excellent strategy, Yong'er.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.830
However, there's another
troublesome matter now.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.690
A skilled expert has appeared
by the Emperor's side

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.130
and has put me in danger several times.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.860
Yong'er, do you know anything

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.020
about this matter?

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.000
Is he referring to Bei Zhou,
the supreme martial artist

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
who has deep connections with the Emperor
in the book?

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.920
But I remember
he should appear much later.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.110
I vaguely recall seeing
glimpses of him in my dreams.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.840
This person does seem to exist.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.610
So, Your Highness,

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.110
is this why you've come to see me?

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.560
Are you angry with me, Yong'er?

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.030
As a mere palace consort,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.520
what right do I have to be angry with
Your Highness?

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.400
I'm merely lamenting my own fate.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.960
Your Highness, look at the flowers
in this flower house.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.220
Beautiful as they are,

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.050
they're confined to this small space.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.070
Tell me,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.750
besides waiting for others to admire them,

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.990
what else can they do?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.640
Yong'er.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.990
Perhaps in others' eyes,

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.590
I'm a prince close to the people,

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.790
a valiant general,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.420
someone expected to become a wise ruler.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.930
But no one actually cares about

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.070
what kind of person I truly am

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.550
deep down.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.210
Within these palace walls,

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.310
I endured the darkest days of my life—

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200
trampled,

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.680
humiliated,

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.110
whipped—

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.030
simply because my mother

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.590
was a lowlife in this palace.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.070
I guess she was favored once,

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.110
but before long,

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.400
she was trampled by
someone even more favored

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.570
and became a wronged soul
lingering in this dark palace.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.060
So no one understands better than I do

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.550
what this vast palace

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.030
means for a woman.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.350
And no one is more desperate than I am

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.010
to take her out of this sea of suffering
as soon as possible,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.180
to be together for all lifetimes to come.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.680
But I don't have that ability right now.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.440
Perhaps I shouldn't have approached you,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.700
perhaps I'm not the right man for you,

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.510
or perhaps from the very beginning,
I never should have...

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.970
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.600
I was being willful.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.750
I know Your Highness bears the world

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.290
on your shoulders.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.960
What is a little grievance on my part
compared to that?

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.000
Mr. Bei.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.510
The dagger's finished?

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.110
It wasn't difficult to make.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.970
The credit goes to your design.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.680
Look.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.890
Impressive.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.680
As soon as tonight's operation is over,

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.830
I'll help Bai leave.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.510
In such a hurry?

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.110
Dan's arrangements won't be wrong.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.240
Then I'll go say goodbye to him now.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.300
Last night when I observed the stars,

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.010
I noticed those 5 stars

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.160
were about to align.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.340
So?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.700
Master's divinations are always accurate,

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.150
and he asked me to pass along
one more thing:

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.400
your meeting with each other

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.320
may not be a blessing after all.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.830
You're just making this up, aren't you?

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.230
I wouldn't dare joke about Master's words.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.790
Let her leave sooner—

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.410
maybe you both can survive.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.910
If you covet Wanyin, just say so.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.160
I mean well.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.370
Even if you won't think of yourself,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.080
at least think of her.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.810
What does it matter
that you're the Emperor?

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:41.870
Can you protect her

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.530
from being mistreated?

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.320
That I can do.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.370
Then can you promise

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.270
to love only her—to take
just this one ladle from the vast waters?

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.270
That's also easy.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.010
Alright.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.510
Fine.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.540
Even if you can do all that you say,

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.110
she'll still be a bird in a cage,

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.480
never able to roam freely and happily
in this world.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:09.960
Bai.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.180
The world isn't just for roaming freely.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.570
She has her own ambitions.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.040
You only see her as a little bird

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.910
that needs to be set free,

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.550
but you fail to see

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.800
how upright and noble she is—

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.780
radiant as the sun,

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.610
able to light up the vast blue sky.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:41.890
Your Highness.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.360
Think it over for yourself.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.260
Since you've come into this world,

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.790
what is it that you truly want?

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.160
That kind of life would be wonderful,
of course.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.290
But I have more important things to do.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.010
Bai, you know what?

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.640
Back in my hometown,

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.920
we liked to use the term
"corporate slaves"

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.250
to describe ourselves,

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.270
as if

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.680
we were all just slaves—

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.170
blindfolded and driven by others,

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.220
doing meaningless things day after day.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.750
But now I have a chance.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.460
When I'm able to do more for this world

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.240
and for more people,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.930
I no longer want to live
just for my own happiness.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.540
The Polaris restores the light in the sky.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.470
A dark omen of royal blood and ruin;

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.960
fortune and calamity hang by a thread.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.630
Five stars align,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.790
[The Nameless,
a master beyond the worldly realm]

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.920
amidst despair, great fortune rises.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.330
These two people are entangled
in many karmic connections.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.080
Their past lives

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.840
are not in this mortal realm.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.930
So annoying.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.570
I'll go pack my things.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.320
But you're right, actually.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.500
It's truly hard for her

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.030
to feel happy here.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.230
If one day she fulfills her ambitions

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.650
and wishes to leave,

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.440
and I'm no longer around by then,

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.690
take her away with you.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.810
Don't say such things.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.640
Please, I'm begging you.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.140
Here, Mr. Li. There are still seats here.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.470
Let's go take a look.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.720
This way, sir.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.310
Gentlemen, thank you for
honoring us today

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.590
with your generous tips.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.350
I guarantee you'll be satisfied with

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:09.830
our variety acts today.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.240
Fill the wine,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.680
pour the tea,

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.070
and let the music begin!

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.700
Alright, alright.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.640
Why are you standing here?
Please go upstairs.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.030
Come on.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:21.560
Alright.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.310
Sir.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.990
What took you so long?

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.640
We've been waiting for you.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.700
Come on, have a seat over there.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.320
No rush,

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.350
no rush.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.060
Today, we have a newly composed song

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.510
called "The Fish Basket Melody."

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.240
The new girls are sweet-tongued as honey—

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.500
miss them now and you'll regret it later.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.540
Please, come in—upstairs, this way.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.500
My Lord, they're here.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.370
Proceed as planned.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.920
Yes.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.380
Trust me, you won't regret it.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.440
Young master, please drink more.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:14.970
Alright.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.480
Sir, do you need anything?

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.620
Hey,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.830
let's talk things through.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.900
Send our people up

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.200
to perform the next variety act.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.640
Don't alarm the audience below the stage.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.080
Sir, drink less next time, alright?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:57.640
Bravo!

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.200
Bravo!

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.050
How nice!

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.310
Bravo!

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.240
Bravo!

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.070
Bravo!

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.000
Bravo!

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.160
They're really skilled.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.400
Yes, truly impressive.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.070
Bravo!

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.470
This is truly wonderful.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.560
-Bravo!
-Truly impressive.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.830
Bravo! Bravo!

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.830
Such martial skills.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:43.640
This is truly impressive!

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.480
Really amazing!

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.310
His skills are truly impressive.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.310
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.210
Look at that!

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.750
Bravo!

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.770
Murder!

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.090
[Prince Duan's Mansion]

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.820
Your Highness.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:16.080
How did it go?

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.030
There's both good news

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.790
and bad news.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.110
Stop keeping us in suspense.
Just tell us the result.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.550
Say it.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.090
The plan succeeded.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.840
However,

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.040
all the assassins sent

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.720
were wiped out.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:35.620
Then...

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.770
This...

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.000
Continue.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.110
As soon as the fight broke out,

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.880
the audience scattered in all directions,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.210
and the place descended into total chaos.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.510
That fellow was surrounded

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.330
on all sides by the assassins,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.740
yet with a single swift move, he slipped
through a gap in their encirclement,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.560
which was truly unbelievable.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.540
He was clearly stabbed once,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.690
but it didn't seem to affect him
in the slightest.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:03.960
He kept fighting,

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.870
charging left and right.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:08.790
Then came

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.210
a second blow,

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.600
and then a third.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.350
Each strike looked fatal,

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.610
blades flashing with blood everywhere—

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:21.210
yet he still showed no sign of faltering,
as if nothing were wrong.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.310
Only after he had killed the last assassin

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.300
did he let out a long peal of laughter,
"hahaha,"

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.150
and then finally collapsed.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.830
Why are you repeating the laughter?

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.230
You're here to report,
not to tell stories.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:53.650
Your Highness.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.920
What I just said

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.510
wasn't exaggerated at all.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.840
Where's that expert's body?

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.720
After he died,

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.640
the officers ordered
the brothel keepers to clean up the scene

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.400
and wipe away all the bloodstains.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:10.720
My Lord.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.400
-I sent someone to buy the body.
-My Lord, the body is here.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.130
And we confirmed his identity.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:16.970
Who is he?

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.560
Based on the body and his belongings,

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.680
he was a trusted secret guard
of the Empress Dowager.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.470
The Empress Dowager?

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.880
Extremely ruthless
with exceptional skills,

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.540
with a long scar on his face.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.070
He was someone

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.070
we were specifically
on guard against before.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.600
So you're saying the Empress Dowager's man

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.820
was protecting the Emperor?

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.340
This...

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.920
I never expected

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.160
things would turn out like this, either.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.760
Why would the Empress Dowager

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.140
suddenly show goodwill to the Emperor?

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.860
This is too bizarre.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.440
A-Absolutely impossible.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440
Have you forgotten

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.030
how fiercely they fought

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.000
over the Salt-for-Services Policy?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.110
That was an intense confrontation

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:06.000
known to everyone at court.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:06.960
How could they suddenly...

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.000
Or perhaps

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.500
he was a spy the Empress Dowager
placed at the Emperor's side.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:14.159
Then...

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.070
Then wouldn't we have killed
the wrong person

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.550
and actually helped the Emperor

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:19.679
eliminate a threat?

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.969
Gentlemen, there's no need
to overthink it.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.639
Eliminating someone of such special status

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.440
actually gives us peace of mind.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.219
At this point, the two of them
are both spent forces.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.730
With the court rife with intrigue,

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.449
replacing them

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.960
is only a matter of time.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.960
Your Highness is wise.

[Zhang San's Diary]

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.360
I heard

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.150
you've been coming to the library
every few days.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.190
I thought you were diligently studying.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.860
I didn't expect

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.110
you'd be so fond of
these plants and flowers.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.750

I haven't blamed you for anything.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.390

in very high regard.

It's just that she was overly strict
in disciplining you.

his gardening is

actually quite beautiful.

I always mean what I say.

Why are you still calling her
"Your Majesty?"

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.070
You should change how you address her

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.530
and call her "Mother" now.

isn't this wonderful?

Look at these flowers.

They're truly exquisite.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:11.440
Yeah.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.320

We don't want to be late.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.440
Just one look.
