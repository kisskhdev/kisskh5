(Hongfa Mahjong Parlor)

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.150
Who's the owner?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.469
Are you here to play mahjong?

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.950
All tables are full today.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.909
Maybe another time.

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:39.915
(You're in a camera area.
Mind your actions.)

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:42.262
(Restricted area. Keep out.)

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.870
Officer.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.629
This is just a small recreation center.

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.749
The residents just come to play

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:57.710
for fun.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.230
Absolutely no illegal activities here.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.590
This place is suspected
of illegal gambling.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.430
Take him away.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.870
Gambling?

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.070
This is just a mahjong parlor,
just for fun.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.710
Ye, has your master left?

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.510
He fell asleep.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.349
He fell asleep?

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.989
Ziwu.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.309
Are you heading home?

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:26.229
I can drive you home.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.989
I-I'm still waiting for a test result.

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:31.309
So you go ahead.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.390
Okay.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.150
Then I...

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:16.229
Thanks.

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:20.150
I came in to bring you something.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.309
Then I saw you sleeping.

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:23.150
So I put this on you.

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.390
Bring me the milk.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.270
Here.

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:38.270
Sour.

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:39.989
It's yogurt.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:53.630
Are you biking? Give me a ride.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.800
I will have a dinner with my classmate.
Are you going?

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.710
No.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.136
I have an early start tomorrow.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.789
Alright.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:06.150
I saw you checking your phone
constantly.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.096
Waiting for messages?

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:08.909
Don't ask.

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:11.429
I told you.

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:13.270
If you like a girl,
go after her and tell her.

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:14.669
Don't bottle it up.

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:21.272
Wait. I'm talking to you.
Why sigh? What's with that look?

00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:23.190
What's wrong with you?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.390
Are you giving me a ride?

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.549
Brief me on the situation.

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.669
We pulled the surveillance footage.

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.989
The elevator footage shows

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.190
that Shanzai
and Haozi appeared at the victim's door

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.270
an hour before the report was filed.

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.869
The time aligns
with the informant's account.

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:42.070
It's basically true.

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.590
I reviewed a month's worth of footage.

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:50.710
These two were indeed at the crime scene
for the first time yesterday morning.

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:54.909
The autopsy confirms the time of death
was 8 PM the previous night.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.669
(Zhao Sihui)
If they were there for the first time,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.789
they couldn't commit the crime.

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:04.510
I checked all the footage
from the complex.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.400
That can be confirmed.

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:10.669
We can rule them out as suspects.

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:13.710
What about the 150,000 yuan?

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.109
It's verified.

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:17.150
Following Haozi's clues,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.789
we found the mahjong parlor owner
who is engaged in gambling.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.789
Zhao Heizi did leave
around 6 PM on the day of the crime,

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:24.669
with 150,000 yuan he won.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.190
After he left,
everyone else kept playing.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.830
No one left.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.950
Footage confirms it.

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:31.390
So 150,000 yuan is our next lead.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.270
How did Zhao Heizi carry the money?

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.589
It was in a black plastic bag.

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:39.230
He carried the bag by hand when leaving.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.789
Where's the mahjong parlor located?

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.829
A private house
near the tunnel entrance.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:45.990
It's close to the victim's home.

00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:48.230
The victim left at 6 PM,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.589
but didn't get home until 8 PM.

00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:51.549
Where was he for those two hours?

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.709
I also noticed something else
in the footage.

00:08:55.709 --> 00:08:56.312
This woman...

00:08:56.888 --> 00:08:57.720
(Mistress)

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:00.709
She visited Zhao Heizi's home
multiple times this month.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.789
Last month on the 28th,
she even spent the night there.

00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:08.350
They had breakfast together
the next morning.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.909
So the victim likely went to see her
after leaving the mahjong parlor.

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.270
This neighborhood seems unsafe now.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.270
How terrifying.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.949
How could this happen?

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:26.750
How terrifying.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.669
Right over there.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.870
Be careful, everyone.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.909
Stay back.

00:09:32.669 --> 00:09:34.750
Trust the police
and property management.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.750
Something happened
at Zhao Heizi's place.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.270
Isn't his home on the second floor?

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:39.390
Yeah.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:39.949
So horrifying.

00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:41.630
This place is not safe anymore.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.909
How terrifying.

00:09:43.023 --> 00:09:43.909
(Zhao)

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:45.350
How did this happen?

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.429
How terrifying!

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:50.549
The footprint trace at the scene

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:51.750
is clear and distinct.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.870
It's from a pair of size 41 sneakers.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.088
New soles,
so the shoes were bought recently.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.909
At the scene, I only
extracted one type of biological sample.

00:09:58.909 --> 00:10:00.470
It was the victim's bloodstain.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.510
However, based on the bloodstain,
we can deduce the entire sequence

00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:08.630
of the suspect's actions.
At Zhao Heizi's home,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.110
a bloodstain was also extracted
at the main power switch.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.110
There was a lot.

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:16.429
It's inferred that the suspect likely

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:18.589
touched the main power switch
after killing the victim.

00:10:19.189 --> 00:10:20.110
This suggests

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.189
the killer cut the power
before committing the murder.

00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:27.270
So, in such complete darkness,

00:10:27.589 --> 00:10:30.510
how did the killer
carry out the quick killing?

00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:33.230
If we stay long enough in darkness,
we will gradually

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.750
adapt to see the surroundings.

00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:37.030
This is our eyes' ability
to adapt to light.

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:13.990
Right. I looked up some information
to explain this to everyone.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.110
The human retina
has cone cells and rod cells.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.309
Cone cells only respond
to bright light stimuli.

00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:23.510
But at night,
we rely mainly on rod cells to see

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.630
because rod cells contain substances
sensitive to low light,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.150
namely rhodopsin.

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:30.669
Moving suddenly
from bright light into darkness

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:32.350
causes the cone cells
to stop functioning.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.470
The rod cells need time
to resynthesize rhodopsin.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.270
This synthesis process
is adaptation to darkness.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.709
It usually takes several minutes.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.829
The suspect exploited this fact.

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:43.669
Right after Zhao Heizi
entered the dark room,

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:47.189
he couldn't see temporarily
due to the darkness.

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:49.350
At that moment,
the killer swiftly killed him.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.630
The killer came prepared.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.470
Yes.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.429
Now look at this.

00:11:56.429 --> 00:11:58.829
Based on the traces extracted
from the scene,

00:11:58.829 --> 00:12:02.549
all glove prints at the scene
show linear scratch marks.

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:08.150
I infer the gloves worn by the suspect
were made of a very unique material.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.669
Based on measurements
of the linear marks,

00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:13.549
it's basically confirmed
that they were cut-resistant gloves.

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:16.470
Moreover, after careful observation

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.350
of the bloodstain distribution
at the scene,

00:12:18.789 --> 00:12:20.189
I infer when the victim entered,

00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:22.230
he likely wasn't carrying 150,000 yuan.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.510
If the victim had been
carrying the money,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.270
during the killing process,

00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:28.829
a lot of blood would have gotten
onto the plastic bag.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.230
After the murder,

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.030
if the suspect took that bag of money,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.309
a blank spot would appear
in the blood on the floor.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.309
Surveillance shows

00:12:36.309 --> 00:12:38.829
that Zhao Heizi was indeed empty-handed
when returning home.

00:12:41.789 --> 00:12:44.150
Ziwu, report your findings.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.150
On the red towel found
on the bathroom floor,

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.870
I extracted three types of substances.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.870
One was the victim's blood.

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:54.630
Another was ordinary sand
and soil particles.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.270
The third
had more complex chemical components.

00:12:57.429 --> 00:12:59.429
It contains shellac,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.110
pure benzene, ethanol,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.110
rubber, and other chemical compounds.

00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:08.589
These chemicals are typically used
for leather finishing oil,

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:11.949
which is generally used
to dye leather jackets

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.589
or increase their sheen.

00:13:14.309 --> 00:13:17.069
Are you saying that after killing,

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:18.470
the suspect wiped himself

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.510
with the towel,
leaving the three substances on it?

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:21.270
Yes.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.549
A leather jacket?

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.549
A black leather jacket.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.949
Significant aniline black
was extracted from the towel,

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:29.630
namely, a black dye,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.669
meaning it was likely black leather oil.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.350
So, it appears
the killer made thorough preparations.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.510
He feared injury
when the victim attacked back.

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:44.189
So he used cut-resistant gloves.

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:46.270
That was his preparation for the murder.

00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:48.230
Leather has low permeability.

00:13:48.549 --> 00:13:49.870
After blood splattered onto it,

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.870
it could be easily wiped off
with a towel.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.750
That was his preparation for escaping.

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:57.309
Ye's analysis makes sense.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.270
The killer's primary motive was murder.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.909
This suggests deep animosity
between the killer and the victim.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.069
It's highly likely they knew each other.

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:12.549
One more piece of information.

00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:14.470
The door shows signs of being pried,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.230
but the lock cylinder shows nothing.

00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:18.589
So, it was a non-forced entry,

00:14:18.589 --> 00:14:20.630
namely, a non-violent entry.

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:24.549
We now know the suspect entered
beforehand to ambush.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.750
So the only plausible entry method
I can think of

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.750
is using a key.

00:14:31.789 --> 00:14:34.150
So, based on this information,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.429
we can think about who else might
have keys to the victim's home.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.429
Your turn.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.870
Did you hear?

00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:49.669
A man died in Lvyin Community.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.270
They say someone hacked him
to death at home.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.949
Is that true?

00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:56.870
How could something like this happen?

00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:58.309
Of course, it's true.

00:14:58.309 --> 00:15:00.270
My sister-in-law lives there.

00:15:00.909 --> 00:15:01.949
They said

00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:04.350
many police officers showed up
in their community that day.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.870
You're giving me goosebumps.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.069
I heard that man owed a ton of money.

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:13.750
His wife and kid are in Shanghai.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.110
They didn't come back
after getting the news.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:17.949
Why come back?

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:19.309
He's already dead.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.669
Who knows
if the creditors would target them?

00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:22.390
Right?

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.069
Yeah.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.669
I've heard about this.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.669
I even saw a video about it on my phone.

00:15:27.789 --> 00:15:29.309
I wonder if they caught the killer.

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:33.429
Bai Xue, what are you thinking about?

00:15:33.429 --> 00:15:34.230
It's your turn.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.829
Your talking is giving me a headache.

00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:41.350
Where've you been these past few days?

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.350
I haven't seen you in days.

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:45.589
I've had a terrible headache,

00:15:45.589 --> 00:15:46.750
completely unwell.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.110
I stayed at home for days.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.630
A few days ago,
I saw you talking to some guy nearby.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.350
You were holding something.
Who was that guy?

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.429
He looked pretty sloppy.

00:15:58.909 --> 00:15:59.829
A relative of yours?

00:16:00.549 --> 00:16:02.350
Now you're gossiping about me?

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.510
You've got sharp eyes.

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:06.230
I met him outside.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.350
I was just saying hello.

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:09.270
Someone you know outside?

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.510
Is he your old flame?

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.270
Nonsense.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.069
By that logic,

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:16.630
every guy who talks to me
on the street is my old flame?

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.309
Who is it?

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.069
Criminal investigation division.
We have some questions for you.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.150
Come with us.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.350
- Police.
- Police.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.429
- She's in trouble.
- Wait.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.589
They're here to arrest her.

00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:36.069
You've seen enough of it.

00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.909
You may leave.

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:39.510
- Go.
- Hurry up.

00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:48.110
Give me another second.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.504
(Conference Room)

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:27.990
Bai Xue,

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.349
did you know about Zhao Heizi's death?

00:17:34.109 --> 00:17:37.030
When I went to his place,
I saw it was sealed off by you.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.309
Everyone's been talking about his death.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.432
I couldn't help but hear about it.

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:44.829
So, what was your relationship
with Zhao Heizi?

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:49.470
Since you brought me here,

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.109
don't you already know it?

00:17:52.069 --> 00:17:52.869
Mistress.

00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:56.510
Besides him,

00:17:57.149 --> 00:18:00.670
are you also involved with someone else?

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.069
I live off men.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.670
I'm not a good woman.

00:18:09.829 --> 00:18:11.670
Those men were scared of me

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.030
asking them to buy me gifts.

00:18:13.389 --> 00:18:14.670
They avoided me like the plague.

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:16.990
Who would kill for me?

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.030
How ridiculous.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.869
Did you know about Zhao Heizi's family?

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.109
I heard from him.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.270
He's not young.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.270
His daughter married far away,
and his wife went with her.

00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:34.990
He lived alone.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.789
Every day, besides gambling a bit,

00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:39.510
he just sought women for amusement.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.670
But he treated me well.

00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:44.430
At least, he was generous.

00:18:45.389 --> 00:18:47.589
He didn't try
to squeeze anything out of me.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.309
Did Zhao Heizi come
to see you the night he died?

00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:59.349
He did.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.030
Hello?

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.549
I'm downstairs now.

00:19:39.109 --> 00:19:39.910
So much money.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.869
If you don't pay them back,
won't they go after you?

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:47.829
I'll drag it out as long as I can.

00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:51.629
Once they know
they can't do anything about it,

00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:53.750
they might settle for less.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.190
Oh, right,

00:19:56.389 --> 00:19:57.710
keep this money for me.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.670
We'll spend it later.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.389
Go downstairs and buy some food.

00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:05.549
We'll have a drink later.

00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:07.670
Okay.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.030
We should have a good drink later.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.869
I'll go buy some food now.

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:22.750
Do you still have that 150,000 yuan?

00:20:23.869 --> 00:20:25.549
I brought it here with me.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.149
Alright.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.389
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:20:40.349 --> 00:20:42.549
Did he suffer when he died?

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:46.710
Got it.

00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:49.030
Why did you ask?

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.670
As I said, he treated me fairly well.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.869
I just hope he could suffer less.

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:23.470
Master.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.230
Bai Xue just went to a shop
and bought some funerary objects.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.309
Captain Leng.

00:21:47.629 --> 00:21:48.109
Come in.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.430
Here's the information on Bai Xue.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.069
Do you still suspect her?

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:01.670
You haven't eaten?

00:22:03.349 --> 00:22:03.990
Take it.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:05.030
No.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.270
I can't eat them.

00:22:07.109 --> 00:22:08.549
Come on. Just eat.

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:09.349
Thanks.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.910
Captain Leng, here is...

00:22:15.389 --> 00:22:16.069
Ziwu.

00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:17.549
Try one.

00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:20.470
Just put it here.

00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:28.270
Captain Leng.

00:22:28.309 --> 00:22:30.589
What's wrong? Is Ziwu getting mad?

00:22:36.349 --> 00:22:37.270
Anything else?

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:39.950
I have something else to do.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.869
I have to go.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.829
Found anything?

00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:24.629
Nothing significant.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.990
We're lacking leads.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.470
I just came to find more.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.470
But look at the blood spatters.

00:23:31.629 --> 00:23:33.510
There really are no blank spots.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.710
But if the killer didn't kill for money,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.069
and every stab was fatal,

00:23:37.629 --> 00:23:39.389
the only possibility
is a revengeful murder.

00:23:39.829 --> 00:23:42.230
Bai Xue is already cleared, right?

00:23:44.309 --> 00:23:45.430
I checked the door lock.

00:23:46.309 --> 00:23:48.430
There are only marks made by Haozi.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.349
Unlike the one in the room,
this character "Fu" is put upside down.

00:23:57.629 --> 00:23:58.629
Someone moved it.

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:02.629
You're right.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.430
Given the dust on this tape,

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.190
it must have been moved recently.

00:24:13.069 --> 00:24:14.149
That makes sense now.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.270
The suspect probably picked the lock
from here.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.829
Liu Yang.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.230
Check with Zhao Heizi's daughter

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.910
and ask her if they came back
for Zhao Heizi's birthday in 2023

00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:22.389
and took a family photo.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.349
Also, who was there on his birthday?

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:25.230
Right now.

00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:34.430
The length of this kind of tool

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.789
is determined
based on the lock's position.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.910
Usually, for portability,

00:25:40.589 --> 00:25:41.910
it's mostly assembled on-site.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.109
Just with some metal rods and bolts.

00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:46.750
It's simple.

00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:52.190
Master.

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:53.910
Lei wants us to look at the footage.

00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:56.789
Based on Long's analysis

00:25:56.789 --> 00:26:00.030
and the clothing details Ziwu provided,

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.950
I found this suspect.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.829
This is footage
from the east gate camera.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.030
When the suspect entered,

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.109
his hands were empty, carrying nothing.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.030
Now look here.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.589
This is him leaving the complex.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.149
Again, his hands were empty,
carrying nothing.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.109
According to Long's analysis,

00:26:22.629 --> 00:26:27.750
he likely used something
like a peephole or a lock-picking tool.

00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:29.869
Long, how do you explain this?

00:26:32.069 --> 00:26:34.069
Either he had an accomplice,

00:26:34.069 --> 00:26:35.430
or otherwise...

00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:40.230
Master.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.309
Lei, what about the elevator footage?

00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:44.510
None.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.829
He probably didn't use the elevator.

00:26:46.829 --> 00:26:47.750
He took the stairs.

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:51.109
Right, I confirmed that.

00:26:51.349 --> 00:26:54.149
I found his footprints in the stairwell.

00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:55.510
Jiao.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.629
I have an idea.

00:26:56.829 --> 00:26:59.470
Cut out the images
of the suspect from both video clips.

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:02.670
Resize them proportionally
to the same scale.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.510
Okay.

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:13.430
Take a look. Found anything?

00:27:21.589 --> 00:27:24.549
When the suspect entered the complex,
his abdomen was slightly protruding.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.670
But after he left, it looked flat.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:33.230
So he must have hidden the tools
inside his clothes.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.389
After killing, he discarded the tools
somewhere inside the complex.

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:41.109
Contact the property management
immediately.

00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:43.750
Re-check all cleaning staff

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:44.670
dumping the trash

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:45.789
for that day.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.349
And find the tools.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.470
Go now.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.950
Yes.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:51.710
Master.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:53.589
I think

00:27:54.069 --> 00:27:55.349
she must know something.

00:28:36.629 --> 00:28:37.430
Found something.

00:28:41.349 --> 00:28:43.349
I have a plan
to play mahjong with friends today.

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.430
What brings you here again?

00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:53.629
On Zhao Heizi's birthday last July,

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.510
were you there?

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.270
Sure.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.069
Last year,
he had a falling out with his family.

00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:01.829
His wife and kid didn't come back.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.589
I spent his birthday with him.

00:29:04.069 --> 00:29:05.230
Did you take photos?

00:29:06.589 --> 00:29:07.389
Yes.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.470
Isn't that photo displayed
in his cabinet?

00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:13.470
That photo is missing.

00:29:15.589 --> 00:29:16.789
I didn't know it.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.750
Maybe he put it away.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.389
Why did you ask?

00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:27.710
It's highly likely
that the murderer took that photo.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.510
Anything you want to say?

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.190
Or anyone you suspect?

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.030
Officer Ye?

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.030
I can call you that, right?

00:29:39.349 --> 00:29:43.510
Are you suggesting
the murderer did it for me?

00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:47.430
I've already told you.

00:29:49.589 --> 00:29:50.950
I'm not a good woman.

00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:53.549
Men avoided me like the plague.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.190
Who would kill for me?

00:29:58.910 --> 00:29:59.990
You're a man too.

00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:01.710
For a woman,

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.629
would you do that?

00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:10.520
The fact that I wouldn't
doesn't mean others wouldn't.

00:30:10.829 --> 00:30:12.109
Whether you tell truth or lies,

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.349
it'll all be clear
once we catch the killer.

00:30:27.629 --> 00:30:29.349
I've already verified with Bai Xue.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.950
On Zhao Heizi's birthday last year,

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:36.549
they took a photo
and displayed it with a family portrait.

00:30:36.589 --> 00:30:38.950
But after the crime,
that photo disappeared.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:48.470
You think Bai Xue is hiding something?

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.789
Bai Xue keeps insisting
it's unrelated to her past.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.549
But since the killer took that photo,

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:58.349
I believe
the killer not only knows Bai Xue,

00:30:58.869 --> 00:30:59.990
but has a history with her.

00:31:04.589 --> 00:31:05.389
Liu Yang.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.430
Look into Bai Xue again,

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.710
and try to find any suspicious points
we overlooked before.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:12.389
Okay.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.349
Hello?

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.190
Captain Leng.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.910
- Ziwu.
- Found it.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.670
On lock-picking tool's threaded
connector, I detected a DNA sample.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.470
It's from a male, with a prior record.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.309
I'll bring the information to you now.

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:55.910
Good.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:19.309
Hello?

00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:20.190
Hello?

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.589
Is this Lu Jun?

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.030
Is everything ready?

00:32:24.349 --> 00:32:25.149
It's ready.

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:29.750
Good. I'll be there soon.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.670
Okay.

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:36.789
I looked into him.

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:37.990
Lu Jun, male.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.309
He was born on August 12, 1984.

00:32:40.309 --> 00:32:41.309
In 2002,

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:43.430
he was sentenced for intentional assault

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.848
and released in 2019.
In January two years ago,

00:32:45.848 --> 00:32:48.020
(Information on Lu Jun)
he was sent to a drug rehab.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.200
He just got released this January.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.750
Only two months after that, he murdered.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.990
When you
investigated the victim's connections,

00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:57.389
was this man involved?

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:58.950
No, he wasn't.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.470
Ye Qian,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.990
find this man first.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:06.750
Understood.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.670
Hello.

00:33:36.829 --> 00:33:37.629
Police.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.030
Which room is Lu Jun in?

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.869
One moment.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:41.149
Room 303.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.589
Is he there now?

00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:44.069
I'm not sure about that.

00:33:44.349 --> 00:33:45.149
Give me the key.

00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.869
Okay.

00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.870
Police!

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.589
Police!

00:34:29.709 --> 00:34:30.749
No one. Turn on the light.

00:34:53.176 --> 00:34:59.640
(Li Guohua, Funeral Services)

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.669
Captain Leng.

00:35:14.149 --> 00:35:16.629
I just contacted Li Guohua
from Zhongxiao Funeral Services.

00:35:16.629 --> 00:35:19.549
A year ago, Lu Jun asked his brother
to buy a burial plot.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:20.549
A few days ago,

00:35:20.549 --> 00:35:22.950
he called to inquire
about the burial plot maintenance fee.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.589
He will go to pay the fee today.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.149
I've gotten the address.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.510
Let's go.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:29.549
Go.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.709
Check your gear.

00:35:56.248 --> 00:35:59.704
(Beloved Wife)

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:06.669
Mengqing.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.310
Very soon, I'll see you

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.229
and our child again.

00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:17.589
The three of us
will finally be together.

00:36:23.549 --> 00:36:26.510
No one will ever hurt you again.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.109
Lu Jun.

00:37:01.189 --> 00:37:02.870
Since we've found you,

00:37:03.189 --> 00:37:05.629
we hope you'll cooperate fully
with our investigation.

00:37:10.549 --> 00:37:13.310
You probably already know my background.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.870
I killed someone before.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.749
If I hadn't turned myself in,

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.069
I wouldn't be sitting here today.

00:37:22.189 --> 00:37:24.629
I'm not saying this
for any other reason.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.269
I will cooperate.

00:37:27.269 --> 00:37:28.629
Did you kill Zhao Heizi?

00:37:28.669 --> 00:37:29.229
Yes.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.549
Killing him fulfilled my final wish.

00:37:33.149 --> 00:37:34.069
What wish?

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.189
He caused my wife's death.

00:37:37.549 --> 00:37:38.549
Who was your wife?

00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:40.430
Wang Mengqing.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:44.149
Actually,
I've held a lot inside for years.

00:37:45.149 --> 00:37:48.189
After getting it out, I can face my end.

00:37:50.149 --> 00:37:53.269
Back in 2000, I was 16.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:55.830
My family was poor

00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:57.350
and couldn't raise all the kids.

00:37:58.269 --> 00:38:00.269
So I had to start
to work in my early days.

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.470
I had almost no money when I left home.

00:38:05.709 --> 00:38:08.629
So I just wanted
to find a job to support myself.

00:38:10.229 --> 00:38:12.430
I took a job as a bartender in a bar.

00:38:13.269 --> 00:38:14.549
Pay was lousy.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.470
But that's where

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.189
I met Mengqing.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.350
I remember one night,

00:38:24.749 --> 00:38:26.749
Mengqing was drinking
with two customers.

00:38:27.269 --> 00:38:29.390
She got drunk and went to the restroom.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:32.510
(Liu Yang, look into Wang Mengqing.)
I overheard

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:34.589
that those two guys planned

00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:36.990
to take her to a motel
when she came out.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.910
One of them slipped something
into her drink while saying it.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:43.870
I couldn't stand it.

00:38:44.709 --> 00:38:46.229
When Mengqing came out,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.229
I got her away.

00:38:50.149 --> 00:38:51.310
That night, to thank me,

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:53.830
she treated me to barbecue.

00:38:54.189 --> 00:38:55.709
She told me a lot then.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.910
I could tell

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.790
she was carrying heavy burdens too.

00:39:03.229 --> 00:39:04.910
Her family was poor too.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.470
To take care of her grandparents,

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.830
she started working at 14.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.189
We totally understood each other.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:19.229
We drank all night that day.

00:39:21.749 --> 00:39:22.669
After that night,

00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:25.109
we got together.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:28.310
To spare my feelings,

00:39:28.669 --> 00:39:30.629
she quit her job in the bar

00:39:31.229 --> 00:39:33.109
and got a job
as a waitress at a restaurant.

00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:36.109
Things were fine at first.

00:39:37.669 --> 00:39:39.910
But after three months,

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.910
I discovered her secret.

00:39:45.229 --> 00:39:46.109
What secret?

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:48.990
Mengqing was using drugs.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.149
What drug?

00:39:51.149 --> 00:39:51.950
Heroin.

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.990
A customer dragged her into it.

00:39:56.189 --> 00:39:58.229
She thought I'd leave her once I knew.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.390
But I told her

00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:01.669
that no matter what,

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:03.709
I would always love her.

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:05.030
Mengqing,

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.470
no matter what you become,

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.470
you're the one I love.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.390
Maybe because of those words,

00:40:16.669 --> 00:40:18.950
she was determined to quit.

00:40:23.149 --> 00:40:26.189
Those were our toughest six months.

00:40:28.229 --> 00:40:29.790
I worked two jobs every day,

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:34.149
just hoping to open our own shop sooner.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.510
Later, we saved up some money.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.310
We also borrowed some.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:47.790
I remember
it was Children's Day, June 1st, 2001.

00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:50.470
We rented a storefront

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:52.549
and opened a small restaurant.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:56.510
We thought
we could finally live normal lives.

00:40:58.709 --> 00:41:02.990
But a few days after the opening,

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.350
trouble came.

00:41:06.709 --> 00:41:09.870
They told me
if we wanted to run a shop there,

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.870
we had to
buy fixed amounts of ingredients

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:15.549
from them every day.

00:41:16.709 --> 00:41:18.109
Fixed amounts?

00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:19.229
Yes.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.189
They didn't care
if my business was good or bad.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:26.069
I had to spend 200 yuan
on buying things from them every day.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.549
And the stuff they gave us
are pure garbage.

00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:30.149
Rotten vegetables

00:41:30.149 --> 00:41:31.030
and spoiled pork.

00:41:31.669 --> 00:41:33.749
I found them completely inedible.

00:41:34.189 --> 00:41:35.589
So I rejected them.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:38.870
Did you file a report?

00:41:40.229 --> 00:41:41.030
I wish I could.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.790
Before I could even file a report,

00:41:44.709 --> 00:41:47.749
their leader,
a guy called Monkey, came to warn me.

00:41:48.749 --> 00:41:50.870
He said this area was his territory.

00:41:51.669 --> 00:41:55.030
If I wanted to do business here,
I had to follow his rules.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.589
Otherwise, I had to leave.

00:41:57.629 --> 00:41:59.870
I was only 18 then,
young and hot-headed.

00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:03.149
So I ended up fighting him
right there in the shop.

00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:06.350
I slashed Monkey's head with a knife.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:11.629
Because of that,
I was detained for 15 days.

00:42:12.669 --> 00:42:14.470
During my detention,

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.229
they went to Mengqing.

00:42:16.749 --> 00:42:19.430
They told her
to prepare a coffin for me.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.069
They said they'd kill me
the moment I was released.
