00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.930
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.820
[Episode 10]

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.710
Which company are you the CEO of?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.350
What does this company do?

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.570
When was it listed?

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.850
What was its market cap

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.200
before you came here?

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.430
I should just tell her everything.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.560
Who exactly are you?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.979
But if I tell the whole truth,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.820
that fragile bit of trust and closeness
she has with me

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.080
will probably vanish.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.210
Between letting her doubt me
and breaking her heart,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.140
I would rather let her keep doubting.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.079
I don't remember.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.579
If you don't want to tell me,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.620
I won't ask again.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.310
Your Highness!

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.000
Your Highness!

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.710
Wake up! Wake up!

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.570
Your Highness,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.670
stop sleeping.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.570
The Empress Dowager
is here to check your homework.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
What the hell?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.190
What am I wearing?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.750
How did I wake up here?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.870
Where am I?

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.270
I think earlier

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.470
I was sneaking my phone in math class

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.710
and accidentally clicked
on a cheesy web novel

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.310
called...

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.030
Oh right.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.070
It's called "Transmigrated:
The Devil's Beloved Consort"!

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.010
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.990
Your Majesty.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.130
How is the Crown Prince's study today?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.950
Your Majesty,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.310
today the Crown Prince studied
the Thousand Character Classic

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.300
and learned about astronomy, geography,
and social customs.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.240
-Devil's Favorite Concubine?
-He is a quick and eager learner

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.150
-Favorite Consort?
-and has already

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.560
grasped much of the material.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.220
So it really is a story
set in an imperial palace.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.630
It's just that...

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.480
Oh no.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.240
How do I get back?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.590
It hurts so much?

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.520
Here,

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.150
let me massage it for you.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.200
Here.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.580
Don't touch me, Mr. Bei.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.900
Why did it flare up all of a sudden?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.640
It might be a brain tumor.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.380
Impossible.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.790
I checked your pulse.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.810
You don't have that.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.090
I need a CT scan.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.970
Wh-What T?

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.730
Never mind.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.950
Mr. Bei.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.620
I want sweet porridge.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.070
Okay.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.680
I'll go make some right now.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.360
Just wait.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.159
Your Majesty, Mr. Bai sent another letter,

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.680
urging you to get rid of
the demonic consort as soon as possible.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.750
She is not a demonic consort!

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.080
No need to reply to that!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.870
Yes.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.200
Your Highness,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.340
His Majesty didn't summon you today.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.680
Is it appropriate for us
to go there directly?

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.510
It's precisely because he didn't summon me

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.680
that I must go.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.330
Why?

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.580
I don't understand.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.950
I, Xie Yong'er, am the chosen one.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.250
In this world, I was supposed to

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.720
have everything go my way.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.380
But I've been in the palace for so long.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.310
Not only have I accomplished nothing,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.360
but I have also been treated
like an outcast.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.020
An outcast?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.840
Now, although he says he believes me,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.800
he hasn't summoned me
to attend him even once since then.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.430
Don't you think something's off?

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.060
So, you mean...

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.710
Ling, remember,

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.780
in this harem,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.890
one careless step can cost you your life.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.430
Tonight,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.220
I must see His Majesty

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.100
and get to the bottom of this.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.120
[Yongyan Hall]

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.870
Eunuch An, I need to see His Majesty.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.470
Please let His Majesty know.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.780
Your Highness,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.040
His Majesty's headache has flared up.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.370
It's not convenient for him to see anyone.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.270
Eunuch An,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.400
if His Majesty is unwell,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.360
then all the more reason for me
to go in and attend him.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.430
Your Highness, please go back.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.760
His Majesty is seeing no one tonight.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.450
Please,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.750
don't make things difficult for me.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.310
[Yongyan Hall]

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.430
Having everything go my way?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.210
Is this how you treat the chosen one?

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.159
Why is she here?

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.040
And she looks even more miserable than me.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.870
Oh right.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.860
She's fallen out of favor
with His Majesty.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.190
Then let me make things
even worse for you.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.080
Go back first, Ling.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.040
Okay.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.410
Sister, why are you here alone?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.580
Are you enjoying the rain?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.830
Yong'er?

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.440
Why are you here?

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.490
I just went to see His Majesty,

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.799
but I didn't even get through the door.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.020
It seems his headache flared up

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.850
and he's not feeling well.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.429
His Majesty is ill?

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.230
You didn't know?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.020
Sister.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.410
I know you and His Majesty are in love.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.100
I think this is the perfect time

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.910
for you two to patch things up.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.540
Why don't you give it a try?

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.100
Since that's the case,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.050
I'll go take a look.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.620
Thank you for coming
to tell me about this.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.240
Go now.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.180
His Majesty said he's seeing no one.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.320
You're just going to hit a wall.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.280
[Yongyan Hall]

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.120
Dan.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.120
Dan?

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.940
Wanyin is here.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.130
The porridge is ready.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.530
Thanks, Mr. Bei.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.420
Well...

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.760
You two talk.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.330
You two talk.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.390
Let me feed you.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.530
Let's talk.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.140
There's no rush.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.540
You should rest now.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.210
You guessed right.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.110
I'm not actually a CEO.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:38.950
Before I came here,

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.050
I was a third-rate actor.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.800
I played bit parts for years

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.490
and never made it big.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.320
If that's all,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.320
why did you lie to me?

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.400
I didn't mean to lie to you.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.910
You first guessed that I was a CEO.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.600
You're not one of those
legendary alpha bosses, are you?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.120
I just went along with it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.060
Why did you do that?

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.960
I...

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.480
have always had bad luck,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.840
and I don't seem
to have any real talent either.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.360
I thought I would die here.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.240
Then,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.670
you showed up,

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.820
like a savior from the heavens,

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.150
holding the script

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.850
and determined to win.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:38.680
When I looked at you,

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.720
I finally felt

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.210
that there might still be hope for me.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.630
You're a little...

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.360
different from how I imagined.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.060
I thought

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.200
you were carrying some deep, dark secret.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.640
Now you know.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.110
I don't have much of a chance.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.480
Even if Prince Duan is a 2D character,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.780
he's 100 times more capable than me.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.460
So that promise

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.710
still stands.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.280
If you want to leave,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.470
I completely understand.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.880
I won't stop you.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.320
Even if you don't act pitiful,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.240
I won't leave.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.730
You need to get better soon.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.700
Our future plans

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.450
still need your acting skills.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.510
Why are your clothes all wet?

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.860
I just got caught in a bit of rain.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.200
I'll go back and change.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.200
Why don't you

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.360
take a hot bath here?

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.480
If you catch a cold,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.420
who's going to take care of me,
the patient?

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.520
[Xiao Tiancai]

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.260
Which palace are you from?

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.240
Don't stand in this heavy rain.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.570
Go into the flower house and take shelter.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.770
What are you waiting for? Go on in.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:11.770
Hurry up.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.620
Wait until the rain lets up
before you head back.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.460
Take this umbrella.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.950
Don't get caught in the rain again.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.340
If you catch a cold,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.850
at best you'll get a fever,

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.450
and at worst it could affect
your internal organs.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.980
That would be real trouble.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.470
This is mugwort.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.200
Take it back and smoke this spot,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.200
the Fengchi point.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.480
It helps dispel cold and dampness.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.880
It's best not to get sick.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.970
What is this?

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.360
This is called danggui.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.100
It grows along the northwestern border.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.770
Some time ago,

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.470
the Imperial Hospital wanted

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.670
to compile a catalog of medicinal herbs

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.340
and study their effects
and growing conditions,

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.670
so they had people bring back
a few plants from the northwest

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.090
and planted them here.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.560
They were fresh and lovely at first

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.090
and grew a lot in just 3 days.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.320
But for some reason,

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.480
after they bloomed, they began to wither.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.440
The same species can be very different

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.040
in different environments.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.050
The northwest is cold.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.730
If you plant it here,

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.430
it surely won't survive.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.540
That's not entirely true.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.000
Plants are like people.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.460
They have strong vitality

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.790
and will try hard
to adapt to different environments.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.240
Dandelions take root wherever they land.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.630
Wild grass grows back stronger
after burning.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.260
Sometimes the price of survival

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.030
is not being as lush as before,

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.430
or bearing fewer fruits,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.290
but that's the law of survival.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.330
Look at that.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.040
Lilyturf.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.320
It's also known as the "immortal herb."

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.720
Whether it's dry or damp,

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.780
warm or cold,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.290
it survives just fine.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.860
That's easy for you to say.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.060
With a flick of your fingers,

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.130
you decide whether it lives or dies.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.910
But has anyone ever asked
if it was willing?

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.330
Maybe death is its way of protesting.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.640
It... it's just a plant.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.360
Miss, can you tell me

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.150
how you know whether it's willing or not?

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.460
I just feel

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.760
it shouldn't have been taken away
from home

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.660
to grow
in this completely unfamiliar place

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.970
and wither here.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.760
What did it do wrong?

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.180
Why should it go through all this?

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.100
You have a soft heart.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.870
It pains me deeply

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.820
that they didn't survive.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.520
I come every day
to mist them and cool them down.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.030
I even prepare ice every day

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.510
to recreate a cold,
damp environment for them.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.110
Though they suffer greatly,

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.330
they aren't alone,

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.030
nor are they facing all this
by themselves.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.790
If,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.960
as you say,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.130
they truly

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.079
have thoughts of their own,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.510
then seeing someone watch over them

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.880
and make an effort for them

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.339
might give them a bit more will
to keep going.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.690
Even a herb has someone watching over it,

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.920
going through hardships together.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.750
Yet I have always been alone.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.500
Are you feeling better?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.720
I ate something,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.940
and I'm better now.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.590
Well,

Could he also be...

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.260
Crown Prince.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.740
In front of my house are two trees.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:13.830
One is a date tree.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.280
What is the other one?

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.270
"Before my bed, the moonlight glows."

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.670
Do you know the next line?

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.030
-"It looks like frost..."
-Your Highness!

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.030
Your Highness!

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:29.790
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.960
Your Highness,
I've been looking everywhere for you.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.440
The Empress Dowager is waiting for you.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.270
Your Highness,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.870
I will take His Highness back
to his palace now.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:50.170
CEO Dan!

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:51.450
CEO Dan!

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.560
Guess what I found in the library.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.940
What?

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.180
SOS.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.140
SOS?

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.200
Yeah.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.010
That distress signal.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.680
I had always been on the 2nd floor before.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.910
Today, I went up to the 3rd floor
to look for books about Yan State.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.470
Through an inconspicuous window,
I happened

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.020
to catch sight of an open space
beneath the library.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.030
Someone had planted flowers

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.390
spelling out a huge SOS.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.740
So there must be
another transmigrator here

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.560
like us.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.120
Could it have been Xie Yong'er?

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.180
That's what I thought at first.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.110
But everything she says and does
is written in the book.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.370
There's not a word about asking for help.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.320
It must be someone else.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.950
We've been here for so long.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.040
If there had been anyone strange,

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.770
we would have noticed long ago.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:48.940
What if that person

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.760
has been trying hard to hide themselves?

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.360
They don't know who to trust,

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.650
so they have to use this

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.180
subtle way to call for help.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:56.940
Exactly.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.000
I need to find out
who planted this flower field.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.670
Wait.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.620
Don't rush.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.250
You think it's an SOS signal.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.370
Maybe

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.030
the person who planted it
intended it to be

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.600
"Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl."

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.390
I know.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.180
But what if

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.970
there really is someone calling for help?

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.110
Just like I was back then.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.710
If I hadn't met you,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.620
I would be so scared struggling alone

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.750
in this other world.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.720
Use your imagination.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.080
If we really find that person,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.940
we can play poker.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.840
Do you think

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.910
this person is a man or a woman?

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.430
Would they like hot pot?

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.950
Would they become friends with us?

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.040
What's wrong?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.240
I asked around.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.310
They all said

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.200
in recent years,

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.500
no one has touched that flower field.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.990
See?

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.000
I told you.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.420
You were overthinking it.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.030
From a distance,

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.270
it really looked like

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.150
a miraculous SOS signal.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.430
Then here comes the problem.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.950
These flowers have just started blooming,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.660
and will bloom for a long time.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.830
What if Xie Yong'er passes by one day,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.830
and just like you,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.480
sees the
"Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl"

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.590
as an SOS signal?

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.790
Guess

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.310
what she would think.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.610
She'd also suspect
there's one of her kind nearby.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.550
She might have a sudden epiphany

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.330
and suspect us.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.460
Then...

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.540
Then we can't keep this field.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.020
Can we find an excuse to remove it?

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.680
Please.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.910
Do I need an excuse

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.670
for renovating a garden?

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.160
What?

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.170
Just call it my wild imagination.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.770
I'm still thinking,

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.830
what if there really was someone
like us who went through

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.920
so much trouble planting all those flowers
to ask for help,

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.520
only to get no response at all

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.170
and even have the flowers pulled out.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.550
Should we bury something there instead?

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.070
Like...

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.440
a note or something?

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.090
There's a risk Xie Yong'er might find it.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.800
True.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.240
Anyway, the person who planted them

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.120
doesn't need them anymore.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:54.930
What?

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.200
I said,

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.150
you look so pretty today.

There's nothing wrong
with the method itself.

What worries me

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.240
is whether it can actually be carried out.

What do you mean?

Look,

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.950
back when I was an editor,

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.450
for a project to launch smoothly,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.770
it had to satisfy several groups' needs.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.440
The producers want to save money,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.510
the screenwriters want credit,

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.920
the directors want artistic freedom,

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.720

Only when everyone's needs are met

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.800
could the project move forward.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.900

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.150
Unless what?

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.610
We raise taxes!

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:03.960
Raise taxes?

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.590
Raise taxes?

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.420
How can we do that?

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.090
Indeed.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.170
The Ministry of Revenue
proposes raising taxes again this year.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.550
What do you all think?

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.050
Well...

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.470
Since none of you has reached a decision,

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.390
stay here

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:33.210
and discuss it until you reach
a conclusion before the court ends.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.370
Your Majesty.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.150
I heard

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:40.420
that His Majesty
plans to build a mausoleum

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.360
at Mount Bei for you as a birthday gift.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.960
I'm both happy and helpless.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.650
How so?

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.890
I'm happy

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.550
because His Majesty and Your Majesty
share such a deep mother-son bond.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.080
It makes everyone envious.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.960
And the helpless part?

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.770
I am helpless because...

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.790
the gift from His Majesty is so grand

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.000
that anything we give

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.620
will seem insignificant.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.980
Flatterer.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:22.280
Building a mausoleum
wastes money and manpower.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:26.830
Those who know
see it's the emperor's filial devotion

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.160
acting on his own.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.770
Those who don't

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.220
might think I

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.150
do not care about the people.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.070
The Ministry of Revenue is short on money.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.250
Let's put

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.970
this matter aside for now.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.170
Your words are mistaken, Your Majesty.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.020
In every dynasty,

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.800
the Empress Dowager's mausoleum
isn't just a tomb—

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.620
it represents the royal prestige

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.220
and is the highest honor
for women of the harem.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.480
Our Great Xia thrives

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.780
and the people prosper

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.890
thanks to Your Majesty's
careful management.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.790
Do you

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.080
want to be outshone
by the previous Empress Dowager?

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.250
You certainly are bold.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.830
I only said

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.880
what others want to say but dare not.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.350
The construction of the mausoleum

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.880
is known by the whole court.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.950
Stopping it now

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.110
would be truly disgraceful.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.150
Your Majesty,

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.390
we absolutely can't do this.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.910
Really?

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.750
Yes.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.160
Yes, indeed.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:32.910
Right.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.040
Then tell me,

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.830
how should this mausoleum be built?

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.270
I...

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:48.580
Make way!

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.690
Irrelevant persons, stand back!

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.450
Your Majesty!

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.000
What are you doing?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.800
Your Majesty!

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.090
Your Majesty! I demand to see you!

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.480
Your Majesty!

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.210
How dare you!

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.590
Startling His Majesty
is a capital offense!

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.670
I'm dying anyway!

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.050
Your Majesty!

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.739
Please show mercy!

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.960
Otherwise, I will die

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.280
with my grievances unresolved!

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.590
-Drag him away now!
-Your Majesty!

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:21.510
-Your Majesty!
-Hurry!

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.190
Your Majesty!

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.800
Your Majesty!

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.429
Stop!

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:24.719
Wait.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.280
Let him go.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.560
Let him go!

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.480
I am here. If you have any grievance,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.139
tell me everything in detail.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.679
Your Majesty,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.900
please show mercy

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.909
and leave us a way to live.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.820
How is there no way to live?

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.239
Your Majesty,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.250
you live in luxury within the palace.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.230
Do you know what kind of life
the common people are living?

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.800
A single vegetable like this

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.130
sells only for one coin,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.360
but taxes take up more than half of it.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.750
After deducting costs,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920
the actual profit

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.030
is less than a tenth.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.970
All my fellow villagers

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.280
toil from

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.440
dawn to dusk.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.560
Yet after all that labor,

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:22.010
the grain left at year's end

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.370
is only enough to stave off hunger.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.150
My...

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.250
My younger brother and sister

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.590
were born into a year of poor harvest

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.480
and starved to death.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.650
They didn't even get the chance

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.280
to see this world.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.650
These lines...

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.730
My younger brother and sister

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.470
were born into

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.800
a year of poor harvest
and starved to death.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.280
Your Majesty,

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.360
my family
is already struggling to survive.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.850
Now that taxes are rising again,

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.750
I fear even my elderly parents

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.990
won't be able to survive.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.070
This is driving the common people

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.000
to a dead end!

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:21.510
What are you doing?

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.760
The mood is just right.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.890
Why did you stand up?

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.820
They are driving us to our deaths!

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.540
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:30.190
No more tax increases!

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.760
Your Majesty, no more tax increases!

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.420
How can this be?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.960
Bring the Minister of Revenue to me
at once!

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.500
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.470
Your Majesty, Chen Danian,
the Minister of Revenue, is here.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.390
Your Majesty!

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.000
I am innocent!

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.010
Why is the Ministry of Revenue
raising taxes again?

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.300
Well...

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.230
Didn't Your Majesty want to build

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.230
the Empress Dowager's...

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.720
Yes.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:13.800
It was me.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.690
I thought that

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.100
building the Empress Dowager's mausoleum
must not be done carelessly,

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:19.740
but...

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.690
but there weren't enough funds.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.560
So...

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.470
No money?

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.190
And with no money, you think you can
take our lives as payment?

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.050
Let go!

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.470
In that case,

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:30.920
our family has no choice

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:32.960
but to cut off our heads

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.570
and offer a bowl of hot blood

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.680
to Your Majesty!

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.650
"The ruler relies on the state,

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.000
and the state relies on the people."

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.400
Such a simple truth,

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.440
and yet you, the Minister of Revenue,

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.000
don't understand it?

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.520
I want to ask you,

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.810
why are the funds for the mausoleum

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.230
not taken from the state treasury?

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.830
Well...

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.580
I was wrong.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.820
I was wrong!

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.260
Take me to the state treasury!

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.250
Your Majesty, you cannot go there!

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:19.430
Today, I must...

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.330
I must give an explanation
to the people of Great Xia!

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:27.740
Your Majesty is wise!

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.190
Your Majesty is wise!
Your Majesty is wise!

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:37.590
Your Majesty is wise!
Your Majesty is wise!

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.320
What is it?

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.990
Why the panic?

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.930
The Emperor publicly berated
the Minister of Revenue

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.360
over the tax increase.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:03.960
Now he's escorting him

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.560
to the Ministry's treasury.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.280
He has an ulterior motive.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.030
I knew

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.530
building the mausoleum wasn't that simple.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.110
It seems our Emperor

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:24.190
is going after the Empress Dowager.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.210
Since they're putting each other
over the fire,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.730
I might as well

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.600
add fuel to the flames.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.250
Zhang San's Diary.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.120
Are there other transmigrators like me?

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.620
Wait.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.510
"Yuanfang,

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.200
what do you think?"

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.110
My name is not Yuanfang.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.700
"I simply cannot do it!"

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:08.530
I...

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.880
I am just a servant!

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.040
"Imperial Jade Wine.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.430
180 for a cup."

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.010
Spare me, Your Highness!

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:19.650
You may go.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:20.970
Yes.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.890
Where is the female lead

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.650
who transmigrated into this book?

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.830
I have to find a way

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.400
to leave a noticeable mark.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:44.790
One that only my kind would notice.
