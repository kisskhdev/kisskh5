[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.130
[Episode 19]

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.780
I'm not going.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.000
My dad will beat the hell out of me.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400
If he hits you, I'll stop—

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.430
Everyone, get out of the car!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.250
There are antelopes over here.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.790
There are antelopes over here.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.740
What are you doing?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.470
Hurry up.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.500
Coming.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.390
The antelope is too heavy.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.720
Do my dad and the others

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.600
usually enter the mountains

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.530
just to fight

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.620
with those people?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.860
Not just them.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.470
There are also placer gold diggers

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.190
and brine shrimp catchers.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.530
We've even run into wild yaks,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.980
wolves,

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.120
bears,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.540
and snow leopards.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.160
Animals

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.440
act on instinct.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.320
Humans are harder to predict.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.130
Outside the Uninhabited Zone,

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.540
we deal with people.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.890
After entering this zone,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.600
we deal with humanity.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.540
Who said that?

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.200
Captain Duojie.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.980
Let's go back.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.840
Let's go back.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.740
This river

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.800
is not far from here.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.010
We'll go check it out,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.330
then we'll head back.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.740
Okay.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.680
Wait for me here.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.390
Have a cigarette, brother.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.390
Have a cigarette.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.540
Brother, have a cigarette.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.300
Have a cigarette, brother.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.630
Brother,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.560
have a cigarette.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.630
I don't smoke.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.890
Brother.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.100
Is this the Wulan River?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.100
Where are you from?

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:24.450
I used to work

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.190
at Zhuoyuan Lake

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.180
with San.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.700
This isn't

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.800
San's territory.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.190
I quit recently.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.490
I worked my ass off day and night,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.530
but the boss took all the money.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.040
I only hid a few grains of placer gold,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.570
and he wanted to kick me out.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.010
So, fine, I'll leave.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.450
It's pointless anyway.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040
Did he let you go?

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.980
He can beat me one-on-one,

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.159
but he can't beat all of us together.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.900
My little brother

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.890
came out with me.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.130
We got separated when we escaped.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.860
So I have to look around for him.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.810
How does the kid look?

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.300
He's about my height.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.910
Tan skin.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.110
Looks very honest.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.710
Brother, have you seen him?

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.010
No.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.860
Out here,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.570
I've never seen an honest man.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.810
What are you looking at?

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.340
What's wrong with looking?

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.600
Come look.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.830
There's food here.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.950
Come here.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.130
There's food and drink.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:23.830
Hurry.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.540
What are you doing?

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.740
You can't take that.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.270
Don't move.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.890
What are you doing?

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.330
Brother.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:28.770
What are you doing?

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.300
Brother.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.340
Hey, guys!

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:30.920
What's wrong?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.870
You're not being fair, kid.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.470
What is it?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.220
There's food on the truck

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.200
and you didn't share with us.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.059
Yeah, exactly.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.010
We still have to go find someone.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.909
We really can't share.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:38.400
That won't do.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.730
You have to give us some.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:40.549
Brother.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.330
What are you doing?

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.409
Who are you pushing, kid?

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.909
Brother.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:43.620
Who are you pushing?

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.150
Get lost.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.860
Don't move.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.150
Go!

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.340
Hurry, leave!

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.740
Don’t move.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.680
What are you doing?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.860
Tashi.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.540
Don't move.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.690
Take it back.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.410
Tashi.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.580
Tashi.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.430
The blood isn't dry yet.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.890
Shots were fired.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.220
There are bullet holes.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.370
It just happened.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.900
Not more than half a day ago.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.980
This is Tashi's knife.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.170
Get in.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.480
Chase them.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.040
Let's go.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.250
Stop right there.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.220
Stop right there.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.500
Don't move.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.750
Don't beat me.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.550
Don't beat me.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.000
Still trying to run away?

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.170
Get up.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.630
Get up.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.240
Behave.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:27.550
Move.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:27.840
Behave.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.100
I...

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.740
I won't move. I won't move.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.470
I won't move.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.300
Hurry. Get up there.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.340
Get up there.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.840
You all better behave.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.620
Lie down.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.790
Behave yourselves.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.910
Don’t move.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:44.910
The Mountain Patrol is here!

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.630
The Mountain Patrol is here!

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.980
The Mountain Patrol is here!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.720
Dad is here.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.840
Dad is here.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.910
Don't shoot at the truck.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.410
Get in.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.620
Get in, quick.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.940
Mountain Patrol!

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.400
Help us, Mountain Patrol!

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.360
We're over here!

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.150
Dad!

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.170
Dad!

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.290
Don't move.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:43.910
The lung's punctured.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.250
Who sent you?

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.930
H-help me.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.340
Help me.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.060
Why are you catching people?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.510
Wake up!

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:54.620
Stay with me!

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.800
Wait, wait.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.480
Easy.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:05.650
Dad!

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.000
Bastard!

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.650
Your mother is so worried!

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.500
Dad...

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:19.880
Dad...

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.220
Ju.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.400
Did I teach you driving for this?

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.840
Causing trouble!

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.410
I won't do it again, Ju.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.230
You liar!

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.220
How dare you lie!

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.150
Causing a mess!

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.080
Alright, alright.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.940
That's enough.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.500
Touch the car again,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.510
and I'll break your arms.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.310
Do you hear me?

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.770
He's miserable enough.
Why did you hit him?

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.550
I have to beat him up

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.460
so he can stay.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.170
Makes sense.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.420
Why did they catch you all?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.570
I don't know.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.790
We went to the river

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.530
to ask them

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.600
about my brother.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.590
Suddenly, two cars came.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.240
Without a word,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.370
they started beating and grabbing us.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.550
They dragged us onto the truck.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.600
Do you have a grudge

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.860
against those people?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.000
We don't know them.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.390
What about you?

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.480
We...

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.080
We don't know them.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.570
Don't know them.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.500
I don't either.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.840
I... I might have seen them before.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.260
When they took me and my brother,

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.000
it was exactly like this.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.370
Was it the same group?

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:19.750
Not sure.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.500
But it seems like it.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.370
It was also a Jeep

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.330
and a truck.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:27.700
The accent was similar too.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.700
Captain.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.830
There are pelts in the car.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.670
Look.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.370
These are all pelts.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.690
Same question.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.840
Why would poachers catch so many people?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.120
It doesn't make sense.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.150
Anything else?

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.530
There's a lot more here.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.250
And this.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.750
Never seen this before.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.730
Ammonium nitrate.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.770
It's fertilizer.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.700
What do they need fertilizer for?

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.390
Yeah.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.870
Bolamula has nothing but meadows,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.360
swamps, and permafrost.

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:23.370
You can't grow crops here.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.310
Explosives.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.200
Explosives.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.360
If you plane this much wood into sawdust,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.430
mix it with fertilizer,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.270
and add diesel,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.140
you can make

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.700
very powerful explosives.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.310
Why are they making explosives?

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.390
To blow up our warehouse, obviously.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.030
Could it be

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.710
they're going to mine for gold?

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.290
That makes sense.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.220
Gold mines need

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.250
a lot of laboru.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.500
Recruiting outsiders is too risky.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:15.910
These fossickers

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.040
came in on their own.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.040
They're experienced and hardworking.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.170
Even if they go missing,

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.670
no one will investigate.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.540
This is going to be trouble.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.630
If inside the Uninhabited Zone,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.630
there really is a large-scale gold mine,

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.960
we must report to the county immediately.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.480
We're just guessing right now.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.140
We don't have solid evidence.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.170
Those people don't know anything.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.500
They can't even be considered witnesses.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:40.890
We still have gas.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.360
Should we keep chasing?

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.990
Li,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.340
would you like a lunch box?

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:58.960
No thanks.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.849
Zhang,

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.780
have a lunch box.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:12.770
Dr. Wei,

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:13.660
try my new dish.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.400
It's Sichuan style.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.000
No thanks.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.030
Party Secretary.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.700
Director Zhang.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.369
What's up?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.830
Have you eaten?

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.650
I just finished a surgery.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.850
I was just about to go.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.240
Come on, let's go.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.570
Let's go to the cafeteria together.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.590
Wait a moment.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.670
There's something

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.390
I want to discuss with you.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.160
Please, sit.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.760
It's like this.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.980
You know, a while back,

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.290
that fund for the shower room renovation,

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:55.800
didn't we

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.260
use it for something else?

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.630
Some comrades

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.860
have issues with it

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.120
and have been upset.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.720
Someone even

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.190
reported this

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.150
to the Municipal Health Bureau.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:07.830
They say you

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.140
abused your position

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.570
for personal gain

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.880
and profited from it.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.940
Also, they say you

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.050
arranged for your family members

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.100
to run businesses

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.070
in the hospital

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.000
Bai Ji.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.900
Bai Ji.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.760
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.600
I made this especially for you.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.180
Here.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.830
For today,

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.490
can you stop selling food

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:53.230
here?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.310
Why?

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.240
I know.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.370
This is purely

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.240
false accusations to settle scores.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.960
Bai Ji has
the necessary licenses and permits.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.890
To reduce the pressure on logistics,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.520
our hospital

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.030
allows limited food-service operations.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.830
It is compliant and reasonable.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.980
However,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.030
Bai Ji has a record.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.660
Some people

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.450
just won't let it go.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.740
If this fuss continues,

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.360
for you

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.420
and the hospital,

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.610
it won't look good.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.480
So,

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.500
Director Zhang.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.440
Can you

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.500
ask Bai Ji

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.990
to stop selling lunch boxes
in the hospital?

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.180
No.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.220
Bai Ji did make a mistake.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.640
But he has already

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.100
accepted his punishment.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:51.480
This time,

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.210
he hasn't done anything wrong.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.160
There are few restaurants

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.370
in our county town to begin with.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.380
It has always been a problem

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.930
for the hospital staff and patients

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.350
to get meals.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.550
Bai Ji selling lunch boxes here

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.620
solves a problem for everyone,

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.830
and he is very popular.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.370
The food he makes is

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.110
affordable

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.160
and clean.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.460
He puts his heart into it.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.200
As

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.180
a mother,

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.610
I'm very proud.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.640
My child

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440
did nothing wrong

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.630
this time.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.630
So I do not agree.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.430
Don't go in.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.220
This has nothing to do with my mom.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.020
Tell me,

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.890
who went to the Bureau to make a scene?

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:52.960
Bai Ji, you go out first.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.290
Party Secretary, tell me,

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.840
-who is it?
-Bai Ji, get out!

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.390
It's not your place to speak here.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.090
Get out!

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.600
Let's go.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.500
Shouting like this

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.910
solves nothing.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.200
You're just causing trouble for ma'am.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.050
You have to trust her.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.910
She can definitely resolve this.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.810
Stop making a scene.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.050
Party Secretary.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.460
All these years,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.360
the one I've neglected the most

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.830
is my youngest son.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.790
I don't blame anyone for making a fuss.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.300
As the Director,

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.030
I haven't done my job well.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.050
But this time,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.330
I can't force Bai Ji to leave.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.390
If there is any negative impact,

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.990
just punish me.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.680
You're back.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.130
How was business today?

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.200
It was okay.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.220
There's so much left over.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.280
That's not how you do it.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.480
You have to soak these in hot water,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.940
or the grease won't come off.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.350
Here,

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:51.870
let me do it.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.140
Take a break.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.320
Brother,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.500
have you eaten?

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.430
Not yet.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:57.960
Great.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.010
Help me finish one.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:02.630
Here.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.700
If this food sits overnight,

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.730
it'll go to waste.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:20.000
How is it?

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.260
Your boiled pork slices

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.650
are pretty good.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.640
You've been practicing secretly.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.290
Just a little bit.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:30.860
Brother,

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.510
do you think there's anything

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.910
that needs improvement?

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.080
I think the flavor

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.970
is a bit bland.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:39.580
But

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.770
considering it's for patients,

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.570
too much seasoning wouldn't be good.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.570
I think it's just right. It's tasty.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.000
Okay.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.750
If you say it's good,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.230
then

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.700
I...

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.940
I have no regrets.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.880
Since the food is so good,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.840
why didn't any of it sell?

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.550
It doesn't matter.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.980
Whether it sells

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.900
or how much money I make,

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.740
I don't actually care.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.680
I just dream of

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.490
making these lunch boxes amazing.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.020
I picked every single vegetable leaf

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.240
with care.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.340
I learned how to pair dishes

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.950
and how to plate them.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.770
I even learned dietary therapy from Yan.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.950
Which dishes suit which illness,

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.810
and how much oil and salt to use

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.930
for these patient meals.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.440
I chased after her

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.780
every day asking about it.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.960
Brother.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.460
You and the sisters

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.610
are all so successful.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.930
But what about me?

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.940
I-I feel like

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.340
I was just starting to make something
of myself.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.200
I could finally hold my head up

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.420
in front of Yan.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.240
Not causing trouble for the family

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.400
or Mom.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.640
But

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.350
why did...

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.970
What is wrong with you?

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.130
Isn't Mom happy too?

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.550
What happened?

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.460
Isn't everything fine?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.280
It's nothing.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.810
It doesn't matter.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.150
It doesn't matter.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.530
As long as you

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.850
enjoy the food

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.270
and Mom is happy,

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.670
that's enough.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.140
I've made up my mind.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.770
I won't go to the hospital

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.370
to sell lunch boxes anymore.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.480
Why not?

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:14.390
Mom.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.180
Mom.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.310
I'm sorry.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.290
I... I caused trouble for you again.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.660
I've decided.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.760
I won't go back

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.310
to the hospital.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.890
What about your future?

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.090
What will you do then?

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.520
Remember this.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.400
In the future,
whenever you make a decision,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.260
you must really think it through.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.710
Don't always be so impulsive.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.500
Bai Ji.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.050
Come here.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:06.910
Wipe your tears.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.220
Wipe your tears.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.420
Sit down.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.200
Your share,

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.770
I'll give it to you in advance.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.720
Mom.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.350
Are you...

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.830
kicking me out?

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.070
What are you thinking?

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.700
Then...

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.180
why are you giving me this?

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.250
Over the years,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.510
I've saved 6,000 yuan.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:56.130
Each of you siblings

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.110
get a share.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.760
When your eldest sister went to Guangzhou,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.270
I gave her 1,500.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.640
Now,

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.270
I'm giving you 1,500 too.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.770
I don't know now,

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.040
how much the rent for a shop is.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:13.950
You might have to

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.210
chip in a bit yourself.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.750
Go open a shop.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.350
Open a shop?

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:24.810
Your cooking is so delicious.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.220
I support you.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.400
My son has a skill now.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.740
Remember what your grandpa said?

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.200
A man with a skill

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.130
will never go hungry.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.140
No.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.640
I can't take it, Mom.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.470
I'm too ashamed.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.480
Didn't I say?

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.900
One share each.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.740
This money

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.420
will be yours sooner or later.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:05.890
I...

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.990
I'm afraid I won't succeed.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.080
Bai Ji.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.280
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.730
Growing up,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.970
how much trouble did you cause?

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.450
How many times did you stumble?

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.010
But every time

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.270
you were knocked down,

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.860
you stood back up.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.090
I believe in you.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.250
Mom.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.870
I clearly love you.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.540
And you thought I was kicking you out.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.100
It seems all these years,

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.930
I haven't done a good job.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.260
No, no, no.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.950
Don't blame me.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.070
I don't. I don't.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.200
You're a grown man now,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.920
are still hiding in my arms

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.720
crying?

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:18.940
Aren't you ashamed?

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:22.620
No, I'm not.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.140
Here.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.800
My veteran's allowance.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.860
To give you a boost.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.000
I...

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.850
How can I take this, Brother?

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.030
I now have food

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:36.940
and shelter at home.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.800
I don't need it.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.770
No way.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.980
You'll need it later.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.140
You have to get married.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.460
There are many things
you have to spend on.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:42.770
I...

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.070
Come on. Just take it.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.980
Your cooking is so good.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.780
Open a restaurant and work hard.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:48.870
I'm waiting for you

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.270
to build Mom a nice house.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.460
I'll look forward to it.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.500
I'll definitely work hard.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.870
[Mazhi County Public Security Bureau]

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.090
Thanks.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:36.770
Does the Mountain Patrol

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:37.900
not go into the mountains anymore

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.760
and are investigating cases now?

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.680
Checking the poachers' backgrounds

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.980
helps us work better.

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:47.480
Are you eating here

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.410
for lunch today?

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.750
Yeah.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.350
I need to borrow some meal tickets
from you.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.140
Then you should pay up.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.820
Okay.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:05.590
We stock dozens of tons

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.350
of this fertilizer every year.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.240
Look,

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.110
we stocked forty tons this year.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.710
Here.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.210
Can you tell me

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:15.240
who bought it?

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.230
Just the bulk buyers.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.820
That's impossible to say.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:21.010
Farmers and herdsmen from nearby townships

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.030
all buy from us.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.340
Some buy three or five bags.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:25.930
Some buy a dozen bags

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.410
to share among a few people.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.810
So what counts as bulk?

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:30.830
Besides,

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.460
buying fertilizer
doesn't require registration.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:34.720
How can I check for you?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.010
I can only tell you

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.570
who bought some in the last few days.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.470
Before that,

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.010
I really can't remember.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.740
Why don't

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.650
you go ask

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:47.090
the other counties?

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.570
We asked.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.640
They said pretty much the same thing.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.180
Then I can't help you.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:53.980
Alright. Sorry to bother you.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.640
No worries.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.220
Shao Yunfei sent this.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.700
-How thoughtful of Reporter Shao.
-Ju.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.030
Let me get you some rice.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.670
Let's see

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.020
what's inside.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.480
Is there any alcohol?

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.270
I don't know.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.680
Look for yourself.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:19.990
He.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.420
Take some of it

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.050
together with the recent supplies,

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:24.070
and send them to the brothers

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.790
at the station tomorrow.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:25.140
Okay.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.700
Keep the ham sausages.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.110
Keep the ham sausages.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.130
There's no alcohol.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.060
But there are liqueur chocolates.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.290
Does this count as alcohol?

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:36.180
It does.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.390
Liquor chocolates.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:40.820
Captain.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:42.560
Is chocolate candy.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.010
not liquor chocolate?

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.380
Why is there no alcohol in it?

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.010
I drank it.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.160
What are you laughing at?

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.560
Just to make you jealous.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.550
It's not good.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.480
It really isn't.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.530
How's the file check going?

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.670
That truck has fake plates.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.830
The VIN code was filed off,

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.600
so we couldn't find the owner.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.940
As for the illegal gold mining files,

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.670
we haven't found any leads yet.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.440
How about on your end?

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.920
No progress

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.480
at the Supply and Marketing Cooperative
either.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.080
We went to several counties.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.030
Buying fertilizer

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.830
doesn't require registration.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.900
Just as I thought.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:37.920
Based on our theory,

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.889
if inside the Uninhabited Zone,

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:40.380
there really is

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.900
blasting and mining,

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.650
the mine could operate

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.000
in two ways.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.940
One is to transport the ore out

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.900
for processing.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:49.719
Two is to smelt the ore

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.420
in the zone

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.469
and transport the gold out.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.110
Transporting ore out

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.470
would be too conspicuous.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.010
That's not realistic.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.930
Unless they have heavy trucks.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.710
That's a line of investigation.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.420
If it's the second possibility,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.300
and they're smelting

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.500
and refining inside,

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:13.440
they'd need

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.030
a lot of equipment and materials.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.830
That would also require trucks.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.660
Take a look at this book.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.470
[Chemistry Handling Technology]

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.340
It might help.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.380
Besides gold mining,

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.690
I also pulled the files

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:27.540
on poaching.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.270
Since they were hiding

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.150
sheepskins in the truck,

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.110
it means this group

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.040
is definitely linked to poaching.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.850
I'm going to go through them all again.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.150
You're getting moldy

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.570
staying at the station, aren't you?

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:47.540
Come with me starting tomorrow.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.450
Be my driver.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:50.830
I still need my hand.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.540
Just go.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.500
You must be bored stiff.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.450
Okay.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.470
We can't drop the fertilizer lead either.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.030
He,

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.070
you and Sangba keep investigating it.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:06.510
Okay.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.690
Han,

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:08.690
tomorrow

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.030
we're going to the freight company.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.490
Okay.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.400
Hello?

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.800
He's here.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.500
Captain, it's for you.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:21.690
Hello?

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.630
I have something to do tomorrow,
so I can't make it.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:33.430
Okay.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:34.980
Got it.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.360
I'm going to the county for a meeting
tomorrow.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.050
What a surprise.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.050
How long has it been

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.650
since you were called for a meeting?

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:46.380
I thought the county government

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.000
had forgotten about you,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.200
Deputy County Mayor.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.920
The municipal research group is coming.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.790
The municipal research group
will arrive tomorrow.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.720
It's a high-level visit this time.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.520
Executive Vice Mayor,

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.380
Zhao Zhijin, is leading the team.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.950
Leaders from Planning, Economy, Finance,

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:10.470
and Tax are all attending.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.440
You're back.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:13.690
Sit.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.150
I called you two to discuss about

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.810
how I should

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.020
report to the research group tomorrow.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.670
I'm not worried
about the Uninhabited Zone.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.340
Although there are many difficulties,

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.500
at least the protection
and development work

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.030
hasn't stopped advancing.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:27.860
What worries me most

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:29.170
is still the issue

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.770
of the animal husbandry tax.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.070
I just took a call.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.410
It was from Chief Song of the Tax Bureau.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.080
What does he want?

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.620
Did he say not to mention

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.140
reducing or exempting
the animal husbandry tax?

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.600
He didn't say it directly.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.610
He just said the higher-ups

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.170
know about our current difficulties.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.570
He hopes we pay attention
to how we report it.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.260
Report the problems realistically,

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:50.860
instead of

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.750
unilaterally pleading poverty.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.990
This guy.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.460
Don't get triggered.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.670
Let's discuss how to report it.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:03.650
The theme of this research visit

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.710
is economic development and reform.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.490
The animal husbandry tax issue

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:08.650
cannot be bypassed.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.570
We've been wrangling with the Tax Bureau

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.880
for over six months.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.820
This is a good opportunity

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.670
to let them

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.480
come here and see

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.280
our actual situation.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.300
I know.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.980
The animal husbandry tax
should be mentioned,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.240
and must be mentioned.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:23.820
But should we bring it up at the meeting

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.130
or report it separately?

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.340
What's your opinion?

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.130
Secretary Chen.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.330
Let me say something.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.440
Go ahead.

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.190
The Provincial Organization Department

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.320
just spoke with you.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.840
We can't discuss

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.200
the specific details.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.650
But the implication

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:39.800
is very clear.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.940
At this critical juncture
of selection and assessment,

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.800
it's better for you to speak less.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.440
There's nothing to hide.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:50.130
It was just a normal inquiry.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.360
I just told the truth.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.090
It's just that

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.720
I turned a proper interview

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.050
into

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.430
a grievance session.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.380
After the meeting,

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.830
when I saw the comrade
from the Organization Department off,

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.090
he only said one thing.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.590
It is hard for anyone

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.220
to stay in a place like this.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.540
That shows the organization

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.800
values you.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.880
We are counting on you to get promoted

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.660
so you can come back and help our county.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.440
Let me bring it up.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.440
I am older than you,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.140
and my education isn't great.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.550
I have no hope

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.610
of getting promoted anyway.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:29.910
It is better if I do it.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.630
You have spent the last two years

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.170
running around the mountains.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.850
If you do it,

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.460
can you even explain it clearly?

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.070
I have spent more time

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.480
in the pastoral areas than you.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.170
During the snowstorm,

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.510
I visited every township.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.610
Do you think I don't know what's going on?

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:41.550
So what if you were there?

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.000
Even so,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.240
you don't know as much as I do.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.550
Stop fighting.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.780
I am the Party Secretary.
I will do the talking.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.250
You two are the key leaders.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.170
If you speak up,

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.540
there won't be any room left
for negotiation

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.660
between the county leadership team
and the higher-ups.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.560
Let me do it.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.860
Everyone

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.520
has difficulties.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.630
The provincial

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.560
and city budgets

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.920
are both very tight.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.970
However,

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.200
regarding the misappropriation of funds,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:12.860
your county

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.230
[Zhao Zhicjin]

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.090
has two cases.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:17.790
According to the Health Bureau,

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.210
the 50,000 yuan allocated
to the County Hospital

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.670
for bathroom renovations

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.040
was misappropriated.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:24.920
Also,

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.670
our investigation shows that

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.940
the 100,000 yuan allocated

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.860
by the Provincial Department of Forestry

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.110
to the Conservation Station

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.230
for improving living conditions

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.760
was also misappropriated?

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.660
What was so urgent
that you had to do this?

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.600
Can anyone explain these two cases

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.600
of misappropriation to me?

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:45.580
Vice Mayor Zhao,

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.470
regarding the use of these funds...

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:48.400
Secretary Chen,

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.810
let me explain this.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.890
Vice Mayor Zhao,

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.820
our county is currently implementing

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.440
a hygiene care program

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.040
for women in pastoral areas.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.340
The 50,000 yuan from the County Hospital

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.340
was used entirely to purchase

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.040
toilet paper and sanitary belts.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.810
They were distributed for free

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.510
across twenty pastoral villages
in the county.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.400
We also conducted

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.130
menstrual hygiene education.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.590
As for the 100,000 yuan

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.190
from the Department of Forestry,

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.700
it was because

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.160
just as the funds arrived,

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.860
the Manri River within our borders

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.920
suddenly dried up.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.170
It severely affected the water supply

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.210
for daily life and livestock

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:21.470
for over a thousand herdsmen households
in two townships.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.410
When County Mayor Lin spoke to me

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:24.470
about this matter,

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.870
I was also very conflicted.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.850
But the situation was urgent.

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.460
We didn't have time

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.520
to apply for more funding from above.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.070
The county had to handle it this way.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.420
If you have a chance

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.100
to visit those two townships,

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.530
you should still see

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.110
the crews drilling wells.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.030
The herdsmen are very grateful

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.630
to the government this time.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.990
The aid money arrived just in time.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:51.710
This matter

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.760
has had a positive effect

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.070
on the image of our Party

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.300
and the government.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.130
Since you brought up the issue

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.660
of misappropriated funds,

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.500
let's lay everything on the table.

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:08.920
Let's talk about things

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.520
we haven't reported before.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.180
The county once diverted

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.890
road repair funds

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.500
to the Mountain Patrol
for mineral exploration.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.520
We even used Mountain Patrol wages

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.630
to help herdsmen build heated sheds.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.560
Never mind

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:27.530
the funding.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.400
Even when it comes to

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.630
cow dung for heating,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.420
our cadres often share theirs

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.820
with the hospital

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.050
and the school.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.250
For years,

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.420
we've been surviving like this.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.880
Robbing Peter to pay Paul,

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.750
and scraping things together.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.680
You criticized
the County Finance Department

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.940
for having irregular

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.070
funding practices.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.400
I accept that.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.730
But the root of the problem

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:56.210
isn't that

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.730
our cadres acted on a whim

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.170
or had selfish motives.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.140
It was out of necessity.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.230
I believe

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:04.620
our comrades in the county

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.420
are dedicated to the public good

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.000
and can withstand any investigation.
