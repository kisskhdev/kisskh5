WEBVTT

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.920
Who are we waiting for?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.920
Dr. Chang.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.239
He said today he'd introduce the elders to

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.599
a very important Master-level figure.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.840
That's really nice.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.800
What does he do?

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.960
I don't know either.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.879
Anyway, they say he can attract a million fans.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.800
Get famous, break out of the circle.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.819
A million fans, that's good.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.840
But we can't go stepping out of the circle.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.039
He doesn't mean that kind of circle.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.780
That's true.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.800
Here he comes.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:22.900
Come.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.620
Come, everyone take your seats.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.039
Come.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.800
Mr. Liu.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.039
Then I... I'll sit here.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.639
Thank you.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:31.560
Uncles and Aunties,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
esteemed elders,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.759
sorry to keep you waiting.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.439
Today, our retirement community

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.680
is very, very honored

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.000
to have invited the famous

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.560
Mr. Liu Liang.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:41.520
Alright.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.539
He...

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.719
Is he famous?

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.240
You don't know Liu Liang?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.039
Never heard of him.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.780
You've heard of him?

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.400
I haven't heard of him either.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.360
This Master Liu is

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:50.879
a Master among Masters.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.719
He has previously...

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.719
single-handedly...

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.120
launched several big internet stars.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.860
Not really.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.000
So today,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.319
we have invited Mr. Liu here

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.960
mainly to ask him to

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.240
introduce to us...

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.960
This... okay.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.199
I'll take it from here.

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.599
Okay.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.979
Thanks.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:05.340
Thank you.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.159
Thank you for the introduction.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.520
Sure.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.680
And thank you, everyone.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.259
I am Liu Liang.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.520
I came here this time

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.719
mainly to share with you Uncles and Aunties

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.919
a little bit about

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.139
my...

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.199
secrets to success.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:18.919
When it comes to success,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.800
does everyone...

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.439
thirst for it or not?

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.159
Not thirsty.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.659
I am already a successful person.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.659
Now I'm enjoying my old age.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.599
I've achieved success and retired.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.340
But you can't just lie flat.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.319
Right?

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.139
Look at that old guy abroad.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.560
He's nearly ninety.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.080
And he's still serving as president.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.479
That explains why it's a mess over there.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.560
Then look at that old lady abroad.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.180
She's over seventy.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.939
And she can still get pregnant and give birth.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.680
Is that what you're here to teach us?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.939
I'm not here to teach you...

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.680
...how to get pregnant and give birth.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.520
I'm here to teach you how to become influencers.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.120
Become influencers?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.960
Don't think it's impossible.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.960
Don't think it's ridiculous.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.419
There's a ninety-three-year-old grandma abroad.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.539
She livestreams eight hours a day.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.259
She has over three million followers.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.060
She's done over a hundred live commerce sessions.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.020
And earned over twenty million.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.180
Compared to them...

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.460
...don't you feel...

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.219
...a little ashamed?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.100
Not at all.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:17.819
I just haven't done it.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.540
If I did live commerce...

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.540
...I'd have at least twenty million followers.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:22.980
Then the one feeling ashamed...

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.000
...would be that foreign old lady.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:26.500
If you put it that way...

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.139
...the most popular one here...

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.379
...should be Mr. Liu.

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:30.019
Isn't that right?

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:31.199
His followers...

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:32.459
...two hundred million.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.459
Don't even compare with Sister Liu.

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:36.379
Let me tell you.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.259
You might not even beat me.

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:40.300
Just based on my time in the matchmaker circle...

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.860
...doing good deeds for decades...

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.420
...and the popularity I've gathered...

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.459
...getting a million followers would be child's play.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.740
So, Mr. Liu...

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.699
...let's cut the crap.

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.139
Just tell us directly how to do it.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.439
Right.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:53.620
Okay.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.139
I will now, based on...

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.860
...the personal situations of all Uncles and Aunties...

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.600
...teach you how to attract millions of fans...

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.779
...with the ten top secrets.

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.240
Hello, fam.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.360
Today I'm going to perform a piece of...

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.220
...Clapper Talk...

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.019
..."Raid on the White Tiger Regiment."

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.459
If you want a happy and perfect marriage...

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:17.139
...a professional matchmaker must handle it.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.240
Matchmaking for sixty years...

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.600
...never missed a shot...

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.139
...never made a mistake.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.939
Auntie Cai.

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:25.819
Hold on a second.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:28.139
This stuff definitely won't work.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.579
Last time, your rhythmic storytelling...

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:30.879
...only got eight likes.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.740
I know other things too!

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:34.560
"Wu Song Fights in the Inn," "Tongrentang."

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.060
Well...

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.040
Uncle Liang...

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.500
...none of those stand a chance.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.600
People these days...

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.319
...except for gossip...

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.519
...they don't like watching anything.

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.759
The first time I played matchmaker was...

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.839
How old were you?

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.079
Four or five years old.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.839
Huh?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.699
What do you mean "huh"?

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:49.660
That year...

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.220
And then the two of them got married.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.220
Isn't this my first time

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.720
playing matchmaker?

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.980
If you don't believe me,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.779
I have some of Bai Jingjing's

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.439
untold secrets.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.339
Spilling big celebrity tea.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.939
That's sure to be popular.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:08.600
Will this go viral?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.519
For sure.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.779
My daughter, Bai Jingjing,

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.339
loved eating white sugar as a kid.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.259
She'd eat plain sugar.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.620
She could eat a whole jar like this.

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:16.980
Like sugar pancakes,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.819
sugar buns,

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.019
sugar ears, honey twists, honey cakes...

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:21.300
One time...

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.819
Stop it.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.379
This won't work.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.819
Then...

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:27.939
Then...

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.060
What about her

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.680
slacking off on piano as a kid?

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.160
I spanked her plenty for that.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.800
Thank you

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:43.980
Thanks for the likes, fam

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.819
Just now, I performed "Spring Snow"

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:47.860
So, next up

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.899
I will continue by playing another piece for you

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.579
"High Mountains and Flowing Water"

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.300
Stop

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:53.019
Stop

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.259
Stop playing, Auntie

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:55.100
Let's not play anymore

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.720
What's wrong?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.019
It sounds so good

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.740
You're just...

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.620
It's either "Spring Snow" or "High Mountains and Flowing Water"

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.819
You've been banging away for ages

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:03.579
And only two old geezers are clapping here

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:04.660
This won't do

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.300
Who are you calling an old geezer?

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.699
No...

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:07.579
Call me Uncle

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:08.699
Uncle

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:09.939
Sit down, Uncle

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.639
That won't work either

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.040
It's not exciting enough

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.319
Then what counts as exciting?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.759
For example

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.920
First love

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:20.120
Yes, that works

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.980
How old were you?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.120
With whom?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.720
Right

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.199
Your daughter is pretty, she must have dated early, right?

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:25.839
Of course

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.360
She takes after me in that regard

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.160
Can we talk about this?

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.699
I think so

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.439
A star using her tragic puppy love experience

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.879
to educate young people

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:39.079
How do you know it was tragic?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.600
Our Yingzi has experience in this area

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.860
I usually

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.660
am the one causing tragedy for others

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.519
My daughter is the same!

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.720
A boy chased her when she was fifteen

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.399
He almost committed suicide for her

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.120
If not for my timely education

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.079
that boy

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:55.579
would have been long gone

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.439
So how did you educate her?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.240
I got serious with her right away

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.759
I said, having a boy chase you is a good thing

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.240
You can't just reject him outright

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.639
You have to string him along

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:07.079
No...

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:08.699
Don't let it cost a life

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.199
That's how you educated her?

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:12.139
Yeah

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.060
Later my daughter got smart

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:15.980
As long as a man chases her

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:17.779
she just dates them for a bit first

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.939
Can she still study properly like that?

00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:22.579
She wasn't studying that well anyway

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:23.699
Didn't she later

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.120
go into singing?

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:27.699
I get it

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.620
I didn't become a singing star

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:31.680
mainly because I studied too well

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.460
Let me put it this way

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.620
Bai Jingjing

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.740
the reason she has today's success

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.179
and my indulgence of her since childhood

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:42.700
my tolerance and leniency towards her

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.899
are inseparable

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.659
The reason you guys didn't become singing stars

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:49.100
is not because you studied too well

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:51.460
but because you lacked a

00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:53.820
father like me

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.879
Hello?

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:03.299
Who is this?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.940
Where did you get this number?

00:09:07.899 --> 00:09:08.659
I don't know.

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:10.419
I don't know anything.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:11.740
I don't have a dad.

00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:15.940
Are you stupid?

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:17.980
Why do you make me take every call?

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:19.740
There was no caller ID.

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:22.299
They said they're a reporter from City Star News.

00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:23.779
No matter who it is.

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:25.580
Cuss them all out for me.

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.700
These paparazzi are so annoying.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.620
You have to blame your dad for this.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.980
Why is he ruining you like this?

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.320
How many times have I told you?

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.299
I don't have a dad.

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:36.980
Will you stop it?

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.340
Shameless and pestering me to death.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.019
Auntie.

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:41.779
No.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.299
I... that was a paparazzi just now.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:44.419
It wasn't directed at you.

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.279
Okay, I'll give it to Sister Jingjing right away.

00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:57.620
Mom, what is it?

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.379
I...

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:06.139
How am I not on your side?

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.460
I'm definitely on your side.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.220
I really didn't go see him.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.700
I haven't seen him even once.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.100
As for why he says that...

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.259
You go ask him!

00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:22.100
Why are you venting your anger on me?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.000
If you keep saying that,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.200
I really will go find him.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.799
He is my biological father, after all.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.559
Enough, stop calling me.

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:29.659
I'm in the middle of filming.

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:33.179
It's gone viral.

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:35.019
The views are approaching 100,000.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.139
Oh my goodness.

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:38.179
Over 98,000.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.440
It's definitely going to break 100,000.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:40.480
Look at the comments.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.740
Are there any negative ones?

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.480
Don't worry, they're all negative.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.539
Is this Bai Jingjing's dad?

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:46.600
Definitely not.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.779
What father would sabotage his daughter like this?

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:49.779
Listen to this one.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.899
Seems it's not just kids who can screw over their dads.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:53.700
Dads screw over their kids even harder.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.500
And this.

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:56.139
Is Bai Jingjing just collateral damage?

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:56.740
Answer:

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.419
No.

00:10:57.419 --> 00:10:59.220
This is her dad taking a precision shot.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.159
It counts as a snipe.

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:03.419
Here's a positive comment.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.740
This is so inspiring.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.220
A wayward youth became a pop star.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.639
It lets us underachievers...

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.779
see hope.

00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:12.740
Does this count as positive?

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.299
This one should count as positive, right?

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.220
I just like Bai Jingjing.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.940
I like her no matter what you say.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.519
She has a buffoon for a dad.

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:21.759
It's not her fault.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.659
Right.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:24.379
Here's one debunking the rumor.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.539
You guys actually believe this?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.620
One look and you know this guy isn't Bai Jingjing's dad.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.659
Look at this.

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:31.220
Where does Bai Jingjing look anything like him?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.860
That makes sense.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.720
Uncle Liang and Bai Jingjing's looks...

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:36.100
really aren't alike.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.059
They don't even have the same surname.

00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:39.139
Well then.

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:40.899
We've been duped.

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:41.419
Wait...

00:11:41.539 --> 00:11:42.179
It's so obvious.

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:43.860
Why didn't any of you notice?

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.580
No...

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.460
It's just that...

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.299
Mainly because we didn't think...

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:49.620
Uncle Liang would lie to us at his age.

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:51.519
We must verify this immediately.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.360
Let's go.

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:54.000
Let's go.

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:55.639
Ver...

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:56.220
Verify.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:11:59.379
Coming.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.500
Coming.

00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:04.940
Come on.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.059
Come on.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.179
So many people here.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.519
You all saw the news online, right?

00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:10.980
We did.

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:13.100
Senior Liang.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.700
At your age...

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:16.159
we trusted you so much.

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:17.600
How could you deceive us?

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:19.360
What kind of talk is that?

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:20.899
She really is fifteen.

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:21.899
We didn't ask about that.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:22.940
Speak.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.659
Is Bai Jingjing really your daughter?

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:28.179
Why is her surname Bai if yours is Liang?

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:29.080
Why do the two of you...

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.039
look nothing alike?

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.740
About that question...

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.440
If I just answer you like this,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.500
it would be a waste.

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:38.019
I suggest...

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:39.960
let's record another video, okay?

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.500
Come, set up the lights. Adjust the dimmer.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.460
Set up the camera. Change the background.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.419
Get me a pot of flowers here.

00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:44.740
Don't busy yourself just yet.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.740
You should first explain why she's a Bai...

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.740
and you're a Liang.

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:50.580
Clear this up for us.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.500
She used to be a Liang.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.960
Later she became a Bai.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.360
Stage name.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.059
Do stage names involve changing surnames?

00:12:58.539 --> 00:12:59.940
Back then, darn it...

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.220
I... I'm not swearing.

00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:03.299
It was darn it...

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:04.000
No...

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.379
I'm not swearing.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.299
It's her mother's surname.

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:10.299
Then why did she change to that surname?

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:12.259
Well, that's just because she...

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:14.899
well, her mom and I...

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:16.379
got divorced.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.259
The relationship fell apart.

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:19.500
Sorry about that.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:21.340
Nothing to be sorry about.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.379
Single-parent families are common now.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.019
My parents are like that.

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:26.460
They divorced when I was ten.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.580
Alright, don't...

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.580
don't get sidetracked.

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:29.419
Then why...

00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:31.500
does Bai Jingjing look nothing like you?

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.460
She...

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.860
she used to look exactly like me.

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:36.539
But then, we got divorced.

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:37.980
She went with her mom and...

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.460
she changed her looks.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.179
No...

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:41.820
Looks can change too?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.419
Well...

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.080
You...

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:44.220
You...

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:45.980
You...

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:47.059
ask them.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.100
Why look at me?

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:51.700
I haven't had plastic surgery anyway.

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:53.080
I...

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.580
have natural double eyelids.

00:13:55.379 --> 00:13:56.740
I definitely haven't had work done.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:13:57.960
Right.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.679
Anyway, let's put it this way.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.379
Right now, only from my face

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:03.659
can you see Bai Jingjing's

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.179
childhood charm.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.299
Dear viewers,

00:14:19.299 --> 00:14:20.220
dear fam,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.759
behind me is Yangliu Xincheng Retirement Community.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.659
The focus of many netizens,

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:27.059
Mr. Liang, who claims to be Bai Jingjing's father,

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.419
is rumored to live right here.

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:30.120
Famous star Bai Jingjing's...

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.820
Why isn't he coming out yet?

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:35.940
How about letting us in to find that

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.059
Evergreen District, No. 3?

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.720
Back.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.440
The person,

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:42.340
our security team has gone to get him.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.100
I believe

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.440
he will definitely come out.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.659
Here.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.659
Hello.

00:14:47.659 --> 00:14:48.379
May I ask,

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.539
you...

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:51.460
why don't you look Chinese?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.259
I am a white Chinese of German ancestry.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.379
Didn't know Bai Jingjing was mixed!

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.179
No wonder she's so pretty.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.179
I am not Ms. Bai Jingjing's father.

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:02.779
You aren't?

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:05.100
Then why walk right in the middle?

00:15:05.299 --> 00:15:06.500
I am not.

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:07.539
Hello, may I ask if you are...

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:08.279
He is.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.460
So you are!

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:10.940
I'd like to ask...

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.299
Friends from the media,

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:18.980
let's not disturb the elders here.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.720
I've prepared a conference room for everyone.

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:21.740
Mr. Liang

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.500
will accept interviews in the conference room.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:23.899
Alright.

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:24.700
Okay.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.279
Fine then.

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:26.179
Come.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.379
Enter in an orderly fashion.

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:28.299
Orderly fashion.

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:29.940
Come, orderly fashion.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.340
Mr. Liang,

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.220
ask when we get there.

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:37.019
Mr. Liang, regarding your daughter,

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.039
what makes you most proud?

00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:39.980
She's smart.

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:41.580
Takes after me.

00:15:42.539 --> 00:15:43.580
So Bai Jingjing's

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.779
grades were really good growing up?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.419
Either first or second place.

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:49.080
That's amazing!

00:15:49.419 --> 00:15:50.340
From the bottom.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.000
May I ask,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.379
regarding raising your star daughter,

00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:55.639
what is your secret to success?

00:15:55.879 --> 00:15:57.279
You've asked the right person.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.259
Let's not talk about the distant past.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.759
Let's start from

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.159
prenatal education.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.559
I remember when Bai Jingjing was still in the womb,

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.399
we exposed her to all kinds of music every day.

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:11.000
Like Beethoven, Glinka,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.279
Enicar, Omega...

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.639
We played them for her every day.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.059
She listened.

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:17.039
Later, on the day the child was born,

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:18.399
the doctor was scared to death.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.159
She came out bobbing her head.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.559
The doctor asked, "What's going on?"

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.480
"What's the situation?"

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:23.840
He said, "This is rock and roll!"

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.320
"This is a future rock superstar!"

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.440
"Don't you know that?"

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.799
Later, as soon as her mom breastfed her,

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.440
her head stopped moving.

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:33.200
Papa Liang,

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:34.879
I'd like to ask you,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.519
in raising Bai Jingjing to be a star,

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.080
you really took great pains.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.519
But why is it that in every acceptance speech,

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:44.360
Bai Jingjing only mentions her mother,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.840
and never mentions you?

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.399
Believe it or not,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.600
I have always been someone who

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.080
does good deeds without leaving a name.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.159
Working silently, not asking for rewards.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.159
Keeping the difficulties to myself,

00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:59.039
and leaving the honor

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:00.200
to others forever.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.519
In a word,

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.600
a modern-day Good Samaritan.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.680
That's the nickname the two of them gave me.

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:07.880
Mr. Liang, let's stop beating around the bush.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.200
Can you tell us directly,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.680
back then, you and your ex-wife,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.720
why did you get divorced?

00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:14.559
Mr. Liang,

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:15.680
rumor has it that

00:17:15.759 --> 00:17:17.759
you had an affair back then,

00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:19.319
and abandoned your wife and daughter,

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.759
never returning to their side.

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:22.599
So that to this day,

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:23.799
they still haven't forgiven you.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.339
Where did you hear that?

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.279
This is

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.720
completely untrue!

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.480
Back then,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.519
I did indeed leave them back then.

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:38.519
But later I realized my mistake!

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:40.119
I wanted to return to the family!

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.000
But they wouldn't accept it.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.599
I heard that later,

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:44.839
you were dumped by that mistress,

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:45.720
and then you regretted it.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.680
Where are you hearing all this?

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:48.940
You...

00:17:49.099 --> 00:17:50.859
Don't believe rumors, don't spread rumors. Don't you understand?

00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:51.839
I...

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.279
I am a prodigal son returning home.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.759
I realized my errors.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.759
I found my way back.

00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:58.039
I endured hardships.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.559
Uh, today's interview ends here.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.359
Mr. Liang didn't rest well last night,

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.480
so today he's a bit...

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.519
No, I rested very well!

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:06.240
I want to speak!

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.240
After all these years,

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.440
I have a belly full of grievances!

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.599
Do you know that?

00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:10.440
Let me speak!

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.480
Help Mr. Liang back to Evergreen Residence.

00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:12.240
Let's go.

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:13.880
Stop making a scene.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.740
Keep order.

00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:22.940
What you did

00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:25.380
is just like a Chen Meishi, you know?

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.500
I don't know.

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:27.980
Who is Chen Meishi?

00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:29.380
It's that guy...

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:32.140
the one who abandoned Qin Lianxiang.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:32.980
Male scum.

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:34.700
What "male scum"?

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.180
I'm classified as a scumbag.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.619
Who's a scumbag?

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:39.940
Don't talk about me.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.579
Didn't you also abandon your wife?

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:44.140
We're different.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.099
I was abandoned by my wife.

00:18:47.339 --> 00:18:48.339
Is there evidence?

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.299
Evidence?

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:52.339
Maybe.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.539
No.

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:54.259
But...

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.180
she went to Germany.

00:18:56.299 --> 00:18:57.420
Does this count as proof?

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.539
That proves you abandoned her!

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:00.859
She...

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:02.740
She went back to her country heartbroken!

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:04.680
Not back to her country.

00:19:05.059 --> 00:19:06.500
She went abroad.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.480
My ex-wife is Chinese.

00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:10.059
Chinese?

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:10.779
Yes.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.099
That proves even more that you abandoned her!

00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:15.819
She left her homeland for Germany!

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:16.619
No.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.900
She wanted to go to Germany.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.660
I wanted to stay in China.

00:19:20.779 --> 00:19:21.339
So...

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:22.519
we broke up.

00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:24.700
You're really strange too.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.819
You, a foreigner...

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.740
why are you so dead set on

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.180
staying in our China?

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.339
China is good.

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:30.579
I love China.

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:31.859
Good.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.660
I don't have time for an interview right now.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.900
Jingjing.

00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:41.500
Is it really you?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.660
What made you think of calling Dad?

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.500
No...

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.940
It's not that...

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.339
You...

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:51.759
Listen to my explanation.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.059
That was all made up by reporters.

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.380
I didn't say it.

00:19:55.859 --> 00:19:56.859
You must absolutely...

00:19:58.619 --> 00:19:59.619
There's a recording?

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.059
The reporters faked that recording.

00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:05.059
There's footage of me too?

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.220
The reporters faked that footage.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.180
You must not believe it.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.240
Then...

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:11.819
Then...

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.160
Then what do you want Dad to do?

00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:14.119
How about...

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:14.940
Dad...

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.079
issues a...

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:16.819
statement?

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.859
Or Dad holds a...

00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:21.660
press conference?

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:25.500
Or Dad gives himself two big slaps?

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:26.779
You...

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.019
Jingjing.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.420
As long as you still acknowledge this dad...

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.880
whatever you want me to do...

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.240
I'll agree to it all.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:34.980
You...

00:20:39.819 --> 00:20:41.259
Aunties, let's do it again.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.759
One, two, three, four.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.400
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:51.839
Two, two, three, four.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.119
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:56.279
Just like that.

00:20:56.279 --> 00:20:57.119
That should be enough, right?

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:59.079
It doesn't seem very synchronized yet.

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:00.119
Then how about...

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:00.799
How about we do two more?

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:01.519
Old Liang.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.799
I'm really sorry.

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:05.880
I misunderstood you before.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.279
Misunderstood me about what?

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:08.880
I thought you were always bragging.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.359
I didn't believe the big star Bai Jingjing...

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:11.559
...was really your daughter.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.720
You believe it now, right?

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:16.640
Well, that's partly your fault.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.680
You usually talk way too big.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.200
Three parts truth, seven parts fake.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.079
Full of hot air.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.799
Who? Who is?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.240
In the past...

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.160
...I won't blame you since you didn't know.

00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:27.960
But now that you know...

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.119
...that I am Bai Jingjing's biological father...

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.599
...why are you still so rude?

00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:33.319
Shake the star's dad's hand first.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.319
So Bai Jingjing really is your daughter?

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:37.480
Then why has she...

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.920
...never come to Yangliu Xincheng...

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.079
...to visit you?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.000
She...

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.640
She's busy.

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:45.960
Being a big star these days is so busy.

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:47.000
Her daily schedule...

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.839
...is packed absolutely full.

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:50.200
You could say...

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.920
...she gets up in the middle of the night...

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.539
...and comes back at sundown.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.539
She's too busy.

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:57.920
But no matter how busy...

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.960
...she should make time to see you.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.839
Exactly.

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:02.720
She'll come.

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:04.000
She'll definitely come.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.200
You just watch.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.039
Any day now...

00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:07.160
...she'll definitely come.

00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:08.720
She should be coming to see me.

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:10.680
Good.

00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:14.859
Miss Bai.

00:22:14.859 --> 00:22:16.920
May I ask when your next project is?

00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:18.359
When do you plan to get married?

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:19.799
When is your next project?
