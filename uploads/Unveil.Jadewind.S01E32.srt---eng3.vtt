00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.700
Yes.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.010
Water here too.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.860

Your Ladyship!

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.860
We planted a plum tree without asking you,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.290
hoping to bring a touch of color

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.580
to the back courtyard.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.690
Your Ladyship, we'll go make something in the kitchen.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.980
Let's eat at home tonight.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.810
Let's go.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.450
Uncle Luo, with all your duties,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.620
you still took the time to plant this tree for me.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.130
You really didn't have to.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.430
One generation plants the trees; another enjoys the shade.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.900
There's not much

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.060
I can do at my age.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.530
I just hope this tree grows tall one day,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.650
and can shelter you from wind and rain.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.300
Then I'll have no regrets.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.750
I've never heard

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.490
of anyone using a plum tree for shelter.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.460
You might pick the wrong tree.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.410
Look.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.260
Even if it can't block the wind and rain,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.270
it can splash a bit of red

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.020
in this lifeless winter.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.500
Isn't that great?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.060
For a moment's pleasure,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.850
you'd kill the innocent?

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.620
Innocent?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.300
Who was innocent?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.780
Did Yu Shishun's whole family deserve death?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.340
Did Li Sheng?

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.370
The court actress?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.780
The Assistant Director?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.130
How did you find out?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.180
No hard proof.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.460
The iron caltrop in Li Sheng's belly.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.430
The Celestial Lord vanishing

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.440
in Chongren Ward,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.800
right where my manor stands.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.300
The blade wounds on Yu Shishun's servant.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.090
That's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.650
all just a guess.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.060
It's not enough to close a case.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.740
If I'm right,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.780
Yu Shishun is the apprentice

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.090
who slowed my family's water clock,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.340
making my father

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.130
miss his audience with His Majesty.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.890
But that's still just a guess.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.520
It's not enough to close a case either.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:29.580
On that alone,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.460
I didn't want to believe you were the killer.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.690
Until Yu Lan'er drew your portrait.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.650
Then every guess I had

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.500
was proven true.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.940
This portrait

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.420
cannot possibly

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.130
be linked to me.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.740
Yes.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.500
Yu Lan'er is only five.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.130
He barely comes up to your waist.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.670
So the angle he saw you from

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.750
isn't like anyone else's.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.780
But Uncle Luo,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.300
you used to play with me when I was little.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.740
Others can't recognize it,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.060
but I knew it was you at a glance.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.250
If you still won't admit it,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.570
come back with me.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.980
Yu Lan'er will recognize you on sight.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.180
So,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.280
you're arresting me?

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.740
Tell me first:

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.450
Why did you do it?

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.370
To avenge the Prince of Duan

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.370
and all my fallen comrades!

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.010
Then go kill the Right Chancellor.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.100
Why kill the innocent?

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.960
I did this to kill the Right Chancellor!

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.770
Yu Shishun deserved to die.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.250
He was the apprentice

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.200
who slowed the water clock in the Prince of Duan's Manor!

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.740
As for the rest...

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.770
innocent?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.030
I'd say

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.300
it was fate!

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.420
If that court actress

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.160
hadn't been so vain,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.100
craving His Majesty's favor,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.250
would she have believed

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.570
that a little money

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.180
could buy her a front-row seat

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.060
at the Grand Festival?

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.010
Or agreed to meet a stranger

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.940
on a winter night?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.330
And if the Assistant Director

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.210
hadn't been so eager to win

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.060
His Majesty's favor,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.160
would he have rushed to report that "auspicious sign"?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.980
If I hadn't killed them,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.940
they would've died

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.620
sooner or later

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.130
for their pathetic desires!

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.620
What's more,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.130
if I couldn't kill these people,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.060
how could I make you understand

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.370
I'm determined

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.210
to avenge Prince of Duan?

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.330
So it seems

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.010
Yu Shishun

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.180
made a pretty good killer.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.540
I only gave him the task

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.180
and he could carry it out

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.370
so cleanly.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.890
You spread that nursery rhyme too?

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.450
You knew His Majesty fears star omens.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.720
Everything you did

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.070
was to frame Consort Shu?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.120
Yes.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.980
If Consort Shu doesn't fall,

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.250
the Right Chancellor can never be removed.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.980
And our vengeance

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.530
will never be avenged!

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.920
The one who killed my parents was the Right Chancellor.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.130
Consort Shu had nothing to do with it!

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.620
Why has the Right Chancellor

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.130
held power at court for decades?

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.860
Because Consort Shu

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.450
has bewitched His Majesty!

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.540
You underestimate His Majesty

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.690
and you overestimate Consort Shu.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.200
But to make the Right Chancellor truly fall,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.730
Consort Shu must

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.010
be cast aside by His Majesty!

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.620
Without Consort Shu's protection,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.800
I'd have died in the palace long ago.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.130
I won't let you hurt her.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.300
But she protects more than you!

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.300
She also protects

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.100
the enemy who wiped out your whole family!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.770
All these years,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.940
you've searched for proof

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.370
and risked your life

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.710
to force the Right Chancellor to show himself.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.810
But what came of it?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.090
He lives in the biggest mansion

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.440
in the capital,

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.270
guarded by the best troops,

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.810
eating delicacies,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.770
and copying scriptures.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.690
Is this

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.250
the punishment he gets?

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.120
That still isn't a reason to drag in the innocent.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.150
Your father served with loyalty all his life.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.350
Yet in death,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.860
he was branded with disgrace.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.860
How was he guilty?

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.620
A dozen of my comrades gave their lives to protect him.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.150
Now, no one even knows

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.470
where their bones rest.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.040
How are they not innocent?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.740
You were just a child when this tragedy struck.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.450
You never saw justice.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.420
How are you not innocent?

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.980
You and I

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.940
want the truth laid bare,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.620
and blood debts paid in blood.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.270
If the law and His Majesty deny us justice,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.890
we'll use our own way

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.980
to take it!

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.450
Don't you

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.500
really want revenge?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.180
Mr. Xiao

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.860
may have many reasons to tell you to give up.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.180
But I only ask you one thing:

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.330
Are you really

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.980
letting go of that blood debt?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.420
Can you really forget the Lantern Festival night

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.100
fifteen years ago?

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.940
Your father and mother

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.690
still cannot rest in peace!

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.770
Enough!

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.980
My life

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.900
should've ended back then.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.300
If I can't get revenge,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.180
you may claim it.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.940
I have no complaint.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.090
You can choose:

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.690
Either

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.900
arrest me now

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.180
and keep being

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.660
that high-and-mighty County Princess.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.900
Or

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.690
kill your enemy

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.540
and be again

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.900
your parents' daughter!

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.850
We're not the only ones

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.140
who want the Right Chancellor dead!

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.810
Your Ladyship.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.140
How did it go?

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.690
How did what go?

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.310
Didn't you take

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.420
the Celestial Lord's portrait out?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.270
How did it go?

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.940
Did you find him?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.620
I showed it to the Wannian County offices.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.970
They're posting copies all over Chongren Ward.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.210
Now we wait for word.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.330
All that fuss

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.090
just to post portraits?

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.090
For something this small,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.730
why did she do it herself?

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.060
[Virtue Alone Endures]

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.140
Don't touch it.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.840
The Ceremony is near.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.190
The sacrificial dragon's eyes are weeping blood tears.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.990
That's no good omen!

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.730
Report this to the Palace Investigation Bureau at once.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:35.900
Understood.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:43.690
Yesterday, His Majesty

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.180
painted the dragon's eyes himself.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.490
But it weeps blood tears today.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.850
It's paint.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.570
There's oil in the paint.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.210
The dragon's blood tears

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.610
have nothing to do with His Majesty.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.330
When they danced the dragon head,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.060
the red paste melted into oil,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.450
soaking through the paper layer

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:22.710
and running down.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.590
From the outside,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.060
it looked like blood tears.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.280
This layer of paper is thinner than the rest.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.670
It's hard to tell from the outside.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.060
Who made this dragon lantern?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.570
Your Ladyship,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.900
it was Lang Maochun of the Palace Workshop Service.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.190
Lang Maochun!

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.490
Hurry and greet the County Princess and the Deputy Director.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.830
I'm Lang Maochun.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.330
Paying my respects, Your Ladyship,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.570
Deputy Director.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.090
You made the dragon head for the dragon dance?

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.020
Yes.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.570
It was made by my own hands.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.610
You're not a palace craftsman, right?

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.690
I'm from Puzhou,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.380
Hedong Commandery.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.080
He's a skilled artisan

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.460
hired from the folk.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.210
All the dance props

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.790
for this year's Ceremony and Grand Festival

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.040
are made by him.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.400
The hidden grooves under the dragon's eyes

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.300
are your trick?

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.190
That's no trick!

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.450
That's our Lang family's

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.730
special craft.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.940
The grooves under the dragon's eyes

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.730
are filled with paste.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.180
After the paste melts,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.260
it keeps the bamboo

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.020
oiled and soft,

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.450
so it holds shape.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.420
So bleeding dragon eyes

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.260
are also your "special craft"?

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.640
Bleeding?

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.940
Faking an evil omen to stir up trouble,

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:01.850
and still playing dumb?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.380
Oh...

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.540
I'm wronged!

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.810
Who would dare play tricks with this?

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.780
That would cost you your head!

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:11.780
Besides,

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.130
His Majesty

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.520
personally chose me for this.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.600
How could I do

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.830
something so treasonous?

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.400
Yesterday, His Majesty came

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.660
to paint the dragon's eyes.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.170
And he praised my skill,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.140
saying I could make

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.650
such exquisite lanterns.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.020
This revolving lantern is complex.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.730
Even palace craftsmen

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.060
would struggle to finish.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.330
His Majesty liked it so much.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.450
He ordered me to make more.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.490
I barely ate or slept,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.850
rushing these lanterns out.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.020
That's proof

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.780
of my loyalty to His Majesty!

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.180
Very impressive.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.540
The paste under the dragon's eyes

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.180
is this one.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.140
It melts easily,

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.540
but there isn't much.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.380
How could it turn into blood tears?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.020
They say

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.970
hearts here are hard to read.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.490
Someone must be jealous,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.300
trying to ruin me!

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.090
You...

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.780
you commit treason!

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.300
"Phoenix pecking dragon," a direct challenge to the throne!

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.950
That was also meant to frame you?

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:34.970
I...

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.540
I didn't do it.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.730
I didn't do it.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.300
Not me!

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.220
- Fire! - Fire!

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.160
Fire!

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.450
Hurry!

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.180
My lanterns!

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.540
My lanterns!

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.180
I...

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.330
Who is it?

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.140
Put out the fire!

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.610
He got away.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.060
The guards will tighten security today.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.780
No one will leave the palace.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.570
That person

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.090
might not need to leave.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.810
He ran toward the palace gate.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.080
If not today,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.180
then tomorrow,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.560
he can't hide forever.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:25.610
The bleeding dragon eyes

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.540
was just a lure.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.970
The killer meant to draw us

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.610
to the Palace Workshop Service,

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.970
then killed using bamboo ribs.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.760
Your Ladyship.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.660
In a fire,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.400
people instinctively protect their heads.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.860
Why was this body's face

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.380
burned even worse?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.850
There wasn't time for him

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.900
to cover his mouth and nose.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.420
The moment

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.730
these bamboo ribs pierced his throat,

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.940
he was dead.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.450
Just as I thought.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.210
He barely inhaled any soot.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.490
When the body burned,

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.420
he was already dead.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.620
However,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.150
if not for the spreading blaze,

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.370
we would've caught him.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.320
That only proves

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.720
every step is full of variables.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.660
As long as one step

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.580
didn't go as the killer planned,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.380
he wouldn't get this outcome.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.970
That's why the killer

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.730
risked showing up on site?

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.970
Something still feels off.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:38.730
But I have no leads yet.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.140
The Grand Festival is in three days.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.380
We're going to be busy.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.530
The Palace Workshop Service and the Bureau of Sacrifices

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.340
have swiftly gathered

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.050
folk artisans from the capital

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.620
to remake the palace lanterns.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.970
They'll be finished

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.100
before the Grand Festival.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600
Your Majesty,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.250
please don't worry.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.620
Using the lantern's bamboo ribs to kill...

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.860
now that is a work of art.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.690
Any leads on the nursery rhyme

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.210
going around the capital?

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.970
The Court of Judicial Review's ordered the offices

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.210
of Chang'an and Wannian counties

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.290
to question every household,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.050
and force out where the rhyme came from.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.810
They've been at it day and night

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.210
without stopping.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.730
But...

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.580
People in the capital always say

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.820
"metal, wood, water, fire, earth."

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.130
The order "fire, water, earth, wood, metal"

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.250
is quite unusual.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.620
People in the capital rarely say

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.180
"fire, water, earth, wood, metal."

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.940
This servant is ignorant.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.050
I truly don't know

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.620
where that saying comes from.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.940
That phrasing is common

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:48.780
in Puzhou,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.940
Consort Shu's home, right?

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.870
Consort Shu's loyalty

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.380
has never wavered!

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.170
Ever since returning from Qinghui Palace,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.940
she's done her utmost

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.570
to prepare for the Grand Festival.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.160
In my humble view,

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.940
Consort Shu surely couldn't

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.180
have anything to do with this.

You old servant,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.980
you know quite a lot.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.940
I wouldn't dare!

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.520
I spoke out of turn!

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.700
I spoke out of turn!

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.050
- I spoke out of turn! - Enough.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.420
Well...

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.220

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.130
what's he been up to lately?

I don't know.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.050
Has anyone gone to see him?

I don't know either.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.260
You don't know,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.050
or you don't dare say?

has called on him privately.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.330
For a man publicly confined,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.530
he receives a steady stream of visitors.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.420
Tell me,

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.420
should I be glad

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.570
that my key ministers

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.790
still value loyalty

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.020
and remember old ties?

Cui Minzhong

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.900
Yes!

[Xie Binglin, Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue]
My former classmates at court

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.260
have all been demoted

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.770
or sent out of the capital,

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.940
scattered everywhere.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.370
That was to be expected.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.130
What chills me is:

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.610
now that my influence

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.290
is fading,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.740
they drop all pretenses!

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.370
You haven't left the residence,

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.370
so you may not know it.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.180
Ever since that nursery rhyme

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.570
spread through the capital,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.980
His Majesty

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.660
has posted more guards

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.770
outside your gates.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.770
The watch is tight.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.610
And the transfer orders came fast.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.850
They didn't even have time to bid you farewell

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.420
before rushing out of the capital.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.840
Every one of them

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.610
knows how to protect himself.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.700
So why would you

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.020
still dare come to my door?

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.090
I'm low-ranked and insignificant.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.940
I can't help anyone gain,

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.810
or stand in anyone's way.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.460
So they just

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.740
turn a blind eye to me.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.370
At least you still cared.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:00.980
As your disciple,

But can you really stomach

waiting to be destroyed?

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.700
His Majesty shows no mercy

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.740
to your faction,

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.260
but he still holds affection for Consort Shu.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.570

you are safe.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.610
But once

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.610
she falls from favor,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.530
then

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.130
you will share her fate.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.130
That nursery rhyme

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.460
is banned in the capital,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.020
but it's still

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.020
a thorn in His Majesty's side.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.900
You've always planned ahead.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.180
You should plan a way out for this.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.180
A way out?

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.290
I've been forced into a corner.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.260
If there's no retreat,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.090
then let's break the wall

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.220
and fight our way back to life!

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.370
Right now,

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.770
I have been stripped of all my arms.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.220
They're scattered

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:21.700
or lying dead.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.220
I'm afraid

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.050
I'm now utterly powerless.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.660
Back then, to protect Lv Chongshan,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.570
you sent him to the Andong Protectorate.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.400
For fifteen years,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.700
they have stayed

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.940
calm and secure,

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.610
never short of pay or rewards.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.130
It's time to have them

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.940
do something for you.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.230
These bamboo ribs weren't tied with cord?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.740
Sir, please look.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.810
We first roast the ribs over fire

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.610
to bend them into shape.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.220
Then

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.920
we brush glue between the ribs,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.810
tie them down with cord,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.700
and remove it once the glue sets.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.330
If you use only cord,

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.330
the bamboo's spring

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.530
will snap it?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.020
That's possible.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.090
But

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.940
for every cord to break at once

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.020
like on that lantern,

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.500
it would be hard.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.700
Hard, yes.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.740
But if you use just one cord

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.090
to bind all the ribs,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.900
it's simple.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.940
What's this for?

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.330
There are small rings

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.370
at each joint of the dragon body.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.370
The rings are linked by a cord.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.610
That way,

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.570
if the dancers get out of step,

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.260
the cord keeps the sections together

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.700
and prevents a total disaster.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.260
I see.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.220
When was the burned coiled-dragon lantern made?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.010
The night before the incident,

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:57.740
it wasn't ready yet.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.700
So Craftsman Lang likely finished it overnight.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.180
What are you looking for, Sir?

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:04.130
Let me help you.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.660
There should be a hook

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.370
near the wooden frame

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.900
to snag the cord,

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:10.530
but it won't stand out.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.960
That barrel of tung oil here

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.940
was moved by you?

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.530
Yes.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.330
Good thing Her Ladyship warned us in time.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.980
If tung oil caught fire,

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.700
this whole place would've been lost.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.130
What's in that barrel?

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.020
Tung oil!

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.820
Hurry!

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:36.800
Move!

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.130
Move!

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.570
Move!

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.180
Where did you put the tung oil?

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.850
Right outside the back window.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.980
The barrel was right outside this window.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.220
Why is it gone?

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:38.940
This is...

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.700
This is the steel needle Craftsman Lang uses

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.940
to sew palace lantern shades.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.700
That's enough.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.090
Please prepare brush and ink for me.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:48.700
Yes, sir.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:49.720
Forget it.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.050
Get a portrait artist.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.330
Understood.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.770
It's simple to make

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.940
the head fall and the ribs spring loose.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.330
All it takes is

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.850
someone cutting this cord.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.020
All the bamboo ribs inside

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.500
were bound with a single cord.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.460
And the bamboo hadn't fully set yet.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.570
Once it's loosened, it springs straight at once.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.570
The tips are razor-sharp.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.740
In that instant,

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.850
it's no different from an arrow.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.940
But back then,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.770
we didn't see any cord linked to a mechanism.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.900
At the third ke of Mao Hour,

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.900
it was still dim.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.180
The daylight in the room was faint.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.740
The cotton thread was very thin,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.130
and it was dark-colored.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.290
It blended into the light,

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.460
so it was hard to see.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.570
Once the lantern was lit,

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.850
the position of the thread

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.180
was even harder to spot.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.180
So,

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:47.770
the killer set up the whole mechanism

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.260
and hid in the dark.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.740
When Lang Maochun stepped into the trap,

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.660
he cut the cord.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.090
The steel needle holding the cord

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.090
was right here.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.710
Your Ladyship was nearby then.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.810
Did you notice the killer?

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.810
The lantern was heated by the flames,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:02.770
and a phoenix shape appeared.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.090
Everyone's attention

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.900
was drawn to the dragon-and-phoenix pattern.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.530
The killer likely struck in silence.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.740
Then how did the killer get away?

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.420
There were plenty of dancers watching.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.460
It was so chaotic.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.740
When the dragon head fell

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.770
and flames burst,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.130
the killer could slip away

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.090
in the chaos.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.810
However,

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.220
you did see the killer.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.020
Not clearly.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.850
Just a shadow

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:27.900
flashing past the window.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.900
I chased him all the way to Chuyang Gate.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.180
Then he vanished.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.570
The guards saw no one suspicious.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.660
The trail seemed

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.130
to vanish all of a sudden.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.290
In this palace,

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.980
is there someone even you can't catch?

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.220
Of course!

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.220
I still need to visit Consort Shu.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.220
I'll leave the case

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.090
to you two.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:28:59.850
Who is it?

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.220
I chased him all the way to Chuyang Gate.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.500
Then he vanished.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.460
The trail seemed

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.940
to vanish all of a sudden.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.900
What's in that barrel?

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.770
Tung oil!

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.090
The barrel was right outside this window.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.460
Her Ladyship was nearby then.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.330
So someone's framing you with that too?

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.290
No.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.090
That wasn't the killer.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.180
[Zichen Hall]

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.180
How is the Palace Workshop Service case going?

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.640
The crime happened at Mao Hour,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.800
on the east side of the palace,

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.980
and the victim was killed with bamboo ribs.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.530
Just like the previous three cases,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.700
it follows the Five Elements pattern,

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.980
and it aligns with Wood this time.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.700
The killer is very particular

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:51.130
about the time and the place.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.220
As for his motive,

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.290
we still don't know.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:57.050
If you won't say it,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.530
then I'll say it.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.050
I'm afraid

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.260
they want to use the omen of Venus in daylight

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.740
to shake the realm,

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.020
and speak up for Consort Shu.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.260
Your Majesty,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.460
I observe the stars every night.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.510
I only see the five planets keeping their course,

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.410
appearing and fading in season.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.900
There's no sign of Venus in daylight.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.700
Even if, as the rhyme implies,

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.360
"Venus" is a hint at Consort Shu,

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.530
we should send more men

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.500
to protect her.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.770
Then what if

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.850
the "metal" in that sequence

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.370
points not to Consort Shu,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.520
but to me,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.770
to this golden throne?

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.290
I will do my utmost

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.810
to bring the killer to justice.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.330
Your Highness, tired from rehearsal?

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.180
Why push yourself so hard?

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.220
I choreographed this dance myself.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.130
And the Grand Festival is my duty.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.500
In this emergency,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.020
I must see it through.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.090
Since only you

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.660
can perform this dance,

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.020
the measure of its success

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.530
is yours to decide.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.090
Listen to you, silver tongue.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.260
But I'm rusty, after all.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.460
I have to rehearse it well.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.370
I can't let His Majesty down.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.570
The Palace Workshop Service sent a few necklaces.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:07.850
Help me pick.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.660
Look.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.850
Which one?

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.850
What's wrong?

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.500
Who upset you this time?

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.500
Your Highness,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.460
don't attend the Grand Festival this time, all right?

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.700
I'm a consort.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.090
Of course I must do my duty.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.020
Don't you know

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.290
the killer is still striking?

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:42.850
Of course I know.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:45.310
These past six months,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.130
His Majesty has toiled for the state.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.610
He meant to use the Southern Suburb Ceremony

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.940
to pray for the realm,

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.700
then reward the ministers

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.940
at the Grand Festival after.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.260
But the killer kept striking,

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.460
with evil omens unending.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.050
His Majesty is worried sick.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.290
Not just the palace cases.

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.770
But also that nursery rhyme sung in the capital.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.460
I know it all.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.180
Have you considered

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.050
the killer means to strike at the Grand Festival,

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.850
and the target is likely you?

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.460
You've exhausted yourself.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:23.460
Your old illness has returned.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.180
You could use your health

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.570
as reason to withdraw.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.260
He would never blame you.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.110
Why put yourself

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.460
in danger?

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.220
If he truly wants to kill me,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.090
why wait for the Grand Festival?

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.330
Haven't you noticed it?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.330
These past two weeks,

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.500
His Majesty hasn't come here once.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.020
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.180
"Fire, water, earth, wood, metal."

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.850
That rhyme uses

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.220
the wording from my hometown, Puzhou.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.770
And it likens Venus to me.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.610
Even if I do nothing,

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.530
the palace cases alone,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.980
plus that folk rhyme,

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.740
are enough for His Majesty

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:06.610
to grow distant and suspicious of me.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.570
Who does Your Highness think did it?

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.700
Either my elder brother,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.290
too bored to sit still,

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.530
stirred up trouble.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.660
Or those who hate the Cui family,

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.130
seizing this chance

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.740
to wipe out the Cui clan,

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.660
plotting in the shadows.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.260
No matter which it is,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.610
I can't try to do anything.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.460
The more I do,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.530
the more His Majesty will suspect me.

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:38.770
So you yield to fate without a fight?

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.610
I do not yield.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.850
I'm doing what I should do.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.370
All these years,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.370
everything I have

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.050
came from His Majesty's favor.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.570
He granted me glory,

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.900
and also made me a target.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.130
Blessings come,

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:56.660
and so does slander.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.810
In this vast inner palace,

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.570
only His Majesty can kill me,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.330
and only His Majesty can protect me.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.690
Doing my duty

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.570
is how I stay steady through change.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.210
I say

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:20.780
we pick this one.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.900
Proper and flawless.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.980
Perfect and complete.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.340
Mr. Gu showed up early,

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.860
said hello to me,

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.020
then fell asleep right here.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.780
You're a dignified prosecutor.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.460
It's past Chen Hour,

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:49.730
and you're slacking off here?

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.530
For the nursery rhyme case,

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:53.460
I was up all night.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.320
The moment I got a lead,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.780
I rushed over to tell you

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.860
without a pause.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.050
I run my legs off every day,

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.570
and not a soul pities me!

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.250
Looking for sympathy, huh?

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.820
Spit it out.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.380
You traced the rhyme's source?

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.860
Technically,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.210
yes.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.210
Effectively,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.090
it's like we didn't.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.730
Let me see.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.860
The first one who learned the rhyme

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.460
was a little girl from a butcher's family.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.250
She said

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.690
the one who taught her the rhyme

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.860
was this person.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.090
Is it the Celestial Lord?

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.250
This one was drawn from the butcher girl's description.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.250
And this one from Lan'er's.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.530
It should be the same man.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.170
When did the Celestial Lord teach the girl

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.130
the rhyme?

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.300
About half a month ago.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.250
We worked for nothing.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:53.610
Not exactly.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.440
At least it confirms

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.420
our earlier guess.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.170
The Celestial Lord spread the rhyme among the people first,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.210
then followed the rhyme

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.210
to strike inside the palace.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.690
So it seems

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.250
the Celestial Lord uses the elemental pattern

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.440
to plague His Majesty

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.130
with a series of bad omens

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.690
before the Southern Suburb Ceremony

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.860
and the Grand Festival.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.050
And by spreading the rhyme,

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.090
he's trying to make His Majesty

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.340
grow sick of Consort Shu.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.650
The Celestial Lord has now committed four cases.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.570
Could the last one

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.610
be at tomorrow's Southern Suburb Ceremony?

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.340
The killer is careful.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.730
He won't change his pattern at random.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.380
"Metal" matches

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.340
Shen and You Hours,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.690
and the direction is west.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.680
But tomorrow's ceremony is at Chen Hour,

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.210
in the southern suburbs.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:34.220
The time and direction don't match.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.380
After the ceremony,

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.220
His Majesty will hold the Grand Festival

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:37.980
at the Hua'e Xianghui Tower,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.170
banqueting ministers and their families.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.340
Consort Shu will also perform a dance for His Majesty.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.610
Notify the Imperial Guards

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.780
and all palace gate guards:

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.820
During tomorrow's Grand Festival,

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.250
we must be especially vigilant.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.500
All right.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.130
Let him sleep here.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.090
Wuren,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.660
about what I asked for yesterday,

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.300
did you get it?

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.650
Yeah. You're really meticulous.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.070
You checked the night-soil collectors' routes and shifts

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.320
to stop someone

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.980
from sneaking into the palace?

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.300
Thank you.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.660
[Routes of the lavatory night-soil collectors]

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.820
Mr. Xiao.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.570
You wanted to see me?

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.730
The hook's been cast?

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.020
Yes.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:32.690
The bait is in the water.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.340
He hasn't bitten yet,

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.250
but the ripples are already spreading.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.300
I heard there was some trouble.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.530
Not really trouble.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.210
Just a bit of rough water.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.340
Rough water doesn't matter.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.090
As long as it gets the boat

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.210
where it needs to go,

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.090
bigger waves are fine too.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.780
Is everything ready?

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:51.860
All ready.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.210
At the Grand Festival,

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.210
it'll be a stunning debut.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.650
That nursery rhyme

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.420
should've reached the Right Chancellor's manor by now.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.780
He copies scriptures at home every day,

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.300
but inside,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.900
his mind is already in chaos.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.170
That old fox

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:08.980
has been flooding the palace with pleas

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.860
for an audience.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.500
But neither His Majesty nor Consort Shu

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.170
has answered.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.250
Your plan really worked.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.380
One more push,

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.940
and he won't be able to sit still!

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.730
Once the Cui family falls,

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.250
the vengeance of Prince of Duan and Jianning Iron Army

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.170
will finally be repaid.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.250
Thank you, my lord!

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:33.460
Clearing the court

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.980
is my duty.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.690
We share the same aim.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.900
No need for thanks.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.650
Without your help,

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.340
I couldn't have done it so smoothly.
