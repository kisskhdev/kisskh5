00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
"Love After Addiction"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600
(Episode 1)

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.560
That was the second time I set foot here.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.439
To attend their wedding.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.359
The year before that...

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.239
Was the longest year

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.400
of my life.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.840
Yoki... Yoki... I like you.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040
Red suit.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.079
Coffee.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.840
Bodyguard.

00:02:01.127 --> 00:02:01.613
Demeanor.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.054
(Film Emperor)

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.079
Courtesy.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.239
And the next second...

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:05.272
White.

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:05.693
(Ruined Reputation)

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.855
And the second after that...

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:07.519
Red.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.799
Pig's blood.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.599
Evidence.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840
Ugly people.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:14.799
Her name is Fang Xiaotian.

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.280
It should be obvious that

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.000
before she splashed me，

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.360
I didn't even know her.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.879
As for the motive，

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.159
I think you all known.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:23.895
The media has widely reported it，

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.919
and I became the villain.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.120
Condemned by public opinion.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.560
Even though I had solid proof

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.719
to prove it was a setup.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.280
I couldn't say anything.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080
Because

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.080
it would drag me into

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.400
a deeper abyss.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.599
So her devious plan paid off.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:37.919
Got famous.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360
Yeah.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.120
The guy on the right

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.560
is my agent, Liang Hao.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.319
After the incident，

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.656
we received contract termination notices

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680
from multiple parties.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.919
But my agent

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.159
always has his ways.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.295
We've only got a
variety show here.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.400
I think maybe you should

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680
treat it like a trip.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.080
Go have some fun.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.000
And along the way，

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.320
take advantage of this show

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.039
to create

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.719
a better, brand-new image for you.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Then make a comeback.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.319
So my immediate refusal

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.520
almost made me miss...

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.799
the most important person in my life.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080
Forget it.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.719
You'd better just watch the story.

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:58.555
[singing classic Chinese opera]

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.159
My precious radio!

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.879
Meng!

00:04:08.392 --> 00:04:09.672
You're really something.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.840
It's nothing, uncle.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
As long as you're happy.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.279
The newly crowned Best Actor, Yoki，

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.735
has recently been embroiled in a scandal

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.560
with actress Fang Xiaotian.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.759
Fang Xiaotian publicly accused Yoki

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.336
of domestic violence
and forcing an abortion

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.199
during their relationship.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.855
Business partners are
terminating contracts one after another.

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:27.879
What kind of person!

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.719
How can anyone

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.639
become a celebrity now?

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:35.399
To master an art, first be a decent person.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.279
Look at you!

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.240
You, a public figure,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.759
should set a good example.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:43.079
Setting a fine example indeed.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.000
Well，

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.240
I just think

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.639
those people on TV

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.976
are no match for our Brother Meng.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Right?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.879
Yes, yes.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.079
Handsome and kind-hearted.

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.800
Sounds good to me.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:54.879
Me?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.520
Climbing trees, raiding bird nests?

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:57.800
Climbing trees, raiding bird nests.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.920
That counts as a talent!

00:04:59.079 --> 00:04:59.600
And anyway，

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.240
you can fix so many things.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.656
How much have you done for the villagers?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.079
Right?

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.319
Yes，exactly.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I'm heading out.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:08.279
Aren't you staying for dinner?

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.000
No, thanks.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.439
Really not eating?

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.560
I'll pass. I'm going home.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.439
He's a young man,

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.278
who has his own mind.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.279
Just let him go.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.639
Xiao Meng!

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.639
Finally found you!

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.279
Is something the matter?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.679
There's a variety show recently

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.720
that's going to film in our village.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.039
They want to get the help of

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.119
some young men

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.720
to ensure safety,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.839
and also to

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.760
promote the unique features of our village.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.959
Aren't you one of our village volunteers?

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.320
You were the first person I thought of!

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:48.759
Village Chief.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.639
Don't worry.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.295
I'll give it my full cooperation.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:51.560
Good.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.199
It's settled then!

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.160
Okay.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
I'll head off now.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.800
Xiao Meng...

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.839
Are you free lately?

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:01.319
Village Chief.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480
What can I do for you?

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.399
Uncle.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.240
The village chief

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.879
asked me to deliver this fertilizer.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.040
Just leave it there.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120
Thank you.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.360
Thanks, Meng.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.759
I'm off.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.079
Thanks for your trouble.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120
Best Actor.

00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:57.255
I recommend conducting an investigation
into how he won that Best Actor award.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.696
All flashy on the surface
but behind the scenes...

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.720
All flashy on the surface

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.319
but a pervert behind the scenes.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:04.456
Should've been crumbled long ago.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.518
Disgusting. Disgusting.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.239
His public persona has completely crumbled.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.519
Pervert.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.720
So disgusting.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.399
All flashy on the surface

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.079
but a pervert behind the scenes.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:14.959
Pervert.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:16.639
Major pervert! Huge pervert!

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040
I am NOT a pervert!

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.399
Is that Yoki?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.279
Yoki, you scumbag!

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.360
I've been a fan for so many years.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.816
And I never thought you were like this!

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.440
Give me back my youth!

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.639
Give me back my feelings!

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:30.399
Fans, find someone better to support.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.240
His fame was just luck.

00:09:33.192 --> 00:09:34.495
Why on earth does a creep like that

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:35.519
get to be Best Actor?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.679
I always said

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.679
he'd come crashing down one day.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.360
Why doesn't he just die?

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:42.240
Such terrible character.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.399
Who knows where those photos came from?

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:45.816
We don't even know if they're real.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.240
That's just one side of the story.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.279
I believe in Yoki.

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:49.159
He's not that kind of person.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:49.960
I can't wait

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:51.039
to watch this drama.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.920
My expectations are through the roof.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.399
The filming must be tough.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.519
Remember to drink water.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
Take care of yourself.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.519
Rookie actor Yoki,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.240
Great things await.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.360
Lanwan Village.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.120
There's a project

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:45.255
called something like Blue... Village.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:46.279
I think it's pretty good.

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:48.480
You can treat it like a vacation.

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.239
That reality show you mentioned earlier，

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.080
I'll do it.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.279
Really? That's great!

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:58.080
Yoki, sweetie!

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840
Brother Yoki.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.279
Hello, I'm Ye Ran.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.960
Can you hold this for me?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.120
Sure.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Brother Yoki.

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:58.120
I'm a guest here too.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.200
I've watched your work.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.360
Really?

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:03.039
Should I carry your bag?

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:03.879
Thanks.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.120
No problem, no problem.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.519
Sir.

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:09.759
This car is full.

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:14.000
How about that one?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
That one's full too.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.080
What do you mean?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.080
It means wait here
till I come back for you.

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:22.239
Or I'll send you a location

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:23.615
and you figure it out yourself.

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:24.895
But bro, there's still space here.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:25.919
Go, go, go!

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:28.639
See you on set, sir.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120
My bag!

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:44.960
My phone's inside!

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.399
Come back!

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.599
He's so... casual about it.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.000
Before all this happened to him,

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:51.240
I actually liked him.

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:52.639
Is he racing

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:53.759
our car?

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:54.480
Driver，

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:55.399
didn't you say

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.360
you were the driving
king of Lanwan Village?

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.279
Can you tolerate this?

00:12:58.279 --> 00:12:58.879
Stop the car.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.080
Hold on tight.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.039
Not bad! Driver, stop!

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:03.879
Stop!

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:11.559
Come back!

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.840
Pick up the phone!

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.240
Boss, your phone is ringing.

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:54.000
Don't bother checking.

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:55.039
Must be a spam call.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.519
Take it away. Hang up.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240
Where am I?

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.080
It's quite pretty.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.120
Hey, buddy,

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:19.159
haven't we

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:19.960
met somewhere?

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.159
No.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.960
Who sent you?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360
No one.

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:28.959
You're a paparazzo, right?

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.320
Hey! Why are you insulting me?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.080
Who sent you?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:31.840
No one sent me.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.679
Why are you cursing at me?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960
Paparazzo, huh?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.559
Why the insults?

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.360
Where's the phone?

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:36.320
No phone.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.000
The phone you used to sneak photos.

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:39.176
The phone you used to sneak photos.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.840
Hand it over! No! I don't have it!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.440
Let me see.

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.639
Give it here.

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:43.959
Isn't my phone right there with you?

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720
N-no, sorry.

00:14:56.039 --> 00:14:57.120
Are you crazy?

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:58.775
If you weren't so good-looking，

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:00.039
I would've punched you already.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.456
My wife just topped up this phone.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.800
You're gonna drain it in no time.

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:04.559
Psycho.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.360
I couldn't get through either.

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:11.879
Thanks.

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:15.039
And thank your wife.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840
"Journey with You"?

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:31.000
You really got me into a mess.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.120
My feet are about to fall off.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.600
Buddy.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720
Hey, buddy.

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:56.039
Need some help?

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.240
Can you ride?

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:21.559
You got a license?

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.079
What did you say?

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.880
I said, can you ride?

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.119
You should probably hold onto me.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.759
It'll be more stable.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480
That won't be necessary.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.400
Drive carefully.

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:37.640
Please be safe.

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:39.000
Don't fall asleep.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.559
Don't worry.

00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:43.079
I absolutely won't fall asleep.

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:48.079
Asleep?

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.160
You're overthinking it.

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.559
Why is it kind of...

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.640
comfortable?

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.000
My eyelids are so heavy.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.319
So... heavy...

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400
Hey, buddy.

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:40.039
Buddy?

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440
Did I fall asleep?

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:47.119
We're here.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.680
How much?

00:20:05.519 --> 00:20:06.640
You're staying here too?

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:11.240
You're a good guy.

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:16.799
Tasty, right?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.000
Our place

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:19.319
is not easy to get delivery.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.976
The production team managed to get us

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.320
this very... distinctive takeout.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.519
When did you get back?

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.720
This afternoon.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.480
The village chief called and said

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:33.599
there's a variety show.

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.376
He asked me to come
back as a safety officer.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.599
Said they're providing

00:20:36.759 --> 00:20:37.919
the guesthouse space to them.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.119
That's great!

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.000
With you here,

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.040
we'll definitely pull
this collaboration off.

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:43.160
Go add some water.

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:44.279
Okay.

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:51.400
Sorry, Teacher Yoki.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.200
My flight was delayed today.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.720
So your arrangements were mishandled.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:56.680
But I just

00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:57.879
sent a car to pick you up.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.598
How did you

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:01.240
get here so fast?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.519
I hate nothing more than a man

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.039
who disrespects women.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:07.599
Watch it. I'll teach
you a lesson.

00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:09.920
Your palms are sweaty.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200
Teacher Yoki.

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:13.160
Just as sleazy as on TV.

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:14.319
Majestic.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.200
Without me,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.359
would this show

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
be able to get funding?

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.759
To tape with no issues?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.799
Be sitting here having a meal?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:27.960
Brother Yoki.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.960
Sit down.

00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:31.599
Teacher Yoki.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.680
Don't be mad.

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:33.799
Sit down and have some.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.759
We specially made

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.160
bitter melon with eggs for you.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.920
Cool down please.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.720
Calm your temper.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.519
Also,

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.440
starting tomorrow,
we begin filming.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.480
Funding is already secured.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400
Surprised?

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:46.759
Shocked?

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:48.359
Happy?

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.079
He's like the most country
of country bumpkins.

00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.039
Where's my bag?

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.480
If I'm not mistaken，

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.279
someone has probably

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.960
already taken it to your room.

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:05.160
Then where's my room?

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.119
I think you'd better

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.160
ask the front desk.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.599
Since it involves privacy.

00:22:12.079 --> 00:22:13.880
If everyone found out

00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:15.519
that wouldn't be good, right?

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:25.559
See you later, Mr. Yoki.

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:28.519
See that?

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:29.799
That's a big star.

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:31.976
It just so happens our dishes

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
are a bit light today.

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.400
His presence added some more spice for us.

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:43.559
Hello.

00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:47.839
Which is my room?

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.400
What's your name?

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:51.039
Yoki.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.119
What about Yoki?

00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:53.279
Just tell me your name.

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.519
Yoki is my name.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200
Yoki.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.920
My name is

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.440
Yoki.

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:22.759
What about Yoki?

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.200
Yoki is my name.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480
What are you laughing at?

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:41.319
My name is Yang Meng.

00:23:41.839 --> 00:23:43.399
Yang Meng... More like Yang "Weakling".

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.039
Yang Meng.
