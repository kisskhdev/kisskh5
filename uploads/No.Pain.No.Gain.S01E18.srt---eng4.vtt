=No Pain No Gain=
(Adapted from the Qidian novel)

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.180
("Losing Money to Be a Tycoon"
by Qingshan Quzui)

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
=Episode 18=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.300
(Party A, Mediator)

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.140
It's you again.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.140
The person involved is now saying

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.946
you're impersonating
a designated driver.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.110
You're suspected of reckless driving.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.270
Tell us the situation.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.230
Sir,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.830
that's not the situation.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.550
You see, it's...

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.790
Be more serious about it.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.670
Sir,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.230
the situation

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.700
isn't like what he described.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.110
Let me show you.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.670
I've been a designated driver
for quite some time.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.990
And, I received a five-star review
on each of my trips.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.230
You see, there was even a client
who booked me monthly.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.990
She wanted me
to pick her up every month.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.830
But picking them up today?

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.580
That was the worst luck
I had in my life.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.350
Don't you agree?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.420
He likes to drive, huh?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.270
You're lying!

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.230
Sir,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.420
our company

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.180
has always been

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.300
Tengda's

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.830
largest competitor.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.300
Now, he's our designated driver.

00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:17.830
And, he almost caused an accident.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.700
It's clear that he
was trying to murder us!

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:20.670
He was!

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.580
Murder?

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.270
That's nonsense,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.900
don't you agree?

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.270
The traffic police
came to the scene as well.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.620
There's a dash cam in his car too.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.830
What did the traffic police conclude?

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.420
They concluded that, at worst,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.420
I had merely made a driving error.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.391
What murder? He thought
I wanted to murder him?

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.670
Why would I?

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.724
Let me ask you this, then.

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:39.350
You're in charge of Tengda.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.350
Why did you join my company?

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.280
And now, why are you
a designated driver?

00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:46.180
I joined Sky Fire purely
because I wanted to make money.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.391
I'm being a designated driver

00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:48.580
purely because I want to try out

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.300
a different experience in life

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.180
and...

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:53.746
And make some money while I'm at it.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.790
Make money?

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.740
Your turn.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.580
(Police)

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.500
Sorry about that.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.260
Sorry for the trouble. Thank you.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.910
Well,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.180
the issue has been resolved perfectly.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.470
Pei Qian,

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.500
you're lucky that I don't have

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.740
any evidence against you.

00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:41.150
But did you need to be this wary

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.060
of me?

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.500
Did you need to do all that
just to assassinate me?

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.300
Assassinate you?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.550
But don't worry.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.324
No matter what devious schemes you have,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.420
once Eternal Reincarnation is launched,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.710
I'll make sure Tengda

00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:56.680
suffers eternal damnation.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.300
Eternal damnation?

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.860
What the heck are you thinking?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.300
Mr. Pei,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.420
don't worry.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.420
I trust you.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.119
I'm sure you won't commit
premeditated murder.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.670
Yeah, right?

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.500
No one in their right mind
would believe that.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.300
But...

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.924
I finally understood you chose
to become a designated driver.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.060
Why, then?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.860
Indeed.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.180
People are at
their most relaxed state in the car.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.102
Sometimes, they might blurt out
something they aren't supposed to.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.350
This way,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.620
it's easier to get a hold of
their confidential information.

00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:30.550
As the saying goes,
"Know the enemy and yourself,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.820
join the battle personally,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.835
and you'll come up on top
with despicable means."

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.300
Impressive.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.260
I like that.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.500
See you.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.060
What the heck is going on here?

00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:46.180
Mr. Pei, you took
the words out of my mouth.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.860
What the heck is going on here?

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.670
Did you know

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.820
what the police officer told me?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.300
What?

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.230
He suggested
that I bring you to a psychiatrist.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.030
Zhou Muyan was the one
who wasn't in his right mind.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.546
What has that got to do with me?

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.350
Mr. Pei,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.470
you signed a contract with Mr. Sima.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.110
I know you have a mortgage to pay.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.391
That's why you do part-time jobs
to make some pocket money.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:13.124
And, I'm turning a blind eye to it.

00:06:13.124 --> 00:06:14.350
But what do you mean by this?

00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:17.546
Are you getting a free 5,000-yuan salary
while being a designated driver?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.910
Can you stop with

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.060
all these ridiculous things?

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:22.124
I don't want to come
to the police station again.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.060
Then what can I possibly do
that would lose me money?

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.389
I finally figured it out.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.500
All those unscrupulous capitalists
are all the same.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.990
Mr. Sima,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.380
Li Fuhui, Li Shi, and Zhou Muyan!

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.940
Listen up.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.413
I'll work as a designated driver!

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:38.380
I'll depend on myself.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.300
I'm not ashamed of it!

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.820
Morning.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.857
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:06:55.857 --> 00:06:56.660
(Tengda Games)

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.060
Mr. Pei, you have
been reported by a client.

00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:02.500
After verification by the platform,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.413
serious violations
have indeed been confirmed.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.180
From today on,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.910
your account and all accounts associated
with your real-name ID

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.910
will be banned.

00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:12.380
(Statistics on Revenues and Expenditures
for Each Settlement Period, The Culprit)

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.860
What's wrong?

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.940
Come here.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.550
Hurry.

00:07:22.013 --> 00:07:24.230
When Mr. Pei returned
to his apartment last night,

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.550
he looked very down.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.470
After that, I bumped into Li Shi.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.860
Initially, I wanted to ignore him.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.791
But he actually knew why

00:07:30.813 --> 00:07:32.670
Mr. Pei became a designated driver.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.620
Come here!

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.060
Come back! Don't keep us in suspense!

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.380
Finish the story!

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.790
Mr. Pei has infiltrated
the designated driver scene

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.380
in hopes that he can
pick up Zhou Muyan one day

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.420
and wait for him to blurt out all of his
company's confidential information.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.740
Something's off.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.060
Sky Fire isn't located in Jinchuan.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.150
This plan is utterly ineffective.

00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:57.520
Even if Mr. Pei works as
a designated driver all his life,

00:07:57.524 --> 00:07:58.902
he couldn't encounter Zhou Muyan.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.250
No, that's not right.

00:08:03.257 --> 00:08:05.030
Huang Sibo has been
sharing tons of insights

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.635
on how to understand Pei with me lately.

00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:08.146
Although I couldn't learn them all,

00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:09.150
I did learn a few.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.350
You see,

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.670
Mr. Pei did pick up
Zhou Muyan last night.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.150
Sky Fire is under Fuhui, right?

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.260
Their HQ is located in Jinchuan, right?

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.500
Therefore, I'm sure
Mr. Pei has inside news.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.991
He knew that Zhou Muyan
was coming here on a business trip.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.420
Though old, the warhorse

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.060
still longs to gallop a thousand miles.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.940
Mr. Pei is truly impressive.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.660
Yeah.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.990
(Zhou Muyan,)

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.470
(you're too much.)

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.813
(I actually bumped into you
even as a designated driver.)

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.230
(I'll settle my debt with you later.)

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.540
(Just you wait.)

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.540
Mr. Pei, I've always
received a high wage.

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:18.280
I usually pay other people 5,000 yuan

00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:19.780
for them to cover this task.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.900
About this,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.710
I think it's kind of embarrassing.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.830
Why don't we forget it?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.900
Madam,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.310
if you're outsourcing
this task to someone else,

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.740
that means you're very intelligent.

00:09:33.702 --> 00:09:35.230
It's the same no matter who you hire.

00:09:35.257 --> 00:09:36.470
You can hire me in the future.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.900
And, we're entrepreneurs.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.950
We have to try out different
experiences in life.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.020
You see,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.710
we should forget about it.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.830
Let me do it.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.140
Let me do it.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.950
Let me do it.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.260
Let me do it.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.590
I told you already! Let me do it!

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.524
Madam, go and shop right now.

00:09:51.546 --> 00:09:52.990
It's the same no matter who you hire!

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.257
From now on, I'll do this job!

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.380
Please go ahead.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:09:59.830
Please go ahead.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.740
Mr. Pei,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.590
what are you up to this time around?

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.620
Cheh.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.110
Mr. Pei, I'm curious as to

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.500
when you'll get back on track again.

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:58.380
Come on, let's play two more rounds.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.110
Ten more rounds.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.590
Sure.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.391
See if you can win.

00:11:00.413 --> 00:11:01.380
No problem.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.990
This...

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.900
Does Tengda have
some kind of fairy godmother?

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.990
Lv,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.900
does someone have a crush on you?

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.990
No way.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.190
Obviously not.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.780
Look.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.950
Unless she has a crush on both of us.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.350
Morning, Lin Wan.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.140
Morning.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.230
Who arranged all my figures so neatly?

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.940
(Neck Support Patch)

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.830
Who got me all these

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.190
neck and back support patches?

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.260
Who made me this goji berry tea?

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.590
Our workspace is so clean and neat.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.830
I thought our janitor

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.070
wasn't a J person.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.990
Did we get someone new?

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.780
I don't think so.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.140
Someone refilled the cat food as well.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.570
Someone cleaned the cat's bed as well.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.620
It was Mr. Pei.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.740
Mr. Pei?

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.710
He thought

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.110
the office was too messy.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.860
That's why he cleaned it up.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.710
How could we make Mr. Pei do that?

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.380
We have to do that ourselves.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.070
I have a suggestion.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.620
From now on,

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.780
let's do a thorough spring cleaning.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.991
We mustn't let Mr. Pei

00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:12.590
worry about these minor matters anymore.

00:12:12.613 --> 00:12:13.230
Don't you agree?

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.020
Yeah.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.710
You have a point.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.590
I'm not used to
having such a clean desk.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.860
(Today, Eternal Reincarnation,
the major game developed by Sky Fire,)

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.780
(is available for purchase.)

00:12:23.902 --> 00:12:26.210
(Eternal Reincarnation's Results Await)
(Eternal Reincarnation is a masterpiece)

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:27.710
(crafted by Sky Fire
using five years.)

00:12:27.857 --> 00:12:29.990
(Sky Fire has truly spared
no expenses this time.)

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.260
(But as for its result,
we still have to wait and see.)

00:12:33.324 --> 00:12:35.213
(Try Eternal Reincarnation together)
(Those who haven't played it yet, take note.)

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.629
(Now, Eternal Reincarnation
has an all-new voice-based gameplay.)

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.110
(It's something
you have to try for yourself.)

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.110
(Hurry and join me.)

00:12:40.146 --> 00:12:41.230
(Trying Sky Fire's new game,
Eternal Reincarnation)

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.860
(Eternal Reincarnation.)

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.990
(Just that name alone
is attractive enough.)

00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:47.350
(Cool Trailer = Big-Budget Game)
(The trailers were pretty cool.)

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.470
(I feel like Eternal Reincarnation)

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.470
(should be the most expensive)

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.391
(locally-developed video games
in recent years.)

00:12:57.524 --> 00:13:00.260
(Eternal Reincarnation is Sky Fire's
heartfelt creation.)

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.235
(It represents
the highest standards of Fuhui.)

00:13:02.235 --> 00:13:04.991
(It was masterfully crafted by their
team of experts over five years.)

00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.900
(An international version will
be released simultaneously)

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:08.191
(and be introduced to the world.)

00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:09.446
Fuhui still thinks

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.989
that we've invested too much money
in Eternal Reincarnation.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:13.500
But they have no idea

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.740
that this game

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.230
will surely succeed.

00:13:16.457 --> 00:13:18.830
We spent three times
Tengda's development cost to develop it.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.190
And, it has the same gameplay.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.430
Tengda

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.710
is no match for us.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.110
Yeah.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.430
Mr. Zhou, under your management,

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.620
it'll definitely achieve success.

00:13:29.013 --> 00:13:30.170
Let's forget about all else.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:31.620
The art style alone

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.830
is world-class.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.302
By then, if we join hands

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:35.950
with the ACG (Anime, Comic, Game) circle,

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.190
the character skins
will surely sell like hotcakes.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:39.590
Mr. Zhou,

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:40.830
I'm sure we can shut

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.500
the HQ up with this.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.270
(To be honest,
this looks kind of familiar.)

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.500
Check out the trending topics
on your phone.

00:13:56.257 --> 00:13:56.950
I'll take a look.

00:13:59.146 --> 00:14:00.900
Eternal Reincarnation
is one of the trending topics.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.710
Really?

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.350
Let me see.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.070
Mr. Zhou.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.230
Mr. Zhou.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.070
You forgot to knock.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.380
Come in.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.710
Mr. Zhou.

00:14:20.768 --> 00:14:21.880
People on the internet said

00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:24.070
that Eternal Reincarnation
resembled Returning to Shore.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.724
Now, it's already
one of the trending topics.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.380
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.070
This isn't a huge deal.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.430
Just push it down and be done with it.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.900
(Eternal Reincarnation
Is Accused of Plagiarism)

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.660
Find Meng Chang.

00:14:53.968 --> 00:14:56.080
What's the point of spending
tens of millions

00:14:56.124 --> 00:14:57.090
on advertising on them?

00:14:57.124 --> 00:14:58.368
Tell him to manage public opinion.

00:14:58.391 --> 00:14:58.940
Understood.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.230
(Eternal Reincarnation is much better
than Returning to Shore.)

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.190
(The art style of Eternal Reincarnation
is clearly better.)

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.500
(The worldview of Eternal Reincarnation)

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.430
(is much more creative.)

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.702
(The plot is very interesting.)

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.380
(Special Assistant Office)

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.470
Hailu.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.500
Wait.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.660
What's the matter?

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.190
Did Mr. Pei clean our office

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.860
with only that intention in mind?

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.430
Before this, he vanished,

00:15:43.546 --> 00:15:45.860
joined Sky Fire, and even
worked as a designated driver.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.110
His actions have been irregular.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.190
Are you guys hiding any secret plans

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.110
from us?

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.780
Hurry and check out the trending topics.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.830
Sky Fire is first
on the trending topics.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.900
But why?

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.900
On the trending again?

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.230
I thought they suppressed the news.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.140
No. They're complaining about
Eternal Reincarnation's quality.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.260
People are criticizing them
for posting misleading trailers.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.660
The game was poorly made.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.660
Plenty of players
are asking for a refund.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.190
I already expected that to happen.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.299
Look at the mess they're in.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.213
And they're still
trying to pin the blame on us.

00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:14.140
They deserve this.

00:16:14.235 --> 00:16:15.860
Their reputation has indeed been ruined.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.860
(Trash game. Shut it down.)
Now, they can't suppress it anymore.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.310
(Poorly made! Give me a refund!)
It's a total collapse.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.500
(The trailers were lies!
Close down Sky Fire! Give me a refund!)

00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:23.368
What's the point of hiring you guys?

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.900
All of you are freeloaders!

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.540
Oh no.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.110
Mr. Zhou has lost it again.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.590
Brace yourself for tough times ahead.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.020
I told you guys already.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.260
Eternal Reincarnation would
get into trouble eventually.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.430
Hush. Stop it.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.430
Return to work.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.140
You can't even do such a simple task.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.500
Useless fools.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.990
(The trailers were lies!)

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.830
(I heard that Sky Fire
has fallen from grace.)

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.350
(They invested too much money
in the previous games.)

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.540
(And they didn't make enough
to cover the cost.)

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.099
(Give me a refund!)

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.724
(Refund!)

00:16:53.768 --> 00:16:54.860
Is Meng Chang dead?

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.590
Can't he even manage public opinion?

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.860
Tell him to give us a refund!

00:16:58.946 --> 00:16:59.860
Meng Chang said

00:16:59.968 --> 00:17:02.124
he tried suppressing it a few times,
but to no avail.

00:17:02.124 --> 00:17:03.350
No matter how high the budget is,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.850
they can't withstand spending like this.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.191
Moreover, the game was rushed out

00:17:06.546 --> 00:17:08.946
after the staff expansion
to meet the early launch deadline.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.630
Now that more and more players
have tried the game,

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.230
there's no way to suppress the news.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.430
Increase our budget.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:17.150
Tell everyone

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.580
to prepare for combat.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.990
Get the situation under control

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.280
no matter how much it'll cost us!

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.710
Get it under control!

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.990
Understood.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.980
(Fuhui)

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.300
Come in.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.190
Mr. Li, Sky Fire seeks to
apply for additional funding

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.870
for their game, Eternal Reincarnation.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.230
This is the cost estimation report.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.230
They want additional funding?

00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:06.230
I thought the game
was already completed.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.150
Indeed.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.670
It's precisely because
the game's current download numbers

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.880
have plummeted dramatically.

00:18:10.946 --> 00:18:13.270
So they wish to increase
the funding for promotional purposes.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.230
However,

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.870
online reviews of the game

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.670
have all been negative.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:18.990
Based on our observation,

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.060
this emerging trend

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.740
might affect Fuhui.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.740
Sky Fire...

00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:28.910
They did develop some excellent games

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.230
in the past few years.

00:18:32.213 --> 00:18:34.150
But they've invested
all of their resources

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.230
into marketing in recent years.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.230
Their so-called viral games

00:18:39.457 --> 00:18:41.550
were an attempt
to deceive themselves and the public.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.630
If this keeps up,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.910
the HQ might be affected.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.470
Understood, Mr. Li.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.470
I'll instruct the legal department

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.870
to prepare an announcement

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.857
and implement risk mitigation
measures in advance.

00:19:20.857 --> 00:19:22.260
Everyone, prepare for combat.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.910
For Eternal Reincarnation,

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.020
let's give it one more shot!

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.020
I'll only say this.

00:19:26.191 --> 00:19:27.235
For the sake of the company,

00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:28.990
only success is allowed!

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.740
Understood?

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.124
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.368
How are the online remarks?

00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:40.100
(They spent five years developing it?)

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.257
(More like ten days.)

00:19:41.257 --> 00:19:42.950
(I see their ads all the time
when I scroll my phone.)

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.150
(As a loyal fan of Sky Fire,)

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.710
(I'm truly disappointed.)

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.990
(It's not an issue with
the graphics and hardware.)

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.540
(It's the gameplay.)

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.500
Keep their remarks under control. Do it!

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.020
What's going on?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.390
Zhao,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.870
the online backlash against Sky Fire
is running high.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.820
I'm sure you know as well.
Can't keep them under control.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.020
Even so, you have to do it!

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.740
Why are you telling me all this?

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.150
We've been at it nonstop
for 24 hours straight.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.580
It's not like we get to determine

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.013
when we can keep them under control.

00:20:10.013 --> 00:20:11.710
And, the budget isn't enough.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.820
Stop talking about the budget.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.230
I've already given you plenty.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.260
Hand that to me.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.150
Must you drink coffee now?

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.710
Get to work!

00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:24.280
Don't even try to pick it up!

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.740
Zhao,

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.150
what's going on over there?

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.020
Everyone is highly emotional right now.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:31.300
I didn't hire you

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.300
to create excuses.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.591
I hired you to solve my issues.

00:20:33.613 --> 00:20:35.300
That's your job, you know?

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.060
I know it's my job,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.950
but I can't just

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:39.340
work for nothing.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.300
Fine.

00:20:42.746 --> 00:20:44.020
I'll tell Mr. Zhou about it.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.420

(Sky Fire Tower)

00:21:28.102 --> 00:21:29.870
It's been five days
since I last went home.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.470
My clothes stink.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.390
I think I've lost my sense of smell.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.470
It's fine even if it stinks.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540
Everyone stinks anyway.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.710
We've been doing this for 45 days.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.990
Even a corpse
would've decomposed by now.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.020
Chen, what's wrong?

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:10.740
Chen!

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.470
Chen, what's wrong?

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.950
Chen!

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:12.870
Call 120!

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.500
Chen, are you okay?

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.870
Chen, wake up!

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:16.630
Wake up!

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.470
Call the ambulance!

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.780
Chen!

00:22:19.791 --> 00:22:21.820
(Sky Fire)
We gave Meng Chang additional budget.

00:22:21.857 --> 00:22:23.950
They're trying their best
to manage the situation.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.810
The online haters are no big deal.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.635
But the thing is,
we've been losing players.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.500
And,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.710
no new players are joining the fray.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.820
Slowly!

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.740
Chen?

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.540
Are you okay?

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.150
What's wrong?

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.470
Do you feel better?

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:41.950
Did you forget about work?

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:42.910
Lend us a hand.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.260
We're on high alert.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.710
We're on high alert!

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.540
Has anyone ever considered

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.910
the company's interest at all?

00:22:48.991 --> 00:22:51.020
Just look at the state
Eternal Reincarnation is in.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.630
Have you guys ever considered that?

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.470
What the heck are you guys doing?

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.500
Work is still in session!

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.670
Are you playing over there?

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.630
Mr. Zhao, we've been working overtime
for the past 45 days.

00:22:58.635 --> 00:22:59.630
Chen is about to collapse!

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.191
If you can't withstand this, go home!

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.430
Chen,

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.390
how old are you?

00:23:04.813 --> 00:23:07.230
If you're that old, and you can't
withstand the workload,

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.813
you should go home as soon as possible.

00:23:08.857 --> 00:23:10.260
Why are you even here?

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.910
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhao,

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.710
I'm fine.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.710
I can do this.

00:23:17.835 --> 00:23:19.950
You have been
working overtime all this while.

00:23:20.013 --> 00:23:21.502
I'm sure it's been tough on you guys.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.102
I'm sure you have plenty of complaints.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.630
Let me tell you guys

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.300
what I think about my work.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.230
Some of you might say

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.540
that you've devoted a lot of time

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.990
and efforts

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.400
for the sake of the projects

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.450
and the company.

00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:40.020
I suppose you think
that it's been tough on you.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.470
But just look at me.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.990
- Mr. Zhou.
- Mr. Zhou.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.740
Look at Chen.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.150
He fainted just now.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.950
Just look at me.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.630
I, Zhou Muyan,

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.020
treated this company as my own home.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.020
I knew you guys didn't leave
for the past 45 days.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.950
I did the same

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.060
as you guys!

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.257
I pulled countless all-nighters,
just like you all!

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.910
Go and inspect my office if you like.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.470
The number of coffee and tea I took,

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.910
it was just as much as you all!

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.020
Trust me!

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.430
If any one of you

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.990
wants to leave Sky Fire,

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.630
scram right now!

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.540
Get lost!

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.740
I won't stop you!

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.857
If you leave,

00:24:40.857 --> 00:24:42.910
you'll starve to death on the streets!

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.150
Don't you know the situation out there?

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.580
Do you know
how many people out there are queuing

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.300
just to get a job?

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.430
We don't lack any of you!

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.740
You, you, you, get lost!

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.950
All of you should be like me.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.300
Every day, before you sleep,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.190
you should ask yourself

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.430
whether you've done your own part!

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.100
In my opinion,

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.580
all the work you've done

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.500
and all the efforts you've devoted,

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.150
all of those are just
a part of your duty.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.780
Do you know how many chances
the company has given you all?

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.780
Do you?

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.710
Chen, how did you think
you were able to afford a car?

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.910
Li, how did you think you were
able to afford your mortgage?

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.740
You guys shouldn't be

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.300
complaining about this!

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.020
You guys should be grateful!

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.870
You guys should be grateful to us!

Me too.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.670
He went overboard.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.020
To think that he blamed his employees...

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.020
Look, he was so harsh to them.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.780
He deserved to have a report
filed against him.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.150
He should be reported.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.580
I'll check it right now.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.540
Check them out.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.870
There's even a video.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:48.500
Really?

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.190
Come.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.780
Hurry.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.990
Come and take a look.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.100
(I, Zhou Muyan,)

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.340
(did the same as you guys!)

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.870
(I pulled countless all-nighters,)

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.470
(just like you all!)

00:26:57.502 --> 00:26:59.150
(Go and inspect my office if you like.)

00:26:59.257 --> 00:27:00.968
(The number of coffee and tea I took,)

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.230
(it was just as much as you all!)

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.500
(Chen!)

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.470
(Internal Leak: Firsthand Account)

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.235
(How did you think
you were able to afford a car?)

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.190
(Li, how did you think you were
able to afford your mortgage?)

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.780
(You guys shouldn't be)

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.740
(complaining about this!)

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.430
(You guys should be grateful!)

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.670
(You should be grateful to us!)

00:27:18.013 --> 00:27:19.820
An anonymous person
commented on the post.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.530
He said Sky Fire had made them
work overtime

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:22.870
for the past one and a half months.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.870
In the video, someone fainted
due to over-exhaustion.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.791
Right now, he's fine.

00:27:25.813 --> 00:27:27.630
But Zhou Muyan
didn't care for his well-being.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.540
He even said something like that.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.540
It'd caused widespread outrage.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.430
Oh my goodness! He went overboard.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.470
Who can tolerate that?

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.670
That's typical Zhou Muyan, you know?

00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:37.102
Sky Fire is at the top
of the trending topics.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.230
"Sky Fire corporate culture."

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.540
"Employees have no dignity."

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.780
"Undergraduates, do not join Sky Fire."

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.500
"Sky Fire, just close down."

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.020
Wei,

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.500
you've finally gotten your revenge.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.300
What are you talking about?

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.340
We're just employees.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.580
All these grudges don't matter.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.710
Yeah.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.020
But even employees like us
have our own dignity!

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.300
Precisely.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.230
I've actually worked at
several companies before

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.710
where workplace bullying occurred.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.540
This issue
should've been addressed long ago.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.746
A terrible company like Sky Fire
will be exposed eventually.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.300
It feels like

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.630
a storm is brewing.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.300
They're too much.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:24.710
What's going on?

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.300
This is ridiculous.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.300
Don't you think their boss is too shady?

00:28:32.191 --> 00:28:33.190
How could this happen?

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.190
Yeah. What's going on?

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.580
Who posted this video?

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:37.780
Does he know

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.580
how much money

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.100
the company and I have lost

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.100
because of his actions?

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.540
He must've lost his mind!

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.990
Find him

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.710
by hook or by crook!

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:48.820
I'm going to sue him

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.300
until he goes bankrupt!

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.630
What's with all
the secret filming these days?

00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:57.020
Why are you still standing there?

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.580
Do you think it's funny too?

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.060
Listen up!

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.780
Find him

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.580
at all costs!

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.780
Get lost!

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.950
Get lost if you can't find him!

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.790
What's with the horrible filming angle?

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.400
Darn it!

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.702
(Sky Fire, the Pit of Hell)
(Did you guys watch)

00:29:25.702 --> 00:29:26.390
(Talk, and You'll Lose Your Job)
(the video?)

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.710
(That was insane.)

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.950
(Listen,)

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.630
(now that the HQ
has received news of this,)

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.150
(they'll surely do something about it.)

00:29:34.435 --> 00:29:36.235
(I will finally have my revenge)

00:29:36.257 --> 00:29:38.100
(after working overtime for 45 days.)

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.580
(We're finally going to be free.)

00:29:46.213 --> 00:29:47.630
All of you, stop what you're doing!

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.780
Listen up.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.540
This is a warning.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.540
Do not post any detrimental remarks!

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.870
Take your phone with you

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.580
and come to my office in turn!

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.060
Did you guys not hear me?

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.340
Are you guys trying to rebel?

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.300
Was it you?

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.300
Was it you?

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.540
You all...

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.340
I'll definitely find out

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.340
who posted the video!

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.580
How dare you all rebel?

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.780
Hello?

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.470
Zhao, it's me.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.260
Meng Chang?

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.670
Now that it has come to this,

00:30:32.857 --> 00:30:34.910
we have no choice
but to part ways with you guys.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.146
I hope Mr. Zhou can understand.

00:30:36.168 --> 00:30:37.020
What?

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.980
(Fuhui)

00:30:59.020 --> 00:30:59.780
Mr. Li,

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.540
the situation with
Sky Fire's Eternal Reincarnation

00:31:02.813 --> 00:31:04.500
has completely spiraled out of control.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.300
There's no room for salvation.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.540
Call Zhou Muyan.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.100
Mr. Zhou,

00:31:16.502 --> 00:31:18.924
Meng Chang and his company
have parted ways with us.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.710
As for the video,

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.813
it's still at the top spot
for trending topics.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.390
The HQ said

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.813
that they saw the video as well.

00:31:25.857 --> 00:31:27.780
Fuhui's stock price
also hit the lower limit today.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.820
Hello?

00:31:41.013 --> 00:31:41.870
May I help you, Sir?

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.100
Understood.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.100
It's our boss.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.740
It's the chairman.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:07.780
Mr. Li,

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.340
sorry for the shock.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.710
What the heck

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.870
is Sky Fire doing?

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.820
Is that how you develop video games?

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.230
And, what's with the video?

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.300
You've utterly embarrassed Fuhui.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.190
And, the consequences are devastating.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:22.235
Do you think there's no one
to keep you in check...

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:26.990
That's

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:28.990
my phone...

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.060
(Fuhui)
(Lately,)

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.780
(affairs related to
Sky Fire under Fuhui have attracted)

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.500
(widespread public attention.)

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.910
(We apologize for
the negative impact)

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.820
(that it has brought upon society.)

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:47.990
(In the future,)

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.235
(Fuhui will place great importance)

00:32:49.257 --> 00:32:51.150
(on the physical and mental well-being
of our employees)

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:52.829
(and conducts through self-reflection,)

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.780
(and address the current
management's shortcomings.)

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.580
(At the same time,)

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.746
(we will embrace
innovation and authenticity.)

00:32:57.813 --> 00:32:59.190
(With authenticity as our core,)

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.946
(Fuhui)
(with quality as our guiding principle,)

00:33:00.968 --> 00:33:03.280
(we shall foster a happy environment
where every employee is family.)

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.629
(Announcement)
(Fuhui will continue to uphold)

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:05.480
(our core principles)

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.740
(and always be there for you all.)

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.860
(Fuhui Group)

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.020
Mr. Li Jr.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.990
Mr. Li Jr!

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.390
It's fine.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.300
Mr. Li is in a bad mood.

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.820
It won't take long.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.820
That's not it, Mr. Li Jr.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.780
Dad.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:35.780
I suppose

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.050
Sky Fire has gotten the company
into deep trouble, right?

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.540
It's like this.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.230
I have an idea.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:42.470
It'll definitely help you out.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.390
Tell me about it.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.020
(Tengda)

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.100
Bao, I finished it in one minute.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.870
You lost.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.470
This...

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.910
That doesn't count. I was lagging.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.870
Stop it.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.910
I found another new project.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.035
We must invest in it this time.

00:34:05.035 --> 00:34:07.150
Sometimes, Mr. Ma's preference
does leave me in awe.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.220
Please enlighten me.

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.310
This is the plan.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:15.540
Ruan Guangjian's original artwork
is truly exceptional.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.990
We should learn from him.

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:18.660
The color scheme is great as well.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:21.870
Ms. Xin.

00:34:23.324 --> 00:34:24.620
Have you watched the news?

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:25.220
What happened?

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.540
Fuhui and Sky Fire

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.700
have parted ways.

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:30.990
A new dawn is here.

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.700
Son,

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.990
I won't be picking you up today.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.310
Dad will pick you up.

00:34:34.946 --> 00:34:36.500
You haven't finished the previous batch

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.470
Mr. Pei bought for you?

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:39.470
Nope. He restocked it after that.

00:34:40.102 --> 00:34:40.750
Hi, Ms. Hailu.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:41.350
Ms. Hailu.

00:34:42.502 --> 00:34:43.500
Do you guys want some?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.670
We'll get reimbursed for it anyway.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.100
No thanks.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.180
Since he bought it for you,
you should keep it.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.350
Ms. Hailu.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:58.660
Ms. Hailu.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.700
(GM Office)

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.060
Mr. Pei,

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.350
Mr. Li Jr. is looking for you.

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.100
Impossible!

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.470
That's impossible!

00:35:16.835 --> 00:35:18.500
All of us know
the kind of person Li Shi is.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.350
Of course, he's up to no good.

00:35:20.368 --> 00:35:21.830
Now, he wants us to acquire Sky Fire?

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:22.990
I won't agree to it!

00:35:23.146 --> 00:35:24.220
What a brilliant plan.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.013
So, Fuhui is trying to use

00:35:26.013 --> 00:35:27.835
Sky Fire's current failure
to their advantage

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.660
and cast them away as a discarded pawn?

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.220
That's right.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.220
You guys are overthinking it here.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.620
Everything'll work out

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.830
as long as Mr. Pei is in charge.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.540
But if we acquire Sky Fire,

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.430
does that mean Zhou Muyan
will join us as well?

00:35:38.435 --> 00:35:39.500
It doesn't matter who joins us

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.302
as long as they don't
turn this into a rat race.

00:35:41.302 --> 00:35:42.257
I can't tolerate that.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.310
Lv, I agree with you.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:44.580
No one can tolerate them.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.540
Yang, we shouldn't
only challenge capitalism,

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.990
we should also seek to understand it.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.470
I lack manpower.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:51.829
I'm busy rewriting the scripts.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.700
I don't have time to read
all those online novels.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.830
With this, I can hire more manpower

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.120
to help me review the novels.

00:35:56.124 --> 00:35:57.540
I won't agree with this. No way.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.790
That's enough.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.700
Why get so agitated?

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.620
Why disagree?

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.524
Why recruit them?

00:36:01.546 --> 00:36:03.220
You can just post
a recruitment notice.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:03.700
No one...

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.257
We're going to acquire
Sky Fire anyway.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:09.350
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.413
Sky Fire has made

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.580
significant contributions
to Fuhui after all.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.220
Don't you agree?

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.430
But all gatherings must come to an end.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.350
Nothing lasts forever.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:19.990
Don't you agree?

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.830
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:23.100
what do you mean by that?

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.750
Mr. Zhou,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.790
I'm just relaying Dad's message to you.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.700
But Mr. Zhou,

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.580
I understand your feelings completely.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.140
After all, you guys have made

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.568
significant contributions to Fuhui.

00:36:34.568 --> 00:36:36.500
And, there's another path you can take.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.900
(Sky Fire)

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:47.700
Alright.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:49.100
Next,

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.620
I'll host this meeting.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:54.100
Mr. Pei is willing to acquire Sky Fire
on behalf of Tengda.

00:36:54.324 --> 00:36:56.620
He'll take over everything
that belongs to Sky Fire.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:58.430
Of course,

00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.470
that includes you as well.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.540
Pei Qian.

00:37:00.768 --> 00:37:02.700
You don't need
to take such a huge detour

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.350
just to humiliate me!

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.430
Listen up!

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.540
I quit!

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.680
In your current situation,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.968
you won't find a better choice.

00:37:08.991 --> 00:37:10.100
Tengda is able to offer you

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.750
the top salary in the industry.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.060
I'm a professional manager.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.310
Everything is negotiable.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.430
You're a professional indeed.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.220
What about me?

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.100
Zhao,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.660
I'm thirsty.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.700
Buy me a cup of coffee.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.300
(One Month Later)

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.390
Ms. Lin Wan.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.310
We renamed Sky Fire to Late Departure

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.100
in hopes that you all

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.124
could get used to Tengda's
slower working pace.

00:37:59.146 --> 00:37:59.990
We respected most of

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.180
the staff members' wishes

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.413
and allowed them to continue
working remotely from Xinyang.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.180
You all are willing to relocate

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.180
to Jinchuan just to work at our HQ.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:08.540
It's been tough on you all.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.140
- Not at all!
- Not at all!

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.830
All moving expenses

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.180
will be covered by Tengda.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.650
If you have any reimbursement claims,

00:38:14.657 --> 00:38:16.280
please send them
to the Finance Department.

00:38:16.324 --> 00:38:17.540
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.310
Ms. Lin Wan, we already have it easy.

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:21.310
It's not tough at all.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.220
Tengda hired so many helpers
just to help us move.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.020
We didn't even
need to move a single thing.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.390
You also provided us
with employee dormitories.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.020
And our unit has two bedrooms
and one hall each.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.060
Yeah. It's even larger than
the unit I used to rent.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.140
You can resume your work.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.950
Get used to it first.

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.310
- Okay.
- Thank you, Ms. Lin Wan.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.350
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.140
Let's go.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.180
This is great.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:45.060
(Late Departure Sdudio)

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.580
(Xu)

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.830
(What a fulfilling day.)

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.020
(Since it's still overtime,)

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.790
(let's take a sip of coffee first.)

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.100
(Moments, The Cyclist)
(Message delivered.)

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.870
(One more message available.)

00:39:09.635 --> 00:39:10.900
(Shrimp)
(Dinner at my workplace.)

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.390
(Supper will be provided after dinner.)

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.350
(There's even breakfast after supper.)

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.950
Once I'm done here,

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:27.390
shift the sticker to the other side

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.830
and change the filming angle.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.750
This way, no one can tell
it's the same cup.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.540
That's a brilliant idea.

00:39:32.568 --> 00:39:34.213
A cup of coffee is expensive nowadays.

00:39:34.257 --> 00:39:36.280
We can share one cup
to post on our Moments.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.580
This way, we can save some money.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.500
Yeah.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:41.580
Ms. Lin just liked my post.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.390
I told you already.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:47.140
I'm sure she didn't want us
to get off work.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.910
She just wanted to see
if we were working overtime at home.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.790
It's a bait-and-switch.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.180
It's the oldest trick in the book.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.660
Yeah.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.540
She'll sack anyone

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.830
who doesn't work overtime.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.060
I don't think Mr. Pei and Lin Wan

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.140
are like that.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.470
Anyway, all bosses like it
when their employees work overtime.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.990
Am I right?

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.620
Yeah.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.020
Why are the lights off?

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.950
The lights are already out?

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.870
Guys, sorry for the interruption.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.020
We sell coffee during the day
and alcohol at night.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.413
If you want to take pictures,
you can head to the cybercafe.

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:16.270
It's free.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.660
Thanks for the support.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.620
It's fine.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:19.620
This is great.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.280
We can take pictures
at two different venues

00:40:21.324 --> 00:40:22.180
for the price of one.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:23.660
Let's go.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.660
Let's go.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.350
Great idea.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.660
It does look pretty good.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.899
Alright. Let's head over there.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.500
You two won't need to spend
a single cent.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.580
Take pictures for tomorrow.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.020
Why didn't she like my post?

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.235
I don't know. Did you post it?

00:40:33.257 --> 00:40:34.100
Yeah, I did.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.280
I suppose she didn't see it.

00:40:35.324 --> 00:40:36.580
But I did work overtime.

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.390
Mr. Pei,

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.540
I've encountered some issues

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.180
while managing our personnel.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.750
May I seek your guidance?

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.910
They're still heavily influenced
by Sky Fire's work culture.

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:00.660
I feel like they're bots.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.100
I don't know what to do with them.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.702
I understand. I understand
their feelings completely.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.180
You see, it's not their fault.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.830
They're too used
to their previous company.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.310
The institutional management of Sky Fire

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.310
is extremely damaging to people.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:17.100
Yeah. If they work for a company
like that for a long time,

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.102
they'll start to doubt

00:41:18.102 --> 00:41:20.830
whether or not they deserve
to have a normal working environment,

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:22.870
a normal working pace,

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.790
and a normal life

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.580
after work.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.220
So,

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.350
we have to help them
get over that mental barrier.
