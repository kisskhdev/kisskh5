00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:10.778
=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 22=

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:22.093
You look so handsome.

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:24.412
You dance so well.

00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:26.733
Come dance.

00:01:36.453 --> 00:01:37.572
What the heck?

00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:38.932
What did he send?

00:01:43.013 --> 00:01:44.533
We're all set on our end, right?

00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:53.373
After all this buildup,

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:55.613
it's time to settle this.

00:02:42.692 --> 00:02:43.813
Little Qian.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.933
It's me, Si Yuanlong.
Little Qian, open up.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.692
I'm miserable.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.892
I feel like I got dumped.

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:02.053
Were you even in a relationship
to get dumped?

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:03.973
Why'd you have to bring that up?

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:05.732
Can't you at least try to comfort me?

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:11.533
I'm heading to bed first.

00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:16.493
If you cook me instant noodles,
I'll feel much better.

00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:18.213
Do I look that idle?

00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:20.292
You came at midnight
and expect me to cook for you?

00:03:21.373 --> 00:03:22.732
But you moved out of the dorm.

00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:24.253
Where else could I find you?

00:03:24.253 --> 00:03:25.973
How about I order delivery instead?

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.653
We'll get some food and drinks and chat.

00:03:45.213 --> 00:03:47.053
Are you cooking it or throwing it away?

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.056
Throwing it away.

00:03:49.253 --> 00:03:49.973
Cooking it.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.292
Your beef patties
are so meaty and flavorful.

00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:03.572
Give me another one.

00:04:07.612 --> 00:04:09.493
I'm a guest here.
Heat up another one for me.

00:04:09.852 --> 00:04:11.053
I have to do it myself?

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.612
Who are you packing that for?

00:04:16.492 --> 00:04:18.492
Just eat. Stop being nosy.

00:04:27.653 --> 00:04:28.732
I have to do it myself.

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:41.812
Morning, Master.

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:43.653
Morning.

00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:08.893
Bribing me?

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:11.612
Suppose so.

00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:13.172
What's up?

00:05:13.653 --> 00:05:15.852
I want to take a few days off
after the case wraps up.

00:05:17.732 --> 00:05:18.612
Absolutely not.

00:05:19.013 --> 00:05:19.973
We'll discuss it later.

00:05:43.252 --> 00:05:43.893
Dad.

00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:46.252
Why are you here?

00:05:46.453 --> 00:05:47.333
Mom's downstairs.

00:05:47.732 --> 00:05:48.693
Bring her up then.

00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:51.932
Hello?

00:05:52.932 --> 00:05:54.932
I'm here on a one-day business trip.

00:05:54.932 --> 00:05:55.973
I'm heading back tonight.

00:05:56.412 --> 00:05:58.333
Xiaoyu insisted on coming to your place.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:05:59.573
He said your place is fun.

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:01.653
Okay, got it.

00:06:02.732 --> 00:06:04.292
Stay safe out there.

00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:05.573
Sorry for the trouble.

00:06:06.412 --> 00:06:08.653
Don't talk nonsense. Okay.

00:06:13.252 --> 00:06:15.292
What did you tell your mom?

00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:17.812
Said it's fun here?

00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:19.292
Know what this place is?

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:21.812
This is where we solve crimes,
understand?

00:06:22.492 --> 00:06:23.893
No more nonsense from now on.

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:26.252
Do you hear me?

00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:29.412
Don't mention my gaming to my mom.

00:06:29.412 --> 00:06:31.052
She nags me just for being on my phone.

00:06:31.612 --> 00:06:33.213
You and your little tricks.

00:06:33.453 --> 00:06:35.653
You know I won't stop you
from gaming, huh?

00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:37.573
Cut down on gaming.

00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:39.852
Read more books. Got it?

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.653
It's not good for your health.

00:06:41.653 --> 00:06:43.653
Look how you're slouching again.

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:47.093
Any plan for later?

00:06:47.693 --> 00:06:48.533
Not going anywhere.

00:06:48.893 --> 00:06:50.333
What do you mean by that?

00:06:51.573 --> 00:06:52.412
Got work to do.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.172
What kind of work?

00:06:53.693 --> 00:06:54.904
Knowing parents' occupations.

00:06:57.013 --> 00:06:58.213
I knew it.

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:47.932
Wang Tong,

00:07:48.453 --> 00:07:49.453
go get Zhang for me.

00:07:49.453 --> 00:07:49.973
Okay.

00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:54.732
Lei.

00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:35.892
Well?

00:08:36.492 --> 00:08:37.173
Chief Xu.

00:08:37.772 --> 00:08:38.532
Captain Leng.

00:08:40.012 --> 00:08:42.453
So far we've found three fetal remains.

00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:45.532
These fetuses have fully formed faces

00:08:46.732 --> 00:08:47.772
with eyelids open

00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:49.693
and limbs fully developed.

00:08:50.053 --> 00:08:51.573
They measure about 26 cm in length

00:08:52.333 --> 00:08:53.532
and weigh about 1.5 kg.

00:08:53.892 --> 00:08:56.693
They were likely
over 28 weeks gestational age.

00:08:57.173 --> 00:08:59.652
Judging by tissue fluid evaporation
on the surface,

00:08:59.813 --> 00:09:02.053
they were extracted
from the womb recently.

00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:04.173
At most two or three days ago.

00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:06.053
At this late stage,

00:09:06.053 --> 00:09:07.093
likely induced abortions.

00:09:07.933 --> 00:09:09.372
All fetuses show abnormalities.

00:09:09.852 --> 00:09:11.093
Brain development deformities.

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:12.852
A back-alley clinic?

00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:14.093
Possibly.

00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:16.532
I've collected tissue samples
from the fetuses.

00:09:16.532 --> 00:09:19.093
I'll arrange for lab tests immediately
after returning

00:09:19.453 --> 00:09:22.252
to see if we can find the donors
of their sex chromosomes.

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.333
With such a public setting

00:09:31.453 --> 00:09:32.252
and so many people,

00:09:32.252 --> 00:09:33.492
the suspect was being bold.

00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:36.213
Judging by the situation,

00:09:36.213 --> 00:09:39.213
I suspect the news is already spreading
like wildfire online.

00:09:41.453 --> 00:09:42.933
Hello, Chief.

00:09:46.732 --> 00:09:47.453
Yes.

00:09:48.813 --> 00:09:49.492
Understood.

00:09:52.053 --> 00:09:54.453
The higher-ups are aware of this matter.

00:09:55.693 --> 00:09:56.333
Here's the plan.

00:09:56.892 --> 00:09:57.772
Categorize it first.

00:09:58.173 --> 00:09:59.132
And be meticulous.

00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:03.372
Nowadays,
anyone can spout nonsense online.

00:10:03.693 --> 00:10:05.293
Who knows what stories they'll make up?

00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:30.093
Surveillance shows
the body dumper is a male

00:10:30.093 --> 00:10:31.173
around 30 years old.

00:10:31.813 --> 00:10:33.532
He appears tall,

00:10:34.132 --> 00:10:35.293
roughly 190 cm.

00:10:35.372 --> 00:10:36.612
He has a slight out-toed gait.

00:10:37.252 --> 00:10:40.053
Then he got in a taxi.

00:10:44.732 --> 00:10:47.772
We've contacted the taxi company.

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:49.732
According to the driver,

00:10:50.732 --> 00:10:51.732
he had a northern accent.

00:10:52.372 --> 00:10:55.652
He was dropped off north
of Guoqing East Road subway station.

00:10:55.772 --> 00:10:57.173
Then he was off the grid.

00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:03.732
The DNA from the three fetuses

00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:05.772
comes from three distinct sets
of parents.

00:11:06.652 --> 00:11:08.492
Judging by fetal development,

00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:10.573
the fertilization times
were likely very close.

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:13.333
Women's ovulation periods
vary individually.

00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:15.652
Achieving such precise timing

00:11:16.173 --> 00:11:18.813
suggests usage
of ovulation-inducing drugs

00:11:19.093 --> 00:11:21.093
and artificial insemination.

00:11:22.693 --> 00:11:23.892
Illegal surrogacy?

00:11:24.093 --> 00:11:24.693
Right.

00:11:25.173 --> 00:11:28.532
Also, we extracted methamphetamine
from the fetuses' organs and blood.

00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:31.093
Meth?

00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:39.093
(No match)
Fingerprints are detected

00:11:39.093 --> 00:11:40.132
on the plastic wrapping.

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:41.053
After comparison,

00:11:41.852 --> 00:11:43.573
identity information remains unknown.

00:11:47.053 --> 00:11:50.732
Meth causes
fetal brain development deformities.

00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:55.573
The three surrogates
are either long-term drug users

00:11:56.252 --> 00:11:59.772
or ingested large quantities of drugs
within a short timeframe.

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:01.933
That doesn't make sense.

00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:05.813
Who'd hire drug users as surrogates?

00:12:08.173 --> 00:12:10.732
I checked long-term drug user records
in the system

00:12:11.213 --> 00:12:13.693
and found a DNA match
for one maternal source.

00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:14.453
(Wu Cuimiao's Info)

00:12:14.453 --> 00:12:15.892
Wu Cuimiao, female,

00:12:16.612 --> 00:12:17.573
26 years old,

00:12:17.732 --> 00:12:18.573
from Qianzhou.

00:12:18.732 --> 00:12:21.772
She has been repeatedly penalized
for prostitution and drug use.

00:12:30.492 --> 00:12:31.293
Master.

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:49.053
Ye Qian.

00:12:52.652 --> 00:12:53.413
Thank you, Master.

00:12:53.413 --> 00:12:54.213
Be careful.

00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:55.612
Rest assured.

00:13:52.252 --> 00:13:52.813
Boss.

00:14:01.693 --> 00:14:02.413
Boss.

00:14:06.573 --> 00:14:07.492
Don't worry, boss.

00:14:07.612 --> 00:14:08.892
We've swept the entire area.

00:14:08.892 --> 00:14:09.693
All clear.

00:15:25.852 --> 00:15:26.652
We're here.

00:15:32.772 --> 00:15:33.453
After you.

00:15:48.132 --> 00:15:49.132
Nice place.

00:15:49.813 --> 00:15:51.372
Thanks to Officer Ye's arrangements.

00:15:58.012 --> 00:16:00.293
Are you planning to cook on-site?

00:16:00.852 --> 00:16:03.413
Can you guarantee quality?

00:16:03.532 --> 00:16:04.652
Don't worry, Mr. Bao.

00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:09.573
All southwest products
previously passed through my hands.

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:11.093
Terrific.

00:16:12.573 --> 00:16:13.372
Can't wait.

00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:20.372
You need to add another two percent
to the agreed price.

00:16:21.012 --> 00:16:21.852
Two percent?

00:16:25.012 --> 00:16:25.813
Mr. Zhang,

00:16:26.612 --> 00:16:28.933
Monkey's now on police radar.

00:16:29.813 --> 00:16:32.732
Without his insurance,
he won't dare flip easily.

00:16:33.532 --> 00:16:35.252
It makes him much easier
for you to control.

00:16:36.492 --> 00:16:37.453
So

00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:47.173
I want ten percent.

00:16:47.933 --> 00:16:48.772
What do you think?

00:17:11.453 --> 00:17:12.893
Twenty percent works too.

00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:17.893
Meeting you, Officer Ye,

00:17:18.373 --> 00:17:19.173
is worth it.

00:17:20.133 --> 00:17:21.973
Let's communicate and exchange more.

00:17:22.853 --> 00:17:24.012
It depends on your actions.

00:18:07.532 --> 00:18:09.973
I haven't been called Mr. Zhang in ages.

00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:14.893
I'm not used
to these underworld nicknames.

00:18:15.532 --> 00:18:16.453
You don't mind, do you?

00:18:18.613 --> 00:18:21.092
I know what caliber
you operate at, Officer Ye.

00:18:24.973 --> 00:18:27.092
Mixing with Huo's gang

00:18:27.092 --> 00:18:30.052
is somewhat beneath your talents.

00:18:30.572 --> 00:18:32.532
Is that how you view your partners?

00:18:35.613 --> 00:18:37.732
It's the synthetic drug era.

00:18:37.772 --> 00:18:39.492
It was never their forte anyway.

00:18:41.052 --> 00:18:42.052
If the price suits,

00:18:42.052 --> 00:18:43.256
we can replace them anytime.

00:18:47.613 --> 00:18:52.252
What matters are the resources
and channels you provide.

00:18:53.092 --> 00:18:54.532
This is the most valuable thing.

00:18:54.532 --> 00:18:55.252
I know.

00:18:56.853 --> 00:18:57.853
So blunt?

00:18:58.613 --> 00:19:00.332
Not afraid I'll jack up the price again?

00:19:06.092 --> 00:19:06.853
No.

00:19:09.012 --> 00:19:10.973
It shows you really want
to do business with me.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.693
(Yunxi Police)

00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:36.373
Alright, you look good enough.

00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:40.052
Stop preening and put it away.

00:19:42.693 --> 00:19:43.893
So you're Wu Cuimiao?

00:19:44.252 --> 00:19:45.812
Do you know why we called you in?

00:19:46.012 --> 00:19:46.853
No.

00:19:47.893 --> 00:19:49.853
You're a regular at the police station.

00:19:50.012 --> 00:19:51.092
Any idea why?

00:19:51.373 --> 00:19:52.252
You know what?

00:19:52.772 --> 00:19:55.532
This is actually my first time
at the city police department.

00:19:55.693 --> 00:19:56.693
Watch your attitude.

00:19:59.853 --> 00:20:00.973
Put it away. Hurry.

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:02.252
Fine.

00:20:02.572 --> 00:20:04.332
Cooperate? Sure, I will.

00:20:05.812 --> 00:20:08.693
I haven't done anything wrong lately.

00:20:08.772 --> 00:20:10.492
I've been staying home, behaving myself.

00:20:11.012 --> 00:20:12.052
Listen to me.

00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:14.693
Surrogacy is illegal in our country.

00:20:14.973 --> 00:20:17.732
All the income you received is illegal.

00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:18.893
Wait.

00:20:20.732 --> 00:20:23.532
You're not going
to take it all back, are you?

00:20:24.613 --> 00:20:25.893
There really wasn't much.

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:28.173
They haven't even paid
the final installment yet.

00:20:28.292 --> 00:20:30.373
Oh my god, what a loss.

00:20:31.693 --> 00:20:32.973
Why didn't they pay it?

00:20:33.252 --> 00:20:34.933
They said the baby was deformed,

00:20:35.173 --> 00:20:36.173
so they couldn't keep it.

00:20:37.252 --> 00:20:38.693
Just decided not to take it.

00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:40.532
How heartless is that?

00:20:42.693 --> 00:20:45.213
I didn't mean to.

00:20:45.772 --> 00:20:47.052
Just couldn't resist.

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:50.693
Tell us everything about your surrogacy.

00:20:51.332 --> 00:20:52.572
This job

00:20:53.012 --> 00:20:56.413
was introduced by a girl I met
when I sold my eggs before.

00:20:56.572 --> 00:20:58.732
I was a bit short on cash at the time.

00:20:59.572 --> 00:21:00.453
What agency?

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:01.453
Where was it located?

00:21:02.653 --> 00:21:04.492
I really don't know its name.

00:21:04.933 --> 00:21:07.052
Anyway, after I agreed,

00:21:07.092 --> 00:21:08.613
someone contacted me.

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:12.252
It was at a private clinic in a resort

00:21:12.252 --> 00:21:13.332
in the western suburbs.

00:21:13.532 --> 00:21:14.492
What resort?

00:21:16.572 --> 00:21:19.092
I really forgot what it was called.

00:21:21.532 --> 00:21:23.133
There was an archway at the main gate.

00:21:23.973 --> 00:21:25.572
Then where did you get the drugs?

00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:29.133
What?

00:21:30.812 --> 00:21:32.133
Playing dumb again?

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:34.893
Answer the question.

00:21:37.092 --> 00:21:38.572
After the embryo transfer was done,

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:42.373
they arranged for us all
to stay at the resort.

00:21:42.373 --> 00:21:44.213
Nothing to do all day.

00:21:44.213 --> 00:21:45.653
Just eating and drinking.

00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:46.853
Could go online,

00:21:46.853 --> 00:21:47.973
but weren't allowed to go.

00:21:48.332 --> 00:21:50.252
It was so boring.

00:21:50.933 --> 00:21:53.173
Liu, who looked after us,
got us some stuff.

00:21:53.732 --> 00:21:54.693
What about the others?

00:21:55.693 --> 00:21:56.653
What others?

00:21:56.653 --> 00:21:59.453
The other two whose pregnancies
were terminated for the same reason.

00:21:59.893 --> 00:22:00.772
Listen to me.

00:22:01.052 --> 00:22:03.292
If you were the one
who provided them with the drugs...

00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:04.052
No, no, no.

00:22:04.693 --> 00:22:06.373
Theirs had nothing to do with me.

00:22:06.653 --> 00:22:08.092
Liu gave it to them.

00:22:08.732 --> 00:22:10.332
Liu? His full name.

00:22:11.572 --> 00:22:12.373
Liu Yong.

00:22:17.693 --> 00:22:18.492
Is this him?

00:22:20.332 --> 00:22:21.572
His address and number.

00:22:23.973 --> 00:22:25.933
He was just the driver

00:22:25.933 --> 00:22:28.012
and looked after our daily needs.

00:22:28.012 --> 00:22:29.732
He stayed with us at the resort.

00:22:30.052 --> 00:22:31.532
Nobody calls nowadays.

00:22:33.572 --> 00:22:34.732
He does have WeChat.

00:22:39.173 --> 00:22:39.893
What?

00:22:39.893 --> 00:22:40.693
WeChat.

00:22:42.772 --> 00:22:43.572
WeChat.

00:22:49.213 --> 00:22:52.052
Egg retrieval and surrogacy
are both quite risky.

00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:54.332
You're pretty bold.

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:55.693
Not afraid something might happen?

00:22:57.453 --> 00:22:59.052
Lots of people do this.

00:22:59.052 --> 00:22:59.853
What's the big deal?

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:01.693
Haven't seen anyone get into trouble.

00:23:02.893 --> 00:23:04.373
Arrange a urine test for her.

00:23:04.492 --> 00:23:05.173
Yes.

00:23:05.173 --> 00:23:07.092
Wait, that's unnecessary.

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:08.373
Come on, bro.

00:23:08.572 --> 00:23:09.572
What 'bro'?

00:23:09.572 --> 00:23:11.092
You had your chance to confess.

00:23:11.092 --> 00:23:12.453
Leniency for confession.

00:23:12.453 --> 00:23:13.973
You've been resisting the whole time.

00:23:13.973 --> 00:23:16.173
I... I did say it.

00:23:16.252 --> 00:23:17.012
Say what?

00:23:17.012 --> 00:23:18.252
None of it made any sense.

00:23:18.252 --> 00:23:18.772
Do the test.

00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.292
I've said everything I need to.

00:23:20.413 --> 00:23:21.413
Enough. Sit down.

00:23:34.296 --> 00:23:36.120
(Yunxi Western International
Tourism Resort)

00:23:41.976 --> 00:23:48.566
(West Suburb People's Clinic)

00:23:56.052 --> 00:23:56.693
Captain Leng,

00:23:57.208 --> 00:23:59.332
this is the person
in charge of this private clinic.

00:23:59.332 --> 00:24:01.413
He's admitted
to running the surrogacy business.

00:24:01.413 --> 00:24:02.572
Still haven't found Liu Yong.

00:24:03.373 --> 00:24:04.772
Is Liu Yong your employee?

00:24:06.413 --> 00:24:07.532
I've always treated

00:24:08.092 --> 00:24:09.252
Liu Yong well.

00:24:09.332 --> 00:24:10.572
And he stabs me in the back?

00:24:10.933 --> 00:24:12.613
I've been in this business for years.

00:24:12.772 --> 00:24:13.812
My success rate is high.

00:24:14.492 --> 00:24:16.213
No client has ever been dissatisfied.

00:24:16.373 --> 00:24:18.133
My good reputation
is ruined because of him.

00:24:18.693 --> 00:24:22.092
You do know surrogacy is illegal, right?

00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:26.173
Tell us in detail about Liu Yong.

00:24:26.853 --> 00:24:30.012
He's just a distant relative of mine.

00:24:30.092 --> 00:24:32.133
No education, no decent skills.

00:24:32.373 --> 00:24:33.693
If he weren't family,

00:24:33.693 --> 00:24:34.893
I wouldn't have hired him.

00:24:36.332 --> 00:24:37.292
Now,

00:24:38.653 --> 00:24:40.292
besides being a driver,

00:24:40.413 --> 00:24:43.292
he just does odd jobs and errands.

00:24:43.973 --> 00:24:45.292
An ungrateful wolf.

00:24:46.613 --> 00:24:48.173
Does Liu Yong do drugs?

00:24:48.933 --> 00:24:49.572
He...

00:24:49.973 --> 00:24:52.893
H-He used to... used to...

00:24:52.893 --> 00:24:55.413
But now... now he says
he quit a long time ago.

00:24:55.893 --> 00:24:57.492
No, not anymore.

00:25:01.613 --> 00:25:02.332
Liu Yong!

00:25:03.413 --> 00:25:04.252
Stop right there!

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:21.853
Keep running.

00:25:28.572 --> 00:25:29.413
Why did you run?

00:25:30.492 --> 00:25:31.772
Scared now?

00:25:32.653 --> 00:25:34.292
Why did you give drugs
to pregnant women?

00:25:35.812 --> 00:25:37.012
I admit to doing meth.

00:25:37.332 --> 00:25:40.653
But I didn't give it to those women.
It was Wu Cuimiao.

00:25:41.133 --> 00:25:43.532
Once she caught me sneaking a hit.

00:25:43.853 --> 00:25:44.933
She asked me for some.

00:25:45.173 --> 00:25:46.213
So you gave it to her?

00:25:46.213 --> 00:25:47.252
Of course I didn't.

00:25:47.252 --> 00:25:48.373
I paid for it myself.

00:25:48.373 --> 00:25:49.572
Why should I give it to her?

00:25:50.292 --> 00:25:52.732
Besides, she was pregnant.

00:25:52.893 --> 00:25:54.613
I'm not that much of a scumbag.

00:25:54.893 --> 00:25:56.373
She pestered me several times.

00:25:56.453 --> 00:25:57.532
I ignored her.

00:25:57.933 --> 00:25:59.572
Then when I was out
working for the boss,

00:25:59.572 --> 00:26:01.693
she went into my room
and took my entire stash.

00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:05.012
I only found out
when I went looking for her.

00:26:07.973 --> 00:26:09.332
Why did you go to City Square?

00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:16.332
Because of that matter,
my boss said he'd fire me,

00:26:16.332 --> 00:26:18.252
and all the losses
would be pinned on me.

00:26:18.252 --> 00:26:19.292
This is not fair.

00:26:19.613 --> 00:26:21.292
He never treated me well anyway.

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:22.973
He makes so much money

00:26:22.973 --> 00:26:24.413
and pays me peanuts.

00:26:24.413 --> 00:26:25.973
And he always orders me around.

00:26:26.613 --> 00:26:29.572
I got mad and thought
I'd just blow the whole thing wide open.

00:26:30.052 --> 00:26:31.933
His money isn't clean anyway.

00:26:31.973 --> 00:26:33.292
I'd expose him to the light.

00:26:37.812 --> 00:26:42.532
Did you tell Liu Yong
to dispose of the fetuses?

00:26:45.492 --> 00:26:46.613
I arranged abortions

00:26:46.613 --> 00:26:48.292
as soon as I realized
something was wrong.

00:26:48.732 --> 00:26:49.973
Three of them.

00:26:50.292 --> 00:26:52.772
A whole year's profit
won't cover the compensation.

00:26:53.173 --> 00:26:55.332
Afterwards, I even asked him
if he'd given them drugs.

00:26:55.332 --> 00:26:56.812
He wouldn't admit it.

00:26:56.812 --> 00:26:59.732
I told him to find a deserted place
to bury them.

00:26:59.732 --> 00:27:00.613
And what did he do?

00:27:00.973 --> 00:27:02.732
This is pure retaliation.

00:27:03.572 --> 00:27:05.213
Why would Liu Yong
retaliate against you?

00:27:05.492 --> 00:27:07.173
He thinks he's underpaid and overworked.

00:27:08.133 --> 00:27:09.933
He never considers his own worth.

00:27:12.133 --> 00:27:15.373
Also, I might have scolded him that day

00:27:15.373 --> 00:27:17.012
and... and hit him.

00:27:19.052 --> 00:27:21.092
Coward, won't own up to what he did.

00:27:21.772 --> 00:27:22.613
Regret it?

00:27:24.052 --> 00:27:26.853
You should regret running
an illegal business, understand?

00:27:27.973 --> 00:27:28.613
Understand?

00:27:33.812 --> 00:27:36.893
We learned from several surrogates

00:27:37.853 --> 00:27:40.133
that you stole Liu Yong's drugs, right?

00:27:41.453 --> 00:27:45.292
And you encouraged them to take drugs,

00:27:45.373 --> 00:27:47.092
claiming it would excite
and energize them.

00:27:48.252 --> 00:27:49.492
Why did you do that?

00:27:51.613 --> 00:27:52.772
For fun.

00:27:54.812 --> 00:27:56.133
You know what they say?

00:27:57.332 --> 00:28:00.572
Having fun alone is boring anyway.

00:28:00.653 --> 00:28:02.373
Might as well have fun together.

00:28:03.653 --> 00:28:05.933
Do you realize the nature of that?

00:28:07.012 --> 00:28:07.973
Being helpful?

00:28:10.332 --> 00:28:11.413
What is this attitude?

00:28:11.973 --> 00:28:13.373
Fix your attitude.

00:28:13.532 --> 00:28:14.732
You broke the law.

00:28:14.732 --> 00:28:16.012
It's a crime, understand?

00:28:16.012 --> 00:28:17.613
But nothing happened, did it?

00:28:19.252 --> 00:28:22.292
Besides, why blame only me?

00:28:23.012 --> 00:28:25.532
It's their own fault
for being ignorant and weak-willed.

00:28:26.252 --> 00:28:30.292
You're endangering yourself and others
with this attitude and lifestyle.

00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:31.213
Do you understand?

00:28:34.693 --> 00:28:36.373
I take it one day at a time.

00:28:37.292 --> 00:28:38.532
That's just how I like to live.

00:28:38.772 --> 00:28:40.012
It's none of your business.

00:28:44.728 --> 00:28:46.973
(No-Name Diner)

00:28:46.973 --> 00:28:47.653
Qiming,

00:28:48.092 --> 00:28:50.532
the Narcotics Division acted
on Liu Yong's confession

00:28:50.532 --> 00:28:52.812
and located his drug supplier.

00:28:54.133 --> 00:28:55.052
After verification,

00:28:55.772 --> 00:28:58.213
that person is a key figure
in Bao Hei's gang.

00:28:58.693 --> 00:29:01.812
Since Liu Yong and he
were former drug buddies,

00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:05.492
he didn't stay guarded around Liu Yong.

00:29:05.653 --> 00:29:06.653
Moreover,

00:29:06.653 --> 00:29:09.693
the Narcotics Division
couldn't identify him previously.

00:29:09.693 --> 00:29:13.732
Unexpectedly, our case
uncovered his background.

00:29:13.893 --> 00:29:16.613
With the key clues from our case,

00:29:16.853 --> 00:29:20.572
dismantling Bao Hei's gang
can happen sooner.

00:29:20.572 --> 00:29:21.173
That's good.

00:29:21.653 --> 00:29:23.012
Alright, go eat.

00:29:56.772 --> 00:29:57.933
Guess what he said?

00:29:59.413 --> 00:30:00.812
I can guess some of it.

00:30:02.613 --> 00:30:03.693
What are our plans next?

00:30:04.492 --> 00:30:05.453
Deliver the goods first

00:30:05.772 --> 00:30:06.893
and get the money.

00:30:08.693 --> 00:30:10.252
How long will the delivery take?

00:30:10.453 --> 00:30:11.252
When it's time...

00:30:11.453 --> 00:30:12.732
Don't worry about the details.

00:30:13.292 --> 00:30:14.853
I'll notify you when it's nearly done.

Here, try this.

00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:13.812
I just made these.

00:33:15.252 --> 00:33:17.492
When the knife cuts in,
the oil sizzles out.

00:33:17.492 --> 00:33:18.213
Yeah.

00:33:27.332 --> 00:33:28.332
Tastes pretty good.

00:33:28.492 --> 00:33:30.092
It's alright, I guess.

00:33:30.973 --> 00:33:31.812
You know what?

00:33:31.812 --> 00:33:35.012
If we wait a few more days
for the saltiness to soak in,

00:33:35.052 --> 00:33:37.332
- the flavor'll be amazing, I swear.
- Indeed.

00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:39.332
A bit bland. Just slightly undersalted.

00:33:39.812 --> 00:33:40.613
Not bad.

00:33:40.893 --> 00:33:41.893
Go ahead and eat.

00:33:42.173 --> 00:33:43.012
No.

00:33:45.693 --> 00:33:46.492
Well?

00:33:46.732 --> 00:33:48.453
How's your dad's health lately?

00:33:50.012 --> 00:33:52.613
His health's about the same.

00:33:53.252 --> 00:33:55.373
If you face any difficulties,
just tell us.

00:33:58.252 --> 00:33:59.772
The nurse mentioned to me

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:05.613
that your wife often brings my dad
homemade food.

00:34:07.532 --> 00:34:08.333
Thanks.

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.612
No need to be polite with me.

00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:13.212
An elder at home is like a treasure.

00:34:13.612 --> 00:34:16.293
We should take good care
of such a treasure.

00:34:16.293 --> 00:34:16.933
Don't you agree?

00:34:16.933 --> 00:34:17.572
Yes.

00:34:17.853 --> 00:34:18.973
It's our blessing.

00:34:21.853 --> 00:34:22.933
Alright, you eat.

00:34:23.212 --> 00:34:24.012
I'm back to work.

00:34:24.012 --> 00:34:24.532
Okay.

00:34:39.373 --> 00:34:41.492
Ten, eleven.

00:34:41.492 --> 00:34:42.893
Why suddenly use this?

00:34:42.893 --> 00:34:43.652
Twelve.

00:34:44.492 --> 00:34:45.413
To exercise.

00:34:46.933 --> 00:34:48.373
I never see you work out normally.

00:34:50.012 --> 00:34:51.893
Well, nobody runs with me anymore.

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:55.973
You need company to run?

00:34:57.933 --> 00:34:59.012
I'm serious.

00:34:59.492 --> 00:35:00.532
You've moved out,

00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:01.813
and I get really bored alone.

00:35:02.092 --> 00:35:04.333
That's why I came early
to exercise at the office.

00:35:20.853 --> 00:35:21.773
Get to the point.

00:35:23.692 --> 00:35:24.853
Forget it, never mind.

00:35:25.413 --> 00:35:27.172
You can't talk about your girlfriend

00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:28.692
or your confidential mission.

00:35:29.092 --> 00:35:31.973
Living like this every day
must exhaust you.

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.333
Honestly, I envy you sometimes.

00:35:38.652 --> 00:35:41.692
I wish I could be unburdened like you

00:35:41.813 --> 00:35:43.092
and live lightly and openly,

00:35:43.773 --> 00:35:44.973
so carefree.

00:35:47.012 --> 00:35:48.293
Actually, sometimes

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:51.492
it's just a split-second decision.

00:35:51.572 --> 00:35:54.813
Once you figure it out,
you can live freely.

00:35:57.132 --> 00:35:59.092
That was unexpectedly profound.

00:35:59.453 --> 00:36:01.572
Of course, I mean it sincerely.

00:36:06.212 --> 00:36:07.532
Hope that day comes.

00:36:08.253 --> 00:36:09.492
It definitely will come.

00:36:09.492 --> 00:36:11.492
I'll always be here
when you need me, bro.

00:36:11.733 --> 00:36:13.893
Just don't stick around
when I don't need you.

00:36:14.853 --> 00:36:15.492
Bye.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:31.288
(Rose Garden Hotel)

00:37:14.172 --> 00:37:15.612
The victim is Mai Qianqian.

00:37:15.612 --> 00:37:17.532
Female, 49 years old, from Yushan.

00:37:17.853 --> 00:37:19.293
She checked in yesterday afternoon.

00:37:19.572 --> 00:37:22.333
The preliminary COD
is blunt force head trauma.

00:37:24.652 --> 00:37:29.532
Time of death
was around 2 to 3 AM last night.

00:37:30.052 --> 00:37:32.413
This matches
what the neighboring guest reported.

00:37:33.052 --> 00:37:34.132
The neighboring guest

00:37:34.132 --> 00:37:38.012
said they heard arguing and fighting
in Room 601 last night.

00:37:38.492 --> 00:37:40.492
So they complained to the front desk.

00:37:41.132 --> 00:37:44.092
The front desk
then called Room 601 to check.

00:37:44.293 --> 00:37:45.813
But a man answered the phone,

00:37:46.172 --> 00:37:47.893
claiming it's a couple's fight.

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:49.413
Then all noise stopped.

00:37:50.052 --> 00:37:52.492
Housekeeping came to clean this morning.

00:37:52.492 --> 00:37:54.532
Only then did they find
the victim was dead.

00:37:56.813 --> 00:37:58.692
There are signs of a struggle
at the scene.

00:37:59.293 --> 00:38:01.212
Based on the size of these wounds,

00:38:01.532 --> 00:38:05.373
the ashtray is most likely
the murder weapon.

00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:08.652
But hotels by the train station

00:38:08.652 --> 00:38:09.773
are all about traffic.

00:38:10.132 --> 00:38:12.092
The cleaning is basically just for show.

00:38:13.012 --> 00:38:14.413
Could be multiple sets of prints.

00:38:16.973 --> 00:38:19.453
But if the suspect
answered the phone call,

00:38:21.612 --> 00:38:22.973
it should have his fingerprints.

00:38:23.413 --> 00:38:24.773
We might even extract DNA.

00:38:24.853 --> 00:38:26.612
This hotel is quite irresponsible.

00:38:27.253 --> 00:38:31.012
Why didn't they come up to check
when there was arguing and fighting?

00:38:31.532 --> 00:38:33.293
For fighting in the middle of the night,

00:38:34.092 --> 00:38:35.773
if it's strangers, that's one thing.

00:38:35.773 --> 00:38:36.773
But if it's a couple,

00:38:36.773 --> 00:38:38.373
people might not want to get involved.

00:38:38.373 --> 00:38:41.333
Even the local police
avoid such trouble.

00:38:41.733 --> 00:38:43.652
Often, you arrest the man,

00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:46.052
and the woman shows up
demanding his release.

00:38:46.052 --> 00:38:46.973
It's not worth it.

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:48.492
Ziwu,

00:38:48.773 --> 00:38:50.492
what's that under the victim's neck?

00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:00.413
A blood clot.

00:39:04.052 --> 00:39:07.532
The suspect likely
struck the victim's head twice.

00:39:07.773 --> 00:39:10.692
The first blow
didn't cause immediate death.

00:39:12.052 --> 00:39:14.813
There was likely a time gap
between the two blows.

00:39:16.212 --> 00:39:17.893
The interval was about...

00:39:20.172 --> 00:39:21.132
twenty minutes.

00:39:21.853 --> 00:39:24.373
Twenty minutes
is enough time to do a lot.

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:27.933
The victim's ID and documents
were still in her bag.

00:39:27.933 --> 00:39:28.933
And bank cards too.

00:39:28.973 --> 00:39:30.092
Plus a fair amount of cash.

00:39:32.973 --> 00:39:34.293
The victim's clothes were intact.

00:39:35.132 --> 00:39:36.492
No signs of sexual assault.

00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:38.853
Hard to say.

00:39:39.012 --> 00:39:42.532
The hotel front desk
registered her with no companion.

00:39:43.052 --> 00:39:45.413
But the hotel can't stop guests
from bringing people in.

00:39:46.212 --> 00:39:49.813
We currently can't ID the man
who answered the phone call.

00:39:50.132 --> 00:39:53.012
We've requested
the hotel's surveillance footage.

00:39:53.652 --> 00:39:55.893
But this building is very old.

00:39:56.012 --> 00:39:59.453
Cameras are only in the lobby,
front door, and elevators on each floor.

00:39:59.453 --> 00:40:01.293
So the investigation
faces some difficulty.

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:02.572
Also,

00:40:03.212 --> 00:40:05.453
the victim's phone is missing.

00:40:05.532 --> 00:40:07.333
It might have been taken by the suspect.

00:40:07.893 --> 00:40:11.293
I'm collecting biological evidence
from under the victim's fingernails.

00:40:12.733 --> 00:40:16.293
Since they fought,
we should find the suspect's tissue.

00:41:46.973 --> 00:41:47.572
Long.

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:48.293
Ziwu.

00:41:48.293 --> 00:41:50.172
Did you verify
the victim's fingerprints?

00:41:51.132 --> 00:41:53.413
By testing the victim's blood sample,

00:41:53.572 --> 00:41:55.612
DNA shows she had a criminal record

00:41:56.172 --> 00:41:58.692
and was a fugitive wanted by the police.

00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:00.092
The victim?

00:42:01.973 --> 00:42:03.492
On my end,

00:42:04.172 --> 00:42:07.092
(Liu Jianyuan's Info)
fingerprints from the ashtray and phone

00:42:07.092 --> 00:42:07.893
are in the system.

00:42:07.893 --> 00:42:09.893
But that's a man named Liu Jianyuan.

00:42:10.572 --> 00:42:11.733
Back in 2011,

00:42:11.733 --> 00:42:15.132
for robbery and assault, he was
sentenced to six years, eight months.

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:16.853
He's now a fugitive.

00:42:17.172 --> 00:42:21.492
A woman named Liu Min
was his accomplice.

00:42:21.853 --> 00:42:22.652
Liu Min?

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:26.773
The victim's DNA confirms
she is Liu Min.

00:42:28.572 --> 00:42:32.692
So the ID used at the hotel
was either fake or stolen.

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:38.132
Is Liu Jianyuan's DNA
among the evidence from the scene?

00:42:38.413 --> 00:42:39.853
If it is...

00:42:39.853 --> 00:42:42.733
The test results
from the fingernail scrapings are in.

00:42:43.052 --> 00:42:43.973
It's Liu Jianyuan.
