00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.540
Whatever kind of person I am,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.290
that's what the Prince of Duan's daughter is.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.170
You don't get to judge.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.410
Today,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.180
I'll purge the traitor for Prince of Duan!

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.060
What a loyal subordinate,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.980
to murder his lord's sole surviving daughter.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.340
Would you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.850
have his line end with me?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.850
I shouldn't have trusted you.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.740
To think you would

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.420
give up your title as the county princess

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.210
to seek revenge with me.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.420
I have been

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.900
way too foolish.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.770
You are indeed foolish.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.650
On the day I hosted the banquet to kill the Right Chancellor,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.340
the Imperial Guards surrounded my mansion.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.810
Did you truly believe

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.090
your safe escape

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.020
was solely the work of your patron?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.140
After that, the murders in the palace

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.530
and the nursery rhyme in the Western Capital...

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.180
You charged ahead,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.970
while he schemed in the shadows.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.970
You thought

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.810
he was plotting the great cause with you,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.770
but have you ever wondered

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.530
why he chose you, of all people?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.420
Because we both wanted Cui Minzhong dead,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.340
and I

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.740
happened to be the sharpest blade he could wield.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.420
With such formidable power,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.900
what kind of blade couldn't he find?

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.140
It's only because I chose you.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.140
He only valued

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.060
your status as my father's former subordinate.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.620
If the plan succeeds,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.320
you will be eliminated

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.530
because you know too much.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.250
If it fails,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.770
you will be the perfect scapegoat.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.090
Do not fabricate lies out of thin air.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.910
Haven't you realized

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.340
that he has abandoned you?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.280
Do you think assassinating Consort Shu

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.530
is some act of righteousness?

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.580
It is just the perfect way

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.530
to pin all the blame

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.930
on you.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.770
Would he care about my grievance over the loss

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.650
or your suffering from injustice?

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.140
It's nothing but a chess game to take down the Cui family.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.810
On the chessboard,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.650
everyone is a pawn.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.530
I can't kill Consort Shu,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.690
nor can I bear to kill you.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.580
As long as he remains,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.970
revenge can still be achieved.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.810
Then why don't we make a bet?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.370
He must have promised

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.210
to escort you out

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.490
once the job is done.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.420
Then let's see

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.250
who he sends.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.180
Someone to help you escape,

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.300
or the Imperial Guards for your arrest.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.930
If you win,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.020
I will let you go

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.900
and stop standing in the way of your revenge.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.810
And if I win...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.620
What do you want?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.740
I will surely win.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.860
Prepare the prize.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.250
Now, we shall see.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.930
We heard Consort Shu was attacked

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.100
and came as soon as possible.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.370
The General of the Imperial Guards has come in person?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.930
Consort Shu went to rest,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.220
and there was no assassin.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.800
Just a petty thief.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.930
I already caught him.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.300
So don't worry.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.490
You caught him?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.780
Where is he?

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.980
We can take him into custody.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.450
It's too late.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.860
That man was bold enough

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.010
to cause trouble in Consort Shu's palace.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.180
I've cut him into pieces right away

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.300
and fed him to the dogs.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.370
Your Ladyship, please stop teasing me.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.300
We are here on orders.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.740
We must do our job and take him back with us.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.810
In that case,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.490
it is tricky.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.420
I don't want to make things hard for you.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.540
How about this?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.100
Take me back.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.490
I will explain to him.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.300
What...

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.300
And it will be my chance to see

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.660
whose orders you are following.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.540
Please forgive us.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.740
We merely heard

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.930
there was an assassin in Consort Shu's palace

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.300
and came to protect Her Highness

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.250
and Your Ladyship.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.740
Her Highness is fine,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.220
and so am I.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.660
The petty thief is dead.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.420
What else concerns you?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.690
We still need to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.740
see the body to be certain.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.010
Didn't you hear me?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.620
I fed him to the dogs.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.180
Do you want me to cut the dogs open

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.010
to reassure you?

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.860
I dare not.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.300
Rest assured, Your Ladyship.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.300
Tonight,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.570
we shall guard outside

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.100
and stay alert.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.780
The Right Chancellor has just fallen,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.450
and someone is here to surround Consort Shu's palace.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.220
How swiftly the times change.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.100
But Consort Shu

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.420
is His Majesty's consort, after all.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.690
Whose power

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.980
are you trying to usurp?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.490
We dare not, Your Ladyship.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.980
We were merely overanxious out of concern.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.250
We didn't mean to displease you.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.570
We will leave right away.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.300
Our regards to Her Highness.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.890
What's wrong?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.100
You know him?

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.420
Just two days ago, we were allies.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.540
But today, he wants me dead.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.060
Fine.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.930
Kill me if you want.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.060
My life is yours.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.250
I don't want your life.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.010
But I can help you

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.370
seek vengeance.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.620
Your Ladyship.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.930
The mastermind wants him dead.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.490
Keep him safe

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.540
at the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.980
Make sure he confesses

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.100
to all his crimes.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.300
Understood.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.660
Did you suspect that I'd hurt Consort Shu?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.330
I was sure you had a plan.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.540
Then why are you upset?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.300
Boss.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.780
You've been planning for so long.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.100
Will you finally be able to take revenge?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.660
It might

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.810
happen soon.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.300
Then I'm happy.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.690
Go check on Mr. Xiao.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.980
He's been waiting for you.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.810
Considering his slight frame,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.930
he may fall ill again

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.930
if he waits any longer.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.140
You've had

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.300
a hard day, Mr. Xiao.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.140
I'm sorry I made you suffer.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.660
It's alright.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.780
I shouldn't have

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.610
involved you in this.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.450
I'm very glad

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.380
that you involved me.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.480
I knew

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.660
you would understand.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.500
I didn't believe that you would hurt Consort Shu

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.610
with Chen Luo

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.780
just for revenge.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.930
The fingertip blade you left me

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.540
showed that you hoped I could

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.020
escape and help you.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.090
The only one you ever wanted revenge against

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.660
was the Right Chancellor.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.660
I had to add fuel to the fire

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.830
to force him

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.610
into your chess game.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.970
No one understands me

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.330
as you do.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.300
But there's one thing

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.570
I don't understand.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.780
What?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.900
The fireworks.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.660
How did you pull it off?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.500
I distracted my opponent

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.810
and used his plan against him.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.450
I caused a commotion

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.020
at my mansion.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.500
It lured the Right Chancellor

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.730
and those who'd long been watching him.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.020
So,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.420
someone seized upon

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.660
mine and Chen Luo's desire for vengeance

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.260
to carry out his own scheme.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.780
While Chen Luo held back from me,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.180
I was quietly investigating

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.500
what he was doing.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.180
Before the Grand Festival,

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.260
you realized

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.500
he was preparing fireworks.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.090
Instead of stopping him,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.540
I turned his plan to my advantage.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.090
I changed the phoenix solo dance

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.090
into the "Dragon and Phoenix in Blissful Harmony".

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.730
Pretty, wasn't it?

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.570
Yes.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.820
♪Wandering clouds of every season♪

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.850
What fate joins our necks

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.260
as mandarin ducks,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.540
soaring together,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.260
wing to wing?

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.850
Since His Majesty is at ease,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.210
I can rest my mind.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.540
♪Break the spell. And know love is the...♪

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.970

Thank you

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.330
for trusting me, too.

[Cui's Manor]

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.180
There you are.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.690
Sorry for the wait.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.060
What a festive attire.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.300
What are we celebrating?

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.660
It's the 15th day of the first month.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.330
The Lantern Festival.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.550
If I remember correctly,

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.300
you never celebrate the Lantern Festival.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.610
This is an exception.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.970
You brought your sword?

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.180
As always.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.500
Are you here

to kill me?

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.660
Yes.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.540
Does His Majesty know?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.300
Does Consort Shu know?

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.810
Cui Minzhong, the disgraced official,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.140
accept the decree.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.960
A few days away from court,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.060
and you've forgotten your manners?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.420
Accept the decree on your knees.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.500
I, Cui Minzhong, the sinned official,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.450
accept the decree.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.930
By thorough investigation,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.180
it has been found

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.380
that for many years, the Right Chancellor Cui Minzhong

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.330
has sold offices and bartered ranks,

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.930
formed cliques for selfish ends,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.180
and framed the loyal ministers

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.540
to eliminate dissent.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.260
Sixteen years ago, he forged an imperial decree

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.060
and murdered the entire household of Prince of Duan.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.850
To conceal his crimes,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.610
he relentlessly pursued

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.210
and harmed the royal descendants.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.730
Now, with his crimes exposed,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.900
to stay alive,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.140
he has resorted to vile sorcery,

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.060
slaughtered the innocent,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.690
cursed the nation's fate,

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.260
and plotted rebellion.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.210
His accumulated evils

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.850
are too numerous to record.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.090
He is hereby

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.020
granted death.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.060
Let those in charge carry it out.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.810
I'm wronged.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.090
I'm wronged.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.140
You set me up.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.300
This talk of vile sorcery

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.610
is a baseless accusation!

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.730
You...

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.450
You...

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.970
I'm sure you have received

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.140
countless rewards

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.380
over the decade, Right Chancellor.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.260
Were you so overjoyed by the death sentence

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.500
that you forgot all propriety?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.690
Show your gratitude.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.330
I-I must see His Majesty.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.810
I must see Consort Shu.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.210
Do not think that this imperial decree

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.850
allows you to distort the truth.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.810
I never harbored rebellious intent.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.630
You and Xiao Huaijin

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.180
conspired to frame me.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.540
I did everything out of self-defense.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.300
I have been here,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.730
copying sutras in repentance,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.140
confined in reflection.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:10.660
His Majesty

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.970
will forgive me.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.420
His Majesty won't kill me.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.840
I've done so much for His Majesty.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.780
He can't kill me.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.540
You have committed countless evil deeds.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.500
The retribution

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.660
is now before you.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.810
Are you finally scared?

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.060
Am I scared?

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.970
Of what?

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.850
Why would I be scared

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:34.900
of a young maiden like you?

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.960
Your father lost to me.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.260
So will you.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.930
I only regret one thing.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.420
I shouldn't have asked Consort Shu to raise you

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.180
and allowed you to be a threat.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.810
I really enjoy

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.300
your whole act of bluffing

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.610
and the empty threats.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.870
When you were rising high,

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.380
basking in His Majesty's favor,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.420
your hands were drenched in blood,

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.370
yet you paid no price.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.060
But you've lost His Majesty's favor,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.570
[Death]
I bet you didn't expect

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.460
that death comes on a breath.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.170
I must see His Majesty.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.610
I must see His Majesty.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.460
I must see His Majesty.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.020
Without his imperial decree,

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.060
no one shall lay a finger on me.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.570
What do you intend

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.610
to tell His Majesty?

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.460
The injustice you suffered?

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.780
Your bitterness and grievances?

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.940
Thanks to you,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.020
I've tasted all of that, over and over again.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.460
When you stole justice from me,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.540
His Majesty didn't intervene.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.260
What makes you think

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.330
you deserve justice for yourself?

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.300
When you stood above all others,

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.540
looking down on everyone,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.460
did you ever feel sorry for my late parents?

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.300
Did you ever feel sorry for me?

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.330
No, you didn't.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.780
You believed that those who oppose you

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.740
shall perish,

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.890
and we brought it all upon ourselves.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.850
You killed so many people

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.780
without a shred of remorse.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.090
It's your turn now.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.500
Why are you so terrified?

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.400
Did you think

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.980
you'd live forever?

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.980
Did you think you could take lives

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.020
and never pay with your own?

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.510
You can't kill me.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.300
You can't kill me.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.960
Why can't I kill you?

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.270
You ordered the water-clock apprentice

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.740
to slow our water clock.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.780
You made my father miss his appointment,

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.310
disturbing His Majesty.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.650
When His Majesty ordered you

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.500
to bring my father,

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.840
you forged an imperial decree

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.980
and slaughtered everyone.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.090
Fortunately, my father had handed in his command tally,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.300
proving his loyalty.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.980
Seeing that your plan failed,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.060
you killed the eunuch sent from the palace

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.220
and made up a lie about my father going mad,

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.330
resisting arrest,

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.700
and slaughtering everyone.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.260
He left me no choice.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.810
The Prince of Duan left me no choice.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.020
I kept reaching out in goodwill,

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.540
but he met me with opposition at every turn.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.850
If I didn't kill him,

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.020
sooner or later,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.060
he would kill me.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:30.370
Military men

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.740
kill with swords and blades.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.810
Civil officials

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.170
kill with their minds.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:37.740
Both are killers.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.460
There is no noble or base.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.500
The victor becomes king, the vanquished a bandit. That's all.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.890
What could a mere woman like you

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.020
know of the power struggles

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.300
and the stratagems?

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.920
When your men threw me into the Moonlit Pond,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.740
I was only eight years old.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.300
You violated even the Five Constant Virtues.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.650
A civil official?

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.410
You are nothing but a vicious, treacherous minister,

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.610
a power-grasping in-law of the royal clan who abuses his power.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.410
So you knew all along.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.170
You've spent all these years

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.850
scheming with such effort

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.610
just to kill me.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.050
If you hadn't inherited your father's stubbornness

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.500
and had learned to read the tides and adapt,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.660
we

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.090
wouldn't end up in mutual ruin.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.220
You were raised under my sister's care.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.810
We could have been close

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.940
like family.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.570
And you've come to force my hand, too.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.050
Li Peiyi.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.980
How dare you hurt me?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.700
Don't you dare mention

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.260
Consort Shu or my father.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.700
I can't die.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.940
I won't die.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.260
I must see His Majesty.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.740
I must...

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.020
I must see His Majesty.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.650
I must...

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.660
[One Supreme Talent Suffices]

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.900
As the daughter of Prince of Duan,

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.610
I can't kill you.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.260
Because I must abide by the law of the Great Tang.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.770
As an Inner Guard,

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.260
I can't kill you.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.370
Because the stability of the court must be preserved.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.940
I sought justice

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.420
within the rules,

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.290
only to find you

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.940
standing above them.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.900
You grew reckless in your triumph,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.050
thinking I couldn't do anything to you.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.180
You thought the court relied on you,

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:29.460
and His Majesty favored you.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.610
You thought no one dared to cross you.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.420
Then I shall make the court fear you,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.460
and His Majesty despise you.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.660
You thought you sat secure in your high position,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.020
basking in His Majesty's favor.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.170
Then I shall give His Majesty

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:46.660
a reason to kill you.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.980
You thought

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.420
you stood above the rules of this world?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.460
Then I will turn your rules against you

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.530
and kill you with them.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.780
♪I see the truth, sharp as a blade♪

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.140
♪I read the books of sin stained with blood♪

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.940
♪What wise words do you offer?♪

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.740
♪I will leave no hiding place for darkness♪

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.260
♪And illuminate this glorious age♪

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.900
♪Justice is my sword, piercing through the fog of mystery♪

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.220
♪Let stars and moon shine through the dark night♪

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.940
♪One day, the sky will turn clear♪

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.260
You handled this matter well.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.370
A reward is due.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.220
But any reward from me

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.850
might be ill-fitting.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.900
So just tell me

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.130
what you want.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.530
Your Majesty,

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.810
whatever you grant Her Ladyship will be appreciated.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.940
It lacks novelty for Her Ladyship

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.850
to demand something.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.090
We await Your Majesty's decree.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:14.940
Li Peiyi.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.610
I decree

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.050
that you shall oversee the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.900
What do you say?

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.330
I am unruly by nature

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.180
and unworthy

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.500
of such a responsibility.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.500
Is it that you are unworthy

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.900
or that you are unwilling?

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.960
Did you really think of it

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.770
as a tool for your private investigations?

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.900
You want to quit now?

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.050
I only

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.850
feel ashamed.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.290
Even if I uncover the truth,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.090
I'm rarely allowed to bring it to light.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.770
I investigate cases and hold trials

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.220
by the laws,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.700
only to find

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:53.810
that the laws

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.770
are nothing but tools of the royal clan.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.330
The laws punish the multitude,

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.940
but not the royals.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.260
Within the inner palace,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.500
I no longer know how to conduct an investigation.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.810
I beg Your Majesty's forgiveness.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.700
I am truly unworthy of such responsibility.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.770
Are you accusing me of bending the law for personal gain?

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.770
The entire realm is Your Majesty's private domain.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:22.700
How can there be any "personal gain"?

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:25.570
Li Peiyi.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.220
Do you truly believe

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.570
I'm unaware of your schemes?

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.230
I have tolerated you,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.180
accommodated you,

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.420
and even allowed you to execute Cui Minzhong.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.370
You are still displeased?

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.680
Your Majesty knew of Cui Minzhong's

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.530
countless, unforgivable crimes,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.290
each deserving a thousand deaths.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.330
Yet, you still chose to shield him.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.500
Without your favoritism,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.880
I wouldn't have waited until today

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.570
to seek justice for my family.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.610
Do you wish to be reunited with your parents?

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.090
You have just cleared my father's name.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.020
How could you execute his only surviving daughter?

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.850
Even if you feel no pity for me,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.850
surely you care about your own reputation.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.030
Get lost.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.940
Get lost.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.090
Get out of here.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.420
Don't ever come back.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.500
Get lost.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.610
I lack the fortune

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.500
to deserve your grace.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.260
But I will always be grateful to you

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.770
for raising me.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.600
Your Highness.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.020
You're leaving?

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:39.870
I always knew

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.390
this day would come.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.820
You don't even ask where I'm going?

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.060
Wherever you wish to go

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.390
must be a place where you can find shelter

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.500
and peace of mind.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.180
Your Highness.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.070
Come with me.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.500
This place

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:05.940
is suffocating.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.740
This is my place of shelter.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.460
But does it

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.870
bring you peace?

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.660
This is not a home.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:17.110
How can it not be?

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.460
I am His Majesty's consort.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.220
This is the home His Majesty gave me.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.180
Always trying to read his mind,

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.350
always having to wear a smiling face...

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.700
That is not what a wife should do.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.630
Favor and fall from grace can change in a single dawn.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.150
That is not what a wife deserves.

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.110
Come with me.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.590
I will take care of you.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.110
With the edge of jade and the heart of orchids.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.350
You have your own name.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.180
You don't have to be Consort Shu.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.350
You are Cui Yuyao.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.110
Nobody has called me Yuyao for a long time.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.110
You've done what you had to do.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.310
But I haven't.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.420
His Majesty needs a Consort Shu.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.110
The Cui family needs a Consort Shu.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.150
To ease His Majesty's anger

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.030
and preserve the Cui family,

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.900
I must stay here

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.550
to atone for my brother's sins.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.550
But His Majesty and the Cui family

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.070
never truly cared about you.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.030
Why must you live for them?

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.630
Peiyi, I am not like you.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.070
I do not know

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.790
for whom to live

I had the same dream again.

I was in the dark
