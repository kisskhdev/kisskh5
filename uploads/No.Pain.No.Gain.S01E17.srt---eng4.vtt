00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
=Episode 17=
(This story is purely fictional)

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.740
Designated driver?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.940
What's going on?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.740
What is this, Huang?

00:01:57.857 --> 00:01:59.635
Are you sure
you called the right number?

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.820
I'm 100% sure.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.380
He is working as a designated driver.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.460
He has changed completely,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.020
but I'm sure
he is planning something big.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.502
What big thing is he planning

00:02:12.524 --> 00:02:14.540
that requires him
to work as a designated driver?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.260
Trying to understand Mr. Pei

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.380
is getting more and more difficult.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.140
Designated Driver, P?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.100
Lin Wan.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.946
Huang and the rest told me
you are working as a designated driver.

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:56.780
I didn't believe them.

00:02:57.013 --> 00:02:58.780
Are you really working
as a designated driver?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.420
Sorry, Lin Wan.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.500
They are recording.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.780
I must finish my greeting.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.220
Hello. CC Designated Driver

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.060
is happy to serve you.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.940
I've arrived
at the agreed pickup point on time.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.420
All right.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.860
Mr. Pei,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.700
what are you trying to do?

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.220
Of course, I'm experiencing life.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.980
Otherwise, do you think I lack money?

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.413
Professional designated driver
lets you arrive home safely.

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:46.860
Protecting you is our duty.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.540
You have arrived at your destination.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.060
Mr. Pei.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.660
Take a walk with me.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.900
The people of the company

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.140
think you are planning something big

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.820
by working as a designated driver.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.140
Are you

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.020
going to venture into another industry?

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.020
All of you are overcomplicating things.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.660
Forget it.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.220
You are so mysterious.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.857
I won't ask
if you don't feel like telling.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.860
I'm not.

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.346
You work as a designated driver

00:04:18.346 --> 00:04:20.020
but I can't even find you
at your office.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.500
Didn't I tell you before?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.940
When it comes to work,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.700
you can decide everything yourself.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.100
I...

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.940
Tell me.

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:40.340
After the Divine Mountains and Seas
began its development,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.940
everything has been going smoothly.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.420
I have a feeling

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.060
that its content is lacking something,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.740
but I can't really point out what it is.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.300
If that's your question,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.500
it might be a problem
with the theme and core content.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.500
You previously said

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.280
innovation in games

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.740
should have relevance to the times
and intellectual depth.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.820
I learned from that.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.940
Did I say something like that before?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.420
I think

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.500
you can think about

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.220
why you develop games.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.980
Because I really like games.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.100
I want to develop a game

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.660
that many people like.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.500
Have you thought about

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.620
why you like games

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.500
and why other people like them?

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.300
Reality is too harsh.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.620
I want a shelter,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.900
a Utopia perhaps.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.060
Yes.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.980
Life always

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.180
feels suffocating.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.860
You can't

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.860
really escape from it.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.420
However, we can take a nap

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.460
and have a nice dream.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.100
If you want
to resonate with more people,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.540
you must first resonate with yourself.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.380
Data, gameplay, and style

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.180
can all be replicated.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.740
Only emotions

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.340
cannot be replicated.

00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:21.020
You are a person with ideals

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.380
and emotions.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.140
I believe you can surely do it.

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:45.180
When I have questions in the future,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.140
can I get you as my designated driver?

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.900
Can I?

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.580
Whatever.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.820
I have a new order.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.260
I have to leave.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.020
Go ahead.

00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:12.140
I need to leave, as well.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.820
My electric scooter
is still in your car.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.500
Let's go retrieve it now.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.700
Are you in a rush?

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.820
Not really.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.700
You walk quickly.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.500
I'll slow down.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.380
Here you go.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.820
I'm leaving. Bye.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.940
Ride safe.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.140
Hello.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.380
Bao. Lv.

00:07:54.613 --> 00:07:57.000
You don't have to worry about
not being able to contact Mr. Pei.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.820
Isn't he working
as a designated driver now?

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.060
Besides using a platform,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.700
he is also
working part-time at an offline

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.730
designated driver company.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.940
I spoke to the company

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.940
to hire him for a month.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.500
When he drives in the future,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.902
we can discuss the project with him.

00:08:08.924 --> 00:08:10.140
Lin Wan, you're amazing.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.420
You're really smart.

(Zhongdian Web Fiction)

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.300
Mr. Pei,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.940
the script is almost ready.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.300
The hard copy has been sent to Shi Huo
and the other actors.

00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:27.720
The director is getting his crew
and preparing everything.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.180
The crew shirts are also ready.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.580
Mr. Pei, you must attend
the pre-shoot ceremony.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.740
Sure. Okay. No problem.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.924
Okay. I'm hanging up.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.340
This is serious.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.260
It's over for him now.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.060
This is over.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.180
What are you talking about?

00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:47.220
Huang, take a look.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.860
Lu Zhiyao is trending again.

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:50.780
Isn't it normal for him to be trending?

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.420
It's different.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.980
This time, it's different.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.180
Come and take a look.

(Lu Zhiyao putting up airs)
(Mr. Lu is still as popular.)

00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.480
(His expression is still cold.)

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.460
(I helped you fans ask around,
and I heard Mr. Lu)

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.060
(has accepted
a famous director's movie.)

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.319
(He might even be more popular now.)

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.899
(Looking at his new style,
Mr. Lu is probably switching genres)

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.550
(and starting to
do some serious acting.)

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.140
(It's actually a wig?)

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.100
(Mr. Lu is still behaving like an idol.)

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.660
(What news is Mr. Lu reading?)

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.940
(Why is he frowning?)

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.140
(Why did he splash all the coffee
his assistant brought him?)

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.740
(Perhaps)

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.300
(he is still immersed in his role.)

00:09:30.435 --> 00:09:31.980
(When Mr. Lu realized I was filming,)

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.860
(he showed his iconic smile again.)

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.340
(He is domineering indeed.)

00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:36.260
(I'll be going now.)

00:09:37.613 --> 00:09:39.680
His expression changed
as soon as he saw the fan.

00:09:39.813 --> 00:09:41.324
He's forcefully changing his style now.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.260
The new film was roasted by fans

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.380
to be a box office bomb.

00:09:44.391 --> 00:09:45.849
They even made this into stickers.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.368
Lu Zhiyao is so angry that
he closed his social media accounts.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.780
Send me these stickers.
I'll save and use them.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.560
Sure. No problem.
I'll share it in the group.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.180
Someone revealed
that after he closed his accounts,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.940
he was still acting the same
and not improving.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.380
He continued to act all high and mighty

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.260
at the production set.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.620
In the end, he was replaced.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.420
He was doing a film
with a famous director.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.591
Moreover, he is the male lead.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.820
He'll be so frustrated
after losing this gig.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.420
Doesn't it feel great?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:09.620
Yes.

(Mandy, Lu Zhiyao's Manager)

Sibo,

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.220
it's like this.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.380
Yao is unhappy with the production team,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.420
so he quit.

00:10:37.813 --> 00:10:39.660
I heard you are
still preparing for the film

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.013
and haven't started production, yet.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.220
We thought about it

00:10:42.568 --> 00:10:44.340
and felt like giving you another chance.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.580
After all,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.340
you did so many changes
for Yao previously.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.820
It's all fate, right?

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.820
You're giving us another chance?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.980
I think she's reasonable.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.980
She's reasonable.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.900
Mr. Lu, do you have anything
you want to say?

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.820
Mr. Lu wants to go to the toilet.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.700
Sorry.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.060
You should calm down.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.700
We are preparing for our new film.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.580
No one cares about it on the Internet.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.860
Yes. Shi Huo cooperates well with us,

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.820
but no one knows him.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.820
No one cares about him.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.940
With Lu Zhiyao here,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.700
he might
bring some attention to the film,

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.340
right?

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.020
Look at how much
he has been teased by others.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.820
Bad publicity is still publicity.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.420
You invested such a huge amount

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.420
but what do you have right now?

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.380
Isn't it all over if you lose money?

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.460
You'll be doomed.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.940
Let me speak.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.940
Sorry.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.220
Mr. Lu,

00:12:07.302 --> 00:12:09.568
I had a quick discussion
with Director Zhuang just now.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.620
We are happy

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.540
and also hope
you can join our production.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.060
Yes.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.940
However,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.260
the actor for the role of the Wizard

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.180
has been decided.

00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:19.620
It's not right to replace him
for no reason.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.380
We have a better role
that's also eye-catching.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.060
It's the role of the Demon King.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.220
I think it suits you a lot.

00:12:26.368 --> 00:12:28.140
Do you want Yao
to be a supporting character?

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.060
That's impossible.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.820
In terms of pay,

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.340
we can increase it.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.060
Also,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.860
his name will be part of

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.300
the film's Special Starring.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.100
Yes.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.420
Mr. Lu,
do you still need to go to the toilet?

00:12:50.391 --> 00:12:52.220
The right hand means
he wants to go to the toilet.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.657
The left hand means he is thinking.

00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:02.070
Actually, I don't really care
about the importance of the role.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.500
He just wants to be promoted,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.680
so he doesn't care
about the role's importance.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.380
However, this version right now

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:12.980
still lacks depth
when it comes to the characters.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.300
He didn't even read the script.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.420
It's all empty talk.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.340
When I accept a role,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.980
I will usually find how I resonate

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.180
with this character.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.060
However, in this version,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.100
I haven't seen

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.860
the depth of the Demon King's soul.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.780
I also can't feel the role's spotlight.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.820
He just wants me
to give him more scenes.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.100
Director Zhuang,
is there a problem with your spine?

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.220
All right.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.820
Mr. Lu,

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.740
you can tell us
your specific requirements.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
The Demon King and the Wizard

00:13:53.524 --> 00:13:55.060
should understand each other well,

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.000
right?

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.440
Yes.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.260
Fundamentally speaking,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.060
the Demon King and the Wizard
are not enemies but rivals.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.020
They are equal

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.220
and are on par with each other.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:06.820
Right?

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.060
So, you can just make them

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.540
into two male leads.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.540
You can stay here and think about it.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.260
I have to go to the toilet.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.420
It was cold last night.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.420
I can't hold it in
since I'm getting old.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.260
His digestive system is bad.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.420
Double male leads?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.860
The Wizard has too many scenes.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.740
Delete it.

00:14:57.391 --> 00:14:58.740
The second lead, the Demon King,

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.340
also has too many scenes.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.180
Too many scenes.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:11.860
Delete.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.580
Delete.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.700
Delete.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.460

into a female character.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.580
It's not right.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.420
The Wizard is the male lead!

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:51.900
You should

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.260
look at the big picture.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.500
Look.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.060
If you change
the original male lead to a female

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.620
and make him, the original female lead,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.820
and Yao's Demon King

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.100
into a triple lead role,

will make it viral.

00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:10.568
Are you teaching me how to write?

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.060
No.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.180
Do you know this story...

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260
Mr. Lu,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.540
doing this isn't right.

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:38.260
Bringing seven people in your entourage?

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.140
Hello.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.060
You are...

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.260
I am the male lead of this film.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.420
The one who plays the Wizard

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.820
is a famous actor,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.420
Shi Huo.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.780
Sorry.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.380
I'm ignorant.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.060
I've never heard of you.

00:17:05.568 --> 00:17:08.540
Mr. Lu, I guess you haven't been
surfing the Internet for a long time.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.020
What are these?

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.740

(Trash!)

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.100
(Stupid!)

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.700
Mr. Lu,

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.660
you are busy.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.700
I don't blame you
for not using the Internet.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.700
Shi Huo,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.235
why do you have an entourage, as well?

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:40.220
Of course.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.380
You know my manager.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.660
Who?

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.380
It's me!

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.380
Darn it.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.220
When did you become Shi Huo's manager?

00:18:01.302 --> 00:18:03.257
Before I took him
to meet you and Director Zhuang,

00:18:03.257 --> 00:18:04.980
I already noticed his unique aura.

00:18:05.102 --> 00:18:07.368
I directly invested in him
through DreamForge Capital.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.140
Also,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.860
I found all those collaborations

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.060
with short series platforms.

00:18:11.435 --> 00:18:12.820
He became viral in an instant.

00:18:12.902 --> 00:18:14.020
What do you think, Huang?

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.140
Am I better
and more talented than Li Shi

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.490
when it comes to making investments?

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.060
I'm already troubled enough

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.380
with Lu Zhiyao.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.720
Now that Shi Huo is also popular,

00:18:25.724 --> 00:18:26.900
are you trying to kill me?

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.420
Are you worried that Shi Huo

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.270
might try to change the script
like Lu Zhiyao?

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.620
Impossible.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.380
Shi Huo isn't that kind of person.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.380
Look how pure he is.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.740
I am now

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.180

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.540
I have millions of fans
on the short series platform.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.580
I'm an award nominee

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.620
with luck on my side.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.340
What?

00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:49.524
Mr. Lu, are you still trying
to become the male lead?

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.260
Shi,

00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:56.140
I'm not someone
who cares about my scenes

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.635
or whether I'm the male lead or not.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.060
The script is holy.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.820
We can't just change it as we wish.

00:19:00.924 --> 00:19:03.060
I was involved in this project
earlier than you.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.500
I understand the male lead better.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.980
I am helping you.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.260
The script is holy. We
can't just change it as we wish.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.420
Pretentious people like you annoy me!

00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:11.660
You are just an actor.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.260
Stop talking about scripts.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.724
If you can act, just do it.
Otherwise, don't.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.860
Mind your attitude.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.860
Shi,

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.220
you just joined the industry.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.980
You need to know the rules.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.580
Do you understand the script?

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.100
Lu Zhiyao,

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.020
I'm showing you respect as my senior.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.700
Do you still not understand?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.540
Hurry.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.900
Put away that arrogant,
self-righteous superiority

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.460
that even reeks a little.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.820
It's just the script, right?

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.380
I'm going to change it, too!

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.340

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.940
(Tengda Total Asset)

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.900
Sorry, Sibo.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.620
It's my fault.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.740
It's all my fault.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.100
It has nothing to do with you.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.860
Let's talk about them.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.500
What kinds of film were they producing?

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.780
What were those films?

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.500
Who are they to treat me like that?

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.180
Listen to me.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.300
I didn't expect

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.100
Shi Huo to be that kind of person.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.460
I didn't expect the kid
to become arrogant

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.700
when he became popular.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.740
Just like a helium balloon.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.460
Seriously.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.020
Why don't we stop doing this?

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.460
Why don't we stop?

00:20:39.724 --> 00:20:41.260
Are you also persuading me to stop?

00:20:42.228 --> 00:20:43.588
Of course.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.780
You were emotionally stable back then.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.060
Back then,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.524
when I was still with Tengda Games,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.620
regardless of

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.220
how crazy the project was,

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.060
Sibo would always get it done.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.460
Look at him now.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.540
Ever since he joined the film industry,

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.260
look at him,

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.580
this guy gets angry
every two to three days.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.820
Let's stop doing this.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.860
I'll talk to Mr. Pei later.

00:21:04.946 --> 00:21:05.700
I'll talk to Qian.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.220
I won't let Huang do this anymore.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.580
No, Ma Yang.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.820
I won't let you do it anymore.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.340
No.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.580
Let me tell you.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.340
Yang,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.660
when I was in my previous company,

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.020
even if I was

00:21:17.124 --> 00:21:19.060
really exhausted
in that competitive environment,

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.620
my boss still didn't think I did enough.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.300
He never even looked at me.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.060
Do you know that?

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.020
Until I met Mr. Pei.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.100
I finally found my own value.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:30.860
I suggested

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.340
Feihuang Pictures to Mr. Pei.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.488
I must do it.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.740
That is my dream.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.060
I must do it.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.020
You're still drinking?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.740
Ask him to drink less.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.660
Do you need a psychology consultant?

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.420
Sibo?

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.860
I don't.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.100
Sibo doesn't need
a psychology consultant.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.860
Sibo is fine.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.860
Sibo will keep writing scripts.

00:21:53.124 --> 00:21:54.319
Sibo will keep working hard.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.860
Is that how he behaves
after drinking?

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.540
No.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.540
DreamForge Capital
should invest in people like Huang Sibo.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.780
That is how it can make money.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.340
(A Month Later)

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.940
(Shenhua International)

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.380
(Birthday Reminder, Ma Yang)

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.300
(Why is the present that Ma Yang likes)

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.900
(so expensive?)

00:22:25.168 --> 00:22:26.809
(After working as a designated driver,)

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.220
(I still don't have any savings
after paying my housing loan.)

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.780
Come in.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:33.940
I was trying my luck.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.502
Turns out you are really here, Qian.

00:22:37.057 --> 00:22:39.635
Why have you always been working
as a designated driver recently?

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.860
They asked me about your plans

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.900
but I couldn't answer them.

00:22:42.302 --> 00:22:43.340
With how close we are,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.780
why are you still hiding from me?

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.060
You'll know why when the time comes.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.100
Why are you looking for me?

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.020
Go to DreamForge Capital,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.235
let me show you something good.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:52.780
Let's go.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:53.980
Come on.

00:22:58.946 --> 00:22:59.820
Please take a seat.

00:23:03.013 --> 00:23:04.260
Dreams Fulfilled Immediately.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.500
Verified by DreamForge Capital.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.980
If you have a dream, come if you dare.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.500
What is this?

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.500
My account.

00:23:09.591 --> 00:23:11.340
I'm planning
to upgrade DreamForge Capital

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.280
and openly recruit dreams.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.620
If you have a dream, your dream
will be fulfilled immediately.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.460
(Dreams Fulfilled Immediately)
Send me a message.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.409
Once it has been verified,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.380
the money will be transferred right away
to fulfill your dream.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.380
Is this the project you came up with
after thinking about it for so long?

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:22.980
Yes.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:24.700
Hold on.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.368
You have 300,000 fans.

00:23:26.435 --> 00:23:27.940
(300,000 Fans)
Did you buy them?

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.700
I didn't.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.260
I gained them last night.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.660
In the beginning, no one believed in me.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.060
Later, I started a live broadcast.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:34.820
After that,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.260
these people called me a scammer.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.740
They said I'm giving out money

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.680
to paid actors.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.900
They asked everyone
to download the anti-scam app.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.340
Can you guess what I did?

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.140
What did you do?

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.546
I had a joint broadcast
with the official anti-scam account.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.700
All of them conceded.

00:23:52.591 --> 00:23:53.540
(Now, do you all believe)

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.060
(that I'm Tengda's Ma Yang?)

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.740
(I'm sincerely trying to help everyone
achieve their dreams.)

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.500
(It's true.)

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.340
(We are DreamForge Capital.)

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.060
No fool will believe in this.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.820
"Fools?"

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.260
"I did receive money."

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.930
"I don't mind
addressing them as my father."

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.700
Still, it shouldn't
become so popular overnight.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.980
This is because of Shi Huo.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.300
Didn't Shi Huo
bully Huang Sibo previously?

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.020
I went to him and chewed him out.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.429
He was embarrassed because of this

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.213
and helped me reshare my account
to promote it.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.100
Then, it...

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.620
Qian,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.500
you don't know.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.220
Many people

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.900
still believe in dreams in this era.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.620
(Someone sent me a text.)

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.440
(Let's take a look.)

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.700
(This is Aluminium Alloy Materials Q.)

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.620
(Here's what he said.)

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.660
(Hello, Mr. Ma.)

00:24:39.724 --> 00:24:40.830
(I'm a gaming content creator)

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.220
(who is doing this out of passion.)

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.420
(My fans always say my mic is bad.)

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.140
(To give them a better experience)

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.700
(and better introduce Tengda's games...)

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.420
(Can you fulfill my wish)

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.460
(and let me
buy a professional microphone?)

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.620
(No problem. Please wait.)

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.780
(Let me check your account.)

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.020
(Q, I just checked your account.)

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.180
(Your account has 5,000 fans now.)

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.180
(I can only help grassroot creators
with fewer than a thousand fans)

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.140
(fulfill their dreams.)

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.580
(Let's take a look at the next one.)

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.700
Qian,

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.060
I only rejected a request

00:25:13.146 --> 00:25:14.460
after seriously verifying it.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.500
Am I professional?

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.580
Am I a man of principle?

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:18.980
(Here's one.)

00:25:19.013 --> 00:25:20.168
(Hello, Mr. Ma.)

00:25:20.191 --> 00:25:21.568
(I am a working-class employee.)

00:25:21.591 --> 00:25:23.740
(My company requires me to work
12 hours a day for six days a week.)

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.540
(I want to resign,)

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.940
(but I can't muster up the courage)

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.860
(because of financial stress.)

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.380
(I don't want money.)

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.460
(I just want you to help me)

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.460
(get a job at Tengda Games.)

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.940
(Thank you.)

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.300
(If this is difficult,)

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.740
(you can also transfer money to me.)

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.100
(No, it's like this.)

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.940
(Mister,)

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.940
(Tengda has)

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.620
(a hiring standard.)

00:25:43.635 --> 00:25:45.740
(Mr. Ma, what's the standard?)
(Backdoors are not allowed.)

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.700
(No backdoors.)

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.460
(However,)

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.420
(I will still help you out a little.)

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.500
(Please wait.)

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.620
(Calm down.)

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.460
(I'll help you)

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.340
(quit and fulfill your dream bravely.)

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.660
(Look over here.)

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.380
(I transferred 10,000 yuan to you.)

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.860
(I wish for your success.)

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.540
You gave him 10,000 yuan?

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.220
Yes.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.860
Don't worry, Qian.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.380
I used my own money.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.540
DreamForge and Tengda Games

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.900
paid me so much every month anyway.

00:26:13.902 --> 00:26:14.968
I can't even spend it all.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.180
Enough, Ma.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.389
Stop telling me

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.860
that you can't spend all your salary.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.060
Keep it yourself.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:21.700
Sure.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.300
Qian,

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.013
can I propose this project
on the agenda?

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.060
I quite like it.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.660
If I don't do it,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.300
are you planning

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.900
to keep using your money?

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.620
Yes.

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.900
This is so meaningful.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.100
I don't plan to stop.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.502
In that case, it's better
if Tengda supports you.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.100
Qian, come on. Give me a hug.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.740
It's time.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.500
Qian, it's time to give me a hug.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.340
Qian.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.300
Mr. Pei.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.100
Use it.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.180
I'm leaving.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.740
Sure.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.660
(Hello, Mr. Ma.)

00:27:16.746 --> 00:27:19.257
(Dreams Fulfilled Immediately)
(I'm the boss of a small company.)

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.540
(However, due to
my company's poor operation,)

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.700
(I only get paid 5,000 yuan a month.)

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.740
(I want to buy my friend a gift.)

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.940
(I need 8,000 yuan)

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.580
(but I don't have money.)

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.940
(Can you help me fulfill this wish?)

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.220
It feels great to leech off Ma Yang.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.340
(Transfer Details)

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.100
Seriously? He transfers money
to help people fulfill their dreams?

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.420
It must be a scam.

00:27:53.124 --> 00:27:54.100
It's already trending.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.124
I think it should be true.

00:27:55.146 --> 00:27:55.700
Whatever.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.570
Let's see
if he can help us pay for this meal.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.780
I really got 56 yuan.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.140
These two cups of coffee are free.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.900
Let me try it again.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.980
Only one opportunity for one account?

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.460
Try it again with a new account.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.980
(Ma Yang)

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.540
Mr. Ma did transfer money to me.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.820
Mr. Qiao.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.460
I knew it.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.591
The profile picture
of Aluminium Alloy Materials Q

00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:32.480
looked familiar.

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:33.740
When I checked the account,

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.768
the posts were all about
how handsome Mr. Qiao is.

00:28:35.768 --> 00:28:37.260
It's obviously your sub-account.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.060
However,

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.220
I've still decided

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.620
to let you leech off me once.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.780
Keep praising Tengda Games
in the future.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.100
Mr. Ma, you found me.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.420
It's me indeed.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.180
Don't worry, Mr. Ma.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.580
If you launch a new game in the future,

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.900
I've decided

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.580
to fully support it.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.540
Qian knows me best.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.740
After speaking with you,

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.820
we've improved

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.660
The Divine Mountains and Seas
once again.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.740
Right now, development is going well.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.260
However, a few parts

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.100
require extra budget.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.380
I want to confirm it with you.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.140
About this,

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.100
the project team
can just decide on its own.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.980
Just do it.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.260
There's no cap on the budget.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.780
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.300
Oh,

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.460
I also want to tell you
about the other games' update.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.340
Although you said

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.660
we don't need
to update our previous games,

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.300
we still think it's a pity
not to give them updates.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.140
Well,

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.140
I did say that before.

00:30:15.387 --> 00:30:16.027
Well,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.220
you'll be in charge

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.740
of all these games from now on.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.940
If you have any ideas,

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.980
just update the games

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.340
when you feel like it.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:24.580
All right.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.100
By the way,

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.940
Lin Wan...

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.620
Well...

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.540
Didn't you tell
the designated driver company

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.060
to hire me for a month?

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.220
I took the job since I can make
more money than usual

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.940
but I realized
you are not here as a passenger.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.420
You are sitting in the passenger seat
to discuss work with me.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.100
You've been working hard enough at work.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.940
Now, you still want me to work two jobs.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.380
This job is not worth it at all.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.340
Mr. Pei, do you care about
the money you make working this job?

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.260
Didn't you say
you were experiencing life?

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.100
I...

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.900
I am

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.020
always serious,

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.380
no matter what I do.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:05.900
Look.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.860
I have the resolve

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.460
to be a designated driver.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.009
The time I use and the money I make

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.940
as a designated driver

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.413
are very important to me right now.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.540
Mr. Pei, your attitude

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.740
of being immersed in your role

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.420
is indeed impressive.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700
No wonder you can make such good games.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.540
Now that I think about it,

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.780
I should improve on the immersiveness
of The Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:31:29.502 --> 00:31:31.060
Lin Wan, help me answer the phone.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.180
Sure.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.500
Hello.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.100
Hello, are you Mr. Pei?

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.540
We noticed you have a loan record.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.660
We have a small...

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.300
Mr. Pei, you got a loan?

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.540
Is it because of Tengda?

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.260
Loan?

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.020
I'll never get a loan.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.340
This is

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.180
an obvious

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.260
harassment call.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.620
Well,

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.460
Lin Wan,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.780
can you

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.380
tell the designated driver company

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.500
and say

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.460
you're going to cancel
my month-long hire?

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.900
Right now,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.540
I really can't work for you alone.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.235
I must only work more,
so I get paid more.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.900
Only by doing this can I

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.780
experience life better.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.780
Don't worry.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.820
I completely trust you

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.580
when it comes to games.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.300
I support you.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300
I believe you can

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.900
do better and greater,

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.740
leading Tengda Games to greater glory.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:34.860
All right.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.180
I'll call

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.630
the designated driver company later.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:38.940
Thank you.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.220
Mr. Li Jr.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.460
This time,

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.900
I came to Jinchuan on purpose

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.220
to bring you good news.

00:33:01.502 --> 00:33:03.660
Development and production
of Eternal Reincarnation

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.980
are completed.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.460
It will be launched soon.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.620
Rest assured.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.300
Previously, we've always been surpassed

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.540
by Tengda Games.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.460
This time, Eternal Reincarnation

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.500
will surely crush Pei Qian.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:17.780
Its sales

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.740
will be better than all of his games

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.700
combined.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.300
Yes, Mr. Li Jr.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.860
This time, Sky Fire will surely win.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.740
Come on.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.980
Let's have a toast to victory.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.340
Come on.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:26.900
Cheers.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.900
Mr. Zhou,

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.380
you can't say things that way sometimes.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.020
Pei Qian is my friend, after all.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:38.620
Right?

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.900
This is a healthy competition.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.620
Of course,

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.020
I'm very happy

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.140
if Sky Fire comes on top of this.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.380
However,

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.860
Tengda Games is indeed capable.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.580
Am I right?

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.860
You're...

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.060
See?

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.460
Mr. Li Jr. has a broad perspective.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.620
Come, Mr. Li Jr.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.860
Come.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.820
Xuming.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.380
Mr. Li Jr. is almost done.
Call a designated driver.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:07.820
Sure.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.340
No.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.300
I can still drink.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.980
I'm fine.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.220
I know. You're fine.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.420
Come. Let me drink with you.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.140
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.300
well,

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.700
ask your driver to go home.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.857
I'll drive you back later.

00:34:20.924 --> 00:34:22.660
We can also chat alone

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.900
on our way back.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.740
Mr. Zhou,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.460
you need something?

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.180
The person who understands me best

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.300
is indeed Mr. Li Jr.

00:34:33.324 --> 00:34:34.020
All right. Cheers.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.780
Cheers.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.420
Have a little more.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.420
Here you go.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.340
I still need to work harder.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.500
Every job counts.

00:34:52.146 --> 00:34:54.340
Didn't they say it's easier
to get more jobs at night?

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.420
Why haven't I seen any?

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.500
(You have a new job.
Please attend to it immediately.)

00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.740
Get it.

00:35:01.863 --> 00:35:04.223
Oh my.
The registration plate is awesome.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.540
There's even a tip.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.300
(Driver, are you coming?)

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.460
Don't worry, Sir.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.180
Designated Driver P will be here soon.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:20.860
Sir.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.220
Designated Driver, where are you?

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.435
I've been waiting for so long.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.220
Sir,

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.860
I'll reach the entrance soon.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.140
It's two of you, right?

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.900
You're at the entrance?

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:29.980
I don't see you.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.900
Where are you?

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.140
Didn't I tip you just now?

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.780
I'm telling you.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.780
If you don't come here,

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.500
I'll cancel my tip and report you.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.500
Hurry up!

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.700
Zhou Muyan?

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.140
Do you need something?

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:49.860
Mr. Li Jr.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:50.780
Wait for a while.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.980
He'll be here soon.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.380
If he isn't,

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.700
I'll make a complaint.

00:35:54.746 --> 00:35:55.880
(Professional Designated Driver)
Here he is.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.380
Sir, I'm glad to serve.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.524
Why are you so slow
after receiving a tip? Let's go.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.900
Wait!

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:02.620
Something's wrong.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.420
Look! He's wearing...

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.980
There's no problem. Get on.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.740
Sir, can you open the trunk?

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.500
Sure.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.080
Didn't you see that he's wearing a mask?

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:09.780
Stop!

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.020
He's here to rob me.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:11.420
Mr. Li Jr.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.180
Get in.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.835
I have something important to tell you.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.300
Well...

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.660
Mr. Driver...

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.740
Are you really wearing this mask

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.260
just to drive

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.700
and not have any weird ideas?

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.340
What weird ideas can he have?

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.060
Perhaps his face is full of pimples,

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.435
and he doesn't want us to see him.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.500
Forget it.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.700
Won't he get more pimples wearing that?

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.500
Mr. Li Jr.,

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.740
don't always think of others
as bad people.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.420
You might not realize it

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.180
if the real bad guy is just beside you.

00:37:04.613 --> 00:37:05.900
Who are you talking about?

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:06.980
Who else?

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.300
Pei Qian.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.740
Why do I spend so much money

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.420
this time on Eternal Reincarnation?

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.220
Because I want to knock him out

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.940
and let him die a cruel death.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.100
Mr. Zhou.

00:37:21.568 --> 00:37:23.020
Just now, there were many people.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.460
I feel bad talking more.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.460
Now, there are only two of us.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.540
Let's talk about this

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.980
behind closed doors.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:36.860
Look.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.820
I think

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.460
Sky Fire and Tengda Games

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.740
are having a healthy competition,

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.140
so that's a good thing.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.780
However, I think you are going overboard

00:37:45.235 --> 00:37:47.168
if your actions
are specifically against Mr. Pei.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.420
That's...

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.100
No.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.180
You are completely obsessed

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.380
with defeating him.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.191
Back then, you hired
people to slander him.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.180
That's wrong.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.820
How am I wrong?

00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:58.860
Mr. Li Jr.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.940
You are my investor.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.899
I can turn a blind eye
if you reprimand me a little,

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.100
but I think you're now siding
with Pei Qian a bit too much.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:04.980
I heard you moved

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.100
to Four Wall Apartments,

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:06.740
right?

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.780
Is that right?

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.500
As the young master of Fuhui,

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.580
you moved to Tengda's apartment.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.300
What will your father think
when he finds out?

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:14.780
No.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.340
You... This is between us.
Why are you getting my dad involved?

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:17.860
Right?

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.820
Besides, I'm telling you.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.900
Mr. Pei has

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.740
many strengths.

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.780
For example,

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.460
he is better at me than investing.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.740
He is better than you
at developing games.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.700
What's wrong with

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.740
being close to him?

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.060
It'll only benefit me, right?

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.580
How does it benefit you?

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.140
Do you want to become Pei Qian's lackey?

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.660
Or do you want to hand over

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.980
Lishi Capital to him?

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.780
In the end,

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.660
both of us will end up

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.740
becoming Pei Qian's driver!

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.235
Seriously, there's no need to...

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:45.340
Watch out!

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.980
Are you mad?

00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:23.591
Sorry.

00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:26.146
- Do you think apologizing helps?
- Do you think apologizing helps?

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.620
What were you doing?

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.460
- Pei Qian?
- Pei Qian?

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:32.820
Sorry.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:37.740
Quick!

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:38.900
Quick!

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.900
Catch him! Don't let him escape!

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.060
Pei Qian, stop!

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:44.980
Pei Qian!

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.620
Mr. Pei!

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.300
Pei Qian!

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.460
It's you, Mr. Pei?

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.300
Mr. Pei!

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.740
What? Mr. Pei, I...

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.180
Pei Qian!

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.500
Mr. Pei, what's going on?
