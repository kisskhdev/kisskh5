Your Majesty,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.699
I've been

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.500
weary in body and mind of late.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.179
I am in need of an assistant

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.899
to attend to you in my stead.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.020
Absolutely not.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.859
If you leave,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.219
who's supposed to advise me?

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.299
I have the perfect candidate in mind,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.699
someone I'm certain will suit
Your Majesty's tastes.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.380
The perfect candidate?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.980
Who?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.700
Get in here.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.940
Greetings, Your Majesty,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.700
I am Xiao Man.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.660
Look up.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.539
(My name is Xiao Man.)

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.020
(What's your name?)

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.419
(I can't say.)

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.219
(Alright.)

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.660
(I'll call you Big Flower then.)

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.659
(You look so sad.)

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.540
(Here, let me teach you how to dance.)

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.780
Is it really you?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.260
It's me.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.579
What are you doing?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.700
Get up.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.059
Tell me,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.860
how have these ten years been for you?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.220
It must have been so hard.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.700
No,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820
it must have been wonderful.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.899
No.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.579
It was just

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.340
an ordinary life.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.580
There's nothing worth telling.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.020
It's alright.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.540
I'm glad you're back.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.260
That's all that matters.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.260
Look at me.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.700
Have I grown

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.939
tall and majestic?

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.300
Handsome and dashing?

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.660

Your Majesty, it's time
for the morning court.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.420
It's not a dream.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.380
Please wash up, Your Majesty.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.379
Your Majesty,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.100
breakfast is ready.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.419
Alright.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.979
Come on.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.140
Let's go together.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.060
I wouldn't dare.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.660
How could I share a meal
with you, Your Majesty?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.739
From now on, between us,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.580
such formalities are unnecessary.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.379
It's alright.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.900
We have plenty of time ahead of us.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.980
How does it feel to be back?

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.140
Still the same as you remember?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.020
Everyone's the same,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.939
but it feels like
I'm the only one who's changed.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.380
And His Majesty?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.980
The place is the same.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.500
The people aren't.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.819
The arrangements have been made.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.260
You will formally succeed me.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.459
Beyond tending to his daily needs,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.979
you'll assist His Majesty
in reviewing memorials.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.059
This will free my hands

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.220
for more critical matters.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.059
Don't be fooled
by His Majesty's playful facade.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.979
Beneath it lies a meticulous mind.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.820
You must tread with the utmost caution.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.020
Yes, Godfather.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.899
I'm Xiao Man, newly appointed
scribe of the Directorate.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.460
You're here, Xiao Man.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.419
Come on.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.939
Let's go dance outside.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.899
Your Majesty,
there are many memorials today.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.579
We should attend to them first.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.019
Why won't you dance with me?

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.720
I want it to be just like
when we were little.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.499
Your Majesty,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.979
we have both grown up now.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.580
We must be proper.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.580
Matters of state must come first.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.859
For the last ten years, Jia Yi has been
the one handling these memorials.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.160
Whoever wants to deal with them
can deal with them. I'm not doing it.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.339
Half the court

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.859
answers to my aunt,

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.460
the other half to Jia Yi.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.540
What does it have to do with me?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.540
Xiao Man,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.020
now that you've taken his position,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.499
why don't you just
handle them from now on?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.580
Here.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.659
Then

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.900
I shall read the contents
of the memorials to you.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.139
Why bother reading them?

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.740
Just make your notations directly.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.060
As you command.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.379
"Severe flooding in Jiangnan

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.780
requires disaster relief funds."

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.360
Your Majesty, you should consult

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.139
with the Minister of Revenue
at tomorrow's court.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.180
Xiao Man,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.860
you've grown handsome.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.340
A bit thin, though.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.420
Want a chicken drumstick?

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.980
Reports from the border say

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.979
the Zhenzhe tribe might
be plotting something.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.099
You know,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.980
for the past ten years, I kept going
back to that dog hole to wait for you.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.300
The Grand Princess's position
on this matter is...

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.179
I just came up with a new dance.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.860
How about we try it together?

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.419
Your Majesty,

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.460
Your Majesty, please allow me
to review the memorials in peace.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.820
Right. Right.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.300
I'll stop talking.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.540
Xiao Man,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.500
why do you smell so nice?

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:05.819
Your...

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.900
Your Majesty,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.019
it's getting late.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.420
You should rest early.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.220
I'll take these memorials back
and finish reviewing them.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.580
Alright.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.939
I should go have breakfast too...

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.700
No, I mean,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.820
I...

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.900
I'll play around a bit longer.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.540
Go on ahead.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.020
See you tomorrow.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.780
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.420
What's going on?

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.900
Why does everything feel so off?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.500
Never mind.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.100
I should just sleep.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.899
It's been ten years, after all.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.340
A lot must have happened in that time.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.379
Even close friends

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.339
would feel awkward

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.060
meeting again after all that time.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.540
It's normal.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.260
It'll pass in a few days.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.100
Hang on.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.260
What's happening to me?
Why can't I stop thinking about him?

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.700
Your Majesty.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.300
Xiao Man?

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.540
What are you doing here?

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.819
Didn't you say I smelled nice?

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.100
I've brought you this sachet.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.660
When you smell it,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.540
it'll be like I'm right by your side.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.540
You smell nice.
