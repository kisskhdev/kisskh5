=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 13=

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:16.951
Big data is really helpful.

00:01:17.272 --> 00:01:21.231
It saves me from having to stay up late
watching surveillance footage.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:22.472
It's more efficient.

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:25.552
Unexpectedly,
after searching high and low,

00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.712
it was right under our noses all along.

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:34.272
The traffic police said
this car was towed here a week ago.

00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:39.192
It was found stuck in a drainage ditch
leading from Sishui River to the city.

00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:41.112
The road conditions are poor.

00:01:41.552 --> 00:01:43.871
Perhaps in the dark,
the driver didn't see it and drove in.

00:01:44.992 --> 00:01:46.712
The fuel tank's practically empty.

00:01:54.352 --> 00:01:56.552
There are cosmetic smudges
and some long hair

00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.752
on the bottom of the trunk.

00:01:58.992 --> 00:02:01.031
I'll take them back for testing

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:02.791
to confirm if they belong to the victim.

00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:30.872
The car accidentally ended up
in the ditch.

00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:32.951
It definitely wasn't part
of the killer's plan.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.752
So in panic, he wouldn't have had time
to properly clean the car.

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:36.551
Search carefully.

00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:37.951
We might find something crucial.

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:50.013
(Insulin Injection)

00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:54.752
Little Qian.

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:56.711
Yes?

00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:58.711
You're just standing there...

00:03:01.951 --> 00:03:04.111
Magnetic car camera.

00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.671
It must've fallen off
when the car jolted.

00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:27.192
Does the evidence we collected
directly link to this vehicle?

00:04:29.151 --> 00:04:29.951
Already tested.

00:04:30.192 --> 00:04:31.552
The wear patterns on the tires

00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:34.471
match the tire marks
at the riverside dump site exactly.

00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:37.911
Also, the dent on the rear of the car

00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:40.552
is basically identical
to the one seen in the video.

00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:42.591
On the trunk lining,

00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:46.232
I found cosmetic residue matching
the ingredients of the victim's makeup.

00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:48.591
And the hair was confirmed
to be the victim's.

00:04:49.112 --> 00:04:51.232
We also found the insulin
left behind in the car.

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:53.351
The suspect we just saw in the video

00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.632
is very thin.

00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:56.232
And he was sweating.

00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:58.711
So there was a lot of sweat residue
on the steering wheel.

00:04:58.872 --> 00:04:59.872
The DNA extracted from it

00:04:59.872 --> 00:05:01.351
matches what we found earlier.

00:05:03.232 --> 00:05:07.072
The car registration information shows
this car is registered under Huitongda.

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:08.351
Wang Meng confessed

00:05:08.511 --> 00:05:09.911
that he had his secretary

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.711
arrange this car for Zhan Qiuman's use.

00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:16.992
This person clearly didn't know
there was a dashcam in the car.

00:05:16.992 --> 00:05:19.271
He's most likely not from Huitongda.

00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:21.312
Then who could he be?

00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:23.471
Judging from the first video clip,

00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:25.632
the place where the suspect
put the victim into the car

00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:27.831
is probably not far
from the primary scene.

00:05:28.072 --> 00:05:30.232
It looks like a parking lot
of a residential complex.

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:33.232
It's just too dark
to make out any details.

00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:36.031
I can improve it.

00:05:37.632 --> 00:05:39.831
But look at this image.

00:05:44.232 --> 00:05:44.911
Well...

00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:46.992
Something "He" and something "Yuan"?

00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:51.271
Search citywide
for residential complexes

00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:53.471
with names
containing both "He" and "Yuan".

00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:56.711
The property management
should give us key leads.

00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.752
The property management
of Hexie Jiayuan has confirmed

00:06:08.752 --> 00:06:10.232
that the man is a tenant.

00:06:10.831 --> 00:06:12.632
But he's not the actual tenant.

00:06:13.192 --> 00:06:15.432
They have contacted the landlord
and the leaseholder.

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:16.920
The landlord is out of town.

00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:18.792
The leaseholder should be here shortly.

00:06:23.432 --> 00:06:24.391
Pang Xianglan?

00:06:25.432 --> 00:06:27.232
You rented apartment 1008?

00:06:29.192 --> 00:06:31.031
I-I rented it for my brother.

00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:34.112
Why did you suddenly call me here?

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.112
Has something happened?

00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:41.232
Is this man your brother?

00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:45.072
Yes.

00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:31.911
He's dead.

00:07:34.432 --> 00:07:35.632
Notify the forensic unit.

00:07:36.031 --> 00:07:36.911
Yes, Captain Leng.

00:07:58.792 --> 00:08:01.232
The time of death
is at least three days ago.

00:08:02.112 --> 00:08:06.591
The low temperature from the AC
slowed down the decomposition.

00:08:07.192 --> 00:08:08.112
It could be earlier.

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:13.232
He probably died
not long after dumping the body.

00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:17.711
The door lock was intact.

00:08:18.112 --> 00:08:19.391
He was alone in the apartment.

00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:21.872
Even though he knew he had diabetes,

00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:23.992
he still ate sweets and drank beer.

00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:26.872
Master, what do you think?

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:32.072
What's that woman's name?

00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:35.751
Pang Xianglan.

00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:36.991
And her brother?

00:08:39.072 --> 00:08:40.111
Pang Xinghua.

00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:51.231
Pang Xinghua's DNA matches the DNA found
under Zhan Qiuman's fingernails.

00:08:51.392 --> 00:08:53.312
(DNA Report)
Defensive wounds were found on his body.

00:08:53.912 --> 00:08:55.272
The estimated time of death is

00:08:55.272 --> 00:08:56.951
the day after Zhan Qiuman was killed.

00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:00.552
Signs of a struggle were found
at Pang Xinghua's apartment.

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:05.591
The shape of Zhan Qiuman's head wound
matches the edge of the end table.

00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:08.751
We can infer that Pang Xinghua's home
was the primary crime scene.

00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:14.552
His computer showed frequent logins
to overseas gambling websites.

00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:18.831
His phone also had calls and messages
from online loan companies

00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:20.111
demanding repayment.

00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:23.072
The due date
for his debts was a week ago.

00:09:24.111 --> 00:09:25.111
That means

00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:28.512
Pang Xinghua killed Zhan Qiuman
for money.

00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:34.751
The cause of Pang Xinghua's death
was ketoacidosis.

00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:37.231
It's a complication of diabetes.

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:39.111
If rescue is timely,

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:40.231
it might not lead to death.

00:09:40.991 --> 00:09:42.991
What was found
in the car was regular insulin.

00:09:43.512 --> 00:09:45.471
This means
Pang Xinghua needs multiple injections

00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:47.871
within a day to control his condition.

00:09:48.552 --> 00:09:50.591
However, based on the dash cam video,

00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:53.871
from loading the body
into the car to dumping it,

00:09:53.871 --> 00:09:55.111
and finally abandoning the car,

00:09:55.392 --> 00:09:57.552
it took about six hours in total.

00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:59.552
Lasting this long
without injecting medication

00:09:59.552 --> 00:10:01.192
is extremely dangerous for him.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.912
The elevator surveillance
didn't capture him moving the body.

00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:06.631
That means Pang Xinghua used the stairs
to move the body.

00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:08.032
Although the floor wasn't high,

00:10:08.032 --> 00:10:10.751
intense physical activity combined
with strong emotional stress

00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:12.152
would affect his endocrine system.

00:10:12.152 --> 00:10:15.231
For someone
with a disrupted endocrine system,

00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:16.751
it's quite dangerous.

00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:21.111
No other medication was found
in Pang Xinghua's home.

00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:24.871
Shouldn't he have gone to the hospital
immediately in this situation?

00:10:25.871 --> 00:10:30.111
The elevator surveillance shows

00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:31.631
that when Pang Xinghua returned,

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.831
dawn was approaching.

00:10:33.312 --> 00:10:36.631
We can't know how he returned home.

00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:38.912
He never came out after returning home.

00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:41.512
Pang Xianglan visited him once

00:10:41.512 --> 00:10:43.471
a few hours after he returned.

00:10:43.792 --> 00:10:45.991
But she stayed for only a few minutes
before leaving.

00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:50.312
At 7 AM in the morning after the crime,

00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:52.591
you went to see Pang Xinghua, right?

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:54.871
Why?

00:10:57.912 --> 00:10:58.792
My brother...

00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:02.351
I was just checking on him.

00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:13.176
According to communications list,

00:11:13.432 --> 00:11:16.831
Pang Xinghua called you 17 times
on the night of the crime.

00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:17.871
You didn't answer any.

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:19.552
Why?

00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:24.111
My phone was out of battery at the time.

00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:29.272
At 5 AM in the next morning,
Pang Xinghua called you again.

00:11:30.152 --> 00:11:31.432
But you answered.

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:32.951
What did you say?

00:11:34.432 --> 00:11:36.272
I had just charged my phone.

00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:39.631
I asked about why he called me

00:11:40.312 --> 00:11:41.792
and if he had taken his medication.

00:11:42.192 --> 00:11:45.231
After seeing that many missed calls,

00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:46.192
especially from family,

00:11:47.512 --> 00:11:48.991
anybody would call back immediately,

00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:50.552
fearing it might be urgent.

00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:03.392
This was captured

00:12:04.312 --> 00:12:06.631
when you left his home,
the night before the crime.

00:12:07.672 --> 00:12:09.272
You looked very emotional.

00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:11.471
What happened?

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:13.831
Nothing.

00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:16.672
I just had an argument with my brother.

00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:18.711
About what?

00:12:20.192 --> 00:12:21.392
What else?

00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:24.272
About money.

00:12:25.032 --> 00:12:28.672
His gambling debts were due soon,
and he couldn't pay.

00:12:29.751 --> 00:12:31.392
He wanted me to get him money again.

00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:34.672
I told him I couldn't.

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:37.032
Then he started a fight.

00:12:38.871 --> 00:12:42.111
So I left in anger.

00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:45.912
Did Pang Xinghua often ask you
to pay off his debts?

00:12:48.192 --> 00:12:52.351
He used my phone number
when borrowing money.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:56.951
I paid them off before too.

00:12:57.751 --> 00:12:58.951
Why not this time?

00:12:58.951 --> 00:13:00.711
I really had no way out.

00:13:01.351 --> 00:13:03.152
My salary is not high.

00:13:03.152 --> 00:13:04.631
I earn less than he spends.

00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:09.951
I've borrowed money
from everyone possible,

00:13:09.951 --> 00:13:11.792
like my friends,
colleagues, and clients.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.912
I honestly couldn't bring myself
to do that again.

00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:23.192
Do you know
about his relationship with Zhan Qiuman?

00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:28.871
They're from the same hometown,
so somewhat familiar.

00:13:29.072 --> 00:13:31.351
Did he know
about Zhan Qiuman's financial situation?

00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:34.591
He might have heard about it
casually in conversation before.

00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:36.871
Who knew he would...

00:13:39.272 --> 00:13:40.792
Man was a pitiful person too,

00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:43.432
just like me.

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:48.871
Tell us about your meeting
with your brother that morning.

00:14:20.056 --> 00:14:20.644
(Place Your Bets)

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:27.152
Are you trying to die?

00:14:27.432 --> 00:14:29.072
Don't you know how bad your health is?

00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:31.912
And you ate sweets and drank alcohol?

00:14:37.591 --> 00:14:38.312
What's wrong?

00:14:39.991 --> 00:14:41.072
Didn't get a shot again?

00:14:43.672 --> 00:14:44.591
Any medication at home?

00:14:44.912 --> 00:14:45.631
I'll get it for you.

00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:47.711
Xianglan.

00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:52.111
Xianglan, you have to help me.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:54.792
You must help me this time.

00:14:55.871 --> 00:14:56.951
If you don't help me,

00:14:57.512 --> 00:14:58.751
I'll die, Xianglan.

00:15:00.631 --> 00:15:01.272
Xianglan.

00:15:02.672 --> 00:15:04.512
Xianglan, I'm begging you.

00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:06.032
Xianglan.

00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:08.032
You have to help me.

00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:12.591
I genuinely thought
he was skipping his shots on purpose

00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:14.312
to force me into paying his debts.

00:15:15.032 --> 00:15:16.471
He had pulled the same trick

00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:17.512
a million times.

00:15:19.432 --> 00:15:20.351
I thought

00:15:21.272 --> 00:15:25.152
he'd eventually get his shot anyway.

00:15:26.032 --> 00:15:28.591
Did you know
he had no insulin left at home?

00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:31.272
That's what he told me.

00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:34.672
But I didn't believe him.

00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:42.711
Did you buy medication for him?

00:15:43.231 --> 00:15:44.912
Or did he buy it himself?

00:15:45.432 --> 00:15:46.392
Himself.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.991
He's a grown man.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.111
He should

00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:52.711
handle such basic things himself.

00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:55.351
It's been about a week

00:15:56.072 --> 00:16:00.392
since his death. During that time,

00:16:01.831 --> 00:16:03.351
you didn't contact him,

00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:05.512
nor visit him.

00:16:06.512 --> 00:16:07.512
What's the reason?

00:16:11.272 --> 00:16:13.672
I was furious then.

00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:17.512
I-I said harsh things.

00:16:18.072 --> 00:16:21.512
I told him I'd cut our ties

00:16:21.631 --> 00:16:23.351
and leave him behind to rot.

00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:26.272
I was truly exhausted.

00:16:27.912 --> 00:16:32.231
I've looked after him since childhood.

00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.792
I always supported him.

00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:43.192
I spent too much time
cleaning up his messes.

00:16:44.032 --> 00:16:44.831
I...

00:16:46.711 --> 00:16:47.552
I'm just...

00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:54.312
Did Pang Xinghua mention anything else
during the meeting?

00:16:56.471 --> 00:16:57.351
No.

00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:03.312
I scolded him and left.

00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:15.631
Master.

00:17:17.232 --> 00:17:18.351
Can we close this case?

00:17:19.631 --> 00:17:21.472
The evidence
against Pang Xinghua is solid.

00:17:22.032 --> 00:17:23.952
No doubts about his death either.

00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:25.911
We can proceed with formalities.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:27.272
Okay.

00:17:27.752 --> 00:17:28.952
How's another case?

00:17:31.312 --> 00:17:32.272
No movement.

00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:41.472
Two bottles of mineral water.

00:17:41.472 --> 00:17:41.752
(Order, Pick up)

00:17:41.752 --> 00:17:42.072
(Line up, Thanks)

00:17:42.072 --> 00:17:42.631
Got it.

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:53.472
I've paid.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:53.992
Thanks.

00:18:08.391 --> 00:18:10.671
I have two tickets to a theme park.

00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:11.831
Are you going?

00:18:12.312 --> 00:18:13.111
Not interested.

00:18:14.512 --> 00:18:16.191
The tickets are hard to get.

00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:17.911
Your crush has asked you out.

00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:21.631
You should reciprocate.

00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:23.552
If you don't go, I'll ask Little Zhao.

00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:28.752
You always ignore me.

00:18:28.752 --> 00:18:30.151
What are you looking at?

00:18:30.431 --> 00:18:32.312
Si Yuanlong, give it back to me.

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:32.871
Back off.

00:18:32.871 --> 00:18:34.191
I won't breathe a word.

00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:34.712
Give it back.

00:18:39.472 --> 00:18:40.631
You're mad again?

00:18:41.712 --> 00:18:43.111
Over something this small?

00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:49.072
So petty.

00:18:52.216 --> 00:18:54.912
(From Dan Qing, Are you free
this weekend? Let's meet up.)

00:18:59.552 --> 00:19:00.191
What is it?

00:19:04.472 --> 00:19:05.631
She is asking you out.

00:19:11.224 --> 00:19:15.686
(Outpatient)

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.072
(Neurology Room)

00:19:21.312 --> 00:19:22.032
You quack!

00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:25.952
Quack!

00:19:28.191 --> 00:19:28.952
Quack!

00:19:43.072 --> 00:19:44.351
Don't worry. Almost there.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:45.552
Move aside! Move!

00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:46.391
The button, please.

00:19:46.391 --> 00:19:47.431
Move! Coming through!

00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:48.431
Step aside!

00:19:48.911 --> 00:19:49.631
Let me through!

00:19:51.032 --> 00:19:51.472
Get in!

00:19:51.671 --> 00:19:52.856
The door can't be closed.

00:20:05.952 --> 00:20:07.431
Make way, please.

00:20:26.952 --> 00:20:27.552
Excuse me.

00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:28.992
Where's the broadcast station?

00:20:28.992 --> 00:20:29.911
Over there. That way.

00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:30.552
That way?

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:34.792
Attention, Leng Qiming's father,

00:20:34.992 --> 00:20:37.191
please come
to the broadcast station right now.

00:20:37.191 --> 00:20:38.591
Someone is here waiting for you.

00:20:39.952 --> 00:20:41.512
Attention, Leng Qiming's father,

00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:44.391
please come
to the broadcast station right now.

00:20:44.391 --> 00:20:45.911
Someone is here waiting for you.

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:52.888
(Operation Room)

00:20:59.151 --> 00:20:59.831
Careful.

00:21:08.072 --> 00:21:08.752
Dad.

00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:14.351
Dad.

00:21:15.351 --> 00:21:16.232
Who am I?

00:21:18.552 --> 00:21:19.831
Who am I?

00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:23.191
Who am I?

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.391
Who am I?

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:36.072
I'm your son.

00:21:36.992 --> 00:21:38.631
I'm your son.

00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:05.992
I asked you to pick a place,

00:22:06.512 --> 00:22:07.631
and you chose this?

00:22:08.272 --> 00:22:09.792
Tickets here must be hard to get.

00:22:11.391 --> 00:22:12.151
Not really.

00:22:12.552 --> 00:22:13.312
My friend gave me.

00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:18.992
I remember this area used to be a park.

00:22:20.911 --> 00:22:23.552
That Ferris wheel seems like
it was there before.

00:22:27.191 --> 00:22:28.728
I wanted to ride it when I was little.

00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:34.391
How about we do it now?

00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:36.992
The line probably won't be too long.

00:22:41.712 --> 00:22:43.032
I came here when I was a kid.

00:22:45.472 --> 00:22:47.151
Has it changed much?

00:22:48.072 --> 00:22:49.792
Even though it's changed quite a bit,

00:22:52.312 --> 00:22:54.111
it doesn't change how I feel about it.

00:23:00.992 --> 00:23:01.671
Let's go.

00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:08.472
- Thanks.
- I took them.

00:23:11.752 --> 00:23:14.792
After all these years, you still
like using ticket stubs as bookmarks.

00:23:16.272 --> 00:23:17.272
To keep as a memento.

00:23:35.391 --> 00:23:36.631
Which one are we taking?

00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:38.111
- This one?
- This one.

00:24:00.312 --> 00:24:02.072
Yunxi has changed a lot over the years.

00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:05.992
Some places are hard
to recognize at first glance.

00:24:09.312 --> 00:24:10.911
People really do change too.

00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:15.072
I remember you didn't like coming
to amusement parks before.

00:24:16.512 --> 00:24:18.831
What made you think
to suddenly invite me here?

00:24:38.552 --> 00:24:40.032
Where is the Ferris wheel here?

00:24:41.232 --> 00:24:42.472
It's right ahead.

00:24:42.472 --> 00:24:43.391
Can't you see it?

00:24:49.111 --> 00:24:49.831
Where?

00:24:51.191 --> 00:24:53.032
I can see it. You can't?

00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:07.391
Can you go with me to an amusement park
and ride the Ferris wheel?

00:25:08.992 --> 00:25:10.232
I hate amusement parks.

00:25:10.992 --> 00:25:11.671
Why?

00:25:11.952 --> 00:25:12.671
I'm over it.

00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:15.192
When I was little,
my nanny always took me there.

00:25:15.911 --> 00:25:16.752
Just once?

00:25:19.032 --> 00:25:20.111
How boring.

00:25:27.312 --> 00:25:28.151
Have some water.

00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:35.232
You don't dare?

00:26:09.992 --> 00:26:12.072
You must have a lot of questions, right?

00:26:15.952 --> 00:26:17.072
There's no one else here.

00:26:18.272 --> 00:26:19.591
And no one will hear us.

00:26:22.151 --> 00:26:23.272
Whatever you want to say,

00:26:24.591 --> 00:26:25.272
just say it.

00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:37.631
What exactly have you been through
these years?

00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:14.671
Your father's condition,

00:27:15.351 --> 00:27:16.871
like memory and cognitive impairment,

00:27:17.351 --> 00:27:19.191
has gotten worse than before.

00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:21.312
The new psychiatric symptoms,

00:27:21.911 --> 00:27:23.671
like hallucinations

00:27:23.752 --> 00:27:25.272
and aggressive behavior,

00:27:25.512 --> 00:27:27.552
indicate his disease has worsened.

00:27:27.992 --> 00:27:30.272
So, first, we'll do some standard tests.

00:27:30.552 --> 00:27:33.272
Then we'll schedule an MRI
as soon as possible

00:27:33.272 --> 00:27:34.272
to examine his brain.

00:27:35.831 --> 00:27:39.032
Doesn't this situation
require hospitalization?

00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:42.391
I need the test results
before I can diagnose.

00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:46.792
I think it hasn't reached the point
of requiring inpatient treatment yet.

00:27:47.391 --> 00:27:50.032
First, he still has self-care ability.

00:27:50.512 --> 00:27:51.191
Second,

00:27:51.952 --> 00:27:55.431
aggressive behavior occurs occasionally,

00:27:55.431 --> 00:27:56.631
but it's not persistent.

00:27:57.351 --> 00:27:59.591
Third, regarding cortical damage,

00:28:00.431 --> 00:28:04.831
neurological symptoms
are still relatively few at present.

00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:06.431
Therefore,

00:28:07.631 --> 00:28:09.512
hospitalization isn't very necessary.

00:28:10.072 --> 00:28:13.431
Besides, our hospital has limited beds.

00:28:13.631 --> 00:28:15.151
Generally, we encourage home care.

00:28:16.072 --> 00:28:16.831
After all,

00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:19.351
the home environment is more stable

00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:20.351
and pleasant.

00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:24.191
The care and comfort from family
are what the hospital can't provide.

00:28:27.671 --> 00:28:28.391
Take this.

00:28:44.111 --> 00:28:44.752
Master.

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:47.552
Can we close this case?

00:28:48.752 --> 00:28:50.631
The evidence
against Pang Xinghua is solid.

00:28:51.191 --> 00:28:53.111
No doubts about his death either.

00:29:28.272 --> 00:29:29.992
I heard from the neighbors

00:29:30.191 --> 00:29:33.391
that similar incidents have happened
many times in this neighborhood.

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:35.312
Not only that,

00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:38.296
but other neighborhoods
have had similar incidents too.

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.512
I called the community office.

00:29:41.072 --> 00:29:44.111
They said they're afraid
of children accidentally eating it,

00:29:44.631 --> 00:29:47.671
so they don't put out rat poison
like they used to.

00:29:49.552 --> 00:29:50.992
So where was that rat poison from?

00:29:52.472 --> 00:29:53.992
If it happened once or twice,

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:59.431
it could be an accident caused
by some rat poison buyers.

00:30:00.431 --> 00:30:01.831
But so many times?

00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:04.671
Could it be
that someone did it on purpose?

00:30:05.072 --> 00:30:06.151
We have

00:30:06.351 --> 00:30:07.792
received similar reports before.

00:30:08.272 --> 00:30:10.952
The cameras didn't catch anything,
so we couldn't find who did it.

00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:13.591
And even if something is caught,

00:30:13.591 --> 00:30:14.312
generally,

00:30:14.911 --> 00:30:17.391
pet cases are handled
by the public security administration.

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:20.232
At most, it's just a small fine.

00:30:22.272 --> 00:30:24.191
But since it's happened so many times,

00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:27.151
has the nature of the case changed?

00:30:27.552 --> 00:30:29.151
Anyway, it's a public security case,

00:30:29.712 --> 00:30:31.391
unless the value involved is high,

00:30:31.792 --> 00:30:35.391
or it causes a negative social impact.

00:30:40.312 --> 00:30:44.431
There are many messy incidents
because of dog ownership.

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:47.792
There are those with no manners at all,

00:30:47.792 --> 00:30:49.792
walking dogs without leashes.
Dogs bite people

00:30:50.151 --> 00:30:51.631
or startle the elderly.

00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:56.032
I heard a child in the western suburbs
was bitten by a rabid dog days ago.

00:30:56.431 --> 00:30:57.391
The kid didn't survive.

00:31:01.671 --> 00:31:02.792
You try to soothe your wife.

00:31:03.312 --> 00:31:05.151
She can raise a new pet.

00:31:08.431 --> 00:31:09.032
Alright.

00:31:09.512 --> 00:31:10.671
I'll keep you updated.

00:31:10.792 --> 00:31:11.512
Okay.

00:31:11.992 --> 00:31:14.151
But I can't guarantee any results.

00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:16.591
I'm off.

00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:18.871
Thank you.

00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:20.232
(No-Name Diner)
Goodbye.

00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:26.552
This was discovered
after screening the footage

00:31:26.552 --> 00:31:28.671
in the vicinity of Hexie Jiayuan.

00:31:29.391 --> 00:31:31.351
The day after Zhan Qiuman was murdered,

00:31:31.351 --> 00:31:33.631
that is, the day
Pang Xinghua is presumed to have died.

00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:38.072
Pang Xianglan's car appeared
on this path outside Hexie Jiayuan.

00:31:38.712 --> 00:31:40.631
She had stayed
for about an hour and a half.

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:43.512
During that time,
Pang Xianglan didn't get out of the car.

00:31:43.512 --> 00:31:45.111
Nor did she make any calls.

00:31:47.768 --> 00:31:51.257
(Jinhaiwan Road)

00:31:55.431 --> 00:31:56.072
Master.

00:31:56.512 --> 00:31:57.752
The club said

00:31:57.752 --> 00:31:59.032
Pang Xianglan has quit her job.

00:31:59.032 --> 00:32:00.191
She also moved

00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:02.431
out of her place
and didn't take any belongings.

00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:03.712
She just took that car.

00:32:15.351 --> 00:32:18.792
Do you also think
Pang Xinghua's death is related to her?

00:32:24.831 --> 00:32:28.911
She had stayed in the car
for an hour and a half.

00:32:30.032 --> 00:32:31.191
What was she thinking?

00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:32.752
Hard to say.

00:32:33.871 --> 00:32:36.032
If Pang Xianglan might be involved,

00:32:37.032 --> 00:32:38.792
should we take action immediately?

00:32:58.911 --> 00:32:59.712
Hello?

00:33:00.391 --> 00:33:01.792
Pay your debts,

00:33:02.032 --> 00:33:03.351
or I'll come after you.

00:33:11.272 --> 00:33:12.272
Stop calling.

00:33:12.712 --> 00:33:14.431
I won't repay any debt for him.

00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:17.512
I'm Leng Qiming from the CID.

00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:22.911
Have you already left Yunxi?

00:33:24.272 --> 00:33:25.431
Where are you going?

00:33:26.792 --> 00:33:27.952
Just traveling around.

00:33:29.272 --> 00:33:32.431
Maybe going somewhere far away.

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:39.712
Actually, Pang Xinghua confessed to you
about murdering Zhan Qiuman,

00:33:40.232 --> 00:33:40.952
right?

00:33:42.871 --> 00:33:43.952
We checked

00:33:44.072 --> 00:33:46.312
Pang Xinghua's health insurance card.

00:33:46.871 --> 00:33:49.431
We discovered that on the day
after Zhan Qiuman was killed,

00:33:49.752 --> 00:33:51.992
the same day Pang Xinghua died,

00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:54.351
someone used this card

00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:56.952
to obtain insulin from the hospital.

00:33:57.391 --> 00:33:59.272
And that person was you,

00:33:59.671 --> 00:34:00.591
Pang Xianglan.

00:34:03.232 --> 00:34:05.952
You parked your car
near Pang Xinghua's place

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.711
and had stayed in the car
for an hour and a half.

00:34:11.271 --> 00:34:13.231
I'm very curious.

00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:15.231
During those ninety minutes,

00:34:16.432 --> 00:34:19.591
Pang Xinghua was dying as time passed.

00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:21.791
What were you thinking?

00:34:28.992 --> 00:34:30.352
You're mistaken, officer.

00:34:32.912 --> 00:34:37.311
My brother never told me he killed Man.

00:34:39.552 --> 00:34:40.751
When we met that day,

00:34:42.952 --> 00:34:44.432
I truly thought he was faking it.

00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:49.311
I did go to the hospital afterward

00:34:50.111 --> 00:34:51.032
and got the medication.

00:34:52.432 --> 00:34:53.711
The reason I didn't go up is

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.591
we'd just had an argument, after all.

00:34:56.872 --> 00:34:58.032
I was still furious.

00:34:59.352 --> 00:35:03.151
Besides, I didn't know
he actually ran out of medicine.

00:35:07.151 --> 00:35:08.231
I've taken care of him

00:35:10.111 --> 00:35:11.791
for such a long time.

00:35:13.832 --> 00:35:15.111
I failed to discipline him.

00:35:16.952 --> 00:35:18.512
I betrayed our parents' trust.

00:35:20.392 --> 00:35:21.671
And I feel sorry for Man.

00:35:23.032 --> 00:35:24.711
I'll make it up
to them in the underworld

00:35:26.032 --> 00:35:27.392
when I die.

00:35:28.032 --> 00:35:30.872
You've looked after your brother
for so long.

00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:32.392
Now, he is dead.

00:35:33.072 --> 00:35:34.231
Aren't you sad?

00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:37.631
You think

00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:41.032
you'll live an easy life without him?

00:35:44.512 --> 00:35:45.271
I don't know.

00:35:46.631 --> 00:35:47.711
But I want to try.

00:35:54.671 --> 00:35:56.432
Pang Xianglan is heartless.

00:36:02.631 --> 00:36:03.432
What's wrong?

00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:08.631
Are you trying to die?

00:36:09.032 --> 00:36:10.032
You're drinking again.

00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:11.231
Xianglan.

00:36:12.432 --> 00:36:13.311
Help me.

00:36:19.791 --> 00:36:20.711
I killed someone.

00:36:21.432 --> 00:36:23.072
Who did you kill?

00:36:33.671 --> 00:36:34.311
Man.

00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:40.512
I urgently borrowed some money from her.

00:36:42.231 --> 00:36:43.751
But she...

00:36:44.151 --> 00:36:44.711
She...

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:48.512
In panic, I pushed her.

00:36:49.311 --> 00:36:52.072
Then she...

00:36:54.311 --> 00:36:54.912
Xianglan.

00:36:55.271 --> 00:36:56.552
Xianglan, I didn't mean that.

00:36:56.912 --> 00:36:58.231
I really didn't mean to.

00:36:58.751 --> 00:36:59.791
Xianglan, please help me.

00:37:02.352 --> 00:37:03.231
What is Man's body?

00:37:08.472 --> 00:37:11.032
I called you yesterday,
but you didn't answer.

00:37:12.552 --> 00:37:13.472
I was helpless.

00:37:15.472 --> 00:37:16.671
So I drove her car

00:37:18.352 --> 00:37:19.552
and threw her into the river.

00:37:23.151 --> 00:37:24.352
Did anyone see that?

00:37:26.591 --> 00:37:28.072
I don't know.

00:37:28.631 --> 00:37:29.392
I don't know.

00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:33.191
When you told Man to come find you,

00:37:33.711 --> 00:37:34.872
did anyone else know it?

00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:35.872
I don't know.

00:37:35.872 --> 00:37:37.832
How would I know
if she told someone else?

00:37:42.591 --> 00:37:43.151
You...

00:37:45.311 --> 00:37:46.352
You didn't take your shot?

00:37:47.872 --> 00:37:48.631
I did.

00:37:50.711 --> 00:37:51.512
I took it, I guess.

00:37:51.671 --> 00:37:52.631
Any medication at home?

00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:54.072
I'll get it for you.

00:37:54.231 --> 00:37:56.631
I remember I put it in the car.

00:38:02.591 --> 00:38:03.392
There's no medicine.

00:38:03.392 --> 00:38:04.832
Why didn't you get more?

00:38:05.552 --> 00:38:05.992
Xianglan.

00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:07.671
Hold on. Hang in there.

00:38:07.832 --> 00:38:09.392
I'll go buy medicine for you right now.

00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:10.392
Hang in there.

00:38:10.392 --> 00:38:11.231
Hang in there!

00:38:12.552 --> 00:38:13.191
Xianglan.

00:38:15.352 --> 00:38:16.032
Xianglan.

00:38:16.271 --> 00:38:18.111
Xianglan.

00:39:30.151 --> 00:39:31.151
If he doesn't get a shot,

00:39:32.072 --> 00:39:33.432
he'll die.

00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:37.791
If he gets it, you'll die with him.

00:39:39.631 --> 00:39:41.992
If he...

00:39:42.432 --> 00:39:45.432
He's my little brother!

00:39:45.952 --> 00:39:49.392
He just sees you as a cash machine.

00:39:50.271 --> 00:39:53.631
Before Mom and Dad passed,
they entrusted him to me.

00:39:53.631 --> 00:39:57.872
They said
our family line couldn't die out.

00:39:58.032 --> 00:39:59.872
He is a parasite.

00:39:59.992 --> 00:40:01.631
It's no big deal to lose him.

00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:05.111
He is doomed anyway.

00:40:13.231 --> 00:40:17.231
I can't just stand by and watch him die.

00:40:18.751 --> 00:40:19.671
I can't do it.

00:40:20.072 --> 00:40:22.392
Every time he dumped his mess on you,

00:40:22.872 --> 00:40:24.631
he didn't feel sorry at all.

00:40:28.671 --> 00:40:31.432
Anyway, I've been taking care of him.

00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:37.072
Maybe I just suffer
for a few more years.

00:40:37.671 --> 00:40:38.671
Just a few more years.

00:40:38.952 --> 00:40:41.311
But how much time is left for yourself?

00:40:42.832 --> 00:40:46.352
Are you really willing
to be dragged down by him

00:40:46.392 --> 00:40:47.912
until the day you die?

00:40:49.472 --> 00:40:52.591
You've just been brainwashed
by your parents.

00:40:53.271 --> 00:40:54.671
You're also their kid.

00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:58.432
Why should you
have to take care of their son,

00:40:58.432 --> 00:40:59.311
support him,

00:40:59.512 --> 00:41:01.111
and give in to him in everything?

00:41:02.072 --> 00:41:03.952
Why were you the one
supporting the parents

00:41:04.032 --> 00:41:05.512
and working hard to earn money?

00:41:05.512 --> 00:41:08.992
Yet they had been thinking of him
until their death.

00:41:12.591 --> 00:41:13.992
He's my brother.

00:41:13.992 --> 00:41:16.432
He's a grown man.
How could he live off of you

00:41:16.671 --> 00:41:18.591
like a parasite?

00:41:18.591 --> 00:41:20.631
- He will chew you up.
- He's my brother.

00:41:20.912 --> 00:41:21.992
Don't you hate him?

00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:23.952
- He's my brother!
- Have you never thought

00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:26.512
about getting rid of him?

00:41:27.472 --> 00:41:28.751
He is my...

00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:31.912
He's my brother.

00:41:33.671 --> 00:41:34.631
Be honest.

00:41:35.952 --> 00:41:39.191
Have you never thought
about killing him?

00:41:43.552 --> 00:41:44.392
He is...

00:41:46.472 --> 00:41:48.392
He's my brother.

00:42:29.832 --> 00:42:30.872
（I know

00:42:31.832 --> 00:42:36.191
you want to go far away from here.）
