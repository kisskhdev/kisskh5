Si Yuanlong.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:42.759
What is it?

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:43.800
Nothing.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.720
Do you remember our bet last time?

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.880
Of course. What do you want me to do?

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:50.119
Let me be clear.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.119
Don't push it.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.240
I wouldn't.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.960
It's actually about that volunteer event
the No-Name Diner keeps organizing.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.080
I want you to join in.
Are you interested in it?

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.240
Just that?

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.320
So did you ask me,
or did he let you ask me?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.759
Well...

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.840
Since when do you care
who asks you to volunteer?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.959
What?

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.840
If I ask you, you won't go?

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.400
But if Little Qian asks, you'll go?

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.959
It's Little Qian who asks.

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.959
Fine. I'll go.

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.040
Volunteering is a good thing.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.799
I'm really speechless.

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.239
Alright then, go ahead. I'm heading out.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:44.959
Remember to go.

(Roman International)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.720
Chen Zhi.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.479
We have some questions.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.320
Based on DNA comparison,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.199
the deceased is your father,
Chen Daning.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.239
He's really dead?

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.600
Then just do whatever you have to do.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.479
What kind of attitude is that?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.280
He was your biological father.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.040
Right.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.199
Biologically. And that's all.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.000
You're not suspecting me, are you?

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.919
Our shop's anniversary is this month.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.359
I'm busy all day long.

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.224
At the shop by day,
back to the dorm at night.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.199
My manager and colleagues
can vouch for me.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.440
Nothing more to say. I'm leaving.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.519
Wait.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.040
Tell us about Chen Daning.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.000
Like what?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.359
What could I possibly say?

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.624
Then we'll talk at the police station.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.519
What about your mother? Tell us.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.840
She died the year I graduated.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.519
Why?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.639
Haven't you investigated long enough

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.959
to know exactly
what kind of scum Chen Daning was?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.080
I don't want to say
a single word about him.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.640
If you really want to know,
go ask around the village.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.040
I left as soon as my mom died.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:23.479
He was never a father to me.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.479
Who was your father
close to in the village?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.119
Who'd want to be close to him?

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:32.999
Everyone avoided him like the plague.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.919
Only the wife of Xie, that simple-minded
woman, was fooled by him all day.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.840
Is Xie also a villager in Shipu Village?

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.559
By the name of Xie Hanguo.

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:46.400
He used to run an oil mill.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.720
Is that oil mill still running?

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:52.239
It was shut down after he died.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.319
He died?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.799
He died long ago.

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.119
He got hit
crossing the highway years ago.

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:58.919
It happened many years ago.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.200
From what you're saying,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.840
Xie Hanguo's wife and Chen Daning
had an improper relationship?

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:10.520
Xie Hanguo found
that simple-minded woman somewhere.

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.040
She wasn't quite right up here.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.160
It's said she didn't
even know her own name.

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.760
Xie Hanguo wasn't too bright either.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840
No idea where he found
that simple-minded woman.

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:22.840
As soon as Xie Hanguo died,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.999
Chen Daning latched onto her.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.879
Well, it might not be fair.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.999
He was definitely tricking her

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.439
and after the money Xie Hanguo
saved up from his oil mill.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.400
Do you know anything else
about Xie Hanguo's wife?

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:43.559
Well, she's dead too.

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:46.919
She and Xie had a son.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.520
He's in his twenties now.

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:50.879
I forgot his real name.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.520
Everyone in the village
just calls him Xie the Idiot.

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.720
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.520
They'll dock my pay for being out.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.359
Xie Wenle,
resident of Shipu Village, 24 years old.

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:10.720
Both of his parents are deceased.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.879
Regarding Xie Wenle's recent activities,

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.799
we've pulled his call records.

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:17.160
But we've found no valuable leads yet.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.960
Our colleagues went to Shipu Village
to investigate.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.400
Xie Wenle has been withdrawn
since childhood

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.600
and always keeps to himself.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.600
He doesn't seem close to anyone.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.999
Is there a car registered
under his name?

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:30.359
No.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.080
No driver's license either.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.960
About Chen Daning,

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:38.400
what did they say over in Shipu Village?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.200
Chen Daning

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.840
was known throughout the area
as a drunk and a gambler.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.200
He was lazy and shiftless.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.679
He relied entirely
on his wife's farming to get by.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.559
After learning of Chen Daning's affair
with Xie Wenle's mother,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.720
his wife drank pesticide
and killed herself.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:59.080
Not long after Xie Hanguo passed away,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.679
Chen Daning moved in
with Xie Wenle's mother.

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.040
It's said he was after the money
Xie Hanguo left behind.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.359
What was the relationship like
between Chen Daning and Xie Wenle?

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:12.720
We don't have many leads on that yet.

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:15.400
Captain Leng,
we'll verify all these details,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.280
including Xie Wenle's connection
to Chen Daning,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.840
Xie Wenle's biological mother,

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.359
and Xie Hanguo's financial status.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.160
Right now, the forensic unit
is screening vehicles on the dump route.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.919
But there are no results yet.

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:35.799
Chief Xu.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.999
Should we suspend Ye Qian's duties
in the Major Crimes Unit for now?

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:40.720
I'm worried he can't handle both.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.999
I trust him.

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:45.600
Okay.

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:50.520
Panicking won't help.

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:53.239
We have to search slowly, right?

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.799
Yeah.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.319
Take a few days off.

00:07:57.799 --> 00:08:00.200
Think of it as giving yourself a break.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.720
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.040
It'll be good for your health.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.720
Get yourself back in shape.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:08.999
Then we can welcome the next chef

00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:10.760
and go all out. Right?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.200
Right?

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:29.799
Found it!

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:34.240
No, not a chef. It's the case.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.559
I've got something here.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.679
I'll hang up now.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:47.919
Captain Leng,
we found the suspect vehicle.

00:08:48.439 --> 00:08:49.040
Yes.

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:53.079
The camera captured
the suspect dumping the body.

00:08:53.719 --> 00:08:55.040
But it was too far away.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.696
And he wore a hat, obscuring his face.

00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:59.120
But the license plate number was clear.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.400
Yunxi BH6320.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.880
Alright, I'll look up
the vehicle information.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.079
The owner is Li Dong.

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:15.640
(Lighthouse Night Market)

00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:27.839
Are you the owner?

00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:37.439
Stop!

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:44.520
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:46.400
Stop!

00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:50.400
What's that?

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.760
Move!

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.520
Police!

00:09:53.319 --> 00:09:53.959
Don't run!

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.799
Stop!

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.599
Stop!

00:09:59.079 --> 00:09:59.839
It'll hit people.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.760
That's dangerous.

00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:10.719
Freeze! Why did you run?

00:10:10.719 --> 00:10:11.240
Wait.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.360
Officer,

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.040
my arm's about to break. Easy.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.959
Take him away.

00:10:16.439 --> 00:10:17.240
Easy.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.400
Arrest her.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.559
She drove into me.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160
Why are you here?

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:26.640
Why can't I be here?

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.360
I just did a heroic act, right?

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.160
Instead of thanking me,
you interrogate me?

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:33.360
How lame.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.679
That's not what I meant.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.760
Come on, let's grab a drink.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.480
I'm still on duty.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:43.599
Next time.

00:10:45.439 --> 00:10:46.160
Thanks.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.719
(It's too tight.)

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.640
(Do you know Chen Daning?)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.679
(Who?)

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.919
Chen Daning from Shipu Village.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.079
I don't know him.

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:27.919
This van is yours, right?

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.360
Yeah, it's mine.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.160
Explain this.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.079
Why was your van at the scene
where Chen Daning's body was dumped?

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:40.599
Body was dumped?

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.360
Wait. What body?

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:45.240
Behave.

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:47.799
Speak! Why did you kill Chen Daning?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.240
I don't even know who Chen Daning was.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.799
I don't know him at all.

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:54.959
I've never even heard his name before!

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.839
What about Xie Wenle?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.679
Xie Wenle?

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:02.959
You mean Xie the idiot, right?

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:04.760
What about him?

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.199
He killed someone?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.040
I have absolutely nothing to do
with that.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.000
I'm not close to him at all.

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:14.880
Then tell me what you know.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.919
Well,

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:20.799
Xie the Idiot, no, Xie Wenle.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.640
He lives in Shipu Village.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.319
He renders cooking fat.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.760
He's actually pretty good at it.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.040
Our relationship is purely business.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.160
I just

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.400
give him the pork, pig offal, lard,
and that sort of thing I collect.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.799
He renders it into oil for me.

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:41.000
Each time, I leave my van with him.

00:12:41.439 --> 00:12:43.439
When it's done, he calls me.

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:45.959
Then I go pick up
both the oil and the van.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.959
That's all I know.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.360
His place has a backyard.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.559
He does all the rendering back there.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.079
Captain Leng.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:31.679
Over here.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.719
I've seen this bag before.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.520
It's probably been around
since his dad ran the oil mill.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.679
He left it to him.

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:51.640
This is a saw.

00:14:52.439 --> 00:14:53.559
I haven't seen this.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.319
Well, I really haven't seen this thing.

00:14:57.319 --> 00:15:01.799
I have no idea how he deals
with all the pork and offal.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.040
I've never even been in that backyard.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.000
You have no idea.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.079
Oh my, that smell is unbearable.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.040
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.199
It wasn't me.

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:03.799
Xie Wenle.

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:04.839
It wasn't me.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.680
Come out.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.159
Don't arrest me.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.920
Don't arrest me.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.319
Don't arrest me.

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:16.639
Look, I put my gun away.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.480
Come out.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.720
Over there.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.720
Captain Leng.

00:18:49.639 --> 00:18:50.319
Captain Leng.

00:18:50.639 --> 00:18:51.520
Captain Leng.

00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:52.920
Captain Leng.

00:18:59.359 --> 00:18:59.960
Captain Leng.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.240
Captain Leng.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.440
(Chen Daning's blood
was found on Li Dong's van.)

00:19:29.319 --> 00:19:31.559
(We also found his DNA
on the cutting equipment)

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:33.359
(in your basement.)

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.200
(Why did you kill Chen Daning?)

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.319
What was your connection to him?

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.680
Why did you kill him?

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.720
Why dismember his body and dump it?

00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:49.680
Where is Chen Daning's head?

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.720
Answer me, Xie Wenle.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.319
Speak.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.119
Little idiot.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.520
Little idiot.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.520
You're ignoring me, huh?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.319
I am your stepdad, after all.

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:23.960
Can't even call me Dad?

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:27.680
You're just like your stupid mom.
A retard.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.319
Give me some money.

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.960
No money.

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:40.960
No money?

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.319
30,000 yuan. Not much.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.319
Really no money.

00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:48.480
Say that again?

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:52.319
I know about that shady business
you people run.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.440
No money?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720
Who do you think you're fooling?

00:20:56.879 --> 00:20:57.520
Get over here.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.720
Come here.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.879
What's with that van outside?

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.319
What's going on?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.520
Whose van is it?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.720
My friend's van.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.559
Your friend's van?

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.760
A retard like you has a friend?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.359
You have a friend?

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.879
It's that short guy's van, right?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.159
He's been coming and going here
so many times.

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:18.639
You think I haven't seen?

00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:22.599
You two are making a fortune

00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:24.680
off rendering that rotten pork,
aren't you?

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.680
Listen up, idiot.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.040
Do you know what this is?

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:29.599
It's illegal. You know that?

00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:30.520
Illegal.

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:32.280
If the police find out,

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:34.839
they'll lock you in a dark cell.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.000
Remember?

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.879
Just like when your dad
used to lock you in that dark room.

00:21:39.879 --> 00:21:40.879
Darker than that.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.000
A drooling idiot like you

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.920
will never get out, I'm telling you.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.280
Never get out. Understand?

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.879
I'm telling you,

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:50.799
30,000 yuan.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.599
Stupid idiot.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.680
That short guy.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.960
Do you know he's scamming you?

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.920
You refine all that oil
for him to sell in the city.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.920
Do you know how much money that makes?

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:19.240
He's taking advantage of you, you idiot.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.960
From now on, let's work together.

00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:26.240
To keep the profits
in the family, right?

00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:28.760
We'll talk about this later.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:32.920
Just give me that 30,000 yuan now.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.159
The debt collectors
are breathing down my neck.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.720
No money.

00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:40.680
No money?

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.079
Is that the only thing
you know how to say?

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.799
Don't make me lose my temper.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.240
No money?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.559
Really no money.

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:54.879
You're not giving it to me?

00:23:55.599 --> 00:23:57.920
Fine, you stupid idiot.

00:23:58.319 --> 00:23:59.760
Think you're all grown up now?

00:24:00.879 --> 00:24:02.720
Alright, just you wait.

00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:06.520
Tomorrow I'm going to the police
station to report you.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.720
I don't believe I can't deal with you.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.040
Your mother and I are legally married.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.639
We have the marriage certificate.

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:20.399
This house and this yard.

00:24:20.399 --> 00:24:22.920
Your mother transferred it all to me.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.040
I took pity on you

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.680
and kindly adopted you.

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:30.920
Don't be ungrateful.

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:41.520
Just wait till the police arrest you.

00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:47.119
You know what? I'll sell the house

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.000
and the yard.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.879
I'll sell all this junk.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.440
I'll make sure you never get out.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.639
Just rot in there.

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:58.119
I'll sell it all.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.599
N-no money.

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:22.799
N-no.

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:24.879
N-no money.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.240
N-no... dark room.

00:25:30.599 --> 00:25:34.639
(N-no... dark room.)

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.960
Dark room? What dark room?

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.280
Dark room.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.799
Xie Wenle,

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.280
I don't care

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.000
about your reasons or concerns.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.480
Since you're sitting here,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.960
- just...
- No dark room.

00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:48.720
No dark room.

00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:50.639
No dark room.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.520
(Dark room.)

00:25:55.639 --> 00:25:56.599
(No dark room.)

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.520
No dark room.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.680
Dark room.

00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:01.960
Master.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520
Send him for psychiatric evaluation.

00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:07.639
His arm should be fine.

00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:14.680
Do you think he might be faking it?

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.159
Fooling us is easy,

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:19.520
but fooling
professional psychiatrists isn't.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.720
If both his parents
had some form of mental illness,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.359
heredity could be a factor.

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:28.000
If that's true,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.119
then his parents' marriage was invalid.

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:35.720
His father found some crazy woman
to marry and have a kid.

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:36.960
It was illegal to begin with.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.079
Frankly, the victim
wasn't exactly a good guy either.

00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:41.639
Why else would his own son disown him?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.319
Xie Wenle had it tough.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.760
But murder is illegal, no matter what.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.896
(Remember to get a tetanus shot.)

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.799
What a mess.

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:05.440
We never thought this would happen.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.904
- After Xie Hanguo died?
- Totally unexpected.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.639
We didn't hear anything.

00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:10.040
- We didn't hear it. We were...
- We didn't hear it.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.720
Captain Leng.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.440
Right over there.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.480
Otherwise, I'd have called the police.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.480
I didn't hear it. I was working.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.000
Master,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.119
I've actually had a question all along.

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:38.599
A victim like Chen Daning

00:27:38.879 --> 00:27:41.720
had a terrible reputation
and strained family ties.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.119
To dispose of his body,

00:27:43.839 --> 00:27:47.119
Xie Wenle could've buried it
in the mountains or in his own yard.

00:27:47.839 --> 00:27:49.639
No one might've found it for years.

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:53.079
But instead, he chopped it to pieces

00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:54.480
and dumped it on the highway

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.720
without avoiding cameras.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.960
It instantly made it a major case.

00:27:58.639 --> 00:28:00.520
That's practically
begging to get caught.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.520
Too many details here don't add up.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.359
But if he truly has a mental illness,

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.319
that will actually explain everything.

00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:15.920
Thank you.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.920
Captain Leng,

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.720
according to villagers
and village officials,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.520
Chen Daning was confirmed
to be an alcoholic and gambler.

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:25.639
After Xie Hanguo's death, he started
harassing Xie Wenle's mother.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.839
He also swindled away
all the savings left by Xie Hanguo

00:28:28.839 --> 00:28:29.720
and blew it all.

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:31.799
After Xie Wenle's mother died,

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:34.240
he started harassing Xie Wenle
from time to time.

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:36.359
He was still after money.

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:39.720
Some people even heard him
bragging while drunk,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.720
claiming he'd found a way to get rich

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:44.960
and he could seize the land
from Xie Hanguo's family.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.319
What about Xie Wenle's parents?

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.119
Villagers only know she was found
by Xie Hanguo while he was selling oil.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.119
But she did have mental issues.

00:28:57.399 --> 00:28:58.119
She rarely spoke.

00:28:58.119 --> 00:28:59.520
Sometimes she acted erratically.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.639
Xie Hanguo probably feared
she'd run away,

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:05.159
so he kept her locked in a room.

00:29:05.319 --> 00:29:07.240
After Xie Wenle was born,

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.839
he finally let her out.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.559
Also, Xie Wenle was often beaten
and abused by Xie Hanguo as a child.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.680
The same room in their house

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.559
held both Xie Wenle's mother

00:29:18.879 --> 00:29:20.200
and, later, Xie Wenle.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.240
Because Xie Hanguo thought
Xie Wenle was stupid.

00:29:24.879 --> 00:29:25.680
Captain Leng.

00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:27.000
Captain Leng,

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.839
we found it.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.440
This room?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.920
Yes, the dog alerted.
Definitely human remains here.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.000
This is the dark room
Xie Wenle mentioned?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.639
Right.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.359
Secure the scene.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.079
Wait for the forensic unit.

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:48.799
Yes.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:51.200
Move out.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.240
Duan, set up a perimeter.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.040
Yes.

00:30:11.896 --> 00:30:14.418
(No-Name Diner)

00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:16.159
Here.

00:30:16.639 --> 00:30:17.399
- Take care.
- Thanks.

00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:18.399
- Bye.
- We're off.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.319
Drinks for both of you.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.440
Okay.

00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:25.920
Have you finished studying?

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.399
And you're already gaming?

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.440
Look at Chang. He has
top grades and is still diligent.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.639
Go do your homework.

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:33.599
Okay.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.680
Hush now, little one.

00:30:37.399 --> 00:30:38.480
Need anything else?

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:39.599
Sorry.

00:30:39.599 --> 00:30:41.680
We haven't seen this place so lively
for a while.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.799
Let me feed you. Here.

00:30:44.879 --> 00:30:45.440
Come on.

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:46.559
Later, we'll go...

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:47.119
Enjoy.

00:30:47.399 --> 00:30:49.119
But the food now

00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:51.079
isn't as good as
that made by the last chef.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.480
Try it.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.639
Be grateful there's food.

00:30:53.639 --> 00:30:54.960
Stop being picky.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.240
How's your injury healing?

00:30:59.879 --> 00:31:00.680
Fine now.

00:31:03.639 --> 00:31:04.680
Be more careful next time.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.839
Don't charge recklessly

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:08.319
regardless of their weapons.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.440
Have some broccoli.

00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:15.399
Master.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.839
Since Xie Wenle's diagnosed
with limited mental capacity,

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.648
regarding sentencing...

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.240
There's nothing more we can do.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.520
The rest depends
on the prosecutor's office.

00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:40.879
(No-Name Diner)

00:31:40.879 --> 00:31:41.480
Hello?

00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:45.159
Is our son asleep?

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.200
I just wanted to talk to him.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.200
If he's asleep, don't wake him.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.000
I didn't get to spend much time
with him this visit.

00:31:56.079 --> 00:31:56.760
Okay.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.960
Next time I'll make it up to him.

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:04.280
Take care of yourself too.

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:05.399
Okay.

00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:06.960
Bye.

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:12.760
Master, I'm heading out first.

00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:14.559
Are you free later?

00:32:15.159 --> 00:32:15.960
Why?

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.520
Let's go to...

00:32:20.079 --> 00:32:20.680
Okay.

00:32:55.608 --> 00:33:00.000
(Strict Discipline)

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.680
Guns are our weapons against crime

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.399
and our last line of defense

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:07.319
in life-threatening situations.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.240
This mission is exceptionally dangerous.

00:33:10.599 --> 00:33:11.799
Stay safe out there.

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:57.359
Why alone? Where's your master?

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.839
In a meeting.

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:00.839
The Sishui River

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.359
sees drownings every year
from illegal swimming.

00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:04.839
No amount of warning signs helps.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.720
But she was wearing jeans.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.279
Unlikely she came to swim.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.840
What do we know?

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.000
The victim is a young female.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.679
Based on physical development,
the estimated age is around 25.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.679
Swabbing the mouth and nose

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.199
comes back with heavy silt.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.679
I thought she was still breathing
upon entering the water,

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.960
meaning ante-mortem drowning.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.079
But after carefully examining her body,

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:31.159
I found a fatal injury on her head.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.719
It was a wound caused by violent impact.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.679
Therefore, homicide is a possibility.

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:38.880
If the body was dumped after death

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.520
and the victim stopped breathing
before entering the water,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.040
she couldn't have inhaled silt.

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:45.199
But there's one exception,

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.400
passive respiration in water.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:50.480
She might have been sucked in
by a sand dredger's suction pipe,

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.920
and the body's chest cavity
was compressed underwater,

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.079
causing the victim
to passively inhale silt.

00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:57.920
Ye,

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.520
contact our field officers
to investigate.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.800
and find a sand dredger

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.800
that's been operating nearby
in the past few days.

00:35:15.736 --> 00:35:17.960
Sand dredging has long been banned
on the Sishui River.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.759
- There are still sand dredgers?
- Yeah.

00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:22.480
My dad's really into night fishing.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.920
I hear him complain every day.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.679
He says those dredgers rumble all night,

00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:26.920
scaring all the fish away.

00:35:27.279 --> 00:35:28.920
Doesn't maritime control handle that?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.639
They do.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.000
My dad and his fishing buddies
have reported them countless times.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.960
But the ships now are all modified.

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:35.759
They're fast

00:35:35.759 --> 00:35:36.840
and highly elusive.

00:35:37.079 --> 00:35:38.320
It's like playing whack-a-mole.

00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:40.279
I just remembered.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.239
His fishing buddies

00:35:42.239 --> 00:35:45.000
are more into reporting the dredgers
than into fishing.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.599
They share tips daily in a group chat.

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:47.520
I'll ask my dad later

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.279
to see if anyone's photographed
that dredger recently.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.599
Any news from your dad?

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:28.759
Not yet.

00:37:28.759 --> 00:37:30.159
But he's asked his fishing buddies.

00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:30.960
Any moment now.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.199
What's for lunch?

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.719
Whatever.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.840
Whatever? Fine.

00:37:35.279 --> 00:37:36.639
Please accept this banner.

00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:39.440
We really can't accept it.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.320
It's just our duty.

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:43.800
This is my small token of appreciation.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.000
Please take it.

00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:46.279
Solutions for the people.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.279
Service with a heart.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.400
That's the duty of the police.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.880
We can't accept it.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.719
Thank you.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.000
But why won't you take it?

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.679
Why can't you accept the banner?

00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:56.759
Is there something wrong

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.679
with these words?

00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.759
No, right?

00:37:59.759 --> 00:38:00.119
No.

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:01.079
They're facts, right?

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:03.400
If it weren't for your keen observation,

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.559
could the case be solved?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.679
Wu Da framed me.

00:38:08.159 --> 00:38:09.679
And you solved the case

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.599
and brought justice for Xiaole.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.920
So I feel I should express something.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.199
Please accept it, okay?

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.679
You're too kind.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.880
Really, no need.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.559
Oh my.

00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:22.279
He's here to present
a commendation banner?

00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:27.559
I know my spying was wrong.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.759
Rest assured.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.759
I will never do such a thing again.

00:38:30.759 --> 00:38:31.400
No conscience.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.800
Please accept this small token.

00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:36.559
It was a joint effort
by field officers and the forensic unit.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.159
Now the gratitude
only goes to you field officers?

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.360
Never mind.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.199
We're noble
and willing to be unsung heroes.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.000
Say that in front of my master.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.400
Reformed ones mean good people.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.639
Take it back.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.639
Alright.

00:38:55.639 --> 00:38:56.239
(Dan Qing)

00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:57.040
Thank you.

00:38:57.639 --> 00:38:58.400
Everyone, disperse.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.199
Enjoy your meal.

00:39:04.199 --> 00:39:04.880
Thanks.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.279
This way, please.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.159
Thanks.

00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:16.000
You're welcome.

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:27.920
Sorry, I'm late.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.800
No problem, I just got here too.

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:33.119
What's the sudden lunch about?

00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:35.199
I wanted to see you.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.159
It was heroic of you last time.

00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:46.679
I haven't had a chance to thank you yet.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.960
Do you remember
what you said to me before?

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:55.040
What did I say?

00:39:57.639 --> 00:40:01.759
You said you'd always stand
on the side of the light.

00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:08.639
You still remember that?

00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:16.480
Come on.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.759
To you.

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:22.000
I don't drink. Thanks.

00:40:24.279 --> 00:40:26.040
A little red wine won't get you drunk.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.159
To our wonderful reunion.

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:25.520
You're looking a bit tipsy there.

00:41:25.559 --> 00:41:26.559
Need a ride?

00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:30.000
No, I've called a cab.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.199
Alright. I'll head out first then.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.360
Let's meet up again soon.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.559
Can he endure this physically?
