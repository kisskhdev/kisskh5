00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:40.902

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:45.902
Come on, brother!

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:11.139
Attention.

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:12.560
Pro�i me, brate.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.680
All right.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.696
What, is it broken?

00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:52.309
Hello, my brother!

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:53.654
Come on.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.466
Let go.

00:01:57.885 --> 00:01:58.885
It's just you, brother.

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:00.124
Roll five.

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.690
I have to go back, brother.

00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:14.575
Brother, answer one question before you go.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.022
How did he die?

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:27.273
He was shot.

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:31.387
We could have run away, but I insisted on going back for Spider.

00:02:31.978 --> 00:02:33.558
So we have to go back.

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:36.301
It's not your fault. How did he die?

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.219
We shouldn't have been there.

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:43.860
It's my fault they caught us, because I disobeyed orders.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.300
It was just you and the girl.

00:02:56.062 --> 00:02:57.062
Hello, my brother.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.300
Skxawng (stupid).

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.738
I killed my brother.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.892
Whatever happens, I will have to carry this burden for the rest of my life.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:53.233
I wish I could do that.

00:03:53.678 --> 00:03:55.578
I wish I could do that.

00:03:57.146 --> 00:04:00.347
I wish I could be underwater again.

00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:02.941
Yes, you beat me without the mask.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.426
« So » the boss?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.300
Let's try and see the result.

00:04:08.325 --> 00:04:10.324
Watch out for snakes, watch out for snakes.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.440
So you know, huh?

00:04:35.532 --> 00:04:40.300
The fire of hatred is only the ashes of sorrow.

00:04:40.853 --> 00:04:43.300
My mother grieves the old-fashioned way,

00:04:43.694 --> 00:04:46.614
singing the story of her son's life during the eclipse.

00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:50.300
Because the light always comes back eventually.

00:04:59.287 --> 00:05:03.306
There is the way of the Na'vi, and there is the way of my father.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.300
Silence, preoccupation with work.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.300
The inhabitants of the reef say that the sea purifies you.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.300
It erases your sins.

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.494
"a to nosi"?

00:06:09.378 --> 00:06:12.153
You should have collected guns, I think you're useless.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.626
Focus, my child.

00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:20.514
Don't let your mother see it.

00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.640
Excuse me. We are sorry.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.811
Tuk.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.889
Bras.

00:06:43.297 --> 00:06:44.297
Amusing.

00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:46.597
What is this?

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
Tsireya.

00:06:50.058 --> 00:06:51.558
“to be written off”?

00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:55.528
It's an assault rifle, right?

00:06:56.033 --> 00:06:58.033
Here is the magazine, where the bullets are stored.

00:06:58.058 --> 00:06:58.988
It's empty.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.060
I'm sure of it.

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:03.119
Zaka�i.

00:07:03.543 --> 00:07:05.699
And there you have it! You can shoot.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.846
You can kill a lot of celestial beings with this.

00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:09.505
Look, ceramic mechanism.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.033
Clean it with oil, it will be as good as new.

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:15.173
This is not the way of the Na'vi, Jake Sully.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.300
Metal weapons are prohibited.

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.013
Zna� to.

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.738
Touch poisons the heart.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.300
Eywa ſe show put.

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:29.099
The time of mourning is not over.

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:33.647
Tuk, you should be with your family, instead of picking up this stuff.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.300
Your wife needs you.

00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:40.919
My son rests with his ancestors on the ridge.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.368
This is our house.

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:45.510
I said I'd stay and fight, but no

00:07:45.522 --> 00:07:47.734
They can fight warships with spears.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.001
We have sunk the demon ship.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.300
The sky beings are afraid of us now.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.300
Yes, we were lucky.

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.159
But they still have many ships.

00:07:57.226 --> 00:07:59.225
At least we have that.

00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:03.292
We're delighted to have you on board, Jake Sully.

00:08:03.413 --> 00:08:06.879
We do not need weapons, but the rider of the last shadow.

00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:12.403
A rider of the Great Toruk, as you once were.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.800
When you ride this creature, you become a part of it.

00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:22.526
And the more blood, the worse.

00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:27.169
I will no longer be Toruk Makto.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.240
Jake Sully, you are still Toruk Makto.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:36.213
Let's go, Rotxo.

00:08:41.726 --> 00:08:43.126
Can you hear me?

00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:46.231
Yes, we hear you perfectly. Keep going, Dom.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.300
We searched the wreckage, inside and out.

00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.300
We carried out the search within a radius of 200 meters.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.268
There are no Na'vi bodies.

00:08:55.303 --> 00:08:56.953
Just the crew. All right.

00:08:57.813 --> 00:09:00.114
Their remains. We will continue the research.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:03.500
We need to widen the search radius. I understand.

00:09:03.525 --> 00:09:06.524
Note: I didn't find anything. No algae.

00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:09.055
Halo.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.160
Sully is still on the loose somewhere.

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:14.276
We don't know if the vultures took the body away.

00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:16.300
No, he managed to escape.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.775
And it is located in this region.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.830
There are only a few villages left, give me a boat and I...

00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:24.536
I already gave you the ship. It lies at the bottom of the sea.

00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:27.560
Yes, with my crew.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.300
They are all dead.

00:09:29.982 --> 00:09:35.578
You took me 26 trillion miles on one mission.

00:09:35.723 --> 00:09:39.073
Kinetic attack on a man.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.300
I won't be able to relax.

00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:47.533
All right. Good morning.

00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:50.231
Are you leaving me here?

00:09:57.685 --> 00:10:00.513
The spirits of my ancestors are in the port.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.020
This is our strength.

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.300
I can help you sort this out, Lo'ak.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.350
Non!

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:15.226
It is destroyed!

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.260
Everything I touch is destroyed.

00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:25.206
They never talk about it.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:28.199
But it is in destruction.

00:10:29.046 --> 00:10:31.046
Like a snoring denador.

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:36.300
I know you will never let go of your bow.

00:10:38.147 --> 00:10:39.624
That's why...

00:10:44.136 --> 00:10:46.086
Don't get too close when this happens.

00:11:04.926 --> 00:11:08.166
Zna�i tue Ronal ?

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958
I will not oppose my husband in front of this woman.

00:11:17.388 --> 00:11:19.113
Look, I'm a Marine.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.080
A knife is not equivalent to a gun.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.980
Not even a prayer.

00:11:28.703 --> 00:11:30.253
What should I do?

00:11:31.543 --> 00:11:33.815
I can't run away. I can't fight.

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:35.233
Is that correct?

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:37.179
Eywa ſe show put.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.575
Eh ? And where is Eywa? Where was Eywa when our son…

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.860
Jake !

00:11:44.196 --> 00:11:46.646
I'm in a place where there is nothing.

00:11:47.819 --> 00:11:50.219
Not my people. Not my forest.

00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:53.980
Even my father's bow is missing.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:12:00.243
I only have faith.

00:12:01.018 --> 00:12:03.556
And here is the plan of the Great Mother.

00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:08.092
There is this family.

00:12:21.736 --> 00:12:23.086
And then there's me.

00:12:25.113 --> 00:12:27.165
I love you very much too.

00:12:50.034 --> 00:12:52.300
Everyone comes to listen to the prayer.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.119
It's incredible!

00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:41.862
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:49.977
It was crazy, Kaz.

00:13:50.061 --> 00:13:51.467
Hello my brother.

00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:56.126
That's what you told me.

00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:01.005
It's a shame that Tulkun is still an outcast.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.951
Yes, even if he saved us all.

00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:07.271
Excuse me, but according to Tulkun's custom, it is his responsibility to bear this debt.

00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:11.758
He bears the debt of all those who fell in battle.

00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:16.293
Sorry, you should have saved us all.

00:14:16.318 --> 00:14:17.711
No problem.

00:14:18.005 --> 00:14:20.005
We are still brothers.

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:26.051
For all people? Forever.

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:39.851
Papa!

00:14:44.304 --> 00:14:45.903
Wait, where's the spare tire? I think it's in the basket.

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:47.236
Wake up ! Come to your senses!

00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:49.368
Where is the spare mask? What ?

00:14:49.393 --> 00:14:51.512
Where is the spare mask? He was there. Where is he?

00:14:51.537 --> 00:14:53.423
Look at ! He's not here.

00:14:53.448 --> 00:14:54.245
Talk to me! Where is he?

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.985
I can't find it! Quickly !

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.676
Where? Come on, quickly!

00:14:57.701 --> 00:15:00.609
I found it, Dad! Quickly, I found it!

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.300
Diii. Diii.

00:15:10.925 --> 00:15:14.875
Deep and slow.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.701
There you go, everything is fine. All right.

00:15:17.173 --> 00:15:19.128
How are you.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.300
Skxawng (stupid), you have to be careful.

00:15:24.325 --> 00:15:26.062
Look, that's my name, Skxawng (stupid).

00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:27.722
You have to be more careful than me, darling.

00:15:27.747 --> 00:15:29.547
Attention ! Stay away!

00:15:32.444 --> 00:15:34.276
Yes, you have to be careful.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.083
Skxawng (stupid) is there, in the middle.

00:15:39.342 --> 00:15:42.300
Treacherous wind! They are coming!

00:15:43.756 --> 00:15:45.300
The traitor's wind is approaching!

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.300
Come on ! Quickly !

00:15:47.728 --> 00:15:49.046
Let's go!

00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:15.133
Bonjour!

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.450
Bonjour!

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.106
Look!

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:42.300
Look, it won't take up much space.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.995
As long as he doesn't cause any problems.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.312
Get on your knees, come on. Hit.

00:16:47.337 --> 00:16:49.300
Come on, Kiri, Kiri, please.

00:16:49.325 --> 00:16:51.325
Children, sit down.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.351
Your mother and I have made a decision.

00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:03.483
Spider, you will stay alone at the upper camp.

00:17:03.508 --> 00:17:05.209
What ? The treacherous wind will catch up with you.

00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:07.107
No, dad. No way.

00:17:07.301 --> 00:17:08.536
Hey, Spider!

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:10.981
We cannot live with a mask day and night.

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:12.764
I just want to stay here with you.

00:17:12.803 --> 00:17:15.052
I know, but it's too risky.

00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.425
It's not fair.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.148
Please, you are the only family I have ever known.

00:17:19.173 --> 00:17:20.517
It's what's best for you.

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:22.263
But dad is our best friend.

00:17:22.288 --> 00:17:23.652
Do we think we are doing wrong?

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:27.142
It's too dangerous. You can die simply because the mask is no longer powered.

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:29.166
It belongs to this species.

00:17:29.294 --> 00:17:32.293
Mom, what kind are you talking about?

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:33.984
Mom. Extraterrestrial?

00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:36.319
Kiri. That's enough. Stop.

00:17:36.353 --> 00:17:39.071
You hate them too much, that's all you see.

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:41.393
We I Spider.

00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:42.991
Please, Jake.

00:17:43.016 --> 00:17:45.410
Madame Sully, I won't disturb you. You know it.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.903
Dad, this isn't normal.

00:17:46.928 --> 00:17:48.509
The spider is part of this family.

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:51.890
He will never be part of this family.

00:17:54.584 --> 00:17:57.300
Transport by caravan is the safest solution.

00:17:57.325 --> 00:17:59.000
No, please. Leave today.

00:17:59.025 --> 00:18:01.348
I can't. Okay, it's decided.

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.276
It's a family. It is not a democracy.

00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:06.300
All right ? I hate you.

00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:08.300
It's the best, my son. No.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.300
Don't touch me!

00:18:11.443 --> 00:18:12.443
It's good.

00:18:13.937 --> 00:18:15.390
Do you understand? No.

00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:18.663
I already lost my brother.

00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:20.769
I don't want to lose anyone else.

00:18:26.756 --> 00:18:29.017
The Sully family must stay united.

00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:32.239
Yes, that's the family motto.

00:18:36.435 --> 00:18:38.798
Absurd. It's not fair.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.300
All right. Hey, what do you think of this?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.300
We will all accompany him.

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:44.514
Gauche?

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.119
You said you wanted to see your grandmother.

00:18:48.144 --> 00:18:51.126
Yes, it will be a family adventure.

00:18:55.983 --> 00:18:56.983
Yes, that's good.

00:19:10.188 --> 00:19:11.684
Hey, stay here.

00:19:14.043 --> 00:19:17.571
Our offer only concerns the boy in pink.

00:19:17.596 --> 00:19:20.390
That won't cause any problems. You're already in trouble.

00:19:20.623 --> 00:19:23.973
A trader must understand that he cannot choose his side.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:29.300
Having Toruk Makto on board is like taking sides in this war.

00:19:30.062 --> 00:19:31.544
You may be wrong.

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:34.666
Toruk Makto was never aboard your ship.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.880
But if he were to board,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.083
He and his wife would be happy to fly as an escort and protect your caravan.

00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:48.690
Maybe so.

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.707
Mangkwan's attackers are now becoming more aggressive.

00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:55.988
All right. I agree.

00:20:02.138 --> 00:20:03.462
Odve�iu�e!

00:20:04.301 --> 00:20:05.695
Come on.

00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:10.276
Odve�iu�e!

00:20:16.127 --> 00:20:18.300
Listen ! Listen !

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.300
Tsireya! Lo'ak!

00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:24.300
Ready to board!

00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:27.300
Ready to board!

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:29.183
Quicker, stop!

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:39.276
The wind is blowing! Hang in there!

00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:41.300
Lift it, bend it into the wind!

00:20:41.301 --> 00:20:43.457
Voice ! Voice !

00:20:51.753 --> 00:20:54.199
Life on a boat seems easy!

00:21:01.163 --> 00:21:02.900
The wind is blowing!

00:21:58.247 --> 00:22:00.861
Everyone grieves in their own way.

00:22:03.898 --> 00:22:06.985
For me, it's isolation here.

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:12.158
I feel it too.

00:22:13.683 --> 00:22:15.069
Brother, look at this!

00:22:15.475 --> 00:22:17.991
I hear his voice in the gusts of wind.

00:22:33.462 --> 00:22:34.418
Hold this.

00:22:43.776 --> 00:22:45.300
Dad, I've been thinking about it.

00:22:45.325 --> 00:22:48.350
I better get a gun, and I can fly with you.

00:22:50.405 --> 00:22:52.579
This won't happen. For what ?

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.475
He taught me how to shoot.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.300
I know what I'm doing.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.873
Put on your communicator, I called you five times.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.300
Install the communicator.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.300
First rule.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.936
You can't do that either.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.413
One of them.

00:23:26.063 --> 00:23:27.004
“to ima”?

00:23:27.198 --> 00:23:29.351
I promised this guy a photo if he came.

00:23:29.376 --> 00:23:30.685
If he gains strength.

00:23:31.658 --> 00:23:34.692
Long-range patrols spotted them as they entered our airspace.

00:23:34.717 --> 00:23:36.453
The route he takes.

00:23:36.708 --> 00:23:38.079
You are then upgraded.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.656
Smile, you fool.

00:23:45.134 --> 00:23:47.432
Wind, 1350 today.

00:23:48.008 --> 00:23:50.620
We have the coordinates. Get ready.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.450
Merci.

00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:08.300
Follow him!

00:24:08.794 --> 00:24:10.069
Follow him!

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:27.030
Your package.

00:24:27.069 --> 00:24:29.068
I'm fine, there's still plenty of time.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.300
Get over it.

00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:58.300
Jake! Back!

00:24:59.974 --> 00:25:02.640
Here's my radar, weapons ready. Check the status!

00:25:08.287 --> 00:25:10.300
I'm going there. Jake, drive!

00:25:10.325 --> 00:25:11.865
Run! Quickly !

00:25:12.301 --> 00:25:14.300
Come on, come on. It's safe.

00:25:25.247 --> 00:25:26.254
Quickly!

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:28.279
Protect your brother! I understand, Lord!

00:25:28.772 --> 00:25:30.094
Stay under cover.

00:25:58.903 --> 00:26:00.473
Spider! This way!

00:26:03.586 --> 00:26:05.065
Damn then, my communicator!

00:26:18.495 --> 00:26:20.521
Stay with the girls. We are safe.

00:26:24.631 --> 00:26:26.160
He must stay here.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.861
Non!

00:26:54.456 --> 00:26:55.489
Let's go!

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:12.383
Of the!

00:28:00.647 --> 00:28:03.041
I'm burning!

00:29:07.263 --> 00:29:08.409
Quickly ! Quickly !

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.769
Ahead ! Ahead ! Come on !

00:29:10.914 --> 00:29:12.102
Quickly!

00:29:19.093 --> 00:29:21.198
Spider... Come on, quickly!

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.300
Let's go!

00:29:49.022 --> 00:29:51.240
Hej, Neytiri, �uje� li moi ?

00:30:01.483 --> 00:30:02.813
People, Lo'ak! Where?

00:30:02.838 --> 00:30:04.730
Come on, we have to catch it! Quickly !

00:30:05.982 --> 00:30:07.829
Lo'ak! Ska�i !

00:30:07.861 --> 00:30:10.172
Lo'ak, ska�i! Brzo!

00:30:10.328 --> 00:30:11.636
Quickly!

00:30:11.661 --> 00:30:12.855
Come on, everyone!

00:30:25.476 --> 00:30:26.562
Oh no, Lo'ak!

00:30:27.556 --> 00:30:28.161
Ah !

00:30:36.025 --> 00:30:36.738
Oh!

00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:40.020
Hold on, Tuk!

00:30:50.075 --> 00:30:52.231
Spider! Kiri! My leg!

00:30:56.251 --> 00:30:57.180
Voice!

00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:01.518
How are you ? Tuk, are you okay?

00:31:01.711 --> 00:31:04.091
Knock knock, hey, are you okay?

00:31:04.116 --> 00:31:06.991
Yes, are you sure? Yes, you are sure.

00:31:07.023 --> 00:31:09.303
Duo, duo.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.895
I'm sorry.

00:31:11.194 --> 00:31:13.353
I'm sorry. It's nothing.

00:31:24.836 --> 00:31:25.836
Bon of!

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.440
Brother, my rescuer is on the boat.

00:31:28.476 --> 00:31:30.866
What ? My spare mask is on this boat.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.980
Damn it, Kiri, stay here.

00:32:23.527 --> 00:32:25.389
We have to go! Damn!

00:32:27.202 --> 00:32:28.643
Quickly, we have to go!

00:32:28.668 --> 00:32:30.344
Kiri, come on, they're coming!

00:32:31.387 --> 00:32:32.226
Quickly!

00:32:35.833 --> 00:32:38.320
They're coming, come on, quickly!

00:32:38.345 --> 00:32:40.242
Continue, quickly!

00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:43.737
Kiri, go, go Tuk!

00:32:43.769 --> 00:32:45.158
Come on, quickly!

00:33:09.596 --> 00:33:11.713
They are very close! They are very close! Quickly !

00:33:19.493 --> 00:33:22.795
What did they miss, Tsahik, look?

00:33:29.553 --> 00:33:30.433
Non…

00:33:38.007 --> 00:33:39.041
Follow me.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.923
Come on, Tuk... this way!

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:03.752
To be!

00:34:09.771 --> 00:34:15.035
They're coming, Tuk, come on, this way, quickly!

00:34:16.496 --> 00:34:17.243
Keep moving forward,

00:34:21.364 --> 00:34:26.356
Come on, this way, we need to get to the water quickly!

00:34:26.381 --> 00:34:27.754
Come on, quickly!

00:34:27.779 --> 00:34:28.514
Look at !

00:34:28.547 --> 00:34:30.111
Come on, Tuk, swim!

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:35.423
Look at !

00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:37.695
I've got you, Tuk, calm down.

00:34:37.767 --> 00:34:39.426
What is our motto?

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.141
We must stay together.

00:34:41.444 --> 00:34:42.881
No, the other one.

00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:44.440
We never give up.

00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:47.124
That's right, we never give up.

00:34:50.885 --> 00:34:51.980
Vide.

00:34:52.528 --> 00:34:53.528
Gauche!

00:34:53.913 --> 00:34:55.787
Lo'ak, followed by Tuk.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.780
Gauche!

00:35:02.323 --> 00:35:03.323
Gauche!

00:35:04.327 --> 00:35:05.327
Spider!

00:35:07.327 --> 00:35:09.121
Come on, quickly!

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.680
Eagle eye, can you hear me?

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.409
Lo'ak, my son, answer me.

00:35:37.232 --> 00:35:38.872
Neytiri, me?

00:35:42.449 --> 00:35:44.299
Neytiri, Neytiri, uje me?

00:35:46.267 --> 00:35:48.106
Neytiri, in uje.

00:35:51.712 --> 00:35:52.712
Look at !

00:35:54.393 --> 00:35:55.663
And!

00:35:56.598 --> 00:35:57.598
Look at !

00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:02.185
Come on, grab it, I've got you.

00:36:08.274 --> 00:36:10.220
Is everyone okay? Are you doing well ?

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.434
Are you sure, brother? Yes I'm dong well.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.900
Do you see them?

00:36:23.776 --> 00:36:26.188
No, let's hide.

00:36:26.213 --> 00:36:27.592
�elim i�i ku�i.

00:36:27.617 --> 00:36:28.876
Tuk, come on.

00:36:29.003 --> 00:36:30.502
I'm tired and I'm hungry.

00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:31.380
I know.

00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:33.264
�elim i�i ku�i. Ku�i.

00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:34.588
They don't know who we are.

00:36:34.794 --> 00:36:36.553
We have no communication.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.080
We are alone.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.856
Brother, I need a mask.

00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:43.280
What should we do?

00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:45.644
I don't know, why am I in charge?

00:36:45.669 --> 00:36:48.159
Calm down, we have to do something.

00:36:48.184 --> 00:36:49.184
Tiéina.

00:36:50.556 --> 00:36:51.556
Lo'ak.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.648
Shit, shit, shit! We need to get back to the ship.

00:36:54.673 --> 00:36:57.162
No, we can't turn around. They are between us and the ship.

00:36:57.187 --> 00:36:59.797
No, this is our last position.

00:36:59.822 --> 00:37:01.197
Dad will look for us there.

00:37:01.222 --> 00:37:02.580
Brother, no, we can get around them.

00:37:02.605 --> 00:37:04.535
That's a good idea, how?

00:37:07.132 --> 00:37:09.542
This way, come on, follow me everyone.

00:37:16.106 --> 00:37:17.679
It's over, Jake.

00:37:23.542 --> 00:37:24.990
Don't move.

00:37:29.144 --> 00:37:30.035
Is that what you caught?

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.399
Non.

00:37:31.937 --> 00:37:34.337
I know, you always act smart, right?

00:37:34.649 --> 00:37:36.528
Raise your hands. Hands!

00:37:39.518 --> 00:37:40.820
I already killed you.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:46.765
Turns out I don't die easily, Corporal.

00:37:50.645 --> 00:37:51.507
Non!

00:37:54.059 --> 00:37:56.253
Help me.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:09.983
Ah, it's you, corporal.

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:12.353
He is not a coordinator.

00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:14.413
They call themselves the People of Ashes.

00:38:15.742 --> 00:38:17.171
What is this?

00:38:17.196 --> 00:38:18.425
Did they massacre the crew?

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.701
They take the enemy's fingers as a sign of power?

00:38:20.814 --> 00:38:22.777
It's worse than death for them.

00:38:25.633 --> 00:38:27.133
Do you mean the victims?

00:38:27.158 --> 00:38:28.497
The children have disappeared.

00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:30.766
That's a lot of energy.

00:38:30.911 --> 00:38:32.610
He therefore did not perceive the mass change.

00:38:32.652 --> 00:38:33.752
He doesn't have much time left.

00:38:33.866 --> 00:38:36.366
And even then, provided that the People of Ashes haven't caught him before.

00:38:36.662 --> 00:38:38.222
We need to take care of these children immediately.

00:38:38.675 --> 00:38:40.216
or you'll never see him again.

00:38:43.556 --> 00:38:44.623
Do you follow him?

00:38:44.648 --> 00:38:46.547
This is not our mission, so what do we do?

00:38:46.572 --> 00:38:49.862
If you follow him, we're wasting our time, Colonel.

00:38:49.887 --> 00:38:51.687
Boss, he's here.

00:38:53.386 --> 00:38:55.426
Oh, his handcuffs.

00:38:55.654 --> 00:38:56.654
In what sense?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.838
Oh, you didn't kill me. Again.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.166
Look over here.

00:39:10.988 --> 00:39:13.403
The river must be in front of us. Come on !

00:39:21.108 --> 00:39:22.191
Bonjour!

00:39:22.796 --> 00:39:25.805
No, you're stuck here. What can we do?

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.343
Monkey, save your air. Look at me.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.505
Inhale slowly.

00:39:31.986 --> 00:39:34.369
Lo'ak, can you carry it? Yes, I can.

00:39:34.408 --> 00:39:36.568
Come on, brother, take the first step.

00:39:36.593 --> 00:39:37.593
Come on.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.223
The child is in the water.

00:39:58.248 --> 00:39:59.407
Intelligent.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.369
No, no, no!

00:40:15.201 --> 00:40:18.566
Great Mother, save him first.

00:40:18.591 --> 00:40:20.131
You are welcome.

00:40:20.263 --> 00:40:21.809
You know his brain is dying.

00:40:21.834 --> 00:40:22.834
Please.

00:40:24.859 --> 00:40:26.820
Calm down, everything will be fine, brother.

00:40:27.007 --> 00:40:28.007
Inspire.

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:30.430
Gauche.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.870
Kiri, we have to go, come on.

00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:41.981
Come on, we have to go.

00:40:42.014 --> 00:40:45.896
We can't stay here. We have to go home.

00:40:46.516 --> 00:40:48.015
Let's move, we have to leave.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.517
Carry it, take it.

00:40:50.341 --> 00:40:51.341
Kiri, come on.

00:40:57.743 --> 00:40:58.901
Stop!

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.432
Bring him here. Kiri, stop.

00:41:03.714 --> 00:41:05.873
Quickly. Stop.

00:41:06.018 --> 00:41:07.220
Obey my order.

00:41:11.897 --> 00:41:13.566
Drop it here.

00:41:27.525 --> 00:41:29.440
Stani. Kiri, what's up?

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.894
“to be written off”?

00:41:34.263 --> 00:41:35.317
“to be written off”?

00:41:35.794 --> 00:41:38.793
I'm not sure, but it seems right to me.

00:41:38.907 --> 00:41:39.907
has ?

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:42.904
Silence, I can't speak.

00:41:55.726 --> 00:41:57.574
Lo'ak, Lo'ak.

00:42:27.006 --> 00:42:29.943
Mask, take it off.

00:42:29.968 --> 00:42:31.967
What ? He can breathe.

00:42:35.425 --> 00:42:36.327
Come on.

00:43:21.121 --> 00:43:25.170
Left, Left, Left, Left.

00:43:27.008 --> 00:43:28.920
Crazy, found.

00:44:03.493 --> 00:44:05.475
I'm sorry.

00:44:20.484 --> 00:44:21.592
Spider.

00:44:42.903 --> 00:44:44.210
Diem

00:44:45.214 --> 00:44:48.110
Yes, Monkey, you breathe.

00:44:51.585 --> 00:44:54.807
I am dead, this is the world of ghosts.

00:44:56.673 --> 00:44:59.253
No, you're still here.

00:45:00.793 --> 00:45:02.838
Diem

00:45:03.214 --> 00:45:04.211
Et.

00:45:04.903 --> 00:45:06.683
Diem

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.609
Diem

00:45:09.105 --> 00:45:10.615
Diem

00:45:11.814 --> 00:45:14.153
It seems I no longer need it.

00:45:15.226 --> 00:45:17.365
Yes yes.

00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:20.771
No, silence, calm down.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.213
Merci.

00:45:26.859 --> 00:45:29.323
Thank you for everything you have done.

00:45:31.162 --> 00:45:32.810
Damn, back!

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.377
Wait.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:57.470
Gauche.

00:46:04.214 --> 00:46:05.353
Tsahik.

00:46:29.457 --> 00:46:31.873
How can he breathe without a mask?

00:46:32.598 --> 00:46:36.731
I can't think about it now. We have to go back.

00:46:38.059 --> 00:46:44.200
Isn't our air toxic to celestial beings?

00:46:52.523 --> 00:46:56.112
Are you living each day to the fullest?

00:46:57.725 --> 00:46:59.800
Because it is Eywin's will.

00:47:05.828 --> 00:47:06.840
Which?

00:47:07.893 --> 00:47:08.893
Et.

00:47:10.892 --> 00:47:17.160
Ako eggs sada zavr im, ho and the Eywa do give them spaces?

00:47:18.277 --> 00:47:21.280
Come on, let me go. They're going to kill him.

00:47:21.281 --> 00:47:22.960
Thoughts?

00:47:25.866 --> 00:47:33.014
No. Your goddess has no power here.

00:47:33.039 --> 00:47:36.076
Come on, come on. Give me this knife.

00:47:40.957 --> 00:47:42.016
Instructional.

00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:51.780
Of.

00:47:55.016 --> 00:47:57.406
Show me how it works.

00:48:04.019 --> 00:48:07.493
Show me how to create thunder. I can't do it.

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:10.313
Empty, no thunder. Make thunder!

00:48:11.971 --> 00:48:14.487
Empty. Make it work!

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.141
I tell you, I tell you, there is no thunder.

00:48:19.293 --> 00:48:21.210
Kill the youngest.

00:48:21.242 --> 00:48:23.449
No, don't, please don't!

00:48:37.517 --> 00:48:38.930
Drop your weapon.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.700
Down.

00:48:44.701 --> 00:48:45.860
Don't use weapons!

00:48:46.714 --> 00:48:47.923
Back to square one.

00:48:48.174 --> 00:48:49.105
Of the!

00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:50.861
Come on.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:56.985
Back up, back up, back up.

00:49:00.085 --> 00:49:01.881
Dad. Sully, are you okay?

00:49:01.906 --> 00:49:02.697
Ready?

00:49:02.722 --> 00:49:04.209
Okay, children, follow me.

00:49:04.234 --> 00:49:07.266
Okay, get out of here.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.207
Follow me, follow me. Back !

00:49:25.321 --> 00:49:27.525
Not, dad!

00:49:33.454 --> 00:49:35.954
Come on, move!

00:49:45.053 --> 00:49:48.021
Don't, don't, dad!

00:50:05.034 --> 00:50:09.173
You are strong, this man is imposing.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:15.660
Of.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.740
Show how to create thunder.

00:50:22.845 --> 00:50:24.440
It's a joke.

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:30.980
See?

00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:37.086
Now take aim, what do you want to destroy?

00:50:38.913 --> 00:50:40.766
Exactly like that.

00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:45.461
Et.

00:50:47.906 --> 00:50:49.196
Continue.

00:50:55.293 --> 00:50:56.900
It's great, isn't it?

00:51:13.086 --> 00:51:15.295
I don't need you anymore, Skyman.

00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:18.502
Tell him to be good! On your knees!

00:51:18.534 --> 00:51:20.812
Prepare another one.

00:51:31.666 --> 00:51:32.740
Neytiri.

00:51:33.798 --> 00:51:34.940
Put it down.

00:51:35.434 --> 00:51:36.434
Wait.

00:51:37.871 --> 00:51:40.295
Neytiri, we saved you. Are you doing well ?

00:51:40.328 --> 00:51:42.261
How are you ? We saved you.

00:51:42.286 --> 00:51:44.085
Doctor, prepare for surgery.

00:51:44.124 --> 00:51:45.818
On the fourth floor.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:06.417
They are really crazy.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.468
Come on, everyone.

00:53:46.387 --> 00:53:47.387
Come on.

00:53:49.286 --> 00:53:50.550
Quickly!

00:54:01.882 --> 00:54:03.369
Hey, where's the girl?

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.042
Come on, help her.

00:54:05.667 --> 00:54:07.531
This way. Come on.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:10.930
Come on.

00:54:15.359 --> 00:54:16.900
I'm ready. Come on !

00:54:24.097 --> 00:54:25.160
Tsahik.

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:28.980
They have already left.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.632
We will carry out aerial searches.

00:54:46.502 --> 00:54:47.502
Slowly, slowly.

00:54:49.628 --> 00:54:51.308
No, no!

00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:53.900
My children. Neytiri.

00:54:53.925 --> 00:54:55.616
My children! Calm down!

00:54:55.641 --> 00:54:57.440
Calm down. My children.

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:00.635
My children. Where are they ?

00:55:02.189 --> 00:55:03.189
Where are they ?

00:55:20.358 --> 00:55:22.476
Come on, quickly. Max, turn me on.

00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:23.932
Yes yes. Are we ready?

00:55:23.957 --> 00:55:26.974
We are ready. Okay, let's not waste time calibrating.

00:55:28.528 --> 00:55:31.427
You must rest under my control. Don't forget.

00:55:31.452 --> 00:55:33.331
Good luck. THANKS.

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:36.804
Are there means of transportation?

00:55:37.313 --> 00:55:38.152
Non.

00:55:40.633 --> 00:55:43.108
Okay, let's go.

00:55:50.129 --> 00:55:51.631
I'm sorry.

00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:00.636
It's good.

00:56:12.063 --> 00:56:14.221
We are sure of it. Yes.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:19.852
We now come to unfinished business.

00:56:24.686 --> 00:56:26.679
“to putli”, Rose?

00:56:29.491 --> 00:56:31.223
We still have our evening.

00:56:36.679 --> 00:56:38.285
Yes, I'm a little tired.

00:56:41.033 --> 00:56:42.041
Et.

00:56:43.193 --> 00:56:45.068
Yes, I will save it.

00:56:46.807 --> 00:56:50.333
In case this enemy appears.

00:56:53.634 --> 00:56:55.126
Yes, absolutely.

00:57:05.824 --> 00:57:07.640
You and your wife made the right choice.

00:57:07.641 --> 00:57:08.736
I admit it.

00:57:09.727 --> 00:57:11.443
He's a good boy.

00:57:12.421 --> 00:57:14.136
He's a great guy.

00:57:16.333 --> 00:57:20.252
But that doesn't mean we'll agree.

00:57:21.352 --> 00:57:22.812
I will continue to put you down.

00:57:22.845 --> 00:57:23.684
Jake.

00:57:23.709 --> 00:57:24.708
If necessary.

00:57:27.321 --> 00:57:30.436
All this time, he still doesn't understand.

00:57:32.296 --> 00:57:36.316
This world is much more complicated than you imagine.

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:40.339
You saw it this evening.

00:57:41.548 --> 00:57:42.773
With her.

00:57:43.944 --> 00:57:45.253
With him.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:47.833
It doesn't matter.

00:57:49.679 --> 00:57:52.918
The color of my skin doesn't matter.

00:57:54.236 --> 00:57:57.251
I still remember which team I'm fighting for.

00:57:59.234 --> 00:58:01.111
The scene has changed, Colonel.

00:58:02.061 --> 00:58:04.325
Just open your eyes.

00:58:25.925 --> 00:58:27.396
There they are. Here's the rest.

00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:28.750
Wake up. Come on, we have to move.

00:58:28.775 --> 00:58:29.697
Quickly ! Quickly !

00:58:29.999 --> 00:58:31.697
Come on, we have to move.

00:58:35.593 --> 00:58:36.348
It's good.

00:58:36.373 --> 00:58:39.295
They are with us! Hey !

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:46.631
Jake. Hi, Sam.

00:58:46.663 --> 00:58:49.249
On the left, Rock. Just kidding, are you sure?

00:58:49.395 --> 00:58:51.189
I need you to find us.

00:58:51.874 --> 00:58:53.308
What was it?

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:57.280
Mom ! Mother ! Knock!

00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.285
RIGHT. LEFT.

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.564
Lo'ak.

00:59:03.396 --> 00:59:06.173
Jake, are you okay?

00:59:06.393 --> 00:59:09.390
Everything is fine. You are safe.

00:59:10.403 --> 00:59:11.653
Hi, Norm.

00:59:14.033 --> 00:59:15.278
How are you doing?

00:59:18.397 --> 00:59:19.720
has ?

00:59:21.077 --> 00:59:22.720
What ? Brother !

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.720
Oh yes. I have no problem breathing.

00:59:35.945 --> 00:59:37.346
Tuktirey.

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.031
Tsireya.

00:59:44.946 --> 00:59:49.015
Switch to real view. We are approaching the city walls.

01:00:00.098 --> 01:00:02.255
So you think he's still Sully?

01:00:02.616 --> 01:00:03.754
I'm sure.

01:00:03.779 --> 01:00:05.807
It's not my main priority.

01:00:05.832 --> 01:00:09.974
My priority is to build the city and send Amrita to finance it.

01:00:09.999 --> 01:00:12.249
And who do you think determines your priorities?

01:00:12.856 --> 01:00:15.795
Here's the big picture. So listen carefully to the main concept.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.720
How can we colonize this world if we cannot counter their arrows?

01:00:19.745 --> 01:00:22.595
If you want to find this child, you must find Sully.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.709
And they are all like that.

01:00:24.734 --> 01:00:26.733
How many more are there like this? There aren't many.

01:00:26.758 --> 01:00:29.847
You said it yesterday. Okay, here is the last scan.

01:00:29.872 --> 01:00:35.619
Do you see that? It's simply mycelium. Just like the forest network.

01:00:35.644 --> 01:00:39.085
Somehow it colonized his body, spread throughout his body,

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:41.720
and then everything was changed down to the cellular level.

01:00:41.745 --> 01:00:46.182
Look, it affects the blood, the nerves and the lungs.

01:00:46.207 --> 01:00:47.765
Can we delete it?

01:00:48.365 --> 01:00:49.900
No, it's an endosymbiont.

01:00:49.925 --> 01:00:52.339
We believe they keep each other alive.

01:00:52.436 --> 01:00:54.696
If he forces himself, it could kill him.

01:00:54.721 --> 01:00:58.720
But look, he's alive and well.

01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:00.862
That's a good thing.

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:02.569
Good thing?

01:01:05.732 --> 01:01:08.873
What if the RDA laboratories managed to reproduce this phenomenon?

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:12.683
What if everyone on Earth could live here without a mask?

01:01:14.681 --> 01:01:17.945
Jake, there's something else.

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:19.741
Sit down. Hey, kid.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.540
All right.

01:01:22.565 --> 01:01:25.465
Silence. Silence. Everything is fine.

01:01:26.513 --> 01:01:29.026
Look at this. What does it do?

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.136
What is this ? His penis is growing.

01:01:32.613 --> 01:01:34.804
All right. All right ? Yes.

01:01:49.676 --> 01:01:53.720
Great Mother. Are you there ?

01:01:54.108 --> 01:01:57.717
Please listen to my little voice.

01:01:59.395 --> 01:02:03.720
I prayed in the forest for my friend to be saved.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:10.720
I prayed with all my strength, but You did not come.

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:15.720
You didn't respond, so I had to do it myself.

01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:20.720
I don't know how, I asked my wife for help.

01:02:21.058 --> 01:02:23.200
I don't remember how.

01:02:25.614 --> 01:02:28.720
Please no. Don't leave me.

01:02:29.263 --> 01:02:31.204
Why am I like this?

01:02:32.084 --> 01:02:34.029
Why do I do these things?

01:02:34.477 --> 01:02:36.576
Please talk to me.

01:02:36.917 --> 01:02:38.303
Please.

01:02:39.362 --> 01:02:41.720
No, please don't.

01:02:42.194 --> 01:02:46.193
No, no, no!

01:03:02.383 --> 01:03:03.419
Gauche.

01:03:03.444 --> 01:03:06.794
Eywa never came to see me. I told you so.

01:03:07.307 --> 01:03:09.194
I don't know how I did it.

01:03:09.493 --> 01:03:10.286
Have a drink.

01:03:10.834 --> 01:03:11.739
Gauche.

01:03:13.033 --> 01:03:16.720
My child, you have been touched by the hand of the Old Mother.

01:03:17.587 --> 01:03:21.586
We have known this since you were born.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.720
You're hiding something.

01:03:31.913 --> 01:03:34.627
I've felt it all my life.

01:03:34.652 --> 01:03:36.696
Just tell the truth.

01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:38.939
Please.

01:03:40.087 --> 01:03:41.587
Tell him.

01:03:43.933 --> 01:03:45.762
It's time.

01:03:47.475 --> 01:03:55.265
My child, you have no father, Kiri.

01:03:55.733 --> 01:03:58.046
What ? Or ?

01:03:58.198 --> 01:04:00.976
Your mother. The embodiment of grace.

01:04:01.563 --> 01:04:04.610
When designing your design, Norm carried out a series of tests.

01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:07.720
There was a path of pathogenic birth.

01:04:08.116 --> 01:04:10.720
You are genetically identical to this avatar.

01:04:11.122 --> 01:04:13.728
He doesn't really have a father.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.539
I'm a clone, grandma.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.760
This is Eywa’s will.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:28.981
When the dreamer's body rested in the arms of the Great Mother,

01:04:31.196 --> 01:04:34.078
The seed is sown.

01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:48.440
It really hurts.

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:51.916
This makes me feel even weirder.

01:04:51.941 --> 01:04:54.514
No, granddaughter.

01:04:54.539 --> 01:04:58.132
You are Eywa's child.

01:05:04.263 --> 01:05:06.314
I don't care what happens.

01:05:07.597 --> 01:05:09.563
You remain my little girl.

01:05:10.369 --> 01:05:12.927
I'm the only father you need.

01:05:17.793 --> 01:05:20.090
If I'm so special,

01:05:21.363 --> 01:05:24.146
Why did Eywa cover my ears?

01:05:26.781 --> 01:05:30.314
We don't know why, but you don't have access to it.

01:05:30.346 --> 01:05:31.522
A sort of protective wall.

01:05:31.547 --> 01:05:33.066
Like encryption.

01:05:33.091 --> 01:05:36.090
The more you try to get in, the more she resists.

01:05:37.821 --> 01:05:41.720
Eywa has a path for you, even if she chooses to hide it.

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.490
You have to trust him.

01:05:44.515 --> 01:05:46.356
I have to find out.

01:05:46.381 --> 01:05:49.131
No, you need to stop asking questions.

01:05:50.251 --> 01:05:55.720
Kiri, if you try to reconnect, you could die.

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:58.585
If you do this underwater, you will definitely die.

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:10.228
You can't stay here. If they already have it, we won't be able to stop it.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:18.094
If she's so dangerous to people who have everything, we have to kill her.

01:06:22.077 --> 01:06:23.720
I am a spider.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.386
On ei it is nama. l�ie na greben.

01:06:27.793 --> 01:06:30.546
We can protect him there.

01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:34.286
Don't look back. Don't look to the past.

01:06:34.977 --> 01:06:37.720
Come on, honey. She didn't think so.

01:06:38.034 --> 01:06:39.874
It's decided.

01:06:51.691 --> 01:06:54.306
Sorry, honey. Take me there.

01:07:00.305 --> 01:07:01.720
Get me in position.

01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:04.553
Place me in position with the missiles.

01:07:05.317 --> 01:07:06.720
It worked.

01:07:08.872 --> 01:07:10.725
Come on, and...

01:07:27.406 --> 01:07:30.406
A photo of love. It's bleeding profusely.

01:08:06.093 --> 01:08:10.206
I know the demon ship is coming. Bigger still.

01:08:10.636 --> 01:08:12.901
And what about the murdered Tulkun?

01:08:12.926 --> 01:08:14.358
I'm so sorry, brother.

01:08:14.649 --> 01:08:18.884
Jake Sully, we told the story of the young warriors.

01:08:19.081 --> 01:08:22.183
Tulkun called a council to decide for him.

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:26.176
You need to rest.

01:08:26.839 --> 01:08:29.484
This barrier must be removed. Find me.

01:08:29.646 --> 01:08:31.811
Children, follow me.

01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:46.095
No, I'm serious. When he's old enough, I'll have my own strength.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.058
Skxawng (idiot). First you need some power.

01:08:49.173 --> 01:08:53.529
Wait a bit. I will have my skin... and I will be there.

01:08:53.554 --> 01:08:55.354
So how is it going?

01:08:56.003 --> 01:08:59.275
Your daughter, the daughter of spilled blood...

01:09:00.492 --> 01:09:02.392
without training.

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:03.884
Hold it here.

01:09:04.622 --> 01:09:07.967
She did what Tsahik could not do.

01:09:08.233 --> 01:09:10.857
Who are you to dare to question Eywa's will?

01:09:10.882 --> 01:09:14.174
I am Tsahik. So behave like Tsahik.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:16.211
This potion is useless.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.998
The potion from my forest heals faster.

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:22.788
I told you to rest. Don't rest.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.720
So it's my drink's fault.

01:09:26.314 --> 01:09:27.605
Oh, u�uti.

01:09:30.129 --> 01:09:32.902
Stupid woman. Witch Tsahik.

01:09:32.927 --> 01:09:36.683
Or maybe I forgot you were pregnant.

01:09:56.456 --> 01:09:58.117
Metkayina spoke.

01:09:58.142 --> 01:10:02.422
She claims that the outcast continues to defy the way of the Tulkuns.

01:10:03.064 --> 01:10:05.050
All murder is prohibited.

01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:06.791
He was excommunicated for this.

01:10:07.223 --> 01:10:09.350
But he did it again.

01:10:09.564 --> 01:10:14.728
The Outcasts attacked the demon ship, bringing death to our people.

01:10:15.094 --> 01:10:17.683
Ōak that your Toruk Maktoa.

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:21.650
Dad... they killed him... I know.

01:10:27.799 --> 01:10:31.301
She says he continues to cause chaos.

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:35.008
Spreading bad ideas among our young people.

01:10:36.661 --> 01:10:38.114
Absurd. This is not true.

01:10:38.139 --> 01:10:41.364
She says it will only bring more deaths.

01:10:41.893 --> 01:10:44.049
Hey, why don't you talk?

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:46.074
Say something, please.

01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:56.050
She says an outcast should not live in these waters. No.

01:10:56.082 --> 01:11:00.054
He must go far away, where his song cannot be heard.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.098
Exile for life.

01:11:03.905 --> 01:11:05.158
It's not fair.

01:11:07.412 --> 01:11:08.966
It's up to you.

01:11:09.631 --> 01:11:13.090
You will never hear my song again.

01:11:14.045 --> 01:11:16.228
Ne, payakan...

01:11:17.223 --> 01:11:19.720
Besides ! Please don't do this!

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.378
Pay it, brat!

01:11:28.774 --> 01:11:32.120
This...this is false! This is false!

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.245
He is not authorized to speak here.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:37.423
No, Payakan fought for us. He fought for us.

01:11:37.448 --> 01:11:40.020
He saved your daughter's life. He saved his life.

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:41.340
He is not authorized to speak here.

01:11:41.365 --> 01:11:43.696
He defended us. Here's the advice.

01:11:43.721 --> 01:11:44.759
Everyone has already spoken.

01:11:44.784 --> 01:11:47.896
The tulkuns are being hunted down. They die.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.298
Man, enough is enough. No !

01:11:50.323 --> 01:11:52.995
He's him the verity. Non !

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.720
Payakan je warrior.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:56.945
He fought for us. More than you.

01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:59.599
More than you. More than anyone.

01:11:59.624 --> 01:12:02.040
He fought for us! Sit down! Look!

01:12:02.158 --> 01:12:03.983
Get him out of here!

01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:05.159
Wait.

01:12:05.184 --> 01:12:06.441
Listen to him.

01:12:06.466 --> 01:12:08.465
We are on the city council.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.270
“to be written off”?

01:12:12.763 --> 01:12:14.234
He never defends me.

01:12:14.266 --> 01:12:15.266
Sit down.

01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:19.720
The council continues its work.

01:12:21.988 --> 01:12:24.553
We are at war. Do you understand?

01:12:24.579 --> 01:12:28.024
If you break the commandments, people die.

01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:31.511
We are hiding here. We try to remain invisible.

01:12:31.536 --> 01:12:34.524
But he is there, galvanizing young people.

01:12:34.549 --> 01:12:37.192
Disaster will overwhelm us.

01:12:37.733 --> 01:12:40.633
Do you want him to leave? That's why you kept quiet.

01:12:40.658 --> 01:12:43.292
He is uncontrollable. Just like you.

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:45.355
If you had fixed the problem from the start,

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.379
that you transgressed the commandments while your brother was still weak...

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.240
It's not my fault!

01:12:56.526 --> 01:12:58.226
That's to say...

01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.720
It's not my fault!

01:13:05.459 --> 01:13:06.901
Look at !

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.607
Go see him, Jake.

01:13:29.147 --> 01:13:31.720
Or you will lose another son.

01:13:34.799 --> 01:13:37.248
I have nothing to say to him.

01:13:39.308 --> 01:13:41.234
Don't blame Lo'ak.

01:13:43.891 --> 01:13:46.095
You said you could protect this family.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.318
You promised it.

01:13:48.608 --> 01:13:50.719
Yes, he thought we were safe here.

01:13:50.745 --> 01:13:53.407
Our son is dead, Jake.

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:55.500
I was wrong!

01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:58.263
And you?

01:13:58.288 --> 01:14:00.898
That all the decisions I made for this family were wrong?

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.036
That I killed our son?

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:13.945
And we're still here...hiding that pink skin.

01:14:14.915 --> 01:14:16.480
This alien.

01:14:16.745 --> 01:14:20.769
If I had to choose between my family and my pink skin,

01:14:20.905 --> 01:14:23.409
I would kill him on the spot.

01:14:23.473 --> 01:14:25.108
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:14:25.133 --> 01:14:27.925
You can't be like that. You can't be like that.

01:14:28.405 --> 01:14:32.398
You've already chosen between your family and your pink skin. Do you remember?

01:14:32.423 --> 01:14:33.423
Tu descends ?

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.495
You can't live like this, darling.

01:14:40.569 --> 01:14:42.675
In hatred.

01:14:43.643 --> 01:14:45.765
I hate them, Jake.

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.460
I hate them.

01:14:48.471 --> 01:14:52.449
I hate them. I hate their little pink hands.

01:14:53.037 --> 01:14:56.555
I hate the madness in their minds.

01:14:58.926 --> 01:15:00.618
I am a man.

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:02.351
From the inside.

01:15:02.376 --> 01:15:04.537
Do you hate me?

01:15:05.758 --> 01:15:08.478
I'll always be a stranger to you, won't I?

01:15:08.856 --> 01:15:11.665
It doesn't matter how long I live in their place.

01:15:13.023 --> 01:15:14.741
Do you hate your children?

01:15:16.576 --> 01:15:19.173
With their foreign hands?

01:15:19.942 --> 01:15:21.023
Non.

01:15:21.835 --> 01:15:23.591
Are you ashamed?

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:27.539
Every time they make a mistake, they are different.

01:15:28.534 --> 01:15:32.218
It's because of their human side, isn't it?

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:55.607
Sorry, honey.

01:15:56.157 --> 01:15:57.802
Sorry.

01:15:58.367 --> 01:16:00.095
Sorry.

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:06.582
I have to... I stay strong now.

01:16:07.633 --> 01:16:10.448
This family is our fortress.

01:16:33.175 --> 01:16:35.930
They say that when you touch steel,

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:39.095
The poison enters your heart.

01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.711
Look at !

01:17:06.403 --> 01:17:09.042
Brother. Look at !

01:17:13.673 --> 01:17:16.544
Stay alive, brother.

01:17:18.276 --> 01:17:21.023
We need you. We love you.

01:17:21.361 --> 01:17:24.024
There is greatness in you.

01:17:39.044 --> 01:17:42.752
The power of the ancestors is here.

01:17:46.473 --> 01:17:49.283
Everything can change.

01:18:01.569 --> 01:18:02.862
It was!

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.335
It's good.

01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:17.995
Mai Mactu

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:25.834
Wow.

01:18:30.089 --> 01:18:31.421
It was.

01:18:35.938 --> 01:18:38.352
Do you feel it? Yes.

01:18:38.454 --> 01:18:40.608
The head priest.

01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:42.638
Yes, that's correct.

01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:45.188
Courting!

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.148
Come on, do it now!

01:19:10.721 --> 01:19:13.541
They're calling it!

01:19:15.963 --> 01:19:17.979
Finish them off!

01:19:18.214 --> 01:19:20.593
I think it's worth talking about, Colonel. They don't know anything about it.

01:19:20.618 --> 01:19:22.575
Well, they know that.

01:19:22.642 --> 01:19:24.555
They just don't talk to each other.

01:19:25.613 --> 01:19:27.478
We have one last movement left,

01:19:27.722 --> 01:19:29.525
but it is very risky.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.078
Hey, do you remember me? Look at this.

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.986
Hey, hey, calm down.

01:20:18.011 --> 01:20:19.915
Pick it up.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.658
I brought something for Tsahik.

01:20:22.611 --> 01:20:24.610
Take me to Tsahik.

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:26.452
Hey, hey.

01:20:26.741 --> 01:20:30.508
It doesn't have to be that way. I'm looking at you, Tak'uk.

01:20:48.572 --> 01:20:50.249
Tsahik.

01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:56.532
Tsahik ?

01:21:13.026 --> 01:21:15.531
I can give you as much as you want.

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:29.038
What is your name ? Heavenly man.

01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:30.918
Quaritch.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.021
Colonel Miles Quaritch.

01:21:38.943 --> 01:21:41.530
If you touch me with that thing again, I'll kill you.

01:21:41.672 --> 01:21:44.513
You won't kill anyone.

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:49.158
I am ready to prove otherwise.

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:51.092
Let go.

01:22:14.359 --> 01:22:15.885
Good tip.

01:22:17.486 --> 01:22:19.229
Quaritch.

01:22:20.156 --> 01:22:21.912
Your next victim.

01:22:22.069 --> 01:22:25.019
Be careful what you want to do.

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:29.053
Come on.

01:22:29.963 --> 01:22:31.996
We'll talk inside.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.447
“to be written off”, “efe? »

01:22:53.032 --> 01:22:54.188
Hein.

01:22:56.973 --> 01:22:58.207
Confortable.

01:23:00.719 --> 01:23:02.845
The problem is that,

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:06.202
Everyone lies to me.

01:23:12.742 --> 01:23:14.710
Ka�u

01:23:14.965 --> 01:23:18.314
that you can make a stone tell the truth.

01:23:18.379 --> 01:23:19.664
Tra�i� �ovjeka.

01:23:19.733 --> 01:23:22.207
Another divine man like you.

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:24.580
He's not like me.

01:23:25.254 --> 01:23:27.253
He's a traitor now.

01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:30.036
So he must die.

01:23:32.037 --> 01:23:35.097
But I can help you find this man.

01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:38.645
And the others you are looking for.

01:23:40.235 --> 01:23:44.076
This man.

01:23:49.325 --> 01:23:52.686
First, I need to see your soul.

01:23:53.268 --> 01:23:54.980
Stay calm.

01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:58.013
Stay calm.

01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:22.720
It's very powerful.

01:24:57.888 --> 01:24:59.478
It is...

01:25:00.657 --> 01:25:03.959
The only pure thing in the world.

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:11.049
Fire came down from the mountain when I was little.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.127
Burn the forest.

01:25:16.003 --> 01:25:18.140
I destroyed everything.

01:25:22.363 --> 01:25:25.862
My people were starving.

01:25:26.067 --> 01:25:29.189
They screamed for help.

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:34.327
Ali Eywa is dying.

01:25:36.117 --> 01:25:40.163
That's why I went near the fire.

01:25:42.409 --> 01:25:46.081
And I learned his method.

01:25:50.724 --> 01:25:54.283
I controlled the fire.

01:25:55.777 --> 01:26:00.641
But when my people began to act,

01:26:00.665 --> 01:26:03.789
We did not surrender and we did not die

01:26:03.828 --> 01:26:07.827
the same person who nas je Eywa napustila.

01:26:09.117 --> 01:26:12.067
We left Eywa.

01:26:13.645 --> 01:26:15.720
Weak mother.

01:26:16.411 --> 01:26:18.720
For fragile children.

01:26:20.783 --> 01:26:26.720
We do not feed on bad souls.

01:26:30.662 --> 01:26:32.422
NOW...

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:39.655
Only true words come out of your mouth.

01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:47.808
He has a strong heart.

01:26:47.944 --> 01:26:50.182
Without fear.

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:54.986
It's great.

01:26:55.077 --> 01:26:58.408
Uni�tit �u te, Quaritch.

01:27:03.373 --> 01:27:07.467
But first you have to answer me.

01:27:10.497 --> 01:27:13.370
Why are you here?

01:27:17.476 --> 01:27:19.104
I am here because of you.

01:27:20.653 --> 01:27:23.050
You want to serve me.

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.553
I don't serve anyone.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.867
Treba� moi.

01:27:30.431 --> 01:27:33.004
But I don't need you.

01:27:33.605 --> 01:27:40.133
Perhaps I will make you my slave to satisfy myself.

01:27:40.618 --> 01:27:44.014
Sounds like a fun weekend, but...

01:27:44.429 --> 01:27:46.891
This is not what you really want.

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:49.533
What and where?

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.295
Something you never had.

01:27:54.753 --> 01:27:56.870
Someone who is your equal.

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:03.975
You want to spread chaos throughout the world.

01:28:05.726 --> 01:28:07.646
I give you weapons.

01:28:08.056 --> 01:28:09.733
I'll give you bullets.

01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:11.539
RPG.

01:28:12.017 --> 01:28:14.293
Much stronger.

01:28:14.892 --> 01:28:16.984
Lead from a distance.

01:28:17.009 --> 01:28:19.189
Strike as fast as lightning.

01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:21.686
Tribes

01:28:22.211 --> 01:28:24.501
As long as you can fly.

01:28:25.688 --> 01:28:28.513
There is no need to bow to the masters.

01:28:34.099 --> 01:28:36.767
Want to challenge someone?

01:28:37.890 --> 01:28:40.180
Treba� moi.

01:28:44.843 --> 01:28:46.412
I SEE YOU.

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.429
Exactly.

01:30:08.863 --> 01:30:12.414
When I can one day reconnect,

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:17.858
I can be your guide in the spiritual world.

01:30:18.935 --> 01:30:21.677
Okay, can I go now?

01:30:21.867 --> 01:30:24.368
No, without me.

01:30:24.761 --> 01:30:27.519
This stranger cannot appear like this.

01:30:27.826 --> 01:30:30.626
To shock the ancestors.

01:30:40.046 --> 01:30:44.136
We begin to gather for the Tulkun children's ceremony.

01:30:45.863 --> 01:30:49.960
Young Tulkun and a reef baby together.

01:30:49.961 --> 01:30:54.050
Making your first contact with Hel will be wonderful.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.704
Let me see.

01:31:24.704 --> 01:31:26.161
Bon.

01:31:26.433 --> 01:31:28.233
I'll put this on for you.

01:31:28.374 --> 01:31:29.576
Come to the festival.

01:31:29.601 --> 01:31:31.319
No, no, no.

01:31:32.107 --> 01:31:34.967
So I will stay here with you.

01:31:42.052 --> 01:31:45.342
Look, I shouldn't tell you this, but...

01:31:45.897 --> 01:31:50.080
My sister Tulkun says they heard Payakan's voice.

01:31:50.081 --> 01:31:52.680
In a very weak voice, he calls out to his original clan.

01:31:52.681 --> 01:31:53.681
Or?

01:31:54.664 --> 01:31:58.037
The song of the Tulkun travels far across the water, Lo'ak.

01:31:58.062 --> 01:31:59.083
Please!

01:32:29.134 --> 01:32:30.393
Lo'ak.

01:32:34.683 --> 01:32:36.167
My mother.

01:32:37.198 --> 01:32:38.872
Where are you going?

01:32:40.599 --> 01:32:41.976
Just a little outside.

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.022
I have something to do.

01:32:53.844 --> 01:32:55.250
Lo'ak.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.360
Lo'ak.

01:33:00.433 --> 01:33:01.835
Lo'ak, cage.

01:33:03.570 --> 01:33:05.066
Lo'ak.

01:33:11.162 --> 01:33:15.979
Yes, we need to find Brother Payakana.

01:33:21.477 --> 01:33:22.834
Mo�emo po�eti.

01:33:22.859 --> 01:33:24.416
Our ceremony will take place in five days.

01:33:24.441 --> 01:33:25.880
I have to go.

01:33:25.905 --> 01:33:27.322
It's my fault.

01:33:27.347 --> 01:33:28.347
Let's go.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.820
Everyone goes there.

01:33:31.936 --> 01:33:33.640
Including them.

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:35.341
Don't tell anyone.

01:33:42.325 --> 01:33:45.119
Our children went looking for him.

01:33:45.144 --> 01:33:46.574
She let them go.

01:33:46.599 --> 01:33:48.540
They didn't ask permission.

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.013
I will send hunters there.

01:33:51.121 --> 01:33:52.760
We can't search the entire ocean.

01:33:52.761 --> 01:33:55.000
We need warriors here in case the demon ships arrive.

01:33:55.025 --> 01:33:56.836
For the ceremony.

01:33:56.974 --> 01:33:59.710
My son is there, all alone.

01:34:00.186 --> 01:34:03.344
He will come back when he is ready.

01:34:03.968 --> 01:34:05.875
That's his way of doing things.

01:34:10.268 --> 01:34:12.543
Look what he does.

01:34:13.696 --> 01:34:17.727
Jake, the strength of your ancestors runs through your son's veins.

01:34:18.866 --> 01:34:20.798
You have to believe it.

01:34:26.825 --> 01:34:28.172
There is no water.

01:34:28.211 --> 01:34:29.530
This doesn't make any sense.

01:34:31.838 --> 01:34:35.323
Nobody sees your house.

01:34:39.987 --> 01:34:42.443
Before you were born.

01:34:47.316 --> 01:34:48.203
As.

01:34:48.238 --> 01:34:49.320
Until death.

01:35:12.217 --> 01:35:18.680
When the one called Toruk Makto, how many birds are there in the sea?

01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:21.360
One, two… how many birds are there in the sky?

01:35:21.385 --> 01:35:23.403
One, two, three, four...

01:35:24.184 --> 01:35:27.334
Couldn't you ask Eywa to make you a little taller?

01:35:27.359 --> 01:35:28.898
Maybe you could have been a little bluer.

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:32.619
No, I was busy saving your life.

01:35:32.644 --> 01:35:33.542
Skxawng (stupid).

01:35:33.567 --> 01:35:36.436
Just a little bit, a few centimeters.

01:35:38.422 --> 01:35:40.883
She is the Great Mother, she can do anything.

01:35:43.273 --> 01:35:46.789
You are perfect, just as you are.

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.667
Come on, monkey.

01:36:11.479 --> 01:36:14.205
Then I will learn to fly a skimwing.

01:36:14.733 --> 01:36:18.458
May you be a mighty warrior and protect us all.

01:36:18.483 --> 01:36:20.387
Is it about body size or curls?

01:36:20.412 --> 01:36:22.482
Or the size of the loop?

01:36:23.241 --> 01:36:24.580
What is this?

01:36:31.917 --> 01:36:34.217
Come on, run!

01:36:43.175 --> 01:36:44.702
Quickly!

01:36:47.531 --> 01:36:49.307
Come on, you idiot!

01:36:51.335 --> 01:36:53.842
Come on, quickly!

01:36:54.381 --> 01:36:56.318
Here, look!

01:36:57.794 --> 01:36:59.251
Want to try?

01:36:59.851 --> 01:37:02.210
Is that all you can do?

01:37:03.019 --> 01:37:04.019
Shit!

01:37:07.061 --> 01:37:09.403
Where are you going, man?

01:37:09.428 --> 01:37:12.257
Be careful, this is dangerous, you could hurt someone.

01:37:13.927 --> 01:37:15.639
Hey you!

01:37:30.901 --> 01:37:32.020
Let's fly!

01:37:32.234 --> 01:37:33.515
Spread!

01:37:34.170 --> 01:37:37.020
The dragonfly, bræ, raestisti put.

01:37:52.492 --> 01:37:54.038
It's a joke.

01:38:01.832 --> 01:38:04.382
They are surrounding us, weapons are on fire, prepare your weapons!

01:38:04.414 --> 01:38:06.624
Where is your brother? He went to get some water.

01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:08.512
Where is Kiri? Where is Spider?

01:38:10.999 --> 01:38:13.198
Dad ! Where is Spider?

01:38:13.223 --> 01:38:16.453
They took him away, this colonel in blue took him away.

01:38:29.412 --> 01:38:30.480
Take it!

01:38:52.054 --> 01:38:53.380
Calm down.

01:38:53.448 --> 01:38:54.828
Navi.

01:38:55.755 --> 01:38:56.895
Navi.

01:39:04.789 --> 01:39:06.660
Jake Sully !

01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:09.760
Change girls and leave now.

01:39:09.761 --> 01:39:11.217
We won't leave without you.

01:39:11.242 --> 01:39:13.858
No, they have Spider, they keep him there.

01:39:13.883 --> 01:39:15.551
You've seen what I'm capable of.

01:39:16.068 --> 01:39:17.907
These people are going to die.

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:19.950
You shouldn't ask this.

01:39:20.001 --> 01:39:22.073
But I have to do it.

01:39:23.493 --> 01:39:24.926
This is the only solution.

01:39:25.687 --> 01:39:27.487
Jake Sully !

01:39:27.681 --> 01:39:29.520
Go crazy!

01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:31.520
You must leave, immediately.

01:39:31.545 --> 01:39:34.195
Take your sister, run and hide.

01:39:34.354 --> 01:39:35.354
Quickly.

01:39:37.285 --> 01:39:38.720
If you stay, I will stay too.

01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:40.320
I'm going to kill a lot of them.

01:39:40.321 --> 01:39:42.824
Whatever happens, don't raise that gun.

01:39:42.849 --> 01:39:44.383
Swear to me.

01:39:47.054 --> 01:39:48.773
I know he's there.

01:39:48.798 --> 01:39:50.377
Leave it to me.

01:39:50.402 --> 01:39:51.809
He is dressed.

01:39:51.834 --> 01:39:55.717
He is one of us.

01:39:55.742 --> 01:39:57.381
Burn something.

01:39:57.406 --> 01:39:58.313
Enter sector four.

01:39:58.338 --> 01:40:00.577
Throw a Molotov cocktail in the center of the village.

01:40:00.602 --> 01:40:02.761
I understand, let's move on to Molotov cocktails.

01:40:18.067 --> 01:40:21.100
I want Jake Sully!

01:40:21.101 --> 01:40:23.160
Stop, stop, don't shoot!

01:40:23.161 --> 01:40:24.300
Cease the fire!

01:40:24.301 --> 01:40:25.736
Stop!

01:40:25.834 --> 01:40:26.834
Cease the fire!

01:40:28.087 --> 01:40:29.800
Ready, back.

01:40:31.733 --> 01:40:33.980
It's my way, brother.

01:40:50.723 --> 01:40:51.833
Pukovni�e?

01:40:52.714 --> 01:40:54.160
Kaplare.

01:40:54.806 --> 01:40:57.985
Take me away, let my family go, let them live in peace.

01:40:58.317 --> 01:40:59.733
It's not enough.

01:41:00.007 --> 01:41:01.965
The mission must also be abandoned.

01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:07.605
On me zadrúava.

01:41:07.878 --> 01:41:10.911
You two are very dangerous here.

01:41:11.411 --> 01:41:13.444
Pregnant women, children.

01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:18.464
Blown up in my grandmother's cabin, because I don't care.

01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:22.148
My friends here can't wait to kill them all.

01:41:22.173 --> 01:41:24.201
and take several prisoners.

01:41:40.251 --> 01:41:41.508
Really?

01:41:42.336 --> 01:41:43.843
Are we doing this?

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.058
When I give up, you and your new love will die.

01:41:48.403 --> 01:41:50.061
You will be the first to die.

01:41:50.086 --> 01:41:52.728
If I die, everyone here dies.

01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.839
Mo�da.

01:41:54.624 --> 01:41:57.120
You can kill some, but not all.

01:41:57.145 --> 01:42:01.538
We will attack and your ships will hesitate because our faces are similar.

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.728
And while you beg for life,

01:42:06.241 --> 01:42:08.004
ja �u te dokraj�iti.

01:42:08.987 --> 01:42:10.780
Vau, Kaplare.

01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:14.276
I don't know if you're smart or crazy.

01:42:14.301 --> 01:42:16.701
I never thought you were smart.

01:42:17.575 --> 01:42:20.320
I need your promise, Marine to Marine.

01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:23.423
Security for these people.

01:42:24.134 --> 01:42:26.664
Burn them all, Quaritch.

01:42:35.183 --> 01:42:36.923
Did we make a deal?

01:42:41.354 --> 01:42:42.439
We agreed.

01:42:43.716 --> 01:42:45.644
Do you want to swear your way?

01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:56.098
Take him away!

01:42:57.273 --> 01:42:58.713
Turn around.

01:43:03.899 --> 01:43:05.101
Come on!

01:43:23.474 --> 01:43:25.180
Come on, quickly.

01:43:25.530 --> 01:43:27.180
Drugi put, Goo. Sully.

01:43:27.181 --> 01:43:28.249
Hah.

01:43:31.865 --> 01:43:33.133
Good luck.

01:44:15.093 --> 01:44:16.214
Who are we talking to?

01:44:16.239 --> 01:44:17.602
Madam, big attack.

01:44:17.627 --> 01:44:18.826
The Banshee Riders approach.

01:44:18.851 --> 01:44:20.292
I see them, line up the line.

01:44:20.317 --> 01:44:22.045
I can't, Madam, the gun is locked.

01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:24.339
They all bear the IFM marking.

01:44:25.225 --> 01:44:25.713
Pro�iri.

01:44:25.738 --> 01:44:27.312
416, 7. meta.

01:44:29.145 --> 01:44:31.005
TRANSPONDER DETECTED

01:45:04.966 --> 01:45:06.966
Stand up straight, stupid.

01:45:07.394 --> 01:45:09.394
Don't show your fear.

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.463
Wait.

01:45:19.090 --> 01:45:20.248
It's over, go away!

01:45:21.802 --> 01:45:22.942
Jake !

01:45:23.161 --> 01:45:24.202
Let's go. Quickly !

01:45:24.441 --> 01:45:25.708
Jake !

01:45:26.061 --> 01:45:27.061
Jake !

01:45:30.274 --> 01:45:31.160
Jake !

01:45:48.494 --> 01:45:50.833
Mission accomplished, General.

01:45:50.858 --> 01:45:53.817
Jake Sully, Toruk Makto himself.

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.020
It is not enough to distribute weapons.

01:46:12.045 --> 01:46:15.085
You have brought the enemy into this territory.

01:46:15.094 --> 01:46:15.813
Weapons later.

01:46:15.837 --> 01:46:17.240
No chance.

01:46:17.241 --> 01:46:19.600
Not an enemy, but an ally.

01:46:20.611 --> 01:46:25.136
General Artmore, allow me to introduce Varang, Tsahik of Mangkwana.

01:46:28.427 --> 01:46:31.360
Let's be perfectly clear, Colonel Quaritch.

01:46:31.361 --> 01:46:33.760
I want all these savages eliminated immediately.

01:46:33.761 --> 01:46:38.280
from my base, including this girl of yours.

01:46:44.926 --> 01:46:47.474
Don't be stupid, General.

01:46:48.657 --> 01:46:50.401
Accept this victory.

01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:54.091
We did it, everyone!

01:46:57.261 --> 01:46:59.312
Everyone is here!

01:47:17.425 --> 01:47:18.518
Are you sure?

01:47:39.710 --> 01:47:40.710
Calm!

01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:49.898
It just hurts a little.

01:47:50.638 --> 01:47:51.965
Slowly!

01:47:54.893 --> 01:47:56.060
Stay calm!

01:47:57.915 --> 01:47:59.195
Apply it slowly!

01:48:04.298 --> 01:48:05.612
I understand!

01:48:09.010 --> 01:48:10.337
I understand!

01:48:16.894 --> 01:48:20.060
They say, “Be careful when you clean.” »

01:48:20.285 --> 01:48:21.285
I understand!

01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:26.188
It's Lo'ak! It's him!

01:48:26.213 --> 01:48:28.309
Lo'ak! Tu es Lo'ak!

01:48:28.334 --> 01:48:29.780
Hold ! Look at !

01:48:29.805 --> 01:48:31.339
Lo'ak! Tsireya!

01:48:35.437 --> 01:48:40.010
They also say: “If you look at the bottom of the ocean,

01:48:42.734 --> 01:48:45.295
“Your soul will be judged. »

01:48:57.673 --> 01:48:59.590
Zeya! Hurry up!

01:49:10.385 --> 01:49:11.398
As!

01:50:15.629 --> 01:50:16.955
Look at !

01:50:17.083 --> 01:50:17.829
Look at !

01:50:17.955 --> 01:50:18.949
Look at !

01:50:19.073 --> 01:50:20.073
Look at !

01:50:24.767 --> 01:50:25.780
Tsireya.

01:50:31.134 --> 01:50:32.645
Thank you, Great Mother.

01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:34.793
Come on, let him breathe.

01:50:34.848 --> 01:50:35.687
Let go!

01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:42.243
You all came for me.

01:50:43.121 --> 01:50:45.120
My friend is my neighbor.

01:50:49.371 --> 01:50:51.261
Is she your sister? Yes.

01:50:52.253 --> 01:50:54.377
About Payakan. Has he heard of it?

01:50:54.402 --> 01:50:56.765
It's close. It happens.

01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:05.179
So what did you find?

01:51:05.888 --> 01:51:08.408
This is the mycelium that lives in its body.

01:51:08.441 --> 01:51:10.090
Wait, is there something living in there?

01:51:10.115 --> 01:51:11.754
Yes, it's an endosymbiont.

01:51:11.779 --> 01:51:13.329
I do not regulate ion exchanges.

01:51:13.354 --> 01:51:14.082
Hey, stop.

01:51:14.107 --> 01:51:15.529
I don't need to know how it works.

01:51:15.554 --> 01:51:17.871
I just need to know if this can be reproduced.

01:51:23.946 --> 01:51:26.340
Get me out of here, you bastard!

01:51:29.563 --> 01:51:33.190
I told that idiot with his gloves to stay away from you.

01:51:33.215 --> 01:51:34.643
Where is Jake?

01:51:35.296 --> 01:51:37.496
It's locked where it belongs.

01:51:37.521 --> 01:51:38.022
Ici.

01:51:39.778 --> 01:51:41.392
I brought you a hamburger.

01:51:41.417 --> 01:51:42.735
Don't hurt him.

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.789
He is no longer part of your life.

01:51:45.874 --> 01:51:47.373
You are with me now.

01:51:48.699 --> 01:51:49.939
I am your father.

01:51:50.107 --> 01:51:51.606
My father is dead.

01:51:52.569 --> 01:51:56.208
It's just an invention, a memory he left behind.

01:51:56.233 --> 01:51:57.992
No, no.

01:51:58.017 --> 01:51:59.466
I'm still me.

01:51:59.863 --> 01:52:00.893
I checked.

01:52:00.918 --> 01:52:02.254
Yes, look.

01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:04.960
Colonel Miles Quaritch.

01:52:05.494 --> 01:52:06.854
Deceased.

01:52:11.926 --> 01:52:13.758
As a result, we rarely spoke to each other.

01:52:13.783 --> 01:52:16.471
when we were together in the forest, but...

01:52:17.536 --> 01:52:18.772
I must thank you.

01:52:18.797 --> 01:52:22.932
You saved me from a sinking ship.

01:52:23.153 --> 01:52:24.742
You saved my life.

01:52:25.073 --> 01:52:27.890
No, you definitely didn't do that.

01:52:29.190 --> 01:52:30.380
Maybe that's true.

01:52:31.612 --> 01:52:33.680
Maybe deep down, it's not like that.

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:36.980
In any case, I owe you a debt of gratitude.

01:52:37.017 --> 01:52:43.221
And I must say, my son, that I am proud of you.

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:46.845
You are an incredible boy.

01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:50.767
You have guts, you're smart, and...

01:52:51.672 --> 01:52:54.001
He suddenly has guts.

01:52:55.331 --> 01:52:57.200
I recognize myself in you.

01:52:57.201 --> 01:52:58.201
Et.

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.033
I really see you.

01:53:02.713 --> 01:53:03.934
Just like your mother.

01:53:05.786 --> 01:53:11.410
She was fierce, strong and difficult to understand.

01:53:13.016 --> 01:53:14.306
I loved him.

01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:17.421
I was angry because she loved you.

01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:24.434
The hardest thing she did that day was board a battleship, go to war.

01:53:24.763 --> 01:53:26.953
she left her baby.

01:53:29.373 --> 01:53:32.118
Your mother died a heroine, my son.

01:53:33.412 --> 01:53:35.655
It's in you too.

01:53:37.949 --> 01:53:40.816
In any case, I didn't come here to be nostalgic.

01:53:40.841 --> 01:53:43.220
I just want to tell you that I am here for you.

01:53:44.343 --> 01:53:50.583
If you need me, I'm here for you.

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.918
Can I keep it?

01:54:05.433 --> 01:54:07.399
You need a place to hide, don't you?

01:54:17.848 --> 01:54:18.973
Besides!

01:54:23.388 --> 01:54:25.041
I'm glad to see you.

01:54:25.715 --> 01:54:28.124
I SEE YOU

01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:35.437
What is this ? What's wrong?

01:54:36.112 --> 01:54:37.118
That's to say...

01:54:37.737 --> 01:54:39.352
Very bad.

01:54:40.398 --> 01:54:42.422
Haven't you found your birth crown yet?

01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:43.994
Et.

01:54:45.521 --> 01:54:49.041
But only one survived.

01:54:55.672 --> 01:54:57.759
I am Ta'nok.

01:54:58.978 --> 01:55:01.665
Look what they did to me!

01:55:02.526 --> 01:55:03.883
They shot me!

01:55:04.125 --> 01:55:05.826
They blinded me!

01:55:07.087 --> 01:55:10.475
Look what the sky people did to me!

01:55:10.553 --> 01:55:12.665
Hakuna has arrived,

01:55:13.388 --> 01:55:15.444
but the tide has not yet reached its peak.

01:55:15.469 --> 01:55:18.498
until the eclipse the day after tomorrow.

01:55:18.523 --> 01:55:19.930
Then we attack.

01:55:20.471 --> 01:55:21.958
No, wait a minute.

01:55:21.983 --> 01:55:24.164
Let's talk about mass murder.

01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.777
Boe.

01:55:24.802 --> 01:55:27.551
Hundreds of dead, an entire region wiped out.

01:55:27.576 --> 01:55:29.024
That's the beauty of this plan.

01:55:29.049 --> 01:55:31.010
We can reach the annual quota in just one day.

01:55:31.035 --> 01:55:33.807
These beings are intelligent and endowed with a soul.

01:55:33.832 --> 01:55:38.974
Who are you… Ian Garmin, marine biologist.

01:55:39.805 --> 01:55:43.371
These beings have a culture and a music.

01:55:43.411 --> 01:55:45.640
They call each other by nicknames. This can be avoided.

01:55:45.665 --> 01:55:49.440
This gathering is intentional. It is a spiritual gathering.

01:55:49.464 --> 01:55:52.721
You're right, Garmin. We all made a deal.

01:55:52.746 --> 01:55:55.041
No, I did not agree.

01:55:55.066 --> 01:55:57.199
Doctor Garmin, thank you.

01:55:57.230 --> 01:55:58.691
Your protest has been recorded.

01:55:58.716 --> 01:56:00.716
Selected? Yes.

01:56:01.112 --> 01:56:05.625
Small teams and fast boats, you form a line.

01:56:05.964 --> 01:56:07.704
Direct family groups here

01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:11.510
until a narrow passage forms between the others.

01:56:12.543 --> 01:56:15.383
Jake Sully, traitor to humanity

01:56:21.787 --> 01:56:23.570
I already forgot.

01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:26.580
Hey, make some room.

01:56:27.968 --> 01:56:29.967
Open!

01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.580
Weapons, sir!

01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:43.119
This is the end of your journey, Jake.

01:56:44.043 --> 01:56:46.059
Tomorrow at 6 p.m.

01:56:48.483 --> 01:56:50.560
You are wrong about your heart,

01:56:50.922 --> 01:56:54.004
but I will use the old method, the firing squad.

01:56:55.130 --> 01:56:58.403
Selfridge says it's prettier.

01:56:58.581 --> 01:57:01.690
Yeah, so you're just a courier?

01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:05.853
It's not because of them.

01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:10.773
This is for me and for you.

01:57:11.456 --> 01:57:14.233
Because of the Marine who betrayed my trust.

01:57:15.022 --> 01:57:17.516
Because of the men and women I have lost.

01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:24.856
Memories of a dead man.

01:57:27.789 --> 01:57:30.714
Miles Quaritch is dead.

01:57:32.008 --> 01:57:33.704
You are free.

01:57:34.666 --> 01:57:37.161
There's a world out there.

01:57:37.186 --> 01:57:40.907
There are things these masters will never understand.

01:57:42.389 --> 01:57:45.339
The Na'vi call him a weapon bearer.

01:57:45.364 --> 01:57:46.059
See?

01:57:46.084 --> 01:57:47.556
They know what it's called.

01:57:47.581 --> 01:57:49.742
So learn to look!

01:57:50.122 --> 01:57:52.677
Connect to something bigger than yourself...

01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:55.697
...bigger than you ever imagined.

01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:59.580
Let's discover this world.

01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:04.220
Look at you.

01:58:08.248 --> 01:58:12.636
Meet at 6 p.m.

01:59:08.930 --> 01:59:11.580
Now they are powerless in the village.

01:59:31.895 --> 01:59:32.985
Hands on the wall!

01:59:33.484 --> 01:59:34.865
Hands on the wall!

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:39.938
Okay, it's safe.

01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:55.580
It's nothing, just gas.

02:00:25.159 --> 02:00:26.683
Pay attention to me.

02:00:48.116 --> 02:00:50.580
Okay, he has a Ph.D.

02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:52.580
How will you proceed?

02:01:12.117 --> 02:01:13.252
Look at this.

02:01:17.519 --> 02:01:18.924
How are you, my beauties?

02:01:21.977 --> 02:01:23.176
Drink and dig.

02:01:31.299 --> 02:01:33.299
Quaritch, Quaritch.

02:01:36.602 --> 02:01:37.580
We are fire.

02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:38.580
Monk's fire!

02:01:38.581 --> 02:01:40.580
Fire! Fire! Fire!

02:01:52.018 --> 02:01:54.592
Ne ispu�taj zvuk, Vje�tice.

02:01:54.873 --> 02:01:56.273
What is Shexory?

02:01:56.566 --> 02:01:59.480
A woman. Loyal to her husband.

02:01:59.505 --> 02:02:01.094
Speak or I'll cut you off.

02:02:05.112 --> 02:02:08.868
Where? I won't ask it again.

02:02:11.526 --> 02:02:13.522
No, okay.

02:02:14.567 --> 02:02:15.580
It's a camp.

02:02:16.930 --> 02:02:19.959
Okay, that's for the animals. Take me there.

02:02:20.736 --> 02:02:23.580
Walk. In which direction? Hey, shoot him!

02:02:27.581 --> 02:02:29.123
Let's go to the party!

02:02:41.043 --> 02:02:43.580
Get it! I want it!

02:02:57.426 --> 02:02:58.713
Quickly, quickly!

02:03:29.731 --> 02:03:30.731
Jake !

02:03:33.018 --> 02:03:35.304
General, now I have a problem.

02:03:35.329 --> 02:03:37.179
No, I have a problem.

02:03:37.401 --> 02:03:40.400
The child is on the run and I need to find him, alive.

02:03:49.737 --> 02:03:51.159
Attack him!

02:04:24.436 --> 02:04:27.376
MILES « SPIDER » PRIX SOCORRO CONTACT SEC-OPS

02:04:42.273 --> 02:04:44.991
Get away, quickly, quickly!

02:04:47.829 --> 02:05:07.829
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

02:04:49.854 --> 02:04:51.593
Stay away!

02:04:58.635 --> 02:05:00.188
Break it now!

02:05:06.844 --> 02:05:08.058
Come on ! Jake!

02:05:11.661 --> 02:05:12.661
To pull!

02:05:16.193 --> 02:05:17.580
Of course.

02:05:20.810 --> 02:05:22.117
It's dark.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:29.773
Stay with me.

02:05:38.287 --> 02:05:39.425
Stay with me.

02:05:44.761 --> 02:05:47.173
What do I do? What do I do?

02:05:52.793 --> 02:05:54.793
Haha... Huuuh...

02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:11.580
Is my protest recorded, you bastard?

02:06:19.992 --> 02:06:22.580
Jake, over here.

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:24.468
No, no, this way.

02:06:24.581 --> 02:06:25.580
All right.

02:06:28.581 --> 02:06:31.001
Ian Garmin. Marine biologist. Oh.

02:06:31.519 --> 02:06:35.409
Come on ! Honestly, I have to say that I love everything you do.

02:06:35.434 --> 02:06:39.121
I am inspired. Their silence...

02:06:40.275 --> 02:06:44.209
What's the point? I can't go any further.

02:06:44.803 --> 02:06:47.765
But there is no plan. Just Neytiri.

02:06:47.855 --> 02:06:48.902
Come on.

02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:54.765
Quickly, quickly!

02:06:57.521 --> 02:06:58.981
Quickly ! Quickly !

02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:09.379
Why are you doing this?

02:07:09.827 --> 02:07:14.451
There will be a big gathering this evening. But the day after tomorrow,

02:07:14.812 --> 02:07:17.236
They will attack with whatever ships they have.

02:07:17.376 --> 02:07:19.457
All right. I have a ceremony.

02:07:21.003 --> 02:07:24.128
You must stop them. Only you can.

02:07:25.343 --> 02:07:26.493
Come on.

02:07:36.181 --> 02:07:38.243
Stop it. Silence.

02:07:41.094 --> 02:07:42.201
Let's go.

02:07:50.581 --> 02:07:52.479
Go now. Go for it.

02:07:59.903 --> 02:08:00.796
Shit.

02:08:01.581 --> 02:08:02.766
Come on, get out of here.

02:08:04.966 --> 02:08:06.520
Oh, Jake. Come on.

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:13.673
Beyond 1-6, the target has fallen behind the vehicle.

02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:16.533
Change the missile, destroy them.

02:08:16.572 --> 02:08:17.685
We have to shoot them down, change the rocket.

02:08:17.710 --> 02:08:18.845
CHOOSE A WEAPON

02:08:19.532 --> 02:08:20.745
Hey, what are you talking about?

02:08:23.108 --> 02:08:26.361
Jake recognizes this object. Oh yes! I don't need these trinkets!

02:08:27.539 --> 02:08:30.368
�to �e� u�initiated? How did you read me?

02:08:32.175 --> 02:08:35.623
Children with breathing apparatus block my shot.

02:08:36.179 --> 02:08:38.530
Don't shoot. Tell him not to shoot.

02:08:39.209 --> 02:08:40.580
Despite 1-6. Despite 1.

02:08:40.581 --> 02:08:43.304
Don't shoot. Keep it in your sights.

02:08:43.329 --> 02:08:45.743
1-6, cease fire. Secure the position of our resources.

02:08:45.768 --> 02:08:49.213
Yes, you won't shoot me. Do you know why? Because you can't.

02:08:49.688 --> 02:08:52.549
No, you can't. Kiss my ass !

02:08:52.581 --> 02:08:54.580
Yes ! Come on, Jake, go ahead!

02:08:54.581 --> 02:08:56.766
What are you doing ? Quickly, quickly!

02:08:56.791 --> 02:08:58.191
Come on, come on!

02:08:59.285 --> 02:09:01.018
He is moving west. The target is determined.

02:09:01.043 --> 02:09:02.931
The target is not clear.

02:09:03.801 --> 02:09:05.297
They are targeting me.

02:09:10.947 --> 02:09:12.580
Stay close to me.

02:09:12.581 --> 02:09:15.495
I don't want to play. Pass 1-6, shoot!

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.519
No, don't shoot.

02:09:17.557 --> 02:09:19.556
Step back. Cease fire.

02:09:19.581 --> 02:09:20.580
Quickly, quickly!

02:09:21.148 --> 02:09:22.580
Despite 1-6.

02:09:22.605 --> 02:09:24.303
You have permission. Free fire.

02:09:24.328 --> 02:09:26.283
Visual blockage. I'm back.

02:09:28.490 --> 02:09:30.296
He comes back. This way.

02:09:30.557 --> 02:09:32.556
This is Blue One. Check your fire.

02:09:32.581 --> 02:09:34.580
Pass 1-6. You have permission to shoot.

02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:36.470
1-6, shoot!

02:09:53.035 --> 02:09:56.008
My Jake. Neytiri.

02:09:56.961 --> 02:10:00.580
Honey, I don't know whether to kiss you or hit you.

02:10:00.903 --> 02:10:02.297
You are wasting your time.

02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:04.111
Come on, let's go.

02:10:06.313 --> 02:10:07.912
Let's go. Yay!

02:10:22.372 --> 02:10:24.012
Down. Anywhere.

02:10:46.182 --> 02:10:48.260
I want to poop.

02:10:48.949 --> 02:10:50.716
You have landed at the right time.

02:10:51.814 --> 02:10:52.821
What is this?

02:10:53.474 --> 02:10:55.353
Why did we stop?

02:10:59.799 --> 02:11:02.069
They didn't even patent this lawsuit.

02:11:02.094 --> 02:11:03.093
It's funny.

02:11:04.317 --> 02:11:07.289
Good idea. Drink first, then do it in the river.

02:11:07.314 --> 02:11:10.583
What's up, Jake? I was mistaken.

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:13.455
We can't protect him.

02:11:14.901 --> 02:11:17.939
I have to take it off. This is for hygiene reasons.

02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:21.965
She is incredible. There is a woman who always knows how to find him.

02:11:23.710 --> 02:11:26.589
They're going to catch him. They will study it.

02:11:27.284 --> 02:11:29.586
And when people can breathe air,

02:11:31.214 --> 02:11:34.162
It will spread throughout the world.

02:11:34.551 --> 02:11:38.763
Then they will destroy the forest, the ocean, everything that exists on Earth.

02:11:39.411 --> 02:11:42.264
Then the Na'vi people will disappear.

02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:45.189
The Tulkuns will disappear.

02:11:45.957 --> 02:11:49.463
And I can't let that happen.

02:11:49.495 --> 02:11:51.495
Kiss him, then begin.

02:11:57.897 --> 02:11:59.552
You're right.

02:12:04.445 --> 02:12:06.445
It has to be done.

02:12:07.862 --> 02:12:08.862
Jake.

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:12.856
He saved your life.

02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:26.330
This is the only solution.

02:12:39.287 --> 02:12:40.287
Spider!

02:12:42.371 --> 02:12:43.371
Do�i.

02:12:50.854 --> 02:12:51.854
What's new?

02:12:55.179 --> 02:12:56.179
What is this?

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:58.135
Come with me.

02:13:01.312 --> 02:13:02.312
Come on, quickly.

02:13:12.147 --> 02:13:13.860
Wait a minute, I have to go to the bathroom.

02:13:13.885 --> 02:13:15.885
Stay close to us.

02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:27.430
Where are we going? Silence.

02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:45.707
So this is some sort of reunion?

02:13:58.782 --> 02:14:01.183
Come here. Come on.

02:14:04.965 --> 02:14:05.964
There are rocks.

02:14:07.709 --> 02:14:09.993
On your knees.

02:14:10.694 --> 02:14:12.694
No. On your knees now!

02:14:13.414 --> 02:14:16.798
Please. Jake, stop.

02:14:17.533 --> 02:14:18.779
Look ahead.

02:14:18.857 --> 02:14:21.232
Don't move. Please.

02:14:21.552 --> 02:14:23.573
You don't have to do this.

02:14:24.982 --> 02:14:26.475
Please.

02:14:27.088 --> 02:14:29.496
Great Mother, are you there?

02:14:30.821 --> 02:14:32.730
You don't have to do this.

02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:35.225
Take my hand. Please don't do this.

02:14:35.269 --> 02:14:37.625
Give me strength. Stop it.

02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:40.248
Please stop. Please.

02:14:40.728 --> 02:14:43.572
Don't look at me. Please don't look at me.

02:14:46.346 --> 02:14:47.799
Forgive your child!

02:14:48.188 --> 02:14:50.752
I will be good. When you are strong, I will prove it to you.

02:14:50.991 --> 02:14:53.584
I promise you. When your body returns to the forest,

02:14:55.447 --> 02:14:58.009
I ask you, Father, to maintain balance.

02:14:58.799 --> 02:15:00.913
May your ancestors welcome you.

02:15:16.099 --> 02:15:17.099
Please.

02:15:17.835 --> 02:15:20.350
May your ancestors welcome you.

02:15:20.886 --> 02:15:23.357
Let them sing you a song.

02:15:23.759 --> 02:15:26.168
I know, I have to go.

02:15:27.427 --> 02:15:29.192
It's good.

02:15:31.697 --> 02:15:35.353
Do you love me...still?

02:15:37.114 --> 02:15:38.780
You are my heart.

02:16:21.565 --> 02:16:22.565
Jake.

02:16:22.636 --> 02:16:23.636
My Jake.

02:16:34.356 --> 02:16:35.609
I SEE YOU.

02:16:43.386 --> 02:16:46.088
Whatever happens, it won't be like this.

02:16:48.046 --> 02:16:50.541
Then we will find another solution.

02:17:05.795 --> 02:17:11.310
My father knew deep down that there was only one way.

02:17:17.844 --> 02:17:20.293
No matter how you imagine yourself

02:17:20.548 --> 02:17:23.466
as a father, as a husband,

02:17:24.214 --> 02:17:27.519
Sooner or later you will return to this path.

02:17:46.334 --> 02:17:47.900
Hello, old friend.

02:17:50.253 --> 02:17:52.375
Toruk loved my father.

02:17:54.878 --> 02:17:57.105
He knew that together they were stronger.

02:17:57.689 --> 02:18:00.973
If they stole, there would be blood.

02:18:04.193 --> 02:18:05.473
He's coming.

02:18:29.403 --> 02:18:31.981
Toruk Makto.

02:18:33.867 --> 02:18:38.978
No, no. Please. Wake up. Please.

02:18:39.926 --> 02:18:41.846
Cher Jake.

02:18:42.298 --> 02:18:45.016
Please. Everything is fine. Everything is fine.

02:18:47.196 --> 02:18:51.989
Go there now, in a few days, to all the clans. Talk to them.

02:18:53.851 --> 02:18:56.594
Tell them to talk about my message.

02:18:58.353 --> 02:19:00.353
You are welcome.

02:19:01.282 --> 02:19:02.549
They will come.

02:19:41.550 --> 02:19:45.364
And finally, Toruk Makto returned.

02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:49.195
My father brought the clans together.

02:19:49.911 --> 02:19:51.500
He spoke forcefully.

02:19:52.022 --> 02:19:55.698
He knew how to bring everyone together. Without fail.

02:19:57.516 --> 02:19:59.307
We did not let ourselves be influenced!

02:20:06.916 --> 02:20:09.979
But he knew that wasn't enough.

02:20:27.053 --> 02:20:28.263
Great Elder,

02:20:28.739 --> 02:20:30.189
wise elders.

02:20:31.934 --> 02:20:35.173
People from heaven are arriving today,

02:20:35.577 --> 02:20:38.782
now to kill our Tulkun family.

02:20:39.795 --> 02:20:40.795
You are welcome.

02:20:41.912 --> 02:20:43.212
Fight with us.

02:20:51.488 --> 02:20:54.387
Ka�e da po�tujemo Toruk Makta,

02:20:54.953 --> 02:20:57.120
but our methods are outdated.

02:21:00.956 --> 02:21:03.881
We believe that killing only brings bad consequences.

02:21:03.906 --> 02:21:08.335
Always more murders, without end, the circle widens.

02:21:10.499 --> 02:21:12.016
Listen to my words.

02:21:13.399 --> 02:21:15.799
The sky people will never stop.

02:21:16.513 --> 02:21:18.937
Until the last Tulkun is captured.

02:21:26.085 --> 02:21:27.085
Lo'ak.

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:36.750
My brother must speak before the council.

02:21:37.094 --> 02:21:38.702
Payakane, go away!

02:21:38.841 --> 02:21:40.041
He shouldn't be here.

02:21:40.072 --> 02:21:41.001
Look at !

02:21:41.601 --> 02:21:42.423
Stop!

02:21:42.709 --> 02:21:43.649
He shouldn't be here.

02:21:43.674 --> 02:21:44.661
Dad, come on!

02:21:45.841 --> 02:21:48.856
I am Tulkun's brother. I have the right to speak.

02:21:48.987 --> 02:21:52.087
Lo'ak speaks the truth. You have to listen to him.

02:21:52.113 --> 02:21:53.033
Tsireya!

02:21:57.919 --> 02:22:00.499
He says his brother is an outcast.

02:22:01.373 --> 02:22:03.813
There are no rights here.

02:22:05.866 --> 02:22:09.966
If he's an outcast, then I am too.

02:22:10.928 --> 02:22:14.596
I too am an outcast. My daughter, shut up!

02:22:14.733 --> 02:22:15.590
Non!

02:22:16.613 --> 02:22:18.489
You won't see me again.

02:22:20.208 --> 02:22:23.919
My brother and I are outcasts. Oh no!

02:22:24.766 --> 02:22:27.931
We too are outcasts.

02:22:40.202 --> 02:22:43.760
He says you can talk.

02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:49.121
Listen to my words.

02:22:49.391 --> 02:22:53.085
My brother returned to his original clan to defend it.

02:22:53.397 --> 02:22:57.036
But his clan was wiped out by demonic ships.

02:22:57.495 --> 02:22:59.398
I thought no one survived.

02:22:59.693 --> 02:23:01.466
Because he fought.

02:23:02.699 --> 02:23:04.204
Avant.

02:23:32.065 --> 02:23:39.621
I'm not just talking about fallen mothers and dead Tulkuns.

02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:48.584
I speak on behalf of my people and all our songs.

02:23:50.587 --> 02:23:51.587
Lost.

02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:54.120
Forever.

02:23:59.767 --> 02:24:01.473
He says I'm the last one.

02:24:02.372 --> 02:24:04.614
A blind witness to our end.

02:24:10.284 --> 02:24:13.556
He states that the way of the Tulkun must change.

02:24:14.076 --> 02:24:16.149
Payakan shows us how to do it.

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:25.715
We must fight!

02:24:26.253 --> 02:24:28.176
We must fight!

02:24:45.926 --> 02:24:47.046
�to ka�e?

02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:49.511
They will decide.

02:24:51.015 --> 02:24:52.568
Look at all this.

02:24:53.481 --> 02:24:55.649
There are hundreds of them.

02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:59.317
And look at these old items. And old things are valuable.

02:25:00.168 --> 02:25:02.165
They never stop growing.

02:25:02.635 --> 02:25:04.634
This means they are better visible on radars.

02:25:05.399 --> 02:25:07.021
And look at this mother.

02:25:07.455 --> 02:25:09.541
It must be about a hundred meters away.

02:25:10.215 --> 02:25:11.615
Meet without me.

02:25:12.848 --> 02:25:14.428
An oversight, I suppose?

02:25:14.996 --> 02:25:16.530
No, it's not an oversight.

02:25:16.721 --> 02:25:19.860
After your misadventure with Sully, it's over for you, Colonel.

02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:22.772
You are being held at the base, awaiting the results of the investigation.

02:25:23.226 --> 02:25:25.194
I can't. I have to move.

02:25:25.265 --> 02:25:28.318
Sully will be there, which means Spider will be there too.

02:25:28.350 --> 02:25:30.975
Don't look at him. He almost ended up in prison too.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.171
Don't tell him not to look at me. What are you going to do?

02:25:33.196 --> 02:25:34.503
Call the boss?

02:25:34.528 --> 02:25:36.184
Do you mean the mayor? That's enough.

02:25:37.917 --> 02:25:40.176
I can still accomplish this mission.

02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:41.751
Look at you.

02:25:42.090 --> 02:25:43.946
You disgrace the uniform.

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:46.460
If you still remember what a uniform is.

02:25:47.452 --> 02:25:50.443
You are under arrest, Colonel. Definitely.

02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:08.120
Why are you here, child?

02:26:09.953 --> 02:26:11.779
Pray, Tsahik.

02:26:15.986 --> 02:26:17.258
No, my child.

02:26:20.847 --> 02:26:22.939
Why did you come to see us?

02:26:25.963 --> 02:26:29.000
Maybe just for this moment.

02:26:31.081 --> 02:26:33.468
Only the chosen ones will survive.

02:26:33.979 --> 02:26:35.732
To the warrior, Mother.

02:26:39.702 --> 02:26:40.706
Tsahik.

02:26:41.795 --> 02:26:43.514
She is giving birth.

02:26:43.712 --> 02:26:47.198
I'm afraid you won't survive.

02:26:51.066 --> 02:26:53.032
Oh, left.

02:26:55.932 --> 02:26:57.459
Listen to my words.

02:26:58.613 --> 02:27:05.319
There is something you can do, so you must do it.

02:27:07.803 --> 02:27:10.901
You have a strong heart.

02:27:11.495 --> 02:27:12.495
Ici.

02:27:13.659 --> 02:27:16.783
I'm coming with you. No, I need you here.

02:27:18.691 --> 02:27:21.558
I can't do this if I don't know my children are safe.

02:27:21.623 --> 02:27:23.607
Stay in your place, no matter what.

02:27:23.902 --> 02:27:25.021
Can you hear me?

02:27:25.213 --> 02:27:26.675
So let's try.

02:27:33.122 --> 02:27:35.132
If your father and I don't come back,

02:27:35.307 --> 02:27:37.438
Take Spider and the girls,

02:27:37.462 --> 02:27:40.961
and run as far and as fast as you can.

02:28:26.065 --> 02:28:27.745
Boe.

02:28:31.997 --> 02:28:34.410
Typically the flow is out of bounds.

02:28:34.909 --> 02:28:39.015
The radius of action is enormous, this energy could destroy you.

02:28:39.193 --> 02:28:41.575
Ready. GunRunner moves to the right.

02:28:57.526 --> 02:29:00.747
Come on, kids, have fun!

02:29:01.535 --> 02:29:03.943
Come on, let's go!

02:29:14.579 --> 02:29:17.327
The team is ready for swimming!

02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:40.823
Is there an enemy in sight?

02:29:41.322 --> 02:29:42.953
Negative, no movement.

02:29:43.189 --> 02:29:45.305
And the biggest one is only doing its part.

02:29:48.222 --> 02:29:50.001
Prelako, Scorzy.

02:29:50.734 --> 02:29:51.734
�ekaj!

02:29:55.594 --> 02:29:56.594
¡Ekaj.

02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:58.680
¡Ekaj.

02:30:00.113 --> 02:30:01.636
�ekaj!

02:30:11.622 --> 02:30:12.622
Just a moment!

02:30:13.877 --> 02:30:17.736
No boats. No big V-Muts.

02:30:18.695 --> 02:30:20.071
There are no elders.

02:30:22.534 --> 02:30:24.154
Prepare everything.

02:30:25.008 --> 02:30:26.867
Sir, I have an excellent signal.

02:30:27.387 --> 02:30:29.508
Tulkun, the great one.

02:30:30.174 --> 02:30:31.272
Lots of big ones.

02:30:31.327 --> 02:30:32.907
Many tulkuns are approaching.

02:30:46.358 --> 02:30:48.529
You said they weren't aggressive.

02:30:49.443 --> 02:30:51.243
Yeah, well, no.

02:30:51.852 --> 02:30:52.883
Open.

02:30:53.432 --> 02:30:56.440
Payakane, I will take orders.

02:30:56.607 --> 02:30:58.681
Yes, Matriarch.

02:31:03.596 --> 02:31:05.121
I have a visual image.

02:31:36.081 --> 02:31:38.079
Bore se!

02:32:04.261 --> 02:32:05.496
Sad!

02:32:08.002 --> 02:32:10.081
It's time for execution.

02:32:36.108 --> 02:32:37.245
Attention!

02:33:00.345 --> 02:33:03.508
Weapon! PULL !

02:33:35.902 --> 02:33:38.662
Charge! Attention !

02:34:12.176 --> 02:34:15.256
Yeah, Jake! Dude... Look!

02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:28.910
Et!

02:34:42.998 --> 02:34:44.038
Go!

02:34:47.971 --> 02:34:49.269
Is this ASH?

02:34:49.862 --> 02:34:53.112
What do you think of our fish, rider? More than a hundred.

02:34:53.393 --> 02:34:55.630
They are friendly. Maybe you will have a sign.

02:34:55.733 --> 02:34:56.545
That's it.

02:34:56.585 --> 02:35:00.658
Jake Sully, tight, General. I'm taking over.

02:35:08.056 --> 02:35:09.124
Wow!

02:35:36.353 --> 02:35:37.787
I can't win.

02:35:39.188 --> 02:35:40.816
They are dying!

02:35:42.132 --> 02:35:44.132
Jake! Skin !

02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:47.250
Stop her! Kiri! Stop!

02:35:47.718 --> 02:35:51.231
Kiri, stop! Return to cover immediately, it's not safe outside.

02:35:51.263 --> 02:35:52.938
I have to go see the Great Mother.

02:35:52.963 --> 02:35:55.878
He cannot do it, he will die. He mustn't...

02:35:55.903 --> 02:35:57.903
You can't now. Go away!

02:35:58.244 --> 02:35:59.244
Of the!

02:35:59.269 --> 02:36:00.269
Gauche ! �ekaj !

02:36:02.181 --> 02:36:04.181
Letter, stop! Letter !

02:36:04.430 --> 02:36:06.430
To the left! To the left!

02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:08.783
Come on ! No, wait!

02:36:11.538 --> 02:36:12.912
Back! I'm serious.

02:36:13.479 --> 02:36:14.784
Come on, come on!

02:36:15.504 --> 02:36:17.728
Don't follow me! Come on !

02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:49.206
Lo'ak, they are coming. Fight us!

02:36:49.632 --> 02:36:51.825
We must protect mothers.

02:36:52.036 --> 02:36:53.917
Come on, I'll stay with her.

02:36:54.361 --> 02:36:55.361
Come on!

02:37:08.627 --> 02:37:11.594
Our Mother, listen to my words.

02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:14.693
Help us, please.

02:37:15.409 --> 02:37:16.968
You are welcome,

02:37:17.339 --> 02:37:19.339
You are our only hope.

02:37:32.479 --> 02:37:35.384
Please ! We need you.

02:37:36.692 --> 02:37:38.711
Don't push me away!

02:37:43.361 --> 02:37:47.669
Please don't do it! No, I beg you! I beg you!

02:37:54.535 --> 02:37:56.995
No... No... No...

02:37:58.824 --> 02:38:00.824
Monkeys, let's go!

02:38:01.756 --> 02:38:02.716
Come on!

02:38:05.224 --> 02:38:06.224
Come on!

02:38:07.415 --> 02:38:08.280
To pull!

02:38:23.977 --> 02:38:26.471
You are welcome!

02:38:30.008 --> 02:38:31.367
No, please!

02:38:31.606 --> 02:38:33.533
People are dying!

02:38:41.302 --> 02:38:43.467
Please don't do it!

02:38:45.494 --> 02:38:46.940
Knock! Come on !

02:38:47.687 --> 02:38:50.394
Come on ! We can do it!

02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:55.071
Mom, you said it was like that!

02:39:11.894 --> 02:39:13.594
Come on, quickly!

02:39:13.619 --> 02:39:15.908
Knock knock! Come on, come in!

02:39:33.991 --> 02:39:37.210
Great Mother, help us, we beg you!

02:39:38.068 --> 02:39:40.189
People are dying!

02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:44.248
I must warn you, Mother!

02:39:44.374 --> 02:39:46.695
You are our only hope!

02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:45.790
To pull!

02:40:55.778 --> 02:40:57.778
Non!

02:41:00.599 --> 02:41:02.020
Here they come!

02:41:07.851 --> 02:41:09.600
Blackout, surround him!

02:41:40.278 --> 02:41:41.468
Good children!

02:41:58.175 --> 02:41:59.910
How are you ? Yes.

02:42:01.180 --> 02:42:02.350
Where is Kiri?

02:42:07.527 --> 02:42:09.475
She is disabled.

02:42:10.365 --> 02:42:13.641
Get to safety. Don't come back!

02:42:15.681 --> 02:42:17.315
It's over.

02:42:35.457 --> 02:42:36.117
Papa!

02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:38.765
Lo'ak. father

02:42:39.676 --> 02:42:41.397
It's okay, I've got you.

02:42:48.965 --> 02:42:49.960
Tsahik!

02:43:02.674 --> 02:43:04.354
Stay here, I'll come back and get her.

02:43:04.379 --> 02:43:06.647
You can't leave me alone.

02:43:15.892 --> 02:43:17.152
Damza, okay!

02:43:21.799 --> 02:43:24.419
I'm dying. No, I'm not dying.

02:43:25.574 --> 02:43:28.185
Why do you always argue?

02:43:28.210 --> 02:43:30.670
I'm dying.

02:43:30.708 --> 02:43:33.512
But first of all, I am going to give birth to this child!

02:43:41.921 --> 02:43:43.537
Don't print!

02:43:45.786 --> 02:43:47.185
I love you!

02:43:52.741 --> 02:43:53.668
Out of three.

02:43:53.693 --> 02:43:54.681
No, don't do it.

02:43:55.411 --> 02:43:56.193
Don't do this!

02:43:56.218 --> 02:43:58.457
I will close this wound!

02:44:10.937 --> 02:44:14.080
Gauche!

02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:24.230
Do you agree?

02:44:25.584 --> 02:44:27.584
I'm doing well. Alright !

02:44:28.895 --> 02:44:30.455
Print, Tsahik!

02:44:34.674 --> 02:44:37.007
Another effort.

02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:40.076
It's outside.

02:44:40.368 --> 02:44:41.468
It's outside.

02:44:45.125 --> 02:44:46.713
Thank you, my child.

02:44:52.761 --> 02:44:54.036
Merci.

02:44:55.603 --> 02:44:56.883
Neytiri!

02:44:57.402 --> 02:44:58.816
Merci.

02:45:02.661 --> 02:45:04.421
What is his name?

02:45:05.993 --> 02:45:08.548
She is magnificent.

02:45:11.607 --> 02:45:13.904
Ro'a.

02:45:17.822 --> 02:45:20.021
Beautiful name.

02:45:21.115 --> 02:45:23.058
You will protect her.

02:45:24.681 --> 02:45:25.681
Et.

02:45:49.443 --> 02:45:51.463
Dad, I'm sorry I left my job.

02:45:52.152 --> 02:45:54.012
It's okay, son. No.

02:45:54.272 --> 02:45:56.372
You have proven yourself to me.

02:45:57.516 --> 02:46:00.789
I mean, you prepare yourself more and more for battle.

02:46:01.713 --> 02:46:03.713
May my words not be in vain...

02:46:04.286 --> 02:46:06.286
And you succeeded.

02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:07.969
I'm proud of you.

02:46:36.626 --> 02:46:39.686
22. What is the condition of the premises? Are there any victims?

02:46:40.193 --> 02:46:41.373
Okay, people.

02:46:42.634 --> 02:46:46.119
Get over yourself. We still have work to do.

02:46:46.769 --> 02:46:48.031
Seriously?

02:46:49.901 --> 02:46:52.668
A hundred billion dollars await us in the Gulf.

02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:54.502
But our life is never normal.

02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:58.143
I pay for the beer.

02:47:00.259 --> 02:47:02.258
Zove� se Brielle.

02:47:03.845 --> 02:47:06.749
Your mother is strong. You will be strong too.

02:47:06.774 --> 02:47:07.894
Come on, Sully!

02:47:27.611 --> 02:47:29.131
Spoils of war.

02:47:30.023 --> 02:47:32.669
Dad, dad! Look at !

02:47:44.121 --> 02:47:45.783
I need you now.

02:47:46.956 --> 02:47:48.543
With you.

02:47:48.714 --> 02:47:50.760
I need my companion.

02:47:51.307 --> 02:47:53.618
Okay, let's go.

02:48:06.047 --> 02:48:08.972
Jake, I know you're there.

02:48:08.996 --> 02:48:10.356
I know you can hear me.

02:48:11.372 --> 02:48:14.279
We are here, your wife has suffered enough.

02:48:19.901 --> 02:48:21.555
Non!

02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:27.019
Now I want you to study and take Spider with you.

02:48:27.044 --> 02:48:29.779
And I know he hears it.

02:48:30.537 --> 02:48:32.020
Thank you, darling.

02:48:37.257 --> 02:48:40.157
Let go. Between. Quickly !

02:48:55.162 --> 02:48:56.433
You knocked them down.

02:48:56.457 --> 02:48:58.657
Gather the big ones.

02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:18.800
A few meters further. Give me space.

02:49:20.898 --> 02:49:21.898
Shit!

02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:26.578
Keep it up, smart guy.

02:49:26.603 --> 02:49:27.845
We dispersed.

02:49:29.718 --> 02:49:32.439
Several teams, torpedoes ready.

02:49:32.490 --> 02:49:33.563
What torpedoes?

02:49:33.588 --> 02:49:36.838
Hermit in front of the torpedo, 60 meters.

02:49:37.439 --> 02:49:38.625
Torpedoes ready.

02:49:45.514 --> 02:49:47.428
None locked.

02:49:50.580 --> 02:49:52.435
Preparation for shooting.

02:50:03.023 --> 02:50:04.593
Look, look!

02:50:19.691 --> 02:50:20.714
Cease fire.

02:50:21.061 --> 02:50:22.541
Why stop the fire?

02:50:22.566 --> 02:50:24.205
We have a problem there.

02:50:24.850 --> 02:50:26.770
It's Eywa, it worked!

02:50:27.263 --> 02:50:28.460
It worked!

02:50:38.877 --> 02:50:40.877
Opt for the Sky People...

02:50:41.917 --> 02:50:43.291
Kill them!

02:50:43.316 --> 02:50:44.671
Kill them all!

02:50:50.203 --> 02:50:51.203
Attention!

02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:06.660
Attention!

02:51:15.039 --> 02:51:16.732
Quick, quick, strike!

02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:20.104
All boats return to the ship!

02:51:22.518 --> 02:51:23.569
Et!

02:51:23.984 --> 02:51:25.164
C'est exact, Bellows !

02:52:24.752 --> 02:52:28.065
Get us out of here. The engines are dead.

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:29.747
Howard, support me.

02:53:31.573 --> 02:53:35.266
General, what's our next step?

02:53:37.343 --> 02:53:39.073
Abandon ship.

02:53:39.653 --> 02:53:41.592
Abandon ship!

02:53:47.121 --> 02:53:48.561
Stay close to us.

02:53:59.531 --> 02:54:00.611
Stay close to us.

02:54:03.098 --> 02:54:03.818
This.

02:54:05.310 --> 02:54:06.030
This.

02:54:11.959 --> 02:54:12.566
Hide!

02:54:22.411 --> 02:54:23.890
I need fire support.

02:54:24.456 --> 02:54:25.279
All right.

02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:27.694
Moved to the left, left flank.

02:54:27.970 --> 02:54:29.748
You go from behind. Pay attention to me.

02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:31.735
Look at me. On order, sir.

02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:33.594
Don't shoot your loved ones.

02:54:34.374 --> 02:54:35.547
Quickly!

02:54:48.573 --> 02:54:50.673
Colonel, ici Spider.

02:54:50.698 --> 02:54:53.239
I am here. Don't kill them.

02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:59.164
Where are you, my son? Get out.

02:55:01.003 --> 02:55:03.016
All right. I'm going out.

02:55:16.063 --> 02:55:20.731
Spider, can you hear me? Time is running out.

02:55:28.882 --> 02:55:30.201
Come on ! Come on !

02:55:45.825 --> 02:55:47.752
I'm here to make a deal.

02:55:48.202 --> 02:55:51.805
Me in exchange for them. It's possible.

02:55:52.516 --> 02:55:56.014
Come with me, my son. I am a man of my word.

02:55:56.229 --> 02:55:59.615
We can end this now. Everyone can go home.

02:56:09.936 --> 02:56:12.669
Let's get together. Let's get out of here.

02:56:35.887 --> 02:56:36.887
Tuk

02:56:43.083 --> 02:56:44.083
Hurry up, big guy!

02:56:59.523 --> 02:57:02.336
Don't touch my mother.

02:57:08.792 --> 02:57:09.912
Look!

02:57:38.254 --> 02:57:40.746
Find the mother. Get her off the ship.

02:58:18.347 --> 02:58:20.385
Is dad here, Jake?

02:58:32.671 --> 02:58:34.673
Jake! Spider!

02:58:46.899 --> 02:58:49.647
Quickly ! Quickly !

02:59:14.223 --> 02:59:15.223
Shit!

02:59:23.681 --> 02:59:25.681
Jake ! Jake !

02:59:44.147 --> 02:59:46.333
I'm going to kill you! I swear!

02:59:47.417 --> 02:59:49.281
Would you be able to kill your own father?

02:59:50.405 --> 02:59:52.609
Don't tempt me!

02:59:55.307 --> 02:59:57.009
You don't have to do this.

02:59:59.355 --> 03:00:01.399
Bad luck!

03:00:04.033 --> 03:00:05.974
Come on ! Jake, come on!

03:00:06.837 --> 03:00:08.345
Get out of here! Quickly !

03:01:21.705 --> 03:01:22.813
Boé!

03:01:42.462 --> 03:01:44.875
Jake... Jake...

03:01:50.907 --> 03:01:51.944
Son!

03:01:54.166 --> 03:01:55.668
Spider, no!

03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:00.440
Throw it! Come on !

03:02:04.876 --> 03:02:08.382
Pick it up! Come on !

03:02:09.939 --> 03:02:12.158
I wish you hadn't pulled me in the arm!

03:02:15.192 --> 03:02:17.202
I won't let you die.

03:02:17.390 --> 03:02:19.534
So do it! Dad ?

03:02:20.733 --> 03:02:22.799
You are a difficult child.

03:02:23.546 --> 03:02:24.960
Hold on, me!

03:02:48.258 --> 03:02:49.803
Take my hand.

03:02:56.578 --> 03:02:57.578
Jake !

03:02:58.297 --> 03:02:59.297
Come on!

03:03:00.776 --> 03:03:01.776
You are welcome.

03:03:02.421 --> 03:03:03.421
You are welcome.

03:03:19.932 --> 03:03:21.779
It's... embarrassing.

03:03:28.838 --> 03:03:30.040
too sad?

03:03:30.951 --> 03:03:34.507
What if we all held hands and sang?

03:03:35.393 --> 03:03:37.401
I am learning to observe.

03:03:39.648 --> 03:03:41.183
There is a choice.

03:03:52.764 --> 03:03:53.917
�ekaj!

03:03:54.671 --> 03:03:56.304
Start! Start!

03:03:56.859 --> 03:03:58.045
Start! Start!

03:04:04.565 --> 03:04:06.651
Damn, that really hurts.

03:04:32.972 --> 03:04:34.982
Dad ? Hi Jake?

03:04:35.716 --> 03:04:37.580
Sit down! Come here !

03:04:54.355 --> 03:04:56.299
The light always comes back eventually.

03:05:08.729 --> 03:05:11.373
We are all linked to the Great Mother.

03:05:14.079 --> 03:05:17.030
Who carries all his children in his heart.

03:05:21.223 --> 03:05:24.636
New life maintains the flow of energy.

03:05:26.446 --> 03:05:28.069
Like the breath of the world.

03:05:31.479 --> 03:05:33.943
We hear my brother's voice.

03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:37.669
The clan accepted it.

03:05:52.058 --> 03:05:56.971
In the spirit world, we invoke the power of our ancestors.

03:05:59.322 --> 03:06:02.567
All those who have taken this path before us.

03:06:14.514 --> 03:06:17.112
Come on, monkey, come on!

03:06:25.931 --> 03:06:26.931
Do�i.

03:06:27.615 --> 03:06:28.615
Do�i.

03:06:37.715 --> 03:06:38.715
Sir,

03:06:40.683 --> 03:06:42.963
I SEE YOU

03:06:43.449 --> 03:06:44.449
Bras!

03:06:46.373 --> 03:06:47.367
Skxawng (crazy).

03:06:48.811 --> 03:06:50.694
I'm glad to see you, brother.

03:06:52.095 --> 03:06:55.928
Mom, it's Spider.

03:06:56.561 --> 03:06:58.402
I've heard a lot about you.

03:06:59.492 --> 03:07:01.117
Worry.

03:07:04.262 --> 03:07:07.428
Live for the first time.

03:07:07.755 --> 03:07:11.121
And your spirit will live on in Eywa.

03:07:12.143 --> 03:07:13.245
Forever.

03:07:14.577 --> 03:07:17.838
You are now one of us.

03:07:18.061 --> 03:07:21.084
You are part of the people.

03:07:21.707 --> 03:07:23.385
Boe.
