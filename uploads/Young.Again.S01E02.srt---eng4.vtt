00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:54.500
Dad,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.459
the company leadership asked me to formally notify you

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.260
to process your retirement procedures.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:03.980
Oh my god.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.340
I finally said it.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.120
I conquered myself.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.699
What did you say?

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.539
You didn't hear?

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.939
This is killing me.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.500
I have to say it again?

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.099
Dad,

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.460
the company leadership asked me to formally notify you

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.460
to process your retirement.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.460
I heard you.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.419
Were those their exact words,

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.780
or is that your summary?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.219
Mr. Ma's exact words, Dad.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.099
For such a big matter,

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.139
how could I just summarize it?

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.819
They've been rushing me for a while.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.699
I've been under huge pressure too.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.340
What?

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.219
Who?

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:47.939
Maotai.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.460
Bring me that Maotai.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.139
Right.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.419
Hurry up.

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.740
Can't you even handle this?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.659
You really are...

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.580
Dad,

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.340
don't take it to heart.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:05.620
This...

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.219
there's not much food left.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.319
It's fine.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.599
I'll fry two more eggs to go with the drink.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.919
Don't bother.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.819
Just sit here.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.580
Listen to me tell you from the beginning.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.699
From the beginning?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.560
Let's not go too far back.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.539
Just start from when the company launched.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.520
That's not far back?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.759
It's been thirty years.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.400
Back then,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.979
running for permits,

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.060
getting approvals,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.699
finding connections and pulling strings.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:37.580
To take a company,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.479
build it from scratch,

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:43.460
who did we rely on?

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:44.800
Relied on...

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:47.199
You.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.599
When the company just took shape,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.979
we hit the financial crisis.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.099
Monetary tightening.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.219
So many companies collapsed.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.000
We, a private enterprise,

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.800
how did we survive?

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.060
Financing and loans,

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.020
increasing income and cutting costs,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.180
braving the storm.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.780
Who did we rely on then?

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:15.740
Still relied on you.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.019
And later,

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:20.459
the company developed,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.699
financing, venture capital...

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:24.379
Dad,

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.819
I know about the financing part.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:29.139
That was all thanks to Mr. Ma.

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.139
That batch of young executives who studied finance.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.819
What young executives?

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:36.500
What do they know?

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.579
Don't get angry.

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:39.060
Without me clearing the way through mountains,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.180
building bridges over water,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.259
paving the way for them,

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.420
teaching them experience,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.819
could they have succeeded?

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:44.019
Right.

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:45.220
Would they be where they are today?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.980
I understand.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:46.660
Speak up.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.060
I... I... I misspoke.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.839
I misspoke.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:49.939
I said it wrong.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:50.699
Wrong.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.259
If it's wrong, it must be corrected.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:52.540
Correct it.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.860
And not casting aside the hound,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.180
hiding the bow,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.699
burning the bridge,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.819
or killing the donkey.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:04:59.220
Right.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.060
Who is the donkey?

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.360
Right.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.620
Who is the donkey?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.959
Who is the donkey?

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.980
I... I am the donkey.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.779
I am the donkey.

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:05.660
I'm not a donkey either!

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.259
Dad,

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:06.779
this...

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:07.860
about this matter,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.579
I think,

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.939
if anyone is to blame, it's that Mr. Ma.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.019
That Little Ma.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.100
He...

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.139
If he wasn't

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.139
Chairman Jia's son-in-law,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.420
would he be here today?

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:23.819
No.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.540
To your face, it's "yes, yes, yes",

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.220
then he kicks you from below.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.399
Calls you "brother" to your face,

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.680
then pulls a weapon when he turns around.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.079
Praises you high to your face,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.579
stabs you in the back.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.540
Dad,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.480
this Mr. Ma,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.740
isn't as bad as you say.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:45.699
Besides,

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:46.720
no matter how you put it,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.540
it is the Jia family's enterprise now.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:49.300
Isn't it?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.500
Back then, retiring at the age limit,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.860
you raised your hand to agree yourself.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.420
Raised my hand?

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.420
Wasn't I doing that to get Old Zheng

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.420
and Old Fu out of there?

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:02.660
Who would have thought

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:05.819
it would be my turn so soon.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.540
The top priority right now

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.259
is finding something for Dad to do, I think.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.660
A person can't stay idle all the time.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.220
Idleness leads to all sorts of problems.

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.259
What should he do?

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.220
In the hearts of red teenagers

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.040
Grow red wings

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.540
Be prepared

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.920
Always be prepared

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.980
What is all that?

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:40.120
At his age,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.579
you want him to sing at a bar?

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:42.740
What's wrong with that?

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.620
At the Jin Jiang Hotel in Shanghai,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.420
that jazz bar there,

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:48.779
the singers and musicians

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:49.899
are all old men.

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:51.500
They don't even want young people.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.379
Give me a break.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.779
What a lousy idea.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.800
Really.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.060
It's really trendy now.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.920
Let me tell you,

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.620
a few close friends get together,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.180
form a small band,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.620
rehearse when free,

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.540
perform when busy.

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:07.339
A few of my close classmates,

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.300
that's exactly what we do.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.459
Classmates?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.139
Wu Yuntang.

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:13.579
If you hadn't mentioned it, I would've forgotten.

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.019
What's going on with that female classmate of yours?

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.420
What? What female classmate?

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.220
I am willing

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:29.019
to be a cloud,

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:34.519
a gray tattered flag,

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.439
in the vast sky,

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:42.899
lazily

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.379
floating to and fro.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.420
As long as my lover...

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:22.379
Wifey,

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:24.500
taste this.

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:27.139
Braised fried egg.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:29.699
Honey

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:30.819
Do you want me to

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:32.899
make you a few side dishes

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:35.179
Honey

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.779
The fried egg won't be good cold

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:38.820
You gotta eat it hot

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.980
I got it

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.779
Honey

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.860
You still look unhappy

00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:47.419
I explained it all clearly

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.620
She's just a regular bestie

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.620
So annoying

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.620
Mention that bestie again and I'll snap

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.419
No

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:56.899
I'm figuring out how to tell Dad

00:08:58.059 --> 00:08:58.860
Morning

00:08:59.139 --> 00:08:59.899
Dad

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:00.419
Dad

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:01.539
What do you want to tell me?

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:03.700
You slept pretty well last night, huh?

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.340
Good

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.740
Why wouldn't it be?

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.179
Right

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:07.419
Slept with a clear conscience

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.440
Right

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:10.220
And...

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.340
while I was half-asleep

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.620
I made a major decision

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.100
What decision?

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:19.860
I decided

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.980
to go to Yangliu Xincheng

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:23.659
and spend the rest of my life

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.580
Retire

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.539
Do it properly

00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:27.620
Yangliu Xin...

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:29.700
That retirement community

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.860
Dad, you can't go there

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.299
Such a major decision

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:34.740
how could you, while half-asleep,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.600
just make a decision?

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.860
You can't go

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.779
Why can't I?

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:38.460
Because you...

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.379
Because...

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:39.799
Be...

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:40.539
...cause...

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.220
Say something, will you?

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:43.039
Right

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:44.100
Because

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:47.460
many important things need you

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:48.740
What a joke

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.740
Then why make me retire with one sentence?

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.779
Why?

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:55.379
You're not fully retired, Dad

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.460
Mr. Ma meant that

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.659
he wants you to lead our magazine

00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:05.059
Even bigger joke

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:06.899
An internal company newsletter

00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:08.299
Editing and reporting combined

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:10.299
The whole staff is just one person

00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:11.259
Who do I lead?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.899
Ex-exactly

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:14.259
We're really not going

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:16.620
Dad has been busy for most of his life

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.059
Why worry about them?

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:18.879
Not going

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:19.820
Dad, let's not go

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.700
You finally stepped down

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.659
I want to use this chance

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.179
to practice painting

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:27.259
do calligraphy

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:29.539
learn opera, sing songs

00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:30.059
Right

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:30.659
Dad

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:32.100
I've always wanted to ask you

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:34.940
how do you sing so well?

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.740
And you

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.340
never went to music school

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.379
never joined a professional troupe

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.220
How come compared to that

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:43.259
Bocelli, you're not bad?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.500
Right

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.659
Not bad at all

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:49.220
Daughter

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.039
You say I don't know this Bao guy

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.620
But you don't know

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.379
Back in the day, Dad

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:55.620
Was the lead singer of the Children's Palace Choir

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:56.740
We only had about three hundred people back then

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.580
Dad

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.299
I think

00:10:58.299 --> 00:10:58.799
You

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.820
Have no right

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.059
To squander your artistic talent anymore

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.539
In the past, you were tied up with official duties

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:08.120
Busy with mundane affairs

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:09.740
Now you are free

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.460
You can totally compete with

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.539
Liao Changyong

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.539
And Yan Weiwen

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:15.539
By the way

00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:18.019
Is your style Folk or Bel Canto?

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.700
I...

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:22.240
I guess mine is the children's choir style

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:29.299
One, two, three, go

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:36.220
Nothing is more beautiful than the sunset red

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.840
Warm and leisurely

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:49.820
The sunset is a late-blooming flower

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:56.139
The sunset is aged wine

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.539
Stop

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:59.919
Something isn't right

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.320
Come on, keep singing

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.480
Sing again

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.720
Come on, continue

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:09.600
The sunset is belated love

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:16.059
The sunset is unending affection

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:22.120
How much love

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.080
Stop

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.159
It sounds so awkward

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:28.600
Come on, tenors

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:30.279
You five, try it once

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:31.220
One, two, three, go

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.639
Come on

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.480
How much love

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.240
Stop

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:38.879
You three, come on

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.480
How much love

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.200
You

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:47.960
Yes, you

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.399
Little Li

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.080
I didn't let you sing lead this time

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.279
Not because I have anything against you

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.039
It's just that Old Hong

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:59.039
Just retired from the National Symphony Orchestra

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:01.120
He's won gold medals internationally

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:03.639
That is indeed better than your...

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:05.340
Right

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.159
Okay

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200
I hope you

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.440
Can understand this correctly

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.039
Right?

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.080
In the future, let me tell you

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.299
There will be plenty of opportunities

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:14.320
Maybe he didn't mean it that way

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.120
I think it was about the singing, not you personally

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.279
Then what did he mean?

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:18.700
With so many people there

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.120
He singled me out alone

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.759
And said

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.000
Said that I

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:25.240
"Why are you pinching your throat trying to act young?"

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.960
Isn't that just insulting?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.639
I was singing before he was even born

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:30.480
I'm not going back

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.279
I won't go back to this choir no matter what

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.679
Even if they carry me in a sedan chair, I won't go

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.559
Don't worry

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:35.860
No one is going to come invite you

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:37.399
I'm saying

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.679
Even if they invite us, we won't go

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:39.320
Exactly

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.919
Seriously

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.080
Can't we sing without them?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.879
If they don't take you seriously

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:45.100
We'll hang out with you

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.039
Just tonight

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:48.000
I'm inviting a few of my besties to go karaoke

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.039
We'll sing all night long

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.220
Good, let's sing

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:53.159
Alright, let's get this party started

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.179
Uncle Li, raise your hands above your head

00:13:59.179 --> 00:13:59.980
Come on

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:11.500
Dad.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.059
Come on.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:12.740
Twist it!

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.840
Get up and exercise.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.019
I can't twist.

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:16.179
My heart...

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:18.059
My heart can't take it.

00:14:18.659 --> 00:14:19.620
I need to take some medicine.

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:20.860
Hey, you...

00:14:21.659 --> 00:14:22.379
Daughter.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.379
Get me some water.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:24.259
Preferably warm.

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:25.820
Just wash it down with Sprite. Come on.

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:45.340
Going singing under my name...

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.700
it's practically just them singing.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.700
Calling it singing is flattering them.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.659
That's practically screaming!

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:54.340
Screaming their lungs out.

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:56.700
Screaming isn't enough.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.740
They're twisting, too.

00:14:58.059 --> 00:14:59.820
It's like demons dancing wildly!

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.899
Jiajia.

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:04.179
What kind of friends are you hanging out with?

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.820
Me?

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.460
Exactly.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.940
You have the nerve to lecture me?

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.460
Look at your own...

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.299
besties.

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:11.980
Wu Yuntang, don't get cocky.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.860
You just wait.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.740
Dad, you see?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.039
She's even trying to retaliate against me.

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:17.059
She wouldn't dare.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.299
Look at the friends Little Wu makes.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.139
Much more decent than your good-for-nothing friends.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.460
Much more decent.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.059
When we're together...

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:26.460
at most, we just...

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.899
have some dinner...

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:28.700
drink some wine...

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.799
and play some games.

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:32.460
Dad.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.299
If they don't take you seriously...

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:35.659
we'll take you along to play.

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:37.139
Do you know how to play games?

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:38.259
What's so hard about that?

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:39.419
It's just video games, isn't it?

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:40.059
Right.

00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:41.659
We started playing them before you did.

00:15:42.019 --> 00:15:44.019
Contra, Minesweeper,

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:45.539
Tetris.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.779
And that...

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:49.779
Oh, my father-in-law!

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:51.820
You are the gaming world's...

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.659
founding father!

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.360
But those are a bit outdated.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:59.980
Now, fighting monsters online is the trend.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.539
You know how to do that, right?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.580
There's too many people.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.120
Retreat!

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.440
Go back!

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.039
Retreat to where?

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:08.799
You're losing health!

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:09.360
No!

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.059
I'm gonna die!

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:16.519
I died.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.720
Oh, come on.

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:22.279
I'm gonna get scolded for this.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.399
Dad died playing the game! Dad!

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:26.000
Dad!

00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:27.480
Dad, are you okay?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:27.899
Dad!

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.639
Dad!

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.100
He really died.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.840
Dad, you're okay.

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:31.320
Dad.

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:33.080
It's all your fault.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:34.960
Look at Dad's age.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.279
He can't go crazy like you guys.

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:37.720
Seriously.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.600
Fighting monsters online...

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.679
...no wonder he got killed.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.639
Don't say that.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.279
Little Wu meant well.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.139
He just wanted me to quickly...

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:47.879
...fit into the young people's world.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:50.200
Why are you still siding with him?

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.320
You can fit in with them?

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.120
That Bear League...

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.860
...everyone's tougher than a bear.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.320
Go get some snacks, hurry up.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.639
Right.

00:16:59.639 --> 00:16:59.960
Right away.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.759
Right away!

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.879
Isn't life just great?

00:17:02.879 --> 00:17:03.139
Dad.

00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:03.519
Dad.

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:05.839
Actually, if you want to fit in...

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.680
...it doesn't have to be physical.

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:09.279
Intellectual stuff works too.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.200
Right now...

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.960
...Script Murder is popular with young people.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:13.960
It's really fun.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.920
Do you want to try it?

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:16.279
What?

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:17.000
Script...

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:18.200
...Murder?

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.339
This game...

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.819
...is about finding the murderer.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.500
Through analysis...

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.619
...step by step...

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.339
...you find the killer.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.579
Now that I've said that...

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.880
...you get the idea, right?

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.180
Get what idea?

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:32.059
I'm still totally lost.

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:33.980
Anyway, one thing is for sure.

00:17:34.819 --> 00:17:36.019
I remember this clearly.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.799
I am not the murderer.

00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:39.980
Sir...

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.819
...don't spoil too much information.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.059
But I'm really not the murderer!

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.839
Then...

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:48.079
...look...

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.119
...which of them is the murderer?

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:51.440
You look like the murderer to me.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.519
Dad, what about me?

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:54.079
What about me?

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:54.720
You...

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.359
...don't look innocent either.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.880
Why do you all look...

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.079
...like murderers to me?

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:03.200
Every single one.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.380
How is that possible?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.200
I'm not going in

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.039
This is it. We're here

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:11.720
This thing is definitely just like last time

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.559
With all the deduction and hypothesizing

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.000
What do you call it?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.720
Brain-burning

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.359
Right

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.759
What? No

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.119
This is an Escape Room

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.519
You just need to move your arms and legs

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:21.359
No need to use your brain

00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:21.640
Let's go

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.160
Is that true?

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:22.519
Dad

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:23.839
This... this isn't like that

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:24.279
Come on, hurry up

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.440
You better not be lying to me

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:26.839
We're already here, I'm telling you

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:27.559
If it requires brainpower

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:28.480
I'm turning around and leaving

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:30.000
Let's go

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.440
We're here. Hurry

00:18:33.339 --> 00:18:34.299
What is wrong with you?

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:35.220
What are you trying to do?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:35.900
Dad!

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.099
You're going to give me a heart attack!

00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:38.099
Tell me, what should be done?

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.059
Can you take responsibility for that?

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:39.819
I'm asking you!

00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:41.619
Grandpa, please spare me!

00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:43.700
I was wrong. I won't do it again

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.220
Dad, what is going on?

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:46.940
A grown girl up to no good

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.980
Hiding in this pitch-black nook and cranny

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.500
Jumping out suddenly to scare people

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:51.380
You think I'm scared of you?

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.779
I'll beat you up!

00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:55.539
I'll discipline you on behalf of your parents

00:18:55.539 --> 00:18:56.980
No, Dad, what are you doing?

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.859
We paid money to play

00:18:57.859 --> 00:18:58.980
Wasn't it just so she could...

00:18:59.339 --> 00:18:59.940
Alright

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.059
You hurry on home

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:02.019
Do something productive

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.980
Hey, I'm sorry about that

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.500
You hurry on home

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:07.500
First day at work

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.700
And look who I run into

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.500
Honey

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.299
Taste this

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:27.700
Braised fried egg

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:29.980
Honey

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:30.980
Do you want me to

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.539
make you some side dishes?

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:34.779
You pull this same routine every day

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:36.019
Aren't you annoying?

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:38.579
Honey

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:40.700
Still unhappy?

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.259
I already told you

00:19:42.339 --> 00:19:43.140
Lately

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.400
I haven't been in touch with that bestie

00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:48.140
I'm just thinking

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.299
You should think with me

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:51.579
What other tricks can we use to entertain Dad?

00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:52.980
Entertain me with what?

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.740
Dad

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.779
That's enough

00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:01.019
You don't need to rack your brains anymore

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:02.960
I don't want to fit into

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.660
your young people's world anymore

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.259
We have our own peers

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:10.019
We were all young once too

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:11.019
The flowers of the motherland

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.220
I...

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.900
am going to hang out with them

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.539
You still want to go to the retirement community?

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:18.940
That won't do

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:19.940
If you go there

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.420
how will the people around us see us?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.059
That's right

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:24.500
Those who know will think you're going to play

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.339
But those who don't know

00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:26.700
will think we're unfilial

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.039
Right

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:27.519
Disobedient

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:28.339
Not supporting our elderly parents

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:30.259
That we forced you into a nursing home

00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:33.460
Do you care that much about what others say?

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.539
Anyway, I...

00:20:35.539 --> 00:20:37.700
want to truly live for myself for once

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:41.339
Where are you going?

00:20:41.339 --> 00:20:42.099
To pack my things

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.420
I'm going today

00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:44.579
Yangliu Xincheng

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.259
You're really going?

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.640
Evergreen Residence

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.960
Chief

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.720
What I mean is,

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:22.640
let's stay in that VIP suite.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.279
Over there,

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:24.240
the facilities are all...

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.200
No.

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:26.920
I've made up my mind.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.279
I'm staying right here.

00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:30.180
Xiao

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.880
Ma.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.599
Mr. Li.

00:21:31.599 --> 00:21:32.160
Xiao Cai.

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:34.579
You said you'd move in, and here you are.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.500
Welcome.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.640
How are things? Everything good?

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:38.559
Thanks to you.

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:39.240
Doing quite well.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.200
And Teacher Liu?

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.279
She's fine, too.

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:43.319
You know, here,

00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:44.519
another old man has arrived.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.359
They say he's a university professor.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.920
Cultured and dashing.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.000
Such a handsome gentleman.

00:21:50.079 --> 00:21:51.859
Teacher Liu is showing him around.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:52.740
Oh.

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:54.839
Over there.
