WEBVTT

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.000
I never expected the world's greatest detective

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.720
to believe that lighting lamps drives away ghosts.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.760
Because I really saw it.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.400
Saw what?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.440
I saw the ghost within my heart.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.280
Back then, I was just a Magistrate.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.280
I misjudged a case,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.280
which led to the death of a woman.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.560
This is my greatest fear.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.160
So I suspect there is something strange in this forest

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.680
that can evoke the fear in people's hearts.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.480
Did you not see anything?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.520
Never.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.800
I just felt a bit dizzy.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.960
Then our Vice Minister truly has a clear conscience.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.120
Guiyi.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.440
You see?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.800
This is the master you idolize.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.440
So what?

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.720
Marong Flower.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.360
What is a Marong Flower?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.600
It is a type of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.920
extremely rare herb from the Western Regions.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.240
Colorless and odorless,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.720
with strong hallucinogenic properties.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.720
Its pollen

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.280
can travel for miles.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.240
Lao Yao.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.120
Mm.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.520
If I act strangely later,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.560
light the lamp immediately.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.040
Okay.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.400
Shentu Baiqi.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.920
You misjudged a case.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.320
You are unworthy of being a Magistrate.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.280
I caught the murderer.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.760
I have already cleared your name.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.800
But I am already dead.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.240
I am atoning for it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.240
I have investigated cases desperately all these years,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.360
just so there would be no more injustice in the world.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.200
I am atoning for it.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.120
I am already atoning for it.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.320
Shentu.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.920
Shentu.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.840
How is it?

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.800
I understand now.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.320
Just now at Old Man Yu's house,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.760
inside the lamp oil,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.840
there was a scent.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.680
That scent

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.000
is the antidote.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.480
Shrouding the whole township in the Marong Flower's hallucinations,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.080
and then using the antidote in the lamp oil to neutralize it.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.200
By doing this,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.200
they maintain the people's normal lives.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.840
When night falls,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.040
whoever they want to kill,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.000
they just extinguish their oil lamp.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.920
Perhaps this is the truth.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.560
But why go to such great lengths?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.680
Making the whole township deplete their wealth,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.400
burdened by these oil lamps.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.320
Could it be

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.720
the entire township is his enemy?

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.600
First, let's find the body dumping site Lady Xiaomu mentioned.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.200
To see if there are any new clues.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.760
Mm.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.360
It should be over there.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.240
Let's go.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.480
This road

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.800
is a point of no return.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.080
Wait.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.200
Something's wrong.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.000
This is actually a cliff.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.640
If no one leads you out,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.280
you will never leave Wanling Township.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.200
They don't want anyone leaving Wanling Township.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.040
So they made fake road signs.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.680
Anyone who wants to leave

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480
will be led to the edge of the cliff.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.200
Not bad.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.080
You people from Dali Temple are indeed extraordinary.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.520
But you found out too late.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.480
You audacious scoundrels!

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.480
You reckless fools!

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.880
Daring to turn your weapons against Dali Temple!

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.880
If you die at the bottom of this cliff,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.040
who would know?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280
If someone comes to investigate,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.520
just like you,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.480
no one will leave Wanling Township.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.480
Get them!

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.280
Let's see what they fear in their hearts.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.680
Mm.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.200
It's her.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.560
It is... it's her, it's her!

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.840
Don't come for me!

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.040
Don't come for me!

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.080
Don't come for me!

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.280
Don't... don't come for me!

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.400
He was the one who wanted you dead!

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.800
It had nothing to do with me!

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.640
Ask him. Who is he?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.920
Stay back!

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.800
Stay back!

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.520
Who is he?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.600
Village Head Qian Yu.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.200
No, no, no!

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.640
No!

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.120
It's not Qian Yu!

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.640
He is... he is Wang Xing!

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.560
Why did you harm me?

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.600
Don't kill me!

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.240
Don't kill me!

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.160
Ghost!

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.880
Please spare me!

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.880
Please spare me!

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080
Please spare me!

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.640
You planted Marong Flowers in the forest,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.920
used this red dress

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.480
to trigger the fear in their hearts,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.080
and controlled them with the antidote in the lamp oil.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.920
Whoever you wanted to kill,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.000
you just extinguished their lamp.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:50.840
Is that right?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.880
Those who survived

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.000
also lived in constant fear,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:56.920
burning lamps day and night,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.360
exhausting their wealth,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.760
until they finally starved

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.400
or froze to death.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.840
Am I right?

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.560
Why did you want to kill everyone in the township?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.240
It wasn't me who killed the people of Wanling Township.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.640
It was him.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.000
Back then, when this group

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.880
of damned people were about to starve to death,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.280
it was the old Village Head Qian Yu who took them in.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.480
But these people were idle,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.360
lazy, and gluttonous.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.400
The old Village Head never complained.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.240
But eventually, there came a day

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.280
when Wanling Township could no longer support them.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.200
Young man.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.720
Young man.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.680
Well...

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.880
I came today

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.960
to discuss something with you.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.560
What is it, Village Head Qian?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.000
You aren't trying to chase us away, are you?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.680
Uh...

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.560
Resources in the township have been tight lately.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.680
We've prepared some grain for everyone

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.840
to eat on your journey.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.840
You've been away for so long,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.920
it's time to go back home and visit.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.040
I heard Village Head Qian's daughter is getting married.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.560
At least let us have a cup of wedding wine before we go.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.120
Well...

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.000
A drop of help earns gratitude,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.040
a bucket breeds resentment.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.800
Wanling Township was their benefactor!

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.600
An entire township of people...

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.240
It took them just one night.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.640
Just one night!

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.760
Thank you all for coming to our wedding.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.920
Please eat and drink to your heart's content.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.440
Thank you.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.240
Neighbors, please enjoy the feast!

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.040
Great!

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.200
Come, let's go toast over there.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.480
A toast to everyone!

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.240
Come, come, let's drink!

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.120
Thank you for the honor.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:00.840
Thank you.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.960
Let's have a drink!

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.440
Here!

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.040
My wife.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.640
Are you alright?

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.800
Luckily, that night I went to the county town to have fun

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.200
and returned late,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.080
so I escaped the disaster.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.320
Otherwise, the tragedy of Wanling Township

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.240
would never have been known to anyone.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.040
Quick, quick, quick!

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:55.720
Hurry up, everyone!

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.760
They occupied our homes

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.240
Used our names

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.520
If you officials have any humanity left

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.680
Then step aside

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.560
Let me kill this jerk

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.040
He committed acts that enrage both gods and men

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.920
He must die

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.360
Tonight, I make the call

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.680
You can choose to kill him

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.560
And we will pretend we never came to Wanling Township

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.280
You can also hand him over to the Dali Temple

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.800
Let the Great Tang laws punish him

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.200
And announce it to the world

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.680
Sun Jia

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.520
Trust me

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.200
Compared to the punishment of the Great Tang laws

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.360
If you kill him

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.520
It is just giving him a quick release

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:02.880
I promise

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.760
His infamy will spread to every corner of the Great Tang

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.080
Reviled by ten thousand generations

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.040
Can I trust you?

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.280
I keep my word

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:49.880
My Lord

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.840
This corpse has a brandy nose

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.800
He is the Western merchant, Cyrus

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.120
This one wearing Dashi clothing

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.160
Is Adudan

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.400
These white bones all have knife marks

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.440
They must be from fifteen years ago

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.800
The wronged souls of Wanling Township

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.160
Sun An

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.080
Open your eyes and look at these people who died in vain

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.520
You ignored the shocking bloodbath of Wanling Township

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.360
What is your crime?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.920
You shielded the murderers

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.320
Hiding them beneath this bright and prosperous era

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:31.960
What is your crime?

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.440
You indulged murderers to rob merchants

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.800
And accepted bribes. What is your crime?

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.920
How are you fit to be an official of my Great Tang?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.760
How are you fit to be a person of my Great Tang?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:41.920
Guiyi

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.000
Search the Sun residence thoroughly

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.320
Escort Sun An to Chang'an immediately

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.600
For conviction and execution

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.360
Yes

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.400
Let's go

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.280
Greed...

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.360
Greed, in the end

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920
What can one gain?

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.360
What about Sun Jia?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.800
How do you plan to sentence him?

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.200
Sun Jia

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.920
Who is Sun Jia?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.160
On that Wanling Township register from fifteen years ago

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.320
There is no such person

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.480
Hey

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.280
Hey, Lao Yao

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.000
Hmm

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.160
I have a favor to ask

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.400
Oh, so polite

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.440
Let's hear it

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.760
Um, about me bumping into a ghost in Wanling Township

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.160
Don't tell anyone when you get back to Chang'an

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.200
That's hard to say

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.920
Depends on my mood

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.680
Depends on your mood? You say it depends on your mood?

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.040
Say "depends on my mood" again
