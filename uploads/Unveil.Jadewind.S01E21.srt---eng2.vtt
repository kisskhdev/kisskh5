{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.465
That is her mother?

00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:37.705
No, her mother-in-law.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.585
Tell her to come for a quiet cultivation
to accumulate blessings.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.265
Have her come see me alone later.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:47.425
Understood.

00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:50.225
What a poor child.

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:52.905
I've heard about your problem.

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:54.425
This is a tribulation destined for you.

00:01:54.505 --> 00:01:56.145
I shouldn't interfere,

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.265
but I truly feel sorry for you.

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:01.825
Fairy, please save my husband.

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:05.905
This isn't about saving your husband.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:08.105
It's about saving you.

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:11.665
Lady Yue speaks very tactfully.

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:16.665
She told Wan
that Sun Renyi was seriously ill

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:19.185
due to the tribulation destined for her.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.825
She basically said

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:24.905
that Sun Renyi was dying because of Wan

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.665
and only Wan could save him.

00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:29.505
Lady Yue also said

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:34.305
that many wealthy families
were having children through surrogacy,

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:35.785
and if Wan's Four Pillars of Destiny

00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:38.865
happened to align
with those of someone wealthy

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.985
and she could give birth to a child
at the auspicious hour,

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.905
she would receive a substantial reward.

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:50.105
This money could save her husband.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:54.065
And that wealthy man turned out
to be Wu Siping.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.905
Wan was well taken care of in the manor.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:16.825
Sun Renyi

00:03:17.785 --> 00:03:21.705
received medicinal herbs quite on time.

00:03:22.585 --> 00:03:25.505
Wan thought things would end like this.

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:26.505
Very stable.

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:27.825
However,

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:31.385
more than two weeks before the due date,

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:34.265
Lady Yue sent her a bowl of medicine.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.985
This isn't the usual medicine.

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:41.345
They changed the medicine
because the due date is approaching.

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:55.825
Harder.

00:03:56.545 --> 00:03:59.065
In an hour, I want to hear the child cry.

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:00.745
Understood.

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:03.025
Push harder.

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:07.425
You can guess what happened after.

00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:11.505
They fed Wan a lot of Tuohua Decoction.

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:16.384
She gave birth to a child
at the exact time they wanted.

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:19.184
Here's the baby.

00:04:21.064 --> 00:04:22.105
Hurry.

00:04:22.184 --> 00:04:23.545
Wan was lucky enough

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:25.825
to survive this.

00:04:26.545 --> 00:04:29.225
But the child was taken away
right after he was born.

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:33.665
After that, Lady Yue settled the payment.

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:35.105
This matter was over.

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:36.665
Wan.

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:38.345
Wan.

00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:42.465
Wan… You finally came back.

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:46.225
Renyi.

00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:48.745
You really recovered.

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:50.745
Yes, I did.

00:04:50.825 --> 00:04:52.065
I'm fine now.

00:04:52.705 --> 00:04:53.865
Wan.

00:04:53.945 --> 00:04:56.305
Sun Renyi was cured.

00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:57.905
We lost the child.

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:00.945
But Wan collapsed.

00:05:02.465 --> 00:05:05.105
She couldn't conceive a child for years.

00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:07.425
It's okay, Wan.

00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:10.105
It's okay.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.345
Slowly,

00:05:12.985 --> 00:05:15.585
Wan's in-laws began to despise her.

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:16.745
Fortunately,

00:05:16.825 --> 00:05:19.785
- Sun Renyi remained nice to her.
- Renyi.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:21.305
Until…

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:23.865
Mother. What's wrong?

00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:26.385
Mother.

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:27.425
You know what?

00:05:27.505 --> 00:05:29.625
Your wife had a child with someone else.

00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:30.825
What?

00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:33.065
Mother. Is that true?

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:34.265
Mother.

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:36.105
Only then did Wan realize

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:39.145
that her in-laws had always been informed.

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:41.905
They let her bear someone else's child

00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:44.545
to save their own son.

00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:48.705
And once they realized
she could no longer give birth,

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:52.545
they didn't even want to hide
the truth from Sun Renyi anymore.

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:54.465
Renyi.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.305
Where are you going?

00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:58.465
Renyi.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.425
We'll have a child.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:03.985
I promise.

00:06:06.105 --> 00:06:07.105
Don't you remember?

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:08.705
You have a child.

00:06:12.345 --> 00:06:13.545
Renyi.

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:19.665
All her sacrifices became her sin.

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:25.105
After that,

00:06:26.985 --> 00:06:30.825
Wan kind of lost it.

00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:33.465
She wanted to find her child.

00:06:33.985 --> 00:06:36.345
I don't know
whether fate was toying with her.

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:39.185
She actually found Wu Siping.

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:41.305
After she saw Wu Mujin,

00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:44.225
she had a mental breakdown.

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:46.425
Because she grew up beside me.

00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:49.505
She knew the formation
Wu Siping set up for the child.

00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:51.465
She felt guilty.

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.905
She wanted to take the child away.

00:06:54.585 --> 00:06:56.025
But the Wu's Manor was heavily guarded.

00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:57.425
She didn't have a chance.

00:06:58.225 --> 00:06:59.705
Following her failed attempts,

00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:06.145
the Suns locked her in the woodshed.

00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:09.385
The woman who approached you
wanted you to take revenge.

00:07:09.985 --> 00:07:13.025
Xu Daoyin and Lady Yue
harmed too many people.

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:17.545
Who among those who survived
wouldn't want revenge?

00:07:18.145 --> 00:07:19.065
She helped you?

00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:21.305
I didn't need it.

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:34.985
Xu Daoyin's petty tricks

00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:39.825
only earned him some recognition.

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:44.465
And the one who truly
helped him become famous was me.

00:07:46.025 --> 00:07:48.065
That head-separation technique

00:07:48.585 --> 00:07:52.385
made his reputation
spread far beyond Mingzhou.

00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:53.785
People came

00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:57.865
even from counties
near the Western Capital,

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.905
offering him a huge fortune.

00:08:00.585 --> 00:08:02.945
I gained his trust

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:05.705
and gradually figured out
the secrets of the manor.

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:10.065
Xu Daoyin was doing shady business

00:08:10.145 --> 00:08:12.305
with those merchants and nobles.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.465
Liu San was Xu Daoyin's confidant.

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:17.825
He helped Xu Daoyin

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:21.905
complete the head-separation trick

00:08:21.985 --> 00:08:23.265
and helped him

00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:27.305
lure those girls from poor families

00:08:27.385 --> 00:08:30.825
{\an8}to willingly
become his reproductive tools.

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:35.545
{\an8}Lady Yue made sure those children
were born at the designated hours.

00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:50.665
I've seen too many girls
at the Vitality Hall.

00:08:51.505 --> 00:08:54.105
Each one was just like Wan.

00:08:55.505 --> 00:08:57.385
Some saw the newborns die.

00:08:58.545 --> 00:09:00.625
Some were physically broken.

00:09:01.665 --> 00:09:03.065
Some died giving birth.

00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:07.585
I approached Xu Daoyin to get revenge.

00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:08.665
But then I realized

00:09:08.745 --> 00:09:13.825
that I had somehow become an accomplice.

00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:16.545
If I didn't do anything about it,

00:09:17.465 --> 00:09:19.745
I had no idea how many more would suffer.

00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:27.745
I started planning for revenge.

00:09:28.665 --> 00:09:30.585
While adjusting the mechanism,

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:33.465
I was persuading Xu Daoyin

00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:38.265
to build secret passages in the manor
to meet with his distinguished clients.

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:41.385
That allowed me

00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:44.865
to go around the manor in secret.

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:54.665
You know the rest of the story.

00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:02.985
Your mechanism was not perfect.

00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:04.065
You moved the timeline up.

00:10:04.865 --> 00:10:05.705
That's right.

00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:08.705
Wu Siping was not pleased
with his business.

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:11.545
Xu Daoyin told him to have
another child through surrogacy.

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.025
You were worried
that Wu Mujin would be replaced.

00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:16.305
He wanted to kill Wu Mujin.

00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:30.385
Follow the great men

00:10:31.345 --> 00:10:32.705
and let go of the weak.

00:10:32.785 --> 00:10:36.585
You will gain what you seek
and remain steadfast.

00:10:37.465 --> 00:10:39.665
Let go… Let go of the weak?

00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:43.545
But that child
supposedly brings me fortune.

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.105
Everyone has their fate.

00:10:45.985 --> 00:10:50.065
Maybe this is the fate for the two of you
as father and son.

00:10:50.145 --> 00:10:54.265
If the old does not go away,
how will you welcome the new?

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:56.305
Are you saying

00:10:57.785 --> 00:10:59.705
that I should ask for another son?

00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:02.305
I only read what the hexagrams show.

00:11:02.385 --> 00:11:05.865
I won't interfere with your choice.

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:10.185
However, there is an auspicious time
for childbirth.

00:11:10.265 --> 00:11:12.025
Make up your mind soon.

00:11:15.665 --> 00:11:18.065
Hexagrams never
tell anyone to hurt others.

00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:19.945
But people exploit it
to manipulate others.

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:23.145
But Wu Siping didn't think so.

00:11:23.745 --> 00:11:25.465
He wanted something.

00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:28.545
Naturally, he believed in the hexagrams.

00:11:28.625 --> 00:11:31.025
The teaching says
that good deeds bring blessings.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:34.025
They do evil,
yet hope for good retribution.

00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:35.585
How absurd.

00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:39.065
He was planning to do it
after the child was born.

00:11:44.345 --> 00:11:46.225
I had to get ahead of him.

00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:50.465
I entered the Wu's Manor
to send the invitation

00:11:51.425 --> 00:11:52.665
to the Heaven-Inquiry Ceremony.

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:21.185
GREAT VIRTUE TO EMBRACE THE WORLD

00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:51.265
I decided from the beginning

00:12:51.345 --> 00:12:55.745
that I wouldn't let him die
without a taste of pain.

00:12:58.305 --> 00:13:02.785
He must suffer what Wan had suffered.

00:13:04.465 --> 00:13:07.105
I didn't replace the incense in his room.

00:13:12.665 --> 00:13:13.745
Who are you?

00:13:14.265 --> 00:13:15.665
What do you want?

00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:17.145
Put me down.

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:20.985
Recognize me?

00:13:21.865 --> 00:13:23.185
It's you.

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.465
You're with that crazy woman.

00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:31.425
Guards. Guards.

00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:32.385
Guards.

00:13:32.905 --> 00:13:34.305
Guards.

00:13:40.745 --> 00:13:41.905
What did you feed me?

00:13:42.825 --> 00:13:45.185
Do you know that murder
is a capital offense?

00:13:45.785 --> 00:13:47.065
Lay a finger on me

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:50.065
and I won't let you
and that crazy woman off!

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:17.945
What are you doing?

00:14:19.305 --> 00:14:20.985
You're crazy.

00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:22.545
Madman!

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:25.105
Too many questions for a madman.

00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:27.625
- Put me down. Guards.
- What answers do you expect?

00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:29.265
Guards.

00:14:29.345 --> 00:14:31.345
What answers do you expect?

00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:39.625
What answers do you expect?

00:14:49.145 --> 00:14:50.185
After that,

00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:53.385
I rushed back to the manor overnight

00:14:53.905 --> 00:14:55.065
and adjusted the mechanism

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:59.265
to kill Liu San and abduct Xu Daoyin
at the Heaven-Inquiry Ceremony.

00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:01.745
I hid Xu Daoyin in the secret passage.

00:15:01.825 --> 00:15:04.065
I was going to kill him.

00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:09.985
But I found gold ingots that he cherished
in the secret chamber.

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:12.185
So I changed my mind.

00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:14.545
Death

00:15:16.465 --> 00:15:18.465
is too easy for him.

00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:22.145
Wu Lie infiltrated the Vitality Hall
with your help, didn't he?

00:15:22.825 --> 00:15:25.425
Otherwise, he couldn't have found anyone
in the formation.

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:28.625
None of you could save anyone.

00:15:28.705 --> 00:15:31.865
You asked Wu Lie
to make a noise outside the chamber

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:36.025
and lead us to the Vitality Hall
to save people?

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:37.825
If you can save people,

00:15:38.345 --> 00:15:41.145
why would you care about my motives?

00:15:41.225 --> 00:15:43.345
If you fail to save people,

00:15:43.865 --> 00:15:46.865
what's so important about my motives?

00:15:48.465 --> 00:15:50.105
I just don't like being used.

00:15:52.065 --> 00:15:53.625
I killed him.

00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:55.265
I plead guilty.

00:15:55.905 --> 00:15:57.585
To avenge your daughter,

00:15:57.665 --> 00:16:00.305
killing these few people can't be enough.

00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:09.945
Your Ladyship.
I almost forgot if you didn't mention it.

00:16:10.545 --> 00:16:11.745
The yamen has records.

00:16:12.265 --> 00:16:14.265
Three years ago, Sun Renyi got remarried.

00:16:14.345 --> 00:16:16.705
On the wedding night,
the house caught fire and collapsed.

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:19.505
Except for the bride
waiting in the wedding chamber,

00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:21.745
all three members of the Sun family died.

00:16:23.865 --> 00:16:26.065
The wedding night

00:16:26.665 --> 00:16:29.585
matches perfectly with the raging flames,

00:16:30.185 --> 00:16:31.985
doesn't it?

00:16:33.945 --> 00:16:35.065
Wan.

00:16:35.145 --> 00:16:36.145
Wan.

00:16:37.385 --> 00:16:39.145
Wan.

00:16:39.225 --> 00:16:40.065
Wan.

00:16:40.145 --> 00:16:42.345
I am so sorry.

00:16:42.425 --> 00:16:44.265
Wan.

00:16:44.345 --> 00:16:46.865
I am so sorry. Wan.

00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:49.025
I was wrong.

00:16:53.425 --> 00:16:54.745
I am so sorry.

00:16:54.825 --> 00:16:56.545
Wan is dead.

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:00.065
Stop putting on a show.

00:17:01.985 --> 00:17:05.985
Xiao. We're sorry about Wan, too.

00:17:06.065 --> 00:17:09.464
Renyi was going to spend
the rest of his life with Wan

00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:11.464
once she recovered.

00:17:12.585 --> 00:17:13.785
You lost your daughter.

00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:15.464
We lost our daughter-in-law.

00:17:15.545 --> 00:17:16.825
We share your sorrow.

00:17:16.905 --> 00:17:19.224
Please stop blaming us.

00:17:21.224 --> 00:17:22.545
What do you want?

00:17:25.265 --> 00:17:26.105
Mr. Xiao.

00:17:27.305 --> 00:17:29.545
We came here to tell you

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:33.425
that we want to bury Wan
in our ancestral grave.

00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:36.105
Wan has married into the Sun family.

00:17:36.185 --> 00:17:39.705
She can't be buried
in your ancestral grave.

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.865
But we can't bear to leave her
lying in the wilderness

00:17:42.945 --> 00:17:44.945
all by herself.

00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:46.705
Mr. Xiao.

00:17:46.785 --> 00:17:49.825
BELOVED DAUGHTER XIAO WAN

00:17:56.305 --> 00:17:57.505
Father-in-law.

00:17:58.025 --> 00:18:01.745
I can't bear to leave her alone,
Father-in-law.

00:18:01.825 --> 00:18:04.785
Let me take Wan home.

00:18:06.265 --> 00:18:08.465
Father-in-law.
Think of it as my atonement.

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:10.825
Please, Father-in-law.

00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:13.945
Please, Father-in-law.

00:18:16.825 --> 00:18:18.225
Father-in-law.

00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:21.025
What are you waiting for?

00:18:21.105 --> 00:18:22.465
Take Wan home now.

00:18:22.545 --> 00:18:24.425
That's right. Take Wan home.

00:18:25.345 --> 00:18:26.745
- Take Wan home.
- Thank you.

00:18:27.345 --> 00:18:28.665
Thank you, Father-in-law.

00:18:31.385 --> 00:18:32.905
Come on. Alright.

00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:34.185
Let's go home, Wan.

00:18:36.025 --> 00:18:38.025
You still had hopes for the Suns.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:42.465
I sensed something
was off that very night.

00:18:47.345 --> 00:18:48.745
- Freeze.
- Stop!

00:18:48.825 --> 00:18:49.945
Freeze.

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:55.505
Freeze. Stop running.

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:56.745
Freeze.

00:19:33.825 --> 00:19:34.905
XIAO

00:19:39.385 --> 00:19:40.265
Who are you?

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.465
ZHAO JINGQIAN, XIAO WAN

00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:43.705
- What happened…
- Who are you?

00:19:43.785 --> 00:19:45.305
What are you doing?

00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:47.385
- This is my daughter.
- Who is this madman?

00:19:47.465 --> 00:19:48.825
- This is my daughter.
- Hold him down. Beat him.

00:19:48.905 --> 00:19:50.345
- Beat him.
- Beat him.

00:19:50.425 --> 00:19:52.545
- This is my daughter.
- Ignore him. Go on.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:53.545
Hurry up. Bury them.

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:56.465
- My daughter.
- Beat him.

00:19:58.185 --> 00:19:59.865
My daughter!

00:19:59.945 --> 00:20:01.545
- They said
- Wan!

00:20:02.145 --> 00:20:05.385
that they paid a lot of money
for this ghost marriage.

00:20:06.025 --> 00:20:07.585
I wanted to get my daughter back.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:09.985
But I couldn't fight so many of them.

00:20:10.505 --> 00:20:11.465
Then I…

00:20:11.985 --> 00:20:14.425
- Thanks.
- I rushed to the Sun's Manor

00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:16.585
for an explanation, only to find that…

00:20:16.665 --> 00:20:17.785
Come on.

00:20:17.865 --> 00:20:18.865
Drink.

00:20:18.945 --> 00:20:19.785
Alright.

00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:20.785
Dig in.

00:20:21.385 --> 00:20:22.505
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:23.665
Thanks.

00:20:23.745 --> 00:20:26.865
It turns out they sold Wan's body

00:20:28.385 --> 00:20:31.705
for Sun Renyi to remarry someone else.

00:20:33.425 --> 00:20:35.665
When Wan was alive,

00:20:36.705 --> 00:20:39.625
she gave up everything to treat him.

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:43.065
After she died, they even
exploited her body.

00:20:44.265 --> 00:20:47.945
Those monsters deserved to die.

00:20:50.745 --> 00:20:53.865
Father. That was 68 qian in total.

00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:56.345
Alright.

00:20:56.425 --> 00:20:57.785
There is brocade and something.

00:20:57.865 --> 00:20:59.185
Alright.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:01.545
Look at this.

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:04.305
That's enough even for my grandson.

00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:06.825
- So heavy.
- Yeah.

00:21:06.905 --> 00:21:07.745
Renyi.

00:21:08.465 --> 00:21:10.345
My love. M-My love.

00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:05.025
That's the whole story.

00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:08.065
Your Ladyship.

00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:09.785
You can convict me.

00:22:11.985 --> 00:22:13.625
Conviction is not my job.

00:22:15.665 --> 00:22:17.345
But you didn't confess everything.

00:22:19.145 --> 00:22:20.905
One murder gets you the death penalty.

00:22:21.745 --> 00:22:23.745
Ten murders won't change that.

00:22:24.665 --> 00:22:26.105
Your Ladyship.

00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:28.145
Why would I hide anything?

00:22:30.705 --> 00:22:34.465
Even if you could replace
the incense in the Wu's Manor

00:22:34.545 --> 00:22:36.345
and kill Wu Siping in his room,

00:22:36.425 --> 00:22:39.865
you couldn't have known who we were

00:22:39.945 --> 00:22:41.425
to switch our incense.

00:22:42.065 --> 00:22:46.065
You know you've been exposed
and would get arrested.

00:22:46.145 --> 00:22:48.945
Why did you go back to the Wu's Manor
just to get caught?

00:22:49.545 --> 00:22:52.945
You're trying to save someone
at the cost of your life.

00:22:57.505 --> 00:22:58.625
Confess.

00:22:58.705 --> 00:22:59.705
Who is your accomplice?

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:01.785
I have no accomplices.

00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:05.345
Still denying it?

00:23:09.065 --> 00:23:09.905
Your Ladyship,

00:23:09.985 --> 00:23:14.465
perhaps a little interrogation

00:23:14.545 --> 00:23:15.625
will make him talk.

00:23:15.705 --> 00:23:17.425
He's not even afraid of death.

00:23:17.945 --> 00:23:19.265
Why would he be scared of torture?

00:23:19.905 --> 00:23:22.585
Besides, such a minor issue
is easy to look into.

00:23:24.985 --> 00:23:26.145
I see.

00:23:27.065 --> 00:23:30.785
His accomplice is right at Wu's Manor.

00:23:38.145 --> 00:23:38.985
Mujin.

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:40.665
It was me.

00:23:41.185 --> 00:23:42.585
Why did you come here?

00:23:42.665 --> 00:23:43.745
He came to confess.

00:23:43.825 --> 00:23:45.145
He's just a kid.

00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:46.185
What's there to confess?

00:23:46.785 --> 00:23:49.025
He was Xiao's accomplice?

00:23:49.105 --> 00:23:50.145
No, it wasn't him.

00:23:50.225 --> 00:23:51.185
Madam Wu.

00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:54.505
Wu Mujin suffered a lot and was misled

00:23:55.105 --> 00:23:56.785
to replace the incense and lead the way.

00:23:56.865 --> 00:24:00.025
He is too young
to distinguish right from wrong.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:03.385
He needs someone
to take care of him and teach him.

00:24:03.465 --> 00:24:06.225
Otherwise, he will face
many difficulties in life.

00:24:08.185 --> 00:24:09.505
What do you think, Madam Wu?

00:24:19.385 --> 00:24:21.505
I apologize. I deserve punishment.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:23.465
No.

00:24:26.585 --> 00:24:28.465
What do you think, Your Ladyship?

00:24:29.185 --> 00:24:30.945
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

00:24:31.025 --> 00:24:33.625
Mujin has nothing to do with it.

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:35.785
Please think twice.

00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:40.225
Magistrate Wen, it's your call.

00:24:46.145 --> 00:24:47.225
Wu Mujin.

00:24:47.825 --> 00:24:51.425
You are just a child who got instigated.

00:24:53.665 --> 00:24:55.425
I can spare you the penalty.

00:24:56.065 --> 00:24:57.185
Madam Wu.

00:24:57.785 --> 00:25:00.105
Please take him back

00:25:00.705 --> 00:25:01.865
and guide him well.

00:25:01.945 --> 00:25:03.465
Thank you, Magistrate Wen.

00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:05.065
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:09.745
Your Ladyship.

00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:14.305
Wu Siping was your uncle, after all.

00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:17.265
The case was solved
by the Palace Investigation Bureau

00:25:17.345 --> 00:25:18.705
and the Court of Judicial Review.

00:25:19.305 --> 00:25:20.905
Could you please

00:25:20.985 --> 00:25:23.945
take the perpetrator
back to the Western Capital?

00:25:24.025 --> 00:25:26.505
I… I am seriously…

00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:27.745
In that case,

00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:31.185
Prosecutor Gu and Wuren will take him
back to the Western Capital?

00:25:32.705 --> 00:25:34.185
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

00:25:34.265 --> 00:25:36.065
Thank you, Prosecutor.

00:25:52.465 --> 00:25:55.385
I'm the one who told Xiao everything.

00:25:55.465 --> 00:25:57.345
But you wanted to save Wu Mujin.

00:25:57.865 --> 00:26:00.745
You also led Xiao to reunite
with the child.

00:26:03.545 --> 00:26:06.145
Yi'en. Go play.

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:07.865
Yi'en?

00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:11.505
Mother said
that I'll be Xiao Yi'en from now on.

00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:24.825
I'm not excusing myself.

00:26:26.025 --> 00:26:30.105
But Wu Siping's death
was his own retribution.

00:26:30.185 --> 00:26:32.465
He brought this upon himself.

00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:35.105
Before Wu Siping left the Western Capital,

00:26:35.185 --> 00:26:38.065
His Majesty suffered from a relapse
of his old illness.

00:26:38.145 --> 00:26:40.945
None of the physicians could do anything.

00:26:41.025 --> 00:26:43.745
Lady Xie happened
to give birth to a prince.

00:26:44.265 --> 00:26:46.545
And His Majesty was suddenly cured.

00:26:48.105 --> 00:26:49.265
The Astronomical Bureau discovered

00:26:49.345 --> 00:26:52.465
that the young prince's Four Pillars
of Destiny match His Majesty's.

00:26:52.545 --> 00:26:53.705
That expelled the illness.

00:26:54.305 --> 00:26:55.905
His Majesty was overjoyed.

00:26:55.985 --> 00:26:58.465
He praised Lady Xie for bringing him luck

00:26:58.545 --> 00:27:00.425
and the young prince as a blessing.

00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:03.545
He rewarded them handsomely.

00:27:06.905 --> 00:27:10.225
Wu Siping had rashes frequently

00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:12.345
and couldn't find a cure.

00:27:12.425 --> 00:27:14.225
After he resigned and came here,

00:27:14.825 --> 00:27:17.465
he decided to follow
the example and find blessings.

00:27:18.065 --> 00:27:20.145
That's why everything happened.

00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:22.145
But his chronic illness

00:27:22.865 --> 00:27:25.865
indeed went away after Yi'en was born.

00:27:28.905 --> 00:27:30.905
So it's partly
the Astronomical Bureau's fault.

00:27:31.905 --> 00:27:33.465
His Majesty got better

00:27:33.545 --> 00:27:35.905
thanks to the Imperial Medical Office's
hard work.

00:27:35.985 --> 00:27:40.105
Wu Siping's rash cleared up
mainly due to the local climate.

00:27:40.185 --> 00:27:42.825
The so-called blessing was just nonsense.

00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:44.545
I stand by what I said.

00:27:44.625 --> 00:27:46.705
The celestial phenomena
follow a certain pattern.

00:27:46.785 --> 00:27:50.625
Only wicked people
make a big fuss about it for profit.

00:27:56.145 --> 00:27:58.385
My uncle was never superstitious.

00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:01.145
But he ended up claiming lives

00:28:01.225 --> 00:28:04.945
and bringing misfortune to a child
for personal gain.

00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:08.305
And this kid is his biological son.

00:28:09.665 --> 00:28:14.145
Some can exploit their own children
in their pursuit of wealth and status.

00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:16.865
Others, bound by familial ties,

00:28:17.465 --> 00:28:20.745
can endure humiliation and hardship
for the sake of revenge.

00:28:22.105 --> 00:28:26.465
Yet some still step forward
to protect strangers,

00:28:26.545 --> 00:28:27.825
driven by innate compassion.

00:28:29.785 --> 00:28:34.185
Becoming a demon or a Buddha
hinges on that fleeting moment of choice.

00:28:35.905 --> 00:28:36.825
Your Ladyship.

00:28:37.545 --> 00:28:39.185
This butterfly lost a wing.

00:28:39.265 --> 00:28:40.465
It can no longer fly.

00:28:45.705 --> 00:28:46.865
But it's still alive.

00:28:47.385 --> 00:28:49.225
So, there is still hope.

00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:50.865
You saved it.

00:28:50.945 --> 00:28:53.345
You'll take good care of it. Right?

00:28:54.385 --> 00:28:57.065
It can't fly anymore.
But I'll keep it alive.

00:29:00.825 --> 00:29:03.745
I'll find you a ceramic jar
to be its home. Alright?

00:29:12.025 --> 00:29:13.265
What happened to your hand?

00:29:14.105 --> 00:29:16.145
I scratched it while saving the butterfly.

00:29:20.585 --> 00:29:22.145
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

00:29:22.745 --> 00:29:26.145
Wounds must be treated promptly
to heal more quickly.

00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:38.385
It becomes a scar if left unattended.

00:29:46.225 --> 00:29:51.705
GREAT VIRTUE TO EMBRACE THE WORLD

00:29:51.785 --> 00:29:52.865
Your Ladyship.

00:29:55.425 --> 00:29:57.105
Are you waiting for me?

00:29:57.705 --> 00:29:58.545
Yes.

00:29:59.065 --> 00:30:00.505
I want to ask you something.

00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:03.505
You saved me.

00:30:03.585 --> 00:30:05.745
I will tell you everything I know.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.905
Why did Wu Siping leave the capital?

00:30:08.985 --> 00:30:12.465
He claimed to be ill
and asked for resignation.

00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:14.505
But I know it was not his intention.

00:30:14.585 --> 00:30:16.865
He was the Crown Prince's
Left Guard Commander.

00:30:16.945 --> 00:30:18.305
The Crown Prince asked him to resign?

00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:20.145
No way.

00:30:20.225 --> 00:30:22.705
The Crown Prince was infuriated
by his sudden resignation.

00:30:22.785 --> 00:30:24.265
But he was determined to leave.

00:30:25.225 --> 00:30:29.585
Where was he on the night
of my family's tragedy 15 years ago?

00:30:34.545 --> 00:30:35.545
He was there?

00:30:36.705 --> 00:30:37.825
No.

00:30:39.385 --> 00:30:42.145
He wasn't on duty that night.

00:30:42.665 --> 00:30:43.505
But…

00:30:45.905 --> 00:30:46.985
WU'S MANOR

00:30:55.705 --> 00:30:57.825
Gather your men.
Come to the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:30:57.905 --> 00:30:59.505
- Now?
- Yes.

00:30:59.585 --> 00:31:00.705
Does His Highness know?

00:31:00.785 --> 00:31:02.745
I will report to him.

00:31:03.505 --> 00:31:05.945
But… isn't it against the rules?

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:09.105
If you don't go,
give me the command tally.

00:31:09.185 --> 00:31:11.305
I'd say I snatched it from you.

00:31:11.385 --> 00:31:12.465
You won't get into trouble.

00:31:15.385 --> 00:31:16.585
Hurry up.

00:31:21.785 --> 00:31:25.545
Grand Tutor. What on earth is this for?

00:31:28.305 --> 00:31:30.265
The less you know, the safer you are.

00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:47.145
Not long after that night,

00:31:47.225 --> 00:31:49.545
Wu Siping claimed to be ill and resigned.

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:54.505
He never mentioned
what happened that night.

00:31:55.985 --> 00:31:58.985
Are you sure it was Xiao Wenyuan
who took the command tally?

00:31:59.505 --> 00:32:00.985
He said he was going
to the Prince of Duan's manor?

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:02.185
Yes.

00:32:02.745 --> 00:32:04.625
I saw and heard them clearly.

00:32:07.105 --> 00:32:09.625
Do you still remember
when Xiao Wenyuan came by?

00:32:11.025 --> 00:32:15.145
I really can't remember the specific time.

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:18.625
But it must have been before midnight.

00:32:19.865 --> 00:32:21.025
Before midnight?

00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:25.745
Before midnight.

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:28.385
Your Ladyship.

00:32:30.785 --> 00:32:32.185
Run.

00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:43.105
Guards.

00:32:45.345 --> 00:32:46.865
Guards.

00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:48.025
Guards.

00:33:00.505 --> 00:33:01.345
Madam.

00:33:04.225 --> 00:33:06.305
Protect Her Ladyship and Madam. Let's go.

00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:41.345
Be careful.

00:33:52.785 --> 00:33:53.945
Wu Lie. Take Madam away.

00:33:54.025 --> 00:33:55.025
They came for me.

00:33:55.785 --> 00:33:57.105
We can't leave you behind.

00:33:57.185 --> 00:33:58.425
You're a mother.

00:33:58.505 --> 00:33:59.705
It's unfair to die here with me.

00:33:59.785 --> 00:34:00.785
Let's go.

00:34:16.905 --> 00:34:18.304
So many people?

00:34:18.385 --> 00:34:19.304
You must have been terrified.

00:34:19.385 --> 00:34:21.225
Your Ladyship is smart.

00:34:21.304 --> 00:34:24.225
I'm sure you understand
that the deeper you dig,

00:34:24.304 --> 00:34:25.625
the more dangerous it gets.

00:34:25.705 --> 00:34:27.985
But you'd better kill me this time.

00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:31.865
Otherwise, you and the mastermind
are going to be in trouble.

00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:32.824
Kill her.

00:35:02.225 --> 00:35:03.825
Any other tricks?

00:35:07.145 --> 00:35:08.305
If not,

00:35:09.425 --> 00:35:10.505
I'm going to kill you.

00:35:11.145 --> 00:35:14.745
If you survive, none of us gets to live.

00:35:16.105 --> 00:35:17.545
But I didn't come alone.

00:35:18.145 --> 00:35:19.585
Don't try to bluff me.

00:35:20.225 --> 00:35:23.265
Gu Lingzhou and Wuren
are heading to the Western Capital.

00:35:23.345 --> 00:35:25.745
You only have Xiao Huaijin with you.

00:35:27.265 --> 00:35:29.425
How can he do?

00:35:30.665 --> 00:35:31.825
Kill her.

00:35:32.585 --> 00:35:33.505
Die!

00:35:40.825 --> 00:35:41.745
Why did you come?

00:35:41.825 --> 00:35:42.985
Madam Wu said you were in danger.

00:35:53.505 --> 00:35:54.505
Your Ladyship.

00:35:56.385 --> 00:35:57.425
I was careless.

00:35:58.185 --> 00:35:59.305
The arrow is poisoned.

00:36:00.665 --> 00:36:01.745
Go. Leave me here.

00:36:06.705 --> 00:36:09.105
Now is not the time
for dramatic displays of loyalty.

00:36:09.185 --> 00:36:10.225
You may die.

00:36:10.305 --> 00:36:11.145
It's fine.

00:36:11.225 --> 00:36:13.385
I don't have something I have to do.

00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:15.105
But I swear I will save you.

00:36:15.185 --> 00:36:16.425
My wound hurts.

00:36:23.265 --> 00:36:26.225
Forget about knocking me out to die alone.

00:36:26.305 --> 00:36:29.625
Either we leave together
or I die with you.

00:36:29.705 --> 00:36:32.225
- I won't appreciate you.
- If I wanted to be appreciated,

00:36:32.305 --> 00:36:34.265
I wouldn't have chosen to be with you.

00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:39.185
Then Mr. Xiao,

00:36:40.225 --> 00:36:41.545
let's try to live.

00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:45.705
Crazy kiddo.

00:36:48.025 --> 00:36:51.585
Without the old man,
you were beaten so badly?

00:36:52.105 --> 00:36:53.105
Old man.

00:36:53.625 --> 00:36:54.905
Why did you come?

00:36:54.985 --> 00:36:56.345
If I don't come now,

00:36:56.425 --> 00:36:59.705
I'll go straight to collect your body.

00:37:15.745 --> 00:37:19.505
Those losers really want you dead.

00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:20.945
Is this poison curable?

00:37:21.025 --> 00:37:23.065
My medicine will keep her alive,

00:37:23.145 --> 00:37:25.345
but she will suffer.

00:37:25.425 --> 00:37:26.505
What do you mean?

00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:29.825
Peiyi.

00:37:30.505 --> 00:37:31.385
Your Ladyship.

00:37:31.465 --> 00:37:33.265
- Inspector Du.
- It's okay.

00:37:34.265 --> 00:37:35.505
It's good that she threw up.

00:37:37.745 --> 00:37:38.825
Old man.

00:37:39.585 --> 00:37:41.185
How do you know I'm in trouble?

00:37:41.785 --> 00:37:42.705
Look at you.

00:37:42.785 --> 00:37:46.025
You never take my advice to heart.

00:37:46.105 --> 00:37:49.105
You didn't even hide the fact
that you came to Mingzhou.

00:37:49.185 --> 00:37:52.065
Even I heard about it.
They surely did, too.

00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:55.545
Always make it quick
if you want to look into something.

00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:56.545
Yet you took your time.

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:58.825
Weren't you inviting
them here to kill you?

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:02.785
You came all the way
from the Western Capital

00:38:03.465 --> 00:38:04.745
just to scold me?

00:38:04.825 --> 00:38:06.465
You surely need a scolding.

00:38:13.545 --> 00:38:15.745
That's enough. Leave it to me.

00:38:15.825 --> 00:38:19.065
I'll leave Her Ladyship to you.

00:38:23.945 --> 00:38:25.025
There are many of them.

00:38:25.545 --> 00:38:26.665
Things might be tricky.

00:38:26.745 --> 00:38:29.105
That's why I said leave it to me.

00:38:30.665 --> 00:38:31.625
Get going.

00:38:36.225 --> 00:38:37.625
Crazy kiddo.

00:38:37.705 --> 00:38:40.065
Try to be more careful.

00:38:40.145 --> 00:38:42.545
Don't cause your old man more trouble.

00:38:44.505 --> 00:38:45.745
I promise.

00:38:47.265 --> 00:38:48.625
Get lost.

00:38:48.705 --> 00:38:49.705
Take care.

00:39:19.585 --> 00:39:20.825
It's you?

00:39:20.905 --> 00:39:22.385
You know me?

00:39:23.385 --> 00:39:24.905
So we're old friends.

00:39:25.665 --> 00:39:27.345
Get out of my way

00:39:27.425 --> 00:39:28.785
and I'll spare you.

00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:33.185
Since you know who I am,
stop wasting your breath.

00:39:33.265 --> 00:39:35.065
- Bring it on.
- Kill him.

00:39:58.185 --> 00:40:00.345
I haven't trained for a long time.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:01.625
This is amazing.

00:42:02.825 --> 00:42:04.465
You old fox.

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:05.505
Tricking me into revealing my moves?

00:42:05.585 --> 00:42:07.185
Otherwise,

00:42:07.265 --> 00:42:10.465
how do I find out
which old friend you are?

00:42:34.545 --> 00:42:35.785
Despicable as expected.

00:42:37.465 --> 00:42:38.545
We're not done yet.

00:42:55.265 --> 00:42:56.585
- The blade is poisoned.
- You can't go.

00:42:56.665 --> 00:42:58.145
If Inspector Du can't make it,

00:42:58.225 --> 00:43:00.305
you'll only die there with him.

00:43:00.385 --> 00:43:01.465
I'd rather die with him.

00:43:01.545 --> 00:43:04.105
You promised him to live well.

00:43:06.665 --> 00:43:07.985
It's hard to live,

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:10.385
but easy to die.

00:43:26.425 --> 00:43:27.625
Sorry.

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:29.345
I have to keep you alive.
