WEBVTT

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.234
Anyway…

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:47.277
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.987
{\an8}…what's this?

00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:50.572
{\an8}Oh, that.

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.241
{\an8}Hey, Woo-seok.

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:55.285
{\an8}By any chance,

00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:57.329
{\an8}do you have a wish?

00:00:59.998 --> 00:01:00.999
{\an8}A wish?

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.047
{\an8}Why? Are you going to grant it?

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:09.591
{\an8}No, it's not that. Actually--

00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:12.719
{\an8}It's fine.
It's my life, so I'll handle it myself.

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:14.429
{\an8}I should get going now, Si-yeol.

00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:18.517
{\an8}By the way…

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.691
{\an8}Congrats on the contract renewal.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.610
Hey…

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:51.341
- Hey, Yeon-su.
- Si-yeol, we've got a problem.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:53.009
Now what?

00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:54.678
What's all the fuss about?

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:56.388
Thames FC is facing relegation.

00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:58.640
What on earth are you talking about?

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.727
Relegation? We won the league last season.

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:06.106
They're voiding last season's title,
stripping us of our Champions League spot,

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.358
and relegating us to the Championship.

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:11.319
Is it April Fools' Day?

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:12.821
I'm serious.

00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:15.365
Apparently, Thames violated
Financial Fair Play regulations,

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.493
so UEFA just slapped them with sanctions.

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:25.959
Explain it in simple terms.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.961
What exactly is "Financial Fair Play"?

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:29.504
It's a UEFA rule stating

00:02:29.588 --> 00:02:33.884
that a club can't spend more than
a certain percentage of its revenue.

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:35.969
I still don't get it.

00:02:36.762 --> 00:02:39.848
Basically, the club
committed accounting fraud

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:43.018
to cover your transfer fee
and massive salary.

00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:47.439
So what am I supposed to do now?

00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.733
Will you play in the second division?

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:52.027
Are you crazy? I'm Kang Si-yeol.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.238
Then there's only one option left.

00:04:01.763 --> 00:04:03.515
What the…

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:05.809
KANG SI-YEOL

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:08.520
THAMES FC REFUSES TRANSFER
KANG SI-YEOL FACES A MAJOR CRISIS

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:15.193
SECOND DIVISION NEXT FOR KANG SI-YEOL?

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.613
THAMES FC CHARGED
WITH VIOLATING FFP REGULATIONS

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:28.373
This won't do.

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:30.876
Your passport's at home, right?

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:32.502
I'll have someone bring it over.

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.421
Let's head to the airport right now.

00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:37.215
I don't think staying in Korea
will solve anything.

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:40.343
Okay, find the earliest flight
available right now.

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:48.226
What are you doing? Let's hurry.

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:50.645
Yeah, I'm coming.

00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:55.233
NOVEMBER 20TH
ANNIVERSARY OF GRANDMA'S DEATH

00:04:58.612 --> 00:05:03.575
DEACON KIM BOK-SUN
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.703
Ms. Kim.

00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:13.043
It didn't look like Si-yeol would make it
again this year, so I came instead.

00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:18.340
Gosh, you know how busy he is.

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:22.719
Still, seeing how he timed his return,

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:25.221
it seems like he really meant
to come this year.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.683
But something came up,

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:31.019
so he's probably
out of the country right now.

00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:47.243
Hey, you…

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.122
Grandma, I'm here.

00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:59.339
Looks like Woo-seok's been coming
to see you, Grandma.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.008
He won't even see me these days.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.574
GARDEN OF PEACE MEMORIAL PARK

00:06:26.658 --> 00:06:27.826
I know

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:31.371
you looked after my grandma for me,

00:06:31.997 --> 00:06:35.875
visiting her every holiday
and taking her to the hospital.

00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:40.130
That's because you were abroad.

00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:44.009
You were there when she passed too.

00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:48.513
And you've been bringing her flowers
every year on her anniversary.

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:51.641
Hey, why are you getting all sappy?

00:06:53.476 --> 00:06:56.062
That's the kind of friend you are to me.

00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:58.857
You can tell me anything, okay?

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.526
If you ever need help, I've got your back.

00:07:02.027 --> 00:07:04.070
If you need money, I can give you--

00:07:04.154 --> 00:07:06.448
That's why I'm avoiding you right now.

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:12.954
I don't want…

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.917
to ask you for favors
or borrow money from you.

00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:21.337
I want us to stay friends.

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:24.007
Even if you're a Premier League player,

00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:27.135
no matter how famous you are,

00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:30.930
I want us to be friends for who we are.

00:07:32.682 --> 00:07:36.102
But if I start asking you for things
or relying on you for help,

00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:38.938
I wouldn't be able to see you
as a friend anymore.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.903
- Woo-seok--
- Let's stop talking about this.

00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:46.237
Just think of it

00:07:47.322 --> 00:07:49.491
as giving me some space for now.

00:07:53.328 --> 00:07:54.370
But seriously,

00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:57.290
is it really okay for you to be here?

00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:02.962
Actually, my agent's already in the UK.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.424
I said I'd stop by my grandma's grave,
then head there right away.

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:09.219
Do you think things will work out?

00:08:10.762 --> 00:08:12.472
It doesn't look good right now.

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:15.600
The only option is to meet
and convince them,

00:08:16.476 --> 00:08:19.646
but neither the chairman
nor the coach will see my agent.

00:08:24.734 --> 00:08:26.361
Jeez, another reporter.

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:27.821
I'd better go.

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:29.989
I should go see what I can do.

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:31.074
Hey, wait.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.576
You dropped this.

00:08:34.994 --> 00:08:35.870
What is this?

00:08:35.954 --> 00:08:36.913
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

00:08:36.996 --> 00:08:38.832
Are you into this kind of stuff lately?

00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:40.750
Isn't this like a cult or something?

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:42.752
Oh, right.

00:08:46.965 --> 00:08:47.882
Woo-seok.

00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:51.219
I think…

00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:54.639
there might be a way.

00:09:02.397 --> 00:09:04.732
The player is determined to transfer.

00:09:04.816 --> 00:09:07.527
But Thames FC is refusing
to negotiate at all.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.155
We offered
a 180 million euro transfer fee,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.950
but they reiterated
that he isn't for sale.

00:09:18.913 --> 00:09:21.541
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:24.377
Hey, what are you doing? That's dangerous.

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:28.631
I'm pretty sure
this is how I was told to do it.

00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:37.974
Are you okay?

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.310
Why isn't it working?

00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:10.757
You summoned me sooner
than I expected, Si-yeol.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.093
Then again, the more humans have,

00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:17.639
the greedier they get,
and the bigger their worries become.

00:10:18.306 --> 00:10:21.226
That's why they always end up
needing beings like me.

00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:25.605
So, tell me.

00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:28.191
What's this great wish of yours?

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:45.792
EPISODE 3
THE RISE AND FALL

00:10:47.877 --> 00:10:50.630
{\an8}THAMES FC, LONDON, UK

00:11:00.056 --> 00:11:01.683
That's none of your business.

00:11:05.478 --> 00:11:07.397
I heard there's a nice pub nearby.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.275
If you're done for the day,
why don't you stop by?

00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:35.133
I couldn't even get him to see me,

00:11:35.883 --> 00:11:37.844
and now I just run into him here?

00:11:56.404 --> 00:11:57.530
So,

00:11:58.865 --> 00:12:02.327
the real reason the Geumsu Group heir
turned himself in nine years ago

00:12:03.036 --> 00:12:05.079
was because of that person… I mean…

00:12:05.163 --> 00:12:06.164
Nine-tailed fox.

00:12:06.664 --> 00:12:07.540
Right.

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.877
It was because of that nine-tailed fox?

00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:13.129
Yeah.

00:12:14.005 --> 00:12:17.091
I can't believe it,
but I can't say I don't believe it either.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:20.595
But still,

00:12:21.137 --> 00:12:23.681
she said she'd grant your wish,
and that's it?

00:12:23.765 --> 00:12:26.142
She just listened and disappeared.

00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:28.978
I know.
I'm not sure what's going on either.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.483
RECENT WITHDRAWALS

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:35.193
What the…

00:12:36.903 --> 00:12:37.779
What is it?

00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:40.406
Did she really fix things?

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.326
No, but money was taken out of my account.

00:12:43.409 --> 00:12:45.203
Out of the blue? How much?

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:48.164
- One hundred million won.
- What?

00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:53.503
What the hell?

00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:56.714
Hey, is your account
still getting drained?

00:12:57.673 --> 00:12:59.217
Could it be a phone scam?

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:09.644
Hello?

00:13:10.144 --> 00:13:13.356
Si-yeol, it's all settled.
You're clear for the transfer.

00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:14.941
Really?

00:13:15.024 --> 00:13:19.695
Yeah. I just ran into the chairman,
and it was like he was possessed.

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:23.241
He agreed to your transfer
and wants to know your preferred team.

00:13:23.324 --> 00:13:25.868
He said he'll give
your negotiations top priority.

00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:34.877
What did she say?

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:37.755
So can you transfer?

00:13:43.177 --> 00:13:44.053
Really?

00:13:44.804 --> 00:13:47.598
It's settled? Just like that?

00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:49.350
Yeah.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.894
Just like that.

00:14:06.117 --> 00:14:07.952
- Hey, that's Kang Si-yeol.
- Hello.

00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:09.078
Hello.

00:14:19.714 --> 00:14:20.631
Si-yeol!

00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:25.386
Hey, Woo-seok.

00:14:27.013 --> 00:14:28.473
What are you doing here?

00:14:30.016 --> 00:14:32.810
Si-yeol, can I really

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:36.522
ask you for a favor?

00:14:37.857 --> 00:14:38.733
Of course.

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:42.945
The truth is,
I don't want to quit like this.

00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:46.073
I want to play professionally,

00:14:46.699 --> 00:14:49.660
and I want to play
for the national team too.

00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:51.996
I really want

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:55.374
to live my life differently, just once.

00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:57.877
Do you think…

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.588
that if I made a wish like you did,

00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:03.090
it could come true?

00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:10.223
I don't think so.

00:15:10.306 --> 00:15:11.390
Why not?

00:15:12.058 --> 00:15:14.519
Wishes always come with a price.

00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:17.688
The bigger the wish,
the greater the price.

00:15:18.481 --> 00:15:20.024
But your friend here

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.485
has nothing to offer.

00:15:24.153 --> 00:15:28.199
Does that price have to be money?

00:15:29.283 --> 00:15:31.911
What, are you thinking
of offering up your soul?

00:15:36.499 --> 00:15:39.001
If that's what it takes, then yes.

00:15:39.085 --> 00:15:41.420
Really? What use would that be to me?

00:15:42.547 --> 00:15:44.632
Typical humans.

00:15:44.715 --> 00:15:46.801
Always falling for tired clichés.

00:15:47.426 --> 00:15:49.470
Is there really no other way?

00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:52.807
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:15:55.226 --> 00:15:57.478
You clearly have this all wrong.

00:15:58.354 --> 00:16:01.899
You're not qualified to be my client.
Do you understand?

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.112
That means that you have nothing
of any value to me.

00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:07.530
And you.

00:16:07.613 --> 00:16:09.865
You think I'm a charity or something?

00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:13.202
Don't ever summon me
for something this petty.

00:16:14.036 --> 00:16:15.329
How insolent.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.500
Don't go. We're not finished yet.

00:16:27.925 --> 00:16:28.801
What?

00:16:28.884 --> 00:16:31.095
You talk a big game,

00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:33.723
but it all comes down to money in the end.

00:16:34.432 --> 00:16:35.600
What are you getting at?

00:16:35.683 --> 00:16:38.519
I'll pay for him.
That should settle it, right?

00:16:40.688 --> 00:16:42.106
- No.
- Why not?

00:16:43.566 --> 00:16:45.776
You have to pay the price
for your own wish.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.905
But if you pay for him,
you're basically giving him your wish.

00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:51.240
What's wrong with that?

00:16:51.324 --> 00:16:54.660
What's wrong is that it's a good deed.

00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:59.206
Maybe I forgot to tell you,
but I have only one principle.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.793
I avoid doing even the smallest good deed
and only avoid doing major misdeeds.

00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:06.339
I'd hate to cultivate more virtue
and end up becoming human.

00:17:07.256 --> 00:17:09.967
Come on, stop making excuses.

00:17:11.302 --> 00:17:13.512
- Excuses?
- That sure sounds like one.

00:17:13.596 --> 00:17:16.432
You came to me first
to help catch that hit-and-run driver.

00:17:16.515 --> 00:17:18.434
If that's not a good deed, then what is?

00:17:18.517 --> 00:17:21.354
You know,
I think you'll need to make a wish.

00:17:21.979 --> 00:17:25.399
Wish for it. I'll grant it for you.

00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:27.443
What kind of principle is that, anyway?

00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:29.904
Well, that was--

00:17:29.987 --> 00:17:32.573
Just do it.
Unless it's beyond your capability.

00:17:36.702 --> 00:17:38.245
"Beyond my capability"?

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:47.046
Come to think of it,
our first meeting was way too friendly.

00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:50.424
That's why you're being so reckless
and pushing your luck.

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:56.722
Fine. I'll grant the wish.

00:17:56.806 --> 00:18:00.351
But how I choose to grant it is up to me.

00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:02.311
And of course, you'll pay the price.

00:18:03.562 --> 00:18:04.522
Any problems with that?

00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:23.708
I AM KANG SI-YEOL

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.326
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:19:40.409 --> 00:19:42.870
We are experiencing sudden turbulence.

00:19:43.496 --> 00:19:47.124
All passengers, please remain seated
until further notice.

00:20:25.704 --> 00:20:28.499
DRIVEN BY YOUR TRUST
BEYOND SATISFACTION

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.807
Wake up, you bastard!

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.396
Hey!

00:21:02.867 --> 00:21:04.076
What the…

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:13.502
Where am I?

00:21:37.651 --> 00:21:38.986
FOREVER CARE NURSING HOME

00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:40.321
What is this?

00:21:46.452 --> 00:21:47.870
Did you sleep well, Si-yeol?

00:21:48.662 --> 00:21:51.081
What's going on right now?

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:53.876
What happened?

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:55.044
Why am I suddenly here?

00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:58.130
You made a wish, so a price must be paid.

00:21:58.213 --> 00:21:59.089
What?

00:21:59.924 --> 00:22:01.967
Wait, what does Woo-seok's wish
have to do--

00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:03.594
Didn't I tell you?

00:22:03.677 --> 00:22:07.222
I can grant the wish,
but how I do it is up to me.

00:22:07.306 --> 00:22:09.683
Once again, your wish has been granted.

00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:18.108
What do you mean,
my wish has been granted?

00:22:18.776 --> 00:22:20.235
Where is Woo-seok right now?

00:22:33.332 --> 00:22:34.291
What?

00:22:39.254 --> 00:22:40.339
What the…

00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:43.467
Here.

00:22:44.009 --> 00:22:46.178
You dropped this, Mr. Hyeon.

00:22:46.261 --> 00:22:47.429
Oh, I see.

00:22:49.098 --> 00:22:51.016
But how do you know my name?

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.101
Of course I know you.

00:22:52.184 --> 00:22:56.230
Everyone in Korea knows who you are.

00:22:56.313 --> 00:22:57.356
Right.

00:22:57.439 --> 00:22:58.399
Wait, what?

00:22:59.316 --> 00:23:00.567
What do you mean…

00:23:02.027 --> 00:23:02.903
Excuse me?

00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:09.159
What is this?

00:23:13.539 --> 00:23:14.415
"Hyeon Woo-seok."

00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:16.417
Why am I…

00:23:28.303 --> 00:23:30.097
Fine. I'll grant the wish.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.559
But how I choose to grant it is up to me.

00:23:37.646 --> 00:23:39.565
Well, let's see.

00:23:39.648 --> 00:23:42.818
Your friend is probably
where you're supposed to be right now.

00:23:44.862 --> 00:23:46.238
Oh, come on.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.284
Stop talking in riddles.
You're not making any sense.

00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:55.289
What does Woo-seok's wish have to do
with me being here?

00:23:56.915 --> 00:23:58.709
I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:00.836
That's understandable.

00:24:01.712 --> 00:24:02.796
But you know…

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:09.011
I'm a bit busy right now.

00:24:09.094 --> 00:24:10.471
I have another client waiting.

00:24:10.554 --> 00:24:13.515
Sadly, I don't have the time
to explain everything.

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:16.143
Are you kidding me? I was on a plane to--

00:24:16.226 --> 00:24:20.105
You'll understand exactly
what's going on soon enough.

00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:23.650
So, we'll finish this later.

00:24:26.904 --> 00:24:28.614
Jeez, what now?

00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:31.366
Wait.

00:24:32.201 --> 00:24:33.202
Where'd she go?

00:24:35.287 --> 00:24:36.789
Seriously?

00:24:37.623 --> 00:24:41.085
Hey, Si-yeol. I know you're in there!

00:24:41.168 --> 00:24:42.586
Si-yeol, open the door.

00:24:43.629 --> 00:24:45.422
- Si-yeol!
- What the hell?

00:24:45.506 --> 00:24:46.924
I know you're in there.

00:24:47.007 --> 00:24:49.551
- Open the door, Si-yeol.
- Si-yeol!

00:24:51.053 --> 00:24:52.763
See, I told you he was here.

00:24:52.846 --> 00:24:55.849
- Open the door already. Jeez.
- What took you so long?

00:24:55.933 --> 00:24:59.144
Hey, have you been drinking?

00:24:59.228 --> 00:25:00.646
- What?
- No way.

00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:02.397
You know Si-yeol doesn't drink.

00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:03.816
He's really disciplined.

00:25:03.899 --> 00:25:06.401
Look. There are empty bottles everywhere.

00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:09.780
This place is a mess.

00:25:10.364 --> 00:25:12.199
He must've been having a rough time.

00:25:12.699 --> 00:25:13.951
Hey.

00:25:14.576 --> 00:25:17.162
This is why I told you
not to let soccer consume your life.

00:25:17.246 --> 00:25:19.373
Who are you people? What is this?

00:25:19.456 --> 00:25:20.958
Do we know each other?

00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:23.585
Of course, and that's exactly why
we're here to pick you up.

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:25.087
I've got all his things.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.256
Good. Let's go now.

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:30.342
Go where? I'm not going anywhere!

00:25:30.425 --> 00:25:32.010
Who the hell are you guys?

00:25:32.886 --> 00:25:36.473
Why won't anyone
give me a straight answer?

00:25:36.557 --> 00:25:40.060
Si-yeol, come on. Let's go.
Just apologize to the coach.

00:25:40.644 --> 00:25:43.272
Apologize for what? To whom?

00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:47.109
Just apologize.

00:25:47.192 --> 00:25:48.861
You're such a hothead.

00:25:49.695 --> 00:25:50.654
Lift him up.

00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:52.030
- One, two, three!
- Wait, hold on!

00:25:52.114 --> 00:25:54.491
- Let's go.
- Let go of me! I said let go!

00:25:54.575 --> 00:25:56.827
Let go. Stop it!

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.246
Hey, that hurts! Let me go!

00:25:59.329 --> 00:26:00.664
I'm not going anywhere!

00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:11.592
Hey.

00:26:15.512 --> 00:26:16.388
Welcome.

00:26:18.098 --> 00:26:20.976
I was wondering who it was.
It's been a while.

00:26:25.314 --> 00:26:28.734
I had this specially ordered
from the hotel patisserie.

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:33.322
They say this is all the rage
with young people these days.

00:26:34.198 --> 00:26:35.991
I hope you like it.

00:26:36.074 --> 00:26:38.118
Gosh, you didn't have to bring anything,

00:26:38.202 --> 00:26:41.205
especially considering
how much you brought.

00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:46.668
Not bad.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.381
This is why I like familiar faces.

00:26:52.925 --> 00:26:55.552
It's just a shame
they keep dying of old age.

00:26:56.637 --> 00:26:58.889
I hope you live a long life, Chairman Kim.

00:26:59.932 --> 00:27:03.227
I guess you were taming a new client.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.353
Yes.

00:27:04.853 --> 00:27:08.148
This client is clueless and rude,

00:27:08.232 --> 00:27:10.734
so I'm taking extra care
to tame him properly.

00:27:15.447 --> 00:27:16.657
I like the scent.

00:27:22.204 --> 00:27:25.624
That fellow must be suffering quite a bit.

00:27:27.334 --> 00:27:29.586
- My gosh.
- Anyway, Chairman Kim.

00:27:30.295 --> 00:27:32.089
You've lived a long life
and have everything.

00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.674
And yet, you want more?

00:27:34.383 --> 00:27:36.385
You've grown greedy with age.

00:27:40.806 --> 00:27:41.974
Actually,

00:27:42.933 --> 00:27:47.104
I didn't come to see you
because I have a wish.

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:50.190
You didn't?

00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:53.026
Then what do you want from me?

00:28:03.245 --> 00:28:04.371
Seriously.

00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:08.709
Who are you guys?
I've asked you so many times.

00:28:08.792 --> 00:28:11.128
What's with you today?

00:28:11.211 --> 00:28:12.713
Knock it off, already.

00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:14.923
You fought with the coach, not us.

00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:17.926
You can't just dump us
like a bad investment.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:20.637
You're not really quitting soccer
like this, are you?

00:28:20.721 --> 00:28:23.098
What are you talking about?
Why would I quit?

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.309
I'm Kang Si-yeol.

00:28:25.392 --> 00:28:27.352
I know you're Kang Si-yeol.

00:28:27.436 --> 00:28:29.354
That's why we came to pick you up.

00:28:29.438 --> 00:28:31.898
What does he think he is, royalty?

00:28:31.982 --> 00:28:34.943
You'd never see a player
throw a water bottle at their coach,

00:28:35.027 --> 00:28:36.611
even in the Premier League.

00:28:36.695 --> 00:28:38.905
He didn't actually throw it at the coach.

00:28:38.989 --> 00:28:40.866
He threw it nearby,

00:28:40.949 --> 00:28:43.452
but it just bounced off the wall
and hit him, right?

00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:44.786
No way.

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.747
When this jerk threw the bottle
at the coach,

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.623
I saw it in his eyes. He lost it.

00:28:48.707 --> 00:28:50.208
He was aiming right at him.

00:28:50.292 --> 00:28:52.753
Come on, Si-yeol isn't that crazy.

00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:55.047
Hey! He is crazy!

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.007
This is driving me crazy.

00:28:57.591 --> 00:28:58.467
Hey.

00:28:59.301 --> 00:29:01.011
Are you guys on the national team?

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:04.598
I've never even seen any of you before.

00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:07.934
Did Coach Gonzalez tell you
to bring me in?

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.273
Wow, I think he really has gone crazy.

00:29:13.357 --> 00:29:15.776
- Si-yeol.
- I told you he's crazy.

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:17.069
Whatever, forget it.

00:29:17.152 --> 00:29:19.321
Whoever you are,
I need to get to London now.

00:29:19.404 --> 00:29:22.324
- So take me to the airport.
- London? Why?

00:29:22.949 --> 00:29:25.410
Jeez, don't you guys even watch the news?

00:29:26.244 --> 00:29:28.080
I'm in the middle
of transfer negotiations.

00:29:28.163 --> 00:29:29.122
Really?

00:29:29.664 --> 00:29:33.251
And where exactly are you transferring to?

00:29:33.752 --> 00:29:34.836
To a Sunday league team?

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.130
Hey, Beom, that's a bit harsh.

00:29:37.214 --> 00:29:39.508
Si-yeol,
don't let your pride get in the way.

00:29:39.591 --> 00:29:41.676
Just go to the coach
and beg for forgiveness.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.720
- Jeez!
- Seriously!

00:29:43.804 --> 00:29:48.350
Who am I even supposed to beg,
and for what?

00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:51.144
- Oh, come on!
- Just beg.

00:29:51.228 --> 00:29:53.021
- Who am I supposed to beg?
- Knock it off.

00:29:53.105 --> 00:29:55.065
- I'm getting out!
- Hold on tight!

00:29:55.148 --> 00:29:56.316
- Stay still!
- Hold on to him!

00:30:20.424 --> 00:30:21.842
Last night,

00:30:22.467 --> 00:30:25.178
the wooden-handled dagger
that was here disappeared.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.477
I remembered you'd come by
from time to time and just stare at it.

00:30:33.103 --> 00:30:35.939
I felt it was only right to let you know.

00:30:37.023 --> 00:30:39.443
There's a story behind this object,
isn't there?

00:30:41.278 --> 00:30:42.362
Yes, there is.

00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:46.241
Do you have a family, Chairman Kim?

00:30:46.992 --> 00:30:49.536
Yes, I have a wife and children.

00:30:50.704 --> 00:30:52.664
I had an older sister.

00:30:53.748 --> 00:30:55.459
We weren't related by blood, but…

00:31:02.716 --> 00:31:03.967
Grandma.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.264
We spent a thousand years together,
cultivating ourselves.

00:31:09.347 --> 00:31:10.849
We were like family.

00:31:11.475 --> 00:31:13.185
Be happy, Geum-ho.

00:31:13.268 --> 00:31:15.562
My lady!

00:31:17.481 --> 00:31:19.649
My lady, something terrible has happened!

00:31:19.733 --> 00:31:20.942
There are people outside--

00:31:21.026 --> 00:31:23.320
Open the gates at once!

00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:25.572
- Oh no!
- Oh my!

00:31:25.655 --> 00:31:27.115
This is the house of a traitor!

00:31:27.199 --> 00:31:29.576
Capture every single one of them!

00:31:35.332 --> 00:31:36.833
That way!

00:31:45.467 --> 00:31:46.510
Chun-sim!

00:32:26.716 --> 00:32:27.801
I can't let you in.

00:32:29.886 --> 00:32:32.097
The swordsmith is occupied at the moment.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.432
If you have business at the forge,
try somewhere else.

00:32:34.516 --> 00:32:36.351
What are you planning to do?

00:32:36.434 --> 00:32:38.853
Are you forging the Sajin Ritual Blade?

00:32:38.937 --> 00:32:40.897
What are you planning to use it for?

00:32:42.023 --> 00:32:44.442
I guess I came to the right place, then.

00:32:44.526 --> 00:32:46.403
You ignored me when I asked for your help

00:32:46.486 --> 00:32:49.155
even though I told you
I saw a miserable future for Geum-ho.

00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:51.700
But look, you chased me down like this.

00:32:51.783 --> 00:32:53.326
It's a human life.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.413
A life that Geum-ho
has to endure on her own.

00:32:56.913 --> 00:32:59.249
This isn't something you should meddle in.

00:32:59.332 --> 00:33:00.750
Don't make me laugh.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.420
It's been a thousand years.

00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:06.339
She spent a thousand years
cultivating herself and doing good deeds.

00:33:06.423 --> 00:33:08.883
Is it right for the human life
she was rewarded with

00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:12.137
to be nothing but misery and misfortune?

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.306
Is that Heaven's so-called will?

00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:16.516
So making her commit a sin

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.144
and undoing a thousand years
of spiritual training

00:33:19.227 --> 00:33:21.104
was the solution you came up with?

00:33:21.187 --> 00:33:25.942
Yes. Her family was branded as traitors
and condemned to live as slaves.

00:33:26.568 --> 00:33:28.153
Her husband will be beaten to death,

00:33:28.236 --> 00:33:30.530
and her children will starve,
sicken, and die.

00:33:31.031 --> 00:33:33.867
And she will grow old
having to watch it all happen.

00:33:34.618 --> 00:33:36.703
Anything would be better than that.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:04.814
Geum-ho.

00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:10.278
THE SAJIN RITUAL BLADE

00:34:11.321 --> 00:34:13.740
Stab him with this. You have to.

00:34:15.158 --> 00:34:17.285
- "Him"?
- I'm talking about your husband.

00:34:18.495 --> 00:34:20.538
You're not happy at all living as a human.

00:34:20.622 --> 00:34:21.748
You're miserable.

00:34:22.457 --> 00:34:24.582
If you kill the one you love
with that dagger,

00:34:24.665 --> 00:34:26.711
they say you can return
to being a nine-tailed fox.

00:34:29.673 --> 00:34:30.757
Eun-ho.

00:34:32.676 --> 00:34:36.638
I have a wish. Could you grant it for me?

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.973
Of course. What is it?

00:34:40.517 --> 00:34:43.520
Promise me that you'll grant it.

00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:46.481
Very well. Go on.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.526
Don't ever

00:34:51.236 --> 00:34:53.279
appear before me again.

00:34:56.157 --> 00:34:57.409
That dagger

00:34:58.702 --> 00:35:01.204
was the last thing I gave Geum-ho.

00:35:02.956 --> 00:35:06.918
It's also one of the very few
sacred objects that can kill me.

00:35:14.092 --> 00:35:17.846
DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC
FIRST HOME GAME OF THE SEASON

00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:21.391
- Jeez.
- Damn it.

00:35:22.267 --> 00:35:23.309
Hurry up!

00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:26.271
- Who is it?
- Good afternoon, Coach.

00:35:26.354 --> 00:35:27.647
Wait, why should I beg…

00:35:27.731 --> 00:35:29.482
K4 LEAGUE DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC
EMBLEM CONTEST

00:35:29.566 --> 00:35:31.484
Just stay in here already! Damn it!

00:35:31.568 --> 00:35:32.569
Wait…

00:35:35.029 --> 00:35:36.030
DAEHEUNG CITIZENS FC

00:35:36.114 --> 00:35:37.907
For crying out loud.

00:35:42.704 --> 00:35:43.580
What do you want?

00:35:44.205 --> 00:35:46.374
Hey, Yong-gil!

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:48.960
"Yong-gil"?

00:35:49.043 --> 00:35:50.837
What are you doing here? And…

00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:52.756
A black eye…

00:35:53.506 --> 00:35:54.382
"Black eye"?

00:35:56.092 --> 00:35:57.510
Where's Coach Gonzalez?

00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:03.224
Why on earth

00:36:04.601 --> 00:36:06.394
are you looking
for the national team coach?

00:36:06.478 --> 00:36:08.396
I don't know. You tell me.

00:36:08.897 --> 00:36:11.149
A bunch of weirdos showed up earlier

00:36:12.066 --> 00:36:14.360
and kept telling me
to apologize to the coach.

00:36:16.112 --> 00:36:19.073
So you're saying the coach
you need to apologize to

00:36:20.241 --> 00:36:22.744
is Gonzalez and not me?

00:36:22.827 --> 00:36:25.705
What are you talking about?
Why would I apologize to you?

00:36:27.749 --> 00:36:28.917
Where even am I?

00:36:32.629 --> 00:36:34.339
Hey, Yong-gil,

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:38.051
it's been a while. Aren't you
even going to offer me some coffee?

00:36:40.386 --> 00:36:41.471
This little…

00:36:43.348 --> 00:36:44.974
He's lost his mind.

00:36:45.892 --> 00:36:47.852
Listen, Si-yeol.

00:36:49.145 --> 00:36:52.315
What do you think you're doing?
Is this some kind of protest?

00:36:53.066 --> 00:36:56.110
What's your problem?
Is this because I called you by name?

00:36:56.194 --> 00:36:57.237
Don't you remember?

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.572
You said I could call you
by your name and not "Coach."

00:36:59.656 --> 00:37:00.698
Hey!

00:37:01.324 --> 00:37:02.826
Why are you yelling at me?

00:37:04.202 --> 00:37:05.703
Why would

00:37:06.454 --> 00:37:10.291
a fourth-division player like you
be looking for the national team coach?

00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:12.001
"Fourth division"?

00:37:13.628 --> 00:37:14.754
Me?

00:37:14.838 --> 00:37:16.756
But I'm Kang Si-yeol.

00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:21.344
I was ready to give you a second chance

00:37:21.427 --> 00:37:24.639
if you came here
and begged for forgiveness.

00:37:25.265 --> 00:37:27.725
But never mind. You're off the team!

00:37:29.227 --> 00:37:31.479
This is ridiculous.

00:37:31.563 --> 00:37:34.274
Anyone would think you were my coach.

00:37:34.357 --> 00:37:37.277
Fine, kick me off the team!

00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:41.698
Fine, you… No. You know what?

00:37:41.781 --> 00:37:45.118
I'm going to ban you
from the sport, you punk!

00:37:45.201 --> 00:37:48.538
You? Ban me? There's no way.

00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:50.290
Do whatever you want!

00:37:50.373 --> 00:37:52.959
Kick me off the team. Ban me for life.

00:37:53.042 --> 00:37:54.586
Do whatever you want!

00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:57.463
That black eye
really knocked something loose.

00:37:59.549 --> 00:38:00.675
Unbelievable!

00:38:00.758 --> 00:38:02.302
What's wrong with him?

00:38:02.927 --> 00:38:04.053
That little…

00:38:08.808 --> 00:38:12.020
- Hey, did you apologize?
- Did he say you can return to training?

00:38:12.103 --> 00:38:14.063
You didn't cause more trouble, did you?

00:38:17.525 --> 00:38:18.693
Be honest with me.

00:38:20.028 --> 00:38:21.529
Is this a hidden camera prank?

00:38:22.989 --> 00:38:23.907
What?

00:38:25.575 --> 00:38:26.618
This is for YouTube, right?

00:38:27.911 --> 00:38:29.120
Whose channel is it?

00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:32.290
You shouldn't be doing this
just for views. I'm Kang Si-yeol.

00:38:34.918 --> 00:38:35.960
What's with him today?

00:38:38.463 --> 00:38:40.048
You can't do this.

00:38:40.131 --> 00:38:42.926
Even if you're desperate for views,
you need to ask first.

00:38:56.481 --> 00:38:58.107
- I'm borrowing this.
- Wait…

00:38:59.776 --> 00:39:01.653
- What…
- What's going on?

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.497
It wasn't just the cameras.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.291
The whole security system
went down briefly.

00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:19.128
Do you have any idea
what might have happened?

00:39:19.212 --> 00:39:21.005
It doesn't make any sense, sir.

00:39:21.089 --> 00:39:24.008
Everything was normal
during our last patrol.

00:39:24.676 --> 00:39:26.135
Looks like your memory was erased.

00:39:27.136 --> 00:39:28.388
Pardon?

00:39:28.471 --> 00:39:31.599
You really didn't notice anything unusual?

00:39:32.767 --> 00:39:34.644
No, ma'am. We patrol in pairs--

00:39:34.727 --> 00:39:36.437
Look me in the eye.

00:39:38.189 --> 00:39:40.775
Are you sure you didn't notice
anything unusual?

00:39:41.734 --> 00:39:43.736
Well…

00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:46.698
Actually, there was someone.

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.284
It was a man.

00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:52.912
- Sir!
- Stay out of this.

00:39:54.747 --> 00:39:55.790
A man?

00:39:56.958 --> 00:39:58.001
Was he alone?

00:39:58.501 --> 00:40:03.339
Yes. I tried to stop him
and asked how he got in--

00:40:17.937 --> 00:40:19.355
He's under a binding spell.

00:40:35.371 --> 00:40:39.709
I didn't realize there were still humans
who could use techniques like that.

00:40:39.792 --> 00:40:40.752
A human?

00:40:42.336 --> 00:40:43.921
Can a human do such a thing?

00:40:44.881 --> 00:40:46.632
It's not something just anyone can do.

00:40:47.425 --> 00:40:50.553
A mere human
mimicking the powers of a deity

00:40:51.054 --> 00:40:53.681
will pay a steep price.

00:40:55.224 --> 00:40:58.936
Why would someone like that
need the wooden-handled dagger?

00:41:01.147 --> 00:41:02.231
Could they be…

00:41:03.608 --> 00:41:06.277
trying to harm you?

00:41:08.404 --> 00:41:11.783
Do you really think a human
who's learned a few cheap tricks like this

00:41:11.866 --> 00:41:13.701
could actually harm me?

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.123
Sure, I'd die if I were stabbed.
But how would he even do that?

00:41:19.624 --> 00:41:21.417
I'd like to see him try.

00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:22.585
That's a relief then.

00:41:23.753 --> 00:41:25.046
So what should we do?

00:41:26.422 --> 00:41:27.965
I'm not sure.

00:41:29.383 --> 00:41:32.303
But let me take a look at him first.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.479
ADVANCING CORRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE

00:41:41.562 --> 00:41:43.981
HUMAN-CENTERED CORRECTIONS
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

00:42:04.293 --> 00:42:05.503
It's been a while.

00:42:07.004 --> 00:42:08.422
Seeing you out here,

00:42:09.173 --> 00:42:11.008
you look like a different person.

00:42:13.719 --> 00:42:16.973
{\an8}TWO YEARS AGO

00:42:24.522 --> 00:42:27.150
There's no need to search
this cell so thoroughly.

00:42:27.692 --> 00:42:30.319
- Excuse me?
- Jeez, come with me.

00:42:36.742 --> 00:42:38.536
Inmate 478, anything to report?

00:42:46.002 --> 00:42:49.380
Inmate 133 has
cigarettes stashed in his cell.

00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:52.175
Inmate 2759 is making flower cards
out of cardboard.

00:42:52.258 --> 00:42:54.844
And as for Inmate 1614…

00:42:57.638 --> 00:42:59.223
You little piece of shit!

00:42:59.307 --> 00:43:02.059
- You little bastard!
- Why did this jerk end up in our cell?

00:43:02.143 --> 00:43:03.060
Damn it!

00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:09.817
You crazy bastard.

00:43:09.901 --> 00:43:12.320
Hey, I heard your father disowned you.

00:43:12.987 --> 00:43:14.989
You're nothing now, you piece of shit.

00:43:17.116 --> 00:43:19.493
Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you.

00:43:19.577 --> 00:43:22.121
- I should poke your eyes out!
- That's enough.

00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:25.917
What did you just say, old man?

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:30.296
Hey, you just got here,
so you clearly don't know how things work.

00:43:30.379 --> 00:43:34.050
- Mind your own damn business.
- I said, that's enough.

00:43:36.844 --> 00:43:39.055
I've got business with this guy.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.433
Is he out of his mind?

00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:46.646
What's going on?

00:43:51.734 --> 00:43:52.818
What the…

00:44:01.953 --> 00:44:03.162
We need to talk.

00:44:03.246 --> 00:44:04.789
Who the hell are you?

00:44:05.498 --> 00:44:08.459
It's a bit cramped in here.
Why don't we go for a walk?

00:44:31.274 --> 00:44:33.818
So you're not human either?

00:44:35.236 --> 00:44:36.112
I'm human.

00:44:37.822 --> 00:44:40.408
That doesn't make sense. How…

00:44:40.491 --> 00:44:42.034
How could a human…

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.246
Why wouldn't a human
be able to do what a mere fox can do?

00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:47.248
It's just a little tricky, that's all.

00:44:53.629 --> 00:44:54.714
Take this.

00:44:55.548 --> 00:44:56.716
What is it?

00:44:57.383 --> 00:44:58.592
A warding sigil.

00:44:59.093 --> 00:45:00.928
It's a talisman to ward off evil.

00:45:01.595 --> 00:45:03.556
As long as you have this on you,

00:45:03.639 --> 00:45:07.018
the nine-tailed fox's spell
won't affect you.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.755
No need to thank me.

00:45:37.465 --> 00:45:38.758
But when you get out,

00:45:39.467 --> 00:45:41.052
let's do a job together.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.444
Jeez.

00:45:59.278 --> 00:46:01.113
Where are we going?

00:46:01.197 --> 00:46:02.531
I told you before.

00:46:02.615 --> 00:46:05.284
I said let's do a job together
once you get out.

00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:07.745
What exactly is this "job"?

00:46:08.412 --> 00:46:09.914
It's nothing difficult.

00:46:11.457 --> 00:46:13.292
You just need to act as bait.

00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:16.170
- What?
- Starting now,

00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:19.590
I'm going on a fox hunt.

00:46:26.931 --> 00:46:33.562
JOSEON-ERA INK-WASH PAINTING
DEPICTING COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY

00:46:34.688 --> 00:46:36.190
You there, painter.

00:46:36.732 --> 00:46:38.901
I was thinking of commissioning something.

00:46:39.652 --> 00:46:43.489
I don't have anything to offer,
but I can buy you a drink.

00:46:48.577 --> 00:46:52.164
I heard someone took the dagger
from over there last night.

00:46:52.832 --> 00:46:55.000
Could you do a quick sketch of him for me?

00:47:09.473 --> 00:47:11.517
Why isn't Woo-seok picking up?

00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:37.418
I don't think you're a resident here.

00:47:38.586 --> 00:47:40.838
Oh, it's me.

00:47:42.047 --> 00:47:44.800
I've never seen you before.
Which unit are you visiting?

00:47:46.135 --> 00:47:47.720
- Pardon?
- What?

00:47:47.803 --> 00:47:49.513
Come on now.

00:47:58.647 --> 00:47:59.732
What?

00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:10.409
Who are you?

00:48:10.493 --> 00:48:13.287
I'm sorry. I thought this was my home.

00:48:15.456 --> 00:48:18.375
Wait, this is my home.

00:48:18.459 --> 00:48:19.752
What a weirdo.

00:48:20.461 --> 00:48:21.378
Oh my goodness!

00:48:21.462 --> 00:48:22.546
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.173
Who are you? Why are you in my--

00:48:24.256 --> 00:48:26.300
What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?

00:48:26.383 --> 00:48:27.593
Excuse me.

00:48:27.676 --> 00:48:29.470
- Sir, this woman--
- Sir, this man--

00:48:29.553 --> 00:48:31.597
This guy's really asking for trouble.

00:48:32.264 --> 00:48:34.683
- Who are you?
- What's wrong with you?

00:48:34.767 --> 00:48:37.186
Don't you recognize me?

00:48:38.312 --> 00:48:40.356
How on earth would I know who you are?

00:48:40.439 --> 00:48:42.233
- Come on, get out.
- Wait a second!

00:48:42.316 --> 00:48:43.776
That's enough. Out!

00:48:43.859 --> 00:48:45.194
Wait…

00:48:46.612 --> 00:48:48.822
Oh my goodness!

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:50.658
What's going on?

00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:51.617
Excuse me!

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:53.077
- This is my home.
- Do something!

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.411
- Yes, ma'am.
- My gosh!

00:48:54.495 --> 00:48:56.121
- Excuse me.
- This really is my home.

00:48:56.205 --> 00:48:57.289
He's just…

00:48:57.957 --> 00:48:58.999
This isn't possible.

00:48:59.083 --> 00:49:00.334
What's wrong with him? Hey!

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.628
- Are you out of your mind?
- Oh my!

00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:04.713
No, this seriously isn't possible.

00:49:04.797 --> 00:49:07.174
Come on! I told you to get out!

00:49:07.967 --> 00:49:09.677
I'm very sorry about this.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.303
Come on, let's go!

00:49:25.025 --> 00:49:27.236
What is all this?

00:49:27.861 --> 00:49:28.988
It's a trap.

00:49:29.572 --> 00:49:31.824
I told you, I'm going on a fox hunt.

00:49:32.533 --> 00:49:34.994
You can catch a nine-tailed fox with this?

00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:37.329
All you have to do is set the right bait.

00:49:38.622 --> 00:49:40.165
A wicked creature like that

00:49:40.249 --> 00:49:43.586
can never escape
once it's trapped in this sacred rope.

00:49:48.382 --> 00:49:50.217
Why are you doing all this?

00:49:51.343 --> 00:49:54.054
Do you have a grudge
against the nine-tailed fox too?

00:49:55.681 --> 00:49:58.392
A hunter doesn't hunt
because of a personal grudge.

00:50:35.304 --> 00:50:36.597
What are you doing?

00:50:37.765 --> 00:50:40.684
Shut your mouth and stay still.
We don't want to jinx it.

00:51:05.668 --> 00:51:06.669
What is this?

00:51:21.642 --> 00:51:22.643
You.

00:51:23.852 --> 00:51:26.522
Food's here. Go on and stuff your face!

00:51:37.032 --> 00:51:37.991
What is that?

00:51:38.575 --> 00:51:41.662
It's the vengeful spirit
of a starved wild dog.

00:51:42.746 --> 00:51:43.831
What?

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:46.959
- Roll up your sleeve.
- Pardon?

00:51:49.044 --> 00:51:51.255
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Roll it up.

00:51:52.506 --> 00:51:53.632
Damn it.

00:51:57.177 --> 00:51:58.178
Stay still.

00:52:04.935 --> 00:52:08.897
That dog needs to pick up
the fox scent all over you.

00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:12.067
The protective talisman you have
masks the fox's scent.

00:52:13.193 --> 00:52:16.697
If you're done stuffing your face,
it's time to earn your keep.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.908
This guy is under the fox's spell.

00:52:20.868 --> 00:52:23.787
Don't move a muscle
unless you want to be torn to pieces.

00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:27.708
Here.

00:52:28.667 --> 00:52:33.422
Now, go and find out where that fox is.

00:52:56.028 --> 00:52:58.989
{\an8}SOLLENFORD AIRPORT, LONDON, UK

00:53:07.539 --> 00:53:09.583
ONLY WOO-SEOK!

00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:10.834
LOVE YOU FOREVER
WOO-SEOK

00:53:18.634 --> 00:53:19.510
Woo-seok.

00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:23.639
Dad?

00:53:25.057 --> 00:53:26.809
Why are you here, Dad?

00:53:27.476 --> 00:53:28.519
What do you mean?

00:53:30.479 --> 00:53:32.189
Where else would I be?

00:53:36.026 --> 00:53:37.110
I see.

00:53:38.111 --> 00:53:38.987
Right.

00:53:39.071 --> 00:53:41.865
Wait, listen to me. I'm not some weirdo.

00:53:42.825 --> 00:53:45.118
I'm telling you that really is my home.

00:53:45.202 --> 00:53:47.120
Hey, wait…

00:53:47.621 --> 00:53:50.499
But do you seriously not know me?
Don't you watch soccer?

00:53:50.582 --> 00:53:53.252
Don't you know Kang Si-yeol,
the world's best athlete?

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.382
What did you do
to get yourself thrown in here already?

00:53:58.465 --> 00:53:59.466
You!

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.468
Perfect timing. Hold on a moment.

00:54:03.178 --> 00:54:04.805
- Hey, you.
- Yes?

00:54:19.945 --> 00:54:21.530
Find someone who looks like this.

00:54:21.613 --> 00:54:23.615
Use any means necessary.

00:54:25.325 --> 00:54:26.285
Yes, ma'am.

00:54:45.053 --> 00:54:46.972
Do you understand what's going on now?

00:54:48.515 --> 00:54:49.850
Damn it.

00:54:52.603 --> 00:54:54.897
What did you do to me?

00:54:55.939 --> 00:54:57.482
I guess not yet.

00:54:59.776 --> 00:55:02.112
All right. I'll fill you in now.

00:55:04.615 --> 00:55:07.993
I switched your fates.

00:55:10.746 --> 00:55:11.872
What?

00:55:11.955 --> 00:55:15.584
So, in this world,
the Kang Si-yeol you knew is gone.

00:55:16.084 --> 00:55:17.669
Because your fate has changed.

00:55:17.753 --> 00:55:20.005
Just tell me what's going on!

00:55:20.088 --> 00:55:25.385
What does no one recognizing me
have to do with Woo-seok's wish?

00:55:25.469 --> 00:55:26.678
And what happened to my house?

00:55:26.762 --> 00:55:29.973
That's the price you paid
for your friend's wish.

00:55:31.975 --> 00:55:35.812
For every rise, there must be a fall.

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.690
For someone to take the throne,

00:55:38.774 --> 00:55:40.943
someone else
must be stripped of their crown.

00:55:41.985 --> 00:55:43.362
That's the law of the world.

00:55:43.445 --> 00:55:45.405
Not even I can change that.

00:55:47.449 --> 00:55:48.450
So,

00:55:49.409 --> 00:55:51.203
when you say
our fates have been switched…

00:55:51.286 --> 00:55:54.164
Since someone became
a world-class soccer player,

00:55:55.832 --> 00:55:59.544
someone else had to step down.

00:56:01.254 --> 00:56:03.423
That's the only way
to maintain the balance.

00:56:19.064 --> 00:56:19.982
Then…

00:56:22.567 --> 00:56:24.194
it wasn't just a dream?

00:56:24.277 --> 00:56:25.570
The past was rewritten.

00:56:26.363 --> 00:56:28.198
Naturally, the present followed suit.

00:56:28.907 --> 00:56:29.992
No way in hell.

00:56:30.659 --> 00:56:32.911
So I really am a fourth-division player?

00:56:33.453 --> 00:56:34.621
Are you kidding me? You…

00:56:36.331 --> 00:56:37.416
What's the problem?

00:56:37.499 --> 00:56:39.876
I made your friend a world-class player

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.088
who plays in the European leagues
and for the national team.

00:56:43.171 --> 00:56:46.091
Isn't that enough?
That's what you both wished for.

00:56:46.717 --> 00:56:50.012
"Enough"? The hell it is! I'm literally…

00:56:58.603 --> 00:57:02.024
Whatever. Just put everything back
the way it was. Right now.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.861
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- Why the hell not?

00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:10.657
Because you have nothing left
to pay for a wish.

00:57:10.741 --> 00:57:14.161
You have no money,
and the life you built is gone.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:15.871
Then…

00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:19.666
I have to keep living like this?

00:57:21.334 --> 00:57:24.588
Well, there is a way.

00:57:25.756 --> 00:57:26.631
What is it?

00:57:35.223 --> 00:57:36.183
What's going on?

00:57:36.266 --> 00:57:39.352
This is my place in London.

00:57:41.188 --> 00:57:42.272
Gosh.

00:57:46.193 --> 00:57:48.820
This is our house? For real?

00:57:49.446 --> 00:57:52.074
- Woo-seok.
- Oh gosh.

00:57:52.157 --> 00:57:54.034
What has he been going on about?

00:57:54.117 --> 00:57:55.410
Of course this is our house.

00:58:21.019 --> 00:58:22.395
It's simple.

00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:26.817
All your friend needs to do
is make a wish, just like you did.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:29.027
A wish to switch your fates back.

00:58:30.028 --> 00:58:30.904
What?

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:32.531
Woo-seok.

00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:34.658
Have you thought about it?

00:58:37.035 --> 00:58:38.662
About what?

00:58:38.745 --> 00:58:41.123
Your transfer. Where do you want to go?

00:58:41.873 --> 00:58:44.960
They said they'll match
any contract terms we want.

00:58:45.794 --> 00:58:46.795
So,

00:58:47.879 --> 00:58:49.840
you just have to make the final call.

00:59:06.273 --> 00:59:07.232
I can go…

00:59:09.192 --> 00:59:10.986
anywhere I want?

00:59:12.195 --> 00:59:14.781
Of course, you're Hyeon Woo-seok.

00:59:17.617 --> 00:59:18.952
But I wonder

00:59:19.703 --> 00:59:22.080
if your friend
would actually make that wish?

00:59:22.164 --> 00:59:23.540
For your sake?

00:59:25.959 --> 00:59:30.255
He finally has the life
he's always dreamed of.

00:59:30.338 --> 00:59:32.465
He's only just started living it.

00:59:46.104 --> 00:59:47.189
Why…

00:59:50.066 --> 00:59:51.484
are you doing this to me?

00:59:52.402 --> 00:59:56.239
I can't stand humans
who get cocky with me.

00:59:57.490 --> 00:59:59.284
To be my client,

01:00:00.076 --> 01:00:02.495
I needed to teach you some manners first.

01:00:03.747 --> 01:00:05.081
That's it?

01:00:06.082 --> 01:00:10.420
Do you think it's okay
to toy with people's lives like this?

01:00:10.921 --> 01:00:12.464
Why are you getting so worked up?

01:00:13.173 --> 01:00:16.051
Everything can be easily fixed
if your friend makes the wish.

01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:21.556
What's wrong?
You don't trust your friend either?

01:00:26.978 --> 01:00:28.688
Actually, I'm curious too.

01:00:29.814 --> 01:00:33.443
Let's see how your friend
decides to play this.

01:01:16.945 --> 01:01:19.864
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:01:19.948 --> 01:01:23.034
{\an8}Si-yeol, just one month.
Let's switch back in a month.

01:01:23.118 --> 01:01:24.744
{\an8}Hyeon Woo-seok! Oh, come on!

01:01:24.828 --> 01:01:26.329
{\an8}No, no.

01:01:26.413 --> 01:01:28.581
{\an8}Are you saying
I have to keep living like this?

01:01:28.665 --> 01:01:31.960
{\an8}I'm going to burn this place down!
Put me down!

01:01:32.043 --> 01:01:34.254
{\an8}I can't live like that. I won't, damn it!

01:01:34.337 --> 01:01:35.505
{\an8}Have you learned your lesson?

01:01:35.588 --> 01:01:38.633
{\an8}Put me back! Please.

01:01:38.717 --> 01:01:41.803
{\an8}Well, that should do it.
I guess I've tamed you enough.

01:01:41.886 --> 01:01:42.846
{\an8}Shall we end this here?

01:01:42.929 --> 01:01:44.556
{\an8}Is it good?

01:01:44.639 --> 01:01:45.682
{\an8}Where to?

01:01:45.765 --> 01:01:47.517
{\an8}I'm sorry. I thought this was a taxi.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.103
{\an8}You have the wish-granting
business card, don't you?

01:01:50.186 --> 01:01:52.480
{\an8}I have some business with that fox.

01:01:52.981 --> 01:01:54.274
{\an8}Get up, Kang Si-yeol.

01:01:56.693 --> 01:01:58.737
