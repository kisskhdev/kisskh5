1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:45,670
Okay.

4
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,505
Hey, what the fuck?
- Hey, hey.
- Easy. Don'’t move.

5
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,379
You'’re making
big mistake, you know that?

6
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,467
Shut the fuck up.

7
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:00,990
- Let'’s go.
- Fuck.

8
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:06,996
[Joel] Get the door.
Shut the fuck up.

9
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,868
Watch the fucking jacket,
man. It'’s new.[Joel] Shut the fuck up!

10
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:22,185
Listen to me.
You alert your brother

11
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:24,970
and I shoot you in
the back of the head,
you understand me?

12
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,451
Okay. You'’re the boss.

13
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,150
Slow.

14
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,854
Yo, yo, yo!

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,858
You remember
my pumpkin frappé, huh?

16
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,864
Don'’t! Don'’t.

17
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,345
Touch it and he'’s
fucking dead. Hands up!

18
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:56,045
Jesus Christ,
you dumb motherfucker.
Do you know who we are?

19
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,613
Yeah, I know who you
fucking are. Last January,

20
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:01,181
the two of you shot an
innocent mother and a kid.

21
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,139
Killed '’em. In Newark.

22
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:07,274
Oh, yeah? Says who?
Who the fuck are you, huh?

23
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:12,757
I brought something
to give you.

24
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:13,976
Uh-huh?

25
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:17,458
But you have to watch
what I'’m doing.

26
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:20,722
You watching?

27
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:25,117
Oh! No!

28
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,730
No! No!

29
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,658
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

30
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,921
No, no, no. Fuck!

31
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,053
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

32
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,839
No, don'’t die.
Don'’t die, don'’t die!

33
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,276
Fuck! Fuck. Look at me.

34
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,584
Look at me, you motherfucker,
you can'’t die! You can'’t die!

35
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:58,542
It needs somebody
to fucking pass to.

36
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,892
If you die, it won'’t
fucking work. Look at me!

37
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:04,200
Stay alive, you piece of shit.
Stay alive, you piece of shit!

38
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,907
Oh, G-- No.

39
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,041
Oh, no.

40
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:23,828
Oh, no.

41
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,444
Fuck. Fuck.

42
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,141
Fuck!

43
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,101
Now it has no one
to pass to, fuck!

44
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,192
Fuck. Fuck.

45
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,411
No, no, no!

46
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,326
- Who the fuck are you?
- No one.

47
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,024
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'’m Lewis.

48
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,810
I'’m no one. I'’m no one.
- I'’m literally no one.
- What the fuck you doing here?

49
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,333
- Don'’t shoot me.
- Answer me!

50
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,161
What the fuck
are you doing here?

51
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,902
I just buy from them, okay?

52
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,426
I fucking hate those guys.
I hate them, too!

53
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,775
I fucking hate them,
especially him!

54
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,473
Please, don'’t shoot me.

55
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,260
I didn'’t know
anybody else was here.

56
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:07,263
Okay, fuck it.

57
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,484
I didn'’t fucking know
anybody else was here!

58
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,574
I fucked this whole thing up.

59
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,446
I fucked this whole thing up
and I'’m sorry.

60
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,667
This wasn'’t meant for you.

61
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:21,016
What?

62
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,757
This wasn'’t meant for you.

63
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,280
What wasn'’t meant for me?

64
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:29,198
- I'’m sorry.
- What? What are you-- Fuck.

65
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,156
What are you sorry for?

66
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:34,943
Fuck.

67
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,207
- I'’m sorry.
- What?

68
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,693
Yo,

69
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,477
who the fuck is that?

70
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:49,871
Oh, shit.

71
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:51,786
Ah!

72
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,396
Fuck!

73
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,443
Who has the goddamned key?

74
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,362
Come on! Fuck!

75
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:15,505
No, no,
- no, no, don'’t shoot!
- Shit.

76
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:19,117
Fuck! Alexi
- and Yev are fucking dead!
- Oh, fuck.

77
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,469
Get that piece of shit!

78
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,819
Open it!

79
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,736
Break the fucking door down!

80
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,651
Break it! Break it!

81
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,263
Go! Go!

82
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,049
Move! Move!

83
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,009
Shoot the motherfucker!

84
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:49,713

Now, nearly one year ago,

92
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:42,826
singer/songwriter
and pop superstar Skye Riley

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,134
was fighting for her life
after being injured in
a car accident.

94
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:49,964
An accident that also
tragically took the life

95
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:51,705
of actor Paul Hudson.

96
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,185
Today, for her first
public interview

97
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,447
since the accident,

98
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,101
ladies and gentlemen,

99
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,190
the one and only Skye Riley.

100
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,985
Oh, my God, Drew!

101
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:14,205
Thank you so much
for having me.

102
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,948
So happy to be doing this
with you.

103
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:21,125
I mean, I have got to say
that you look incredible
in person.

104
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,388
-  Oh, my gosh. As do you.
- Your hair-- I'’m obsessed.

105
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,043
Oh, my God. My hair. I was
just trying something new.

106
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,176
I'’m not sure if
- I'’m pulling it off.
- Um, I-- What do we think?

107
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,178
[Skye] Oh, my God.

108
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,006
Well, I think
you have your answer.

109
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,486
Now you'’ve announced
new tour dates... Yes.

110
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,707
...actually kicking off
right here in New York City

111
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,623
next week. Is this
an emotional comeback?

112
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:43,757
Yes, a lot of different
emotions, you know, with
this one.

113
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,108
A year ago, you had
- just won a Grammy.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:50,807
You were in the middle
- of a big world tour.
- Mm.

115
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,810
And then you hit
this rough patch.

116
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,986
"Rough patch" might
be generous.

117
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,728
I was wondering
if you could share anything

118
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,861
from that period of your life.

119
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:04,038
I was dealing with
a lot of stress and pressure

120
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,779
from the demands of the tour.

121
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:09,217
And I should have
asked for help, but

122
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,916
instead I drowned it all out
with...

123
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,399
drugs and alcohol
and a lot of bad decisions.

124
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,923
And I let myself get
completely out of control.

125
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:22,970
And actually, I want to
take this opportunity

126
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,625
to apologize to my fans,

127
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,585
my loved ones, my team.

128
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,893
Everyone who was counting on me
and supporting me.

129
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,418
I let you all down and...

130
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,681
I promise

131
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,031
that will never
happen again.

132
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:43,077
So, thank you.

133
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,559
You were in the hospital.
When you got out,

134
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:51,607
what has the time been like
between then and now?

135
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,267
I spent a lot of time
looking inward.

136
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:04,664
Relearning how to
appreciate life sober.

137
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,015
And I'’m...

138
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,539
I'’m just so grateful
for this second chance,

139
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,672
and I don'’t want to waste it.

140
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,812
Car'’s waiting right
outside by the curb.

141
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,814
There'’s a bit of a crowd.

142
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,131
Skye!

143
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,971
- My name is Ashley.
- So nice to meet you.

144
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,200
That went really well.

145
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,420
- You were perfectly graceful.
- Yeah.

146
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,596
Skye, you'’ve got
Instagram and TikTok

147
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,425
seriously blowing up
right now.

148
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:14,646

on Twitter. I mean, you should
really be so proud...

00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,511
Are you hurt?

176
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,208
Yep, I'’m fine.

177
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,472
I'’m fine. I think
I just took a weird step.

178
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:43,866
Let'’s take a break, everyone.
Can we get some ice?

179
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,346
Anton, I'’m fine. I'’m fine.

180
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,739
- Skye.
- Can we please just go again?

181
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,089
- I want to get it right, okay?
- Okay.

182
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,307
- Let'’s go.
- Let'’s go again.

183
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,874
-  Line up!
- Rewind it.

184
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,789
- Yep.
- Back to one.

185
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,400
Music.

186
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,576
<i>♪ Give me a new brain ♪</i>

187
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,013
<i>♪ I'’ve got a sweet tooth ♪</i>

188
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:43,708
Shit!

189
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,102
One second!

190
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,894
Yeah, come in.

191
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,331
Hey.

192
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:58,636
You okay?

193
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,683
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, Mom.

194
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:03,293
I just need a minute.

195
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,950
You should feel really good
about today.

196
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,300
I know.

197
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,303
I do.

198
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:14,826
Good.

199
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,396
We'’re ready whenever you are.

200
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,363
Final rehearsal is
confirmed for Wednesday.

201
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,234
So we'’ll be at the venue
first thing in the morning.

202
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:34,063
You have a fitting,
photo shoot,

203
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:37,153
then stage walk-throughs,
then a fan meet-and-greet.

204
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,068
Please go straight to bed
when you get home.

205
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:40,896
It'’s going to be a long day.

206
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,683
Oh, and reminder:
Darius gets in tomorrow.

207
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,990
He'’s gonna be here for opening.

208
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,993
I want him
to feel the love, please.

209
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,387
The label is advancing
a lot of money on this tour.

210
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,606
Have I ever not been
good with Darius?

211
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,566
Darius adores you, obviously.

212
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,308
Just want you to remember
who'’s paying the bill.

213
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,064
Hey, straight to bed, Skye.

214
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:19,239
Good night.

215
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,243
Miss Riley.

216
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:56,754
Hey.

217
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,587
What the fuck, Lewis?

218
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:06,721
- What do you want from me?
- Vicodin! Just Vicodin.

219
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:10,203
Just for pain,
- same as last time.
- Fuck that!

220
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,901
Skye Riley isn'’t just gonna
suddenly show up here.

221
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,991
Your text
said to come over.

222
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:17,340
- What?
- What?

223
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:20,169
- What? What?
- What? What?

224
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:27,176
I don'’t--
I don'’t remember texting that.

225
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,137
How come I don'’t remember
texting that?

226
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,747
- Oh, fuck.
- I don'’t know.

227
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,662
Just get the fuck off me.

228
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:35,706
Get the fuck off me!

229
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,318
Oh. Oh, shit.

230
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,711
Holy shit, I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry.

231
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:47,109
I am having the worst week.

232
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:55,857
The worst!

233
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,862
Lewis... what was
with the sword?

234
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,039
Uh, what? What sword?

235
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,780
Oh, that sword.

236
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:09,218
I feel--
I'’m so sorry about that.

237
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,134
I cannot be too careful
right now. Okay?

238
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:16,486
I am in the middle of some
genuinely fucking freaky shit.

239
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,836
Okay? I'’m talking like
fucking scary,

240
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,056
fucking haunted-house shit,
you know?

241
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,626
Yo...

242
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:30,021
do you believe in, like,
weird stuff?

243
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,504
- Yeah, I'’m gonna go.
- What? No, no, no!

244
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:38,117
No, please stay.
Please stay. What am I doing?
What am I doing?

245
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,032
Skye fucking Riley'’s here
and Lewis is being fucking
crazy?

246
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:44,775
I am so stoked to see you.
I am pumped. Come on. Come in.

247
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:48,344
I will chill. Be my guest.
Please take a seat.

248
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,999
Make yourself at home.
I'’m sorry about the mess.

249
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,044
You said you, uh, wanted...
what was it?

250
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:55,134
You want Vicodin? Right?

251
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,353
- Yeah.
- I got you. I got you.

252
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,268
Want anything else?
I got banger ketamine.

253
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:02,837
I got really good
fucking Molly. I got some...

254
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:06,232
- I don'’t know what this is.
- No, dude, just the
Vicodin for my back.

255
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,061
Oh, right, your back.

256
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,934
Ouch. That sucks.
I hate that.

257
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,719
Okay, well, you chill,
and I'’ll be right back.

258
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:18,940
You chill and I'’ll be
right back, okay?

259
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,898
I'’ll be right back. Mmm.

260
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:23,205
- Oh, my God.
- You smell good.

261
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:26,469
I missed you!
Skye fuckin'’ Riley, dude!

262
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:29,559
Vicodin. Vicodin.
What the fuck are you thinking?

263
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,300
<i>...could still have</i>

264
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,084

265
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,608
What the fuck?

266
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:37,132
Ah, shit.

267
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:46,097
<i>Here'’s how we see
everything coming together.</i>

268
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:49,492
<i>The cold air stays in place.</i>

269
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:53,496
<i>...north of the area...</i>
<i>Freddy. It'’s some snow.</i>

270
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,456
<i>I mean, this is not a huge
storm. It'’s not, you know,</i>

271
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,981
<i>an ultra-dangerous situation
out there. It'’s our first
snow of the season.</i>

00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:04,290
<i>Over in pop culture
news, singer/songwriter
Skye Riley is back,</i>

273
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:07,510

she was hospitalized
in a car crash</i>

274

actor Paul Hudson.</i>

275
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:12,776

277

283
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:44,025
Hey, uh, Lewis, I kind
of have a really early
morning tomorrow, so...

284
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,340
Lewis!

285
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,388
This fucking guy.

286
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,001
Lewis, what the fuck, man?

287
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:17,841
Lewis!

288
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,020
Swear to God, if you'’re
fucking with me, dude...

289
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,645
- Jesus!
- Skye!

290
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,211
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Lewis?

291
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,517
Where the fuck
did you come from?

292
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:42,866
What?

293
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:48,089
- Oh! No! No! No!
- What? What is it?

294
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:51,614
Get the fuck away from me!
- Get the fuck away from me!
- What the fuck is happening?

295
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,008
No! No!

296
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,277
Oh, shit.

297
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:04,627
Lewis? Lewis? Fuck!

298
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:07,630
What do I do, Lewis, do I call
an ambulance? Fuck. Shit.

299
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:10,459
Lewis, Lewis! Lewis?
What the fuck?

300
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:12,592
Lewis?

301
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,289
Fuck. Shit!

302
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,726
Shit.
You fuckin'’ OD'’ing, man?

303
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,033
Shit! Fuck!

304
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,472
Lewis?

305
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:22,286
Okay.

306
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,640
Oh, fuck.

307
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:30,381
Oh, shit.

308
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,340
Oh, fuck.

309
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:38,781
Oh, my God.

310
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,205
What do you think, Skye?

311
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,555
Skye?

312
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,775
Hey! Are you paying attention?

313
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:12,603
What?

314
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:13,735
Yeah.

315
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,563
This stuff is important.

316
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:19,349
- I'’m listening.
- Are you okay?

317
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,656
-  You look exhausted.
- Wow, thanks, Mom.

318
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,179
It'’s really important for you

319
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,920
to stay on top of
your sleep schedule.

320
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,227
- Joshua, grab her a water.
- I'’m fine.

321
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,620
I want you to have
someone around to help
out with things again.

322
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,840
Have you talked to Gemma
about coming on tour?

323
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:33,842
Gemma is not gonna want
to hear from me, Mom.

324
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:36,192
- Have you reached out?
- No, not exactly.

325
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:38,542
She'’s your best friend. I'’m
sure she'’d be willing to forgive

326
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,371
whatever it was that happened
between the two of you.

327
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:45,375
You'’re a completely different
- person than you were a year ago.
- Can you please leave it alone?

328
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,031
All I'’m saying is real friends
are hard to come by.

329
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:51,512
And it was really good for you
when Gemma was around.

330
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:54,297
I'’d be more than happy to help
out with any personal stuff

331
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:56,647
Skye might need.
Do you want--

332
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:58,954
- I don'’t want that.
- You need to stay hydrated.

333
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,390
Will you just stop?

334
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:02,392
Okay.

335
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,395
No, sorry, not you.

336
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:08,050
[Skye'’s mom] Come in!

337
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,575
Hi, Darius!

338
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,230
Just wanted to say hi
to my favorite rock star.

339
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,363
I'’d get up and hug you
but I'’m trapped.

340
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:18,017
- All good. I'’ll come to you.
- Look at you.

341
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:19,279
- Hey, Elizabeth.
- Hi.

342
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,586
- Hey, Darius.
- Hey, man.

343
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,066
Starting to get
exciting around here.

344
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,460
Oh, my God. I am so excited.

345
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,376
I have a little favor
- to ask of you.
- Sure.

346
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,683
Tomorrow night,
there'’s a fundraising dinner
for Music Inspires Hope.

347
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,947
It'’s a foundation
for underprivileged youth.

348
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,601
Interscope Records has done a
- lot of work with the foundation.
- Wow.

349
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,387
I know this is last-minute,
but I was hoping you'’d
be willing

350
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:43,564
- to be a special presenter.
- Oh!

351
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:46,262
I know you'’ve got
a lot on your plate, but
there'’s no arrival carpet,

352
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,656
no press. None of that
annoying stuff.

353
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,614
It'’s purely about the kids.[mouthing] Yes.

354
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,313
Your remarks will be prewritten.
All you have to do is smile

355
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:54,793
and read from the teleprompter.

356
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,884
How could I say no?

357
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,537
Number three.

358
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,061
Let'’s start with a 70.

359
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,542
All right, Skye.

360
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:10,286
Loving this.

361
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,681
Can you give me more?

362
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,250
Even more.

363
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:21,471
More.

364
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,095
"Hey..."

365
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:15,123
What the fuck?

366
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:16,733
Fuck this guy, man.

367
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:19,084
Come on.

368
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:20,520
Get your shit together.

369
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:22,478
Get your shit together.

370
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,572
Jesus!

371
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:31,400
Can you knock?

372
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:33,533
We were knocking.
You weren'’t answering.

373
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:36,275
Why were you screaming?

374
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:39,800
- I-- I saw a spider.
- Sorry, there'’s
a spider in here?

375
00:33:39,974 --> 00:33:44,413
Tanya says there'’s some
wardrobe issue that you
needed me to look at.

376
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:47,373
Yeah, I'’m not wearing this one.

377
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,505
I love it. What--
What'’s wrong with it?

378
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,072
Can you show her, please?

379
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,600
The lighting'’s gonna show
- right through this onstage.
- And?

380
00:33:57,774 --> 00:34:00,038
I'’m not trying to show everyone
how fucking disgusting I am.

381
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,780
I think you'’re overreacting
a little bit.

382
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:06,653
Yeah, Skye, you know what?
I think your scar is badass.

383
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,350
-  It is badass.
- Seriously.

384
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:10,222
This is honestly
one of your best looks.

385
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:12,398
I'’m not wearing it.

386
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,809
- There you go.
- Thank you, thank you!

387
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:18,072
All right,
let'’s grab that photo, yeah?

388
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:22,555
Can we do matching poses?

389
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,034
Of course.
What are you thinking?

390
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,124
Um, like...

391
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:28,691
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

392
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,867
Twinsies. Super cute.

393
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,218
Thank you.
Thanks for coming out.

394
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,523
- Thank you.
- Who'’s next?

395
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,439
"Too Much For One Heart"
got me through

396
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,659
literally the worst breakup
of my life.

397
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,096
I feel like
you'’re my spirit animal and...

398
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,619
Oh, my gosh,
can I give you a hug?

399
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:45,926
Oh, my gosh, yes! Aw.

400
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:49,277
Skye, you got to check out
my SoundCloud.

401
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:52,019
Oh.[chuckles] Like,
who does your production?

402
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,977
All right, dawg,
let'’s grab that photo now.

403
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,545
-  Nice.
- Oh, can we do one
more vertical?

404
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,679
<i>♪ Doctor, I need a new brain ♪</i>

405
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,246
Oh, my God, that'’s...

406
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,464
That was amazing.

407
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,210
Could you sign,
"For Alfredo..."

408
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,473

409
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,694
"...love...

Skye."

411
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:19,394
Yeah.

412
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,229
There you go.

413
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,492
All right.
Let'’s take that photo.

414
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,105
I'’m a really big fan.

415
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,107
Oh, thanks for coming out.

416
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,807
I can see you'’re sad
on the inside.

417
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,724
- Sorry, what?
- I could make you happy.

418
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,596
- We would be so happy together.
- Okay, I think we got it.

419
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,164
And you'’re so beautiful.

420
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:53,820
You have the most
amazing... skin!

421
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,778
- Dude, get the fuck off me!
- Amazing skin!

422
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:57,519
Skye, I love you!

423
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,956
I love you, Skye! Skye!

424
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,221
Skye, I love you!

425
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:09,096
Hey, folks, just give us,
like... one quick sec.

426
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,278
You okay?

427
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,457
You need to take a break?

428
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:28,289
You sure?[sighs] Let'’s just
get through this.

429
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,343
Hey, Skye.

430
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:40,606
- Everything gravy?
- Yeah, fine.

431
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:43,435
All right, who'’s next?

432
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:57,100
Hi. What'’s your name?

433
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,107
That'’s-- That'’s a pretty
cool shirt you got.

434
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,761
You want me to sign it?

435
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:24,693
Okay.
How about a photo?

436
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,568
Yeah. So sweet.

437
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,570
All right, one, two...

438
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,311
Cheese.

439
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,487
[chuckles] All right.

440
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:37,053
Now that'’s a good one.

441
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:41,335
<i>It'’s Gemma. Leave it.</i>

442
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:43,946
Hi!

443
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,905
Hi, it'’s me. Um...

444
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,995
I was just thinking
about you and, uh...

445
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,866
how much...

446
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,393
how much I want to apologize
about everything.

447
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:02,791
Anyway, I don'’t know if
you want to talk to me. Um...

448
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,577
Will you call me? Please?

449
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:07,970
I miss you.

450
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,279
Shit.

451
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,463
Hey![Gemma] <i>Hey.</i>

452
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,774
How have you been?

453
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,166
<i>Pretty good, I guess.</i>

454
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,255
<i>Surprised to hear from you.</i>

455
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,868
I know. Sorry I just
called out of the blue.

456
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:38,087
<i>No, it'’s okay.</i>

457
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,437
<i>It'’s cool.</i>

458
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,657
Actually, um...

459
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,922
I kind of feel...

460
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:48,620
...really, uh,
overwhelmed at the moment.

461
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,752
I know it'’s not...

462
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:53,451
I know it'’s not your problem
and it'’s probably really...

463
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:57,716
shitty of me to even
be calling you. But, uh...

464
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,719
I don'’t really have anyone
I can talk to right now.

466
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,160

467
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:10,642

busy or something.

Jesus, fuck!

What is happening right now?

00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:01,906
What the fuck?

485
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,908
Right. So...

486
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:05,300
I'’m confused.

487
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,869
Oh. Hi to you, too.

488
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:11,263
How did you get
- here so fast?
- Wait.

489
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:13,918
Why? What do you mean?
You called me like an hour ago.

490
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:18,531
An hour?

491
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,846
How you doing, Skye?

492
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,329
I, um...

493
00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:37,724
...didn'’t sleep
last night, and I...

494
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:41,206
think I had some sort of crazy
lucid-nightmare-fever-dream,

495
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,295
and it scared the...

496
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:45,384
...scared the crap out of me.

497
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:50,476
Um... thirsty?

498
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,789
This therapist from my recovery
program she suggested that...

499
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:03,402
anytime I feel overwhelmed by
the urge to use or get drunk

500
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:05,230
that I should stop
whatever I'’m doing

501
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:07,362
and drink
a full glass of water.

502
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,408
It'’s supposed to be some
sort of form of acknowledgement

503
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:11,497
for what I can
and can'’t control.

504
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,587
Well, it'’s good to see you.

505
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:19,897
Jesus, Gemma.

506
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,076
I'’m so sorry.

507
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,340
I was a ginormous
fucking asshole.

508
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:33,693
- I owe you such a huge apology.
- You really do.

509
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:36,522
I don'’t know why it'’s taken you
like a year to tell me that.

510
00:48:36,696 --> 00:48:39,829
I know. I'’m sorry. I...
I did want to call sooner.

511
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,440
I just didn'’t know
if you would...

512
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:43,268
forgive me
or if you hated me

513
00:48:43,442 --> 00:48:44,617
and never wanted
to hear from me again.

514
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,445
Okay, apology accepted.

515
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,057
Oh, God.

516
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:53,582
Fucking love you.
You know that, right?

517
00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:56,411
- Okay.
- Seriously.
You'’re my ride or die.

518
00:48:56,585 --> 00:48:58,848
Okay! Before we start
sucking each other'’s dicks,

519
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:00,676
what'’s going on?
Why are you being so weird?

520
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,114
I don'’t know.

521
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:09,642
I don'’t know.

522
00:49:13,646 --> 00:49:15,126
I'’m such a mess.

523
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:24,526
Just how messy
are we talking?

524
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,488
Something really bad happened.

525
00:49:37,496 --> 00:49:39,672
You remember Lewis Fregoli?

526
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:41,282
Lewis Fregoli from high school?

527
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,676
He died in front of me
yesterday.

528
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,026
- What?
- I went to his apartment
to buy Vicodin.

529
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,420
- Skye, what the fuck?
- Just for pain, I swear.

530
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:50,683
Gemma, I haven'’t
touched alcohol

531
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,250
or coke in a year,
I promise.

532
00:49:52,424 --> 00:49:53,816
But my back
is still fucked.

533
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,862
Since I have a history
of substance abuse,

534
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,951
no one will prescribe me
anything stronger than Tylenol.

535
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,214
You think that maybe
there'’s a reason for that?

536
00:50:00,388 --> 00:50:02,434
Well, I don'’t know
what else to do.

537
00:50:03,826 --> 00:50:06,046
Everyone'’s counting on me.

538
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,570
Okay, just wait.
All right. Go back.

539
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:09,615
What happened to Lewis?

540
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:11,225
When I showed up,

541
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,445
there was something off
about him.

542
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,708
Like he was scared
of something.

543
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:19,059
He started... freaking out

544
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,757
and screaming,
like screaming screaming.

545
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:23,368
And then he...

546
00:50:25,283 --> 00:50:28,547
grabbed this metal gym weight
from like a bench press...

547
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,290
and then he like...

548
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:35,684
just smashed
his whole face in with it.

549
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:38,035
What?

550
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,602
- Ew. Oh, my God. What?
- I didn'’t know what to do.

551
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:43,692
I just freaked
and ran out, and...

552
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:47,609
- Gemma, I just left him there.
- Does anyone else know
about this?

553
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:51,570
- No. Should I tell the police?
- No! Skye, no, listen to me.

554
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:53,746
If anyone connects you
to a drug dealer'’s death,

555
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,792
the story will take over your
life and fuck up everything.

556
00:50:56,966 --> 00:51:01,188
- And it'’s not your fault.
- I keep seeing
his face everywhere.

557
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:03,843
- I just feel so fucked up!
- Yeah, no wonder.

558
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:05,975
I can'’t imagine how scary
that must have been.

559
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,891
Oh, God, I'’m sorry.

560
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,763
I'’m so sorry I'’m laying
all of this on you.

561
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,112
I just...

562
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:18,031
I don'’t know, I just don'’t
really have anyone to talk to.

563
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:23,776
You want me to spend the night?

564
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:27,780
Really? Would you?

565
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,782
I mean, I'’m already here.

566
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:34,874
Oh, God,
I missed you, bitch.

567
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:17,281
Help me!

568
00:53:17,455 --> 00:53:20,197
Please someone help!

569
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:00,106
Hey, are you okay?

570
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:01,673
Yeah.

571
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:25,087
Gemma, I'’m so sorry
about everything.

572
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:30,049
I know, it'’s okay.
I already forgave you.

573
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:41,060
I don'’t know why
I destroy everything.

574
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:49,634
I feel like my brain is...

575
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,030
this really fucked-up place,

576
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:57,772
full of all this

577
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,645
chaos and noise.

578
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:02,560
And I'’m trapped there

579
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:06,128
all alone...

580
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:08,261
...in this darkness.

581
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:10,698
And I just want
to quiet the noise,

582
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,396
but I don'’t know how.

583
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,184
It'’s because
you'’re a horrible person.

584
00:55:23,842 --> 00:55:25,322
What did you say?

585
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:32,764
Gemma?

586
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:51,696
Gemma?

587
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,456
Oh, hey, you'’re up!

588
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:17,504
What the fuck is happening?

589
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:20,072
What do you mean?
I made matcha.

590
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:22,727
Matcha? What?

591
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,775
Wait, it'’s-- it'’s morning?
What time is it?

592
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:31,083
Fuck! Fuck, I'’m so late!
Why didn'’t you wake me?

593
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:33,825
I'’m sorry, I didn'’t know.
I don'’t have your schedule.

594
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:37,176
My mom is gonna
fucking kill me! Aw, shit.

595
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:46,968
- Can I help you or something?
- Will you come on tour?

596
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:50,015
- What?
- Come to rehearsal with me today.

597
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:52,670
Today? I can'’t. I have
a friend'’s thing later on.

598
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:56,064
What? What-- What friend?
Do you have to go?

599
00:56:56,238 --> 00:56:57,892
Well, yeah,
I made a commitment.

600
00:56:58,066 --> 00:57:01,200
Fuck. Well, then
can you start tomorrow?

601
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:03,768
I mean, I don'’t know. I sort of
feel like this is like a thing

602
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:06,118
we should have a conversation
about first.

603
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:11,993
- Are you kidding me?
- I'’m sorry, I'’m sorry.

604
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,952
There are a hundred people
waiting for just you.

605
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:15,910
I know! I know!

606
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,785
Hey, Elizabeth.

607
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:25,790
Look, talent'’s here.

608
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:27,444
Okay, talent'’s pulling in.

609
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,278
-  Thought we said 8:30.
- I'’m so sorry. It'’s my fault.

610
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,150
But I'’m ready.
I'’m ready, let'’s do this.

611
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:41,153
Sorry, everyone.
I'’m here. I'’m so sorry.

612
00:57:42,154 --> 00:57:43,590
Sorry.

613
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,172
I need some water
for my daughter.

614
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:02,740
For my daughter,
I need some water.

615
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:04,350
I need a waiter
with some water.

616
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:05,786
I need a waiter
with some water.

Fuck!

Oh, God.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

644
01:00:32,846 --> 01:00:33,934
Are you okay?

645
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:35,675
My leg!

646
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:38,330
- What happened? What'’s wrong?
- My--

647
01:00:45,467 --> 01:00:47,208
Who was that?

648
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:49,297
One of you was out of place
and knocked me over!

649
01:00:49,471 --> 01:00:51,430
Who was it?

650
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:53,432
Skye, I don'’t think
that'’s what happened.

651
01:00:53,606 --> 01:00:56,217
Do not tell me
what I just experienced, Anton!

652
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:58,567
I'’m not.

653
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:01,701
I'’m just saying
that from where I was watching,

654
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,224
I didn'’t see anyone
out of place.

655
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,238
Skye!

656
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,399
- What happened?
- Where is Joshua?

657
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:33,488
Christ, what did you do?

658
01:02:33,662 --> 01:02:35,926
Hey. Everything okay?
Can I get you anything?

659
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,536
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

660
01:02:39,407 --> 01:02:42,062
- Sorry, what?
- Are you fucking with me?

661
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:45,022
I have no idea what you'’re
- talking about, I swear.
- He trashed my dressing room!

662
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:48,547
- What? Wha-- No, I didn'’t!
- I fucking saw you, Joshua!

663
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:51,289
Skye! I... Skye.
I would never,

664
01:02:51,463 --> 01:02:53,639
ever do something
like that to you, okay?

665
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,859
Like, come on.
What reason would I have?

666
01:02:58,035 --> 01:02:59,993
- Fuck you. Fuck you!
- Okay.

667
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:02,387
Fuck you! Fuck you, Joshua!

668
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:04,084
- Fuck you!
- All right. That'’s enough.

669
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:06,086
Mom, you need to believe me.
He did this!

670
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,523
- He fucking did this!
- You need to cool off.

671
01:03:08,697 --> 01:03:10,438
You'’re not actually
taking his side?

672
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:12,614
I am on your side,
okay? Always.

673
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,443
But Joshua has been
with me the entire day.

674
01:03:15,617 --> 01:03:18,533
What? What are you
even talking about?

675
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:21,101
I don'’t even care what happened
in here, we'’ll get it fixed.

676
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:23,843
I just need you to...
...tell me the truth.

677
01:03:24,017 --> 01:03:25,889
I'’m gonna ask you something...

678
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:27,673
...and I want you
to be honest with me.

679
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:30,719
Skye? Are you using again?

680
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:32,069
What?

681
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:33,548
Nobody has to know.

682
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:35,899
You just have to
tell me the truth.

683
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:39,119
Oh, my God, no!
I am not using again, Mom.

684
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:41,469
You want me
to take a drug test?

685
01:03:42,296 --> 01:03:43,602
Okay.

686
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:45,822
I believe you. Um...

687
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:49,651
What'’s going on?

688
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,089
I don'’t know! I don'’t know!
I just--

689
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:57,659
Fuck, I feel crazy all the time.
Everything'’s going wrong.

690
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:01,925
Nobody will fucking listen
to me and everyone fucking
hates me.

691
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:04,623
Oh, come on, do you hear
yourself? Everybody loves you.

692
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:08,105
We'’re all here for you. We'’re
here because we believe in you.

693
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,498
We believe in this tour.

694
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:13,240
I think doing this tour
was a huge mistake. It'’s--

695
01:04:13,414 --> 01:04:16,678
It'’s too much.
- I'’m not-- I'’m not ready for it.
- Okay, you know what?

696
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,594
We'’re gonna, um, look at the
book tonight. Look at the dates,

697
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:22,032
carve out some time for you
to decompress before opening.

698
01:04:22,206 --> 01:04:24,382
But right now
you need to pull it together

699
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,558
and get back out there.

700
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:29,126
Because we need to be on time
for Darius'’s foundation event.

701
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,737
Fuck, no. Mom, please
don'’t make me do that.

702
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,479
I can'’t get out on stage
in front of a bunch
of people tonight.

703
01:04:34,653 --> 01:04:36,394
- Skye.
- Mom, you'’re not--

704
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:38,744
Fuck, you'’re not
listening to me!

705
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:40,659
I am not in the headspace

706
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,791
to put on a fucking dress
and play dancing monkey

707
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:46,186
in front of a room
- full of strangers!
- Darius is counting on you

708
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,101
to be there, okay?

709
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:49,929
You gave him your word.

710
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:52,845
You are a woman
who keeps her word.

711
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:55,326
You are not gonna cancel
on a commitment

712
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,197
to underprivileged youth

713
01:04:57,371 --> 01:05:00,113
right before launching a tour.

714
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:25,704
<i>Music Inspires Hope
was founded on the idea</i>

715
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:27,967
<i>that no dream could be too big.</i>

716
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:32,885
<i>With the help and support
of everyone in this room</i>

717
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:35,714
<i>and from all of our donors
across the country,</i>

718
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:37,803
<i>the foundation has been able</i>

719
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:41,589
<i>to reach more families
this year than ever before.</i>

720
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:44,375
<i>Thanks to you,</i>

721
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:47,117
<i>more and more children

722
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:51,556

723
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:54,733
<i>And now without further ado,</i>

724
01:05:54,907 --> 01:05:57,257
<i>it is my great pleasure</i>

725
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:59,303
<i>to introduce...</i> Ten seconds.

726
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:02,915
<i>...a wonderful young artist.
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

727
01:06:03,089 --> 01:06:05,178
<i>please put your
hands together...</i> I'’ll take that.

728
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:08,225
<i>...for Skye Riley.</i>

729
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:18,931
Wow.

730
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:20,541
Thank you.

731
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:23,631
Thank you so much.

732
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:30,725
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

733
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:32,771
I'’m Skye Riley,

734
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,294
and I'’m here tonight to...

735
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:36,601
Uh...

736
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:44,000
I'’m here tonight to...

737
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:45,784
Uh...

738
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,960
Oh, that'’s, uh...

739
01:06:56,055 --> 01:06:58,405
So, how'’s everyone
doing tonight?

740
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,842
Hope you'’re all
enjoying the party.

741
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,628
Uh. Don'’t worry, though.
I'’m sober.

742
01:07:03,802 --> 01:07:05,064
So...

743
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:10,765
Um...

744
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,251
What can I say about
how music inspires hope?

745
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:19,818
Well,

746
01:07:19,992 --> 01:07:22,212
music gave me
everything I ever wanted.

747
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:28,218
Then again, music did almost
kill me, so there'’s that.

748
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:31,090
Uh... Well, I--
I guess that'’s not fair.

749
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:33,049
Music didn'’t put
all those drugs up my nose,

750
01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:34,137
I did.

751
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,577
Um...

752
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:45,061
I-- I think
I'’m supposed to be up here

753
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:50,457
offering words of inspiration
and advice.

754
01:07:50,631 --> 01:07:53,069
Well, when I think about
what I wish someone would have

755
01:07:53,243 --> 01:07:56,550
told me when I was younger
and first getting started,

756
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:59,249
I suppose I'’d say

757
01:08:00,337 --> 01:08:02,991
this business is really hard.

758
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:07,779
And, uh, you'’ll spend years
of your life chasing success

759
01:08:07,953 --> 01:08:10,434
you know, thinking that
when it comes,

760
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:14,438
it will magically fix,
you know, everything

761
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:18,181
that'’s bad and wrong about you.

762
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:21,009
And then you achieve success,
and you realize that
it can'’t fix

763
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:23,751
the deeply broken person
that you have always been.

764
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:26,885
And now you can'’t escape

765
01:08:27,059 --> 01:08:29,844
the miserable thing
that you'’ve become,

766
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:31,411
and one day, you realize

767
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:33,021
how badly you wish you could

768
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:34,719
just trade it all just for

769
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:36,068
one fucking moment of happiness!

770
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:48,385
Oh.

771
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:49,908
Sorry about that. Uh...

772
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,481
What I meant to say is:

773
01:08:57,655 --> 01:09:01,137
I hope the next generation
of young artists

774
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,488
finds themselves
truly inspired tonight.

775
01:09:04,662 --> 01:09:07,012
I know I sure am.

776
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:12,365
And without any further ado,

777
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:14,759
I'’d like to introduce
our next guest,

778
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:16,674
a very special person

779
01:09:16,848 --> 01:09:19,285
who surely needs
no introduction:

780
01:09:20,112 --> 01:09:21,069
Paul Hudson.

781
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:24,943
What?

782
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:28,164
Why does it say that?
That'’s not--

783
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:30,818
This-- No. Why did s--

784
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:33,952
This-- Why did--

785
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,434
What?

786
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:46,443
No.

787
01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:49,750
No.

788
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:54,755
No.

789
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:56,148
No, stay away from me.

790
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:58,281
Stay away from me!

791
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,848
Paul'’s dead!

792
01:10:01,022 --> 01:10:02,633
You'’re not Paul!

793
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:05,201
Stop smiling at me!

794
01:10:08,595 --> 01:10:09,553
No, no.

795
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,862
I can hold it. No, no, stop.

796
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:28,822
Okay.

797
01:13:39,676 --> 01:13:43,723
<i>Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

798
01:14:12,883 --> 01:14:14,232
<i>Do you see it?</i>

799
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:24,938
<i>It just stares at me,</i>

800
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:26,810
<i>smiling.</i>

801
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,249
Skye!

802
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:13,394
Thank you for agreeing to see--
Wait, what are you doing?

803
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,746
Sending a photo of you to my
friend in case you'’re some
kind of creep.

804
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,443
What? I'’m not a creep.

805
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,576
Yeah, that'’s what
every creep says.

806
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:26,233
Look, I realize
you'’re super famous,

807
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:29,280
and I invaded your
privacy. I apologize.

808
01:16:29,454 --> 01:16:31,195
This is also
very weird for me.

809
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,762
- How do you know Lewis?
- I don'’t.

810
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:35,199
I-- I didn'’t.

811
01:16:35,373 --> 01:16:37,375
I was trying to
contact Lewis to warn him.

812
01:16:37,549 --> 01:16:39,507
Tracked down his address
and went to his apartment.

813
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:41,858
The front door was unlocked,
and he was already dead inside.

814
01:16:42,032 --> 01:16:44,556
I checked his phone,
and you were the last
person he texted with.

815
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:47,733
W-What were you trying
to warn him about?

816
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:51,345
I'’m aware that what
I'’m about to say is going
to sound completely insane,

817
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:53,783
but Lewis didn'’t kill himself.

818
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:58,309
He was systematically infected,
possessed and then murdered

819
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:01,007
by some kind
of metaphysical being.

820
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:03,314
What the fuck
are you talking about?

821
01:17:03,488 --> 01:17:08,145
If it helps, you might call it
a-- a spirit or a demon.

822
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:11,061
Maybe. I have no clue
what this thing is!

823
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:13,193
But it disguises itself

824
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:16,936
to look like people.
Like smiling people.

825
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:19,896
But only the person that'’s
been infected by it can see it.

826
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:22,986
No, that'’s--
that'’s not real. That'’s
some supernatural bullshit.

827
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,466
But you'’ve seen it,
haven'’t you?

828
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,555
That'’s why you'’re still
sitting here.

829
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:33,649
I--

830
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,520
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know what'’s happening.

831
01:17:35,694 --> 01:17:37,870
I feel like I'’m losing
my goddamn mind!

832
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:40,090
That'’s precisely
what this thing does to you.
It'’s what it did to Lewis

833
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:42,483
while it was latched onto him.
It'’s like a parasite

834
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,442
that infects the host
through their mind.

835
01:17:44,616 --> 01:17:47,227
In less than a week,
it drives the host insane.

836
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:49,926
It'’s like it feeds off
all the bad shit in their head,

837
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,319
and then
once it'’s done feeding,

838
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:55,192
it forces the host to kill
themself in front of a witness.

839
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:57,716
And then that witness
becomes the new host.

840
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:59,370
That'’s how you got it
from Lewis.

841
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:02,112
It was passed to Lewis
by a cop in Jersey.

842
01:18:02,286 --> 01:18:03,722
That cop was the first one
I tried to contact,

843
01:18:03,896 --> 01:18:05,724
but I guess he went
off the grid.

844
01:18:05,898 --> 01:18:07,465
That cop caught it
from some doctor, who got it

845
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,075
from a patient, who got it
from a college professor.

846
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:10,903
And the chain
keeps going back.

847
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:12,862
I'’ve documented all of this.
I can show you.

848
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:14,298
Why do you even know
all of this?

849
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:16,692
Because it killed my brother.

850
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,825
My brother was a host

851
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:23,002
eight people before you.

852
01:18:23,176 --> 01:18:25,178
He tried to tell me
what was happening to him.

853
01:18:25,352 --> 01:18:27,050
But he made it hard
to trust him,

854
01:18:27,224 --> 01:18:28,399
and the stuff he was saying

855
01:18:29,313 --> 01:18:32,316
sounded certifiably crazy.

856
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:36,407
He begged me for help.
But I didn'’t listen.

857
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:38,801
And then a few days later...

858
01:18:38,975 --> 01:18:40,541
...I got a call informing me

859
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,935
that he tore his own jaw off
with a crowbar.

860
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:51,422
Well, have you gone
to the police?[chuckling] And say what?

861
01:18:51,596 --> 01:18:53,729
My brother'’s suicide
was actually caused

862
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:57,123
by some cosmic evil being
that no one else can see?

863
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:59,169
The police can'’t
stop this thing anyway.

864
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:01,127
So I'’m just supposed to wait
until this thing kills me?

865
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:02,520
No, I want you

866
01:19:02,694 --> 01:19:05,001
- to help me destroy it.
- How?

867
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:08,395
From what I can tell,
the chain stops

868
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:12,051
when an infected host dies
in some other way

869
01:19:12,225 --> 01:19:14,184
outside of the being'’s control.

870
01:19:14,358 --> 01:19:17,317
My guess is that,
just like other parasites,

871
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:18,623
without a living host

872
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:20,364
it has no way to survive.

873
01:19:20,538 --> 01:19:22,888
It ceases to exist.

874
01:19:23,062 --> 01:19:24,629
So it only stops if--

875
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:26,283
if I die before it kills me?

876
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,154
Exactly. We need
to kill you first.

877
01:19:28,328 --> 01:19:29,852
What?

878
01:19:30,026 --> 01:19:32,768
Only technically. Look.

879
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:36,336
There are ways that we can
very safely stop your heart.

880
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,035
That'’ll deprive it
of a living host.

881
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:40,906
Once it goes,

882
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,952
I can resuscitate your heart
and bring you back.

883
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:44,867
Are you
out of your fucking mind?

884
01:19:45,041 --> 01:19:46,346
I know it seems extreme.

885
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,957
"Extreme"?
You'’re asking to kill me!

886
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:50,089
Whoa, hey. Just keep it down.

887
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:52,178
I don'’t even know you.
I don'’t even know you!

888
01:19:52,352 --> 01:19:54,354
My name is Morris.
I'’m an ER nurse,

889
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,530
and if we don'’t do this,
it'’s gonna kill you

890
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:58,750
like it killed Lewis
and infect another victim.

891
01:19:58,924 --> 01:20:00,883
Look, I'’ve already got
everything prepared.

892
01:20:01,057 --> 01:20:03,102
We should just go now and
get rid of this thing tonight.

893
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:08,499
- I can'’t. I can'’t do this.
- You'’re nearly out of time!

894
01:20:08,673 --> 01:20:11,110
This thing has been feeding
on you for three days already!

895
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:13,939
It'’s already taking control
of your brain, and pretty soon

896
01:20:14,113 --> 01:20:16,333
you won'’t even realize
the ways it'’s manipulating you,

897
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:19,510
and then it'’ll be too late
to stop it. We have to go
right now.

898
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:22,165
Is that Skye Riley?
Holy shit. Dude.

899
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:24,645
That'’s Skye?[onlooker 2] It'’s Skye Riley!

900
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,779
Would you do a quick
- TikTok with us?
- Skye Riley!

901
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:31,261
I watched that video
where you knocked down that
old lady like fifty times!

902
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:33,045
That shit was so fucking funny.

903
01:20:35,743 --> 01:20:37,049
Skye!

904
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:39,399
Skye, can I get your autograph?

905
01:22:10,838 --> 01:22:12,014
Fuck!

906
01:22:14,016 --> 01:22:15,191
Fuck!

907
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:27,116
Fuck!

908
01:22:35,472 --> 01:22:37,474
Fuck!

909
01:25:55,237 --> 01:25:56,847
No! No!

910
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:59,154
Don'’t! No!

911
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:07,423
No! No! No!

912
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:08,989
No!

913
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,302
Get off!

914
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:26,589
What?

915
01:27:26,763 --> 01:27:27,938
What?

916
01:27:28,112 --> 01:27:29,244
-  What?
- What?

917
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:32,682
Oh, Jesus Christ.

918
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,555
Are you crying right now?

919
01:27:36,729 --> 01:27:39,166
I'’m-- I'’m not crying. [sniffs]

920
01:27:39,341 --> 01:27:40,994
Are you crying?

921
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,303
Hmm? Huh?

922
01:27:45,477 --> 01:27:48,611
Hey! Hey, I'’m fucking
talking to you!

923
01:27:53,746 --> 01:27:55,052
Are you fucking kidding me?

924
01:27:55,226 --> 01:27:56,445
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

925
01:27:56,619 --> 01:27:57,881
What the fuck is wrong with me?

926
01:27:58,055 --> 01:27:59,709
What the fuck
is wrong with you, huh?

927
01:27:59,883 --> 01:28:01,580
I don'’t know! I don'’t know!

928
01:28:01,754 --> 01:28:03,234
I don'’t know, Paul.
Why don'’t you tell me,

929
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:05,062
since I can'’t
do anything right?

930
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:07,630
Jesus Christ! I swear--

931
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:10,197
I swear to fucking God,
you are so--

932
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:11,938
What? What? What?

933
01:28:12,112 --> 01:28:15,072
I'’m so fucking what?
Say it. What am I?

934
01:28:15,246 --> 01:28:17,727
Tell me, I am so fucking...

935
01:28:18,728 --> 01:28:20,643
You'’re fucking psycho!

936
01:28:20,817 --> 01:28:22,427
- Oh, yay!
- Yeah!

937
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:25,082
- Psycho!
- It'’s out of the bag!

938
01:28:25,256 --> 01:28:26,997
You'’re fucking crazy!

939
01:28:27,171 --> 01:28:28,781
I'’ll show you crazy!

940
01:28:28,955 --> 01:28:30,957
- You want to fucking see crazy?
- Stop it! Stop it!

941
01:28:31,131 --> 01:28:32,916
- What are you doing?
- Is that crazy enough for you?

942
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:35,614
- Is that fucked up? Huh?
- Stop it!

943
01:28:35,788 --> 01:28:37,573
- Is that crazy enough for you?
- Yes, that is crazy,

944
01:28:37,747 --> 01:28:39,923
you fucking psycho!

945
01:28:40,097 --> 01:28:43,230
Jesus fucking Christ!
I'’m fucking driving.

946
01:28:43,405 --> 01:28:47,104
-  Fucking hate you!
- Good! Good!

947
01:28:47,278 --> 01:28:50,803
'’Cause I fucking hate you, too.
I fucking--

948
01:28:52,065 --> 01:28:53,589
You crazy bitch.

949
01:28:56,766 --> 01:28:59,595
Ah, you psycho bitch!

950
01:29:01,814 --> 01:29:04,469
Oh, you'’re gonna cry.

951
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:07,994
Are you gonna cry now?
Is that your thing? "Oh, God!"

952
01:29:08,168 --> 01:29:12,042
Oh, you look so fucking ugly
when you cry. It'’s horrible.

953
01:29:12,216 --> 01:29:15,350
I can'’t-- Ew, I can'’t--

954
01:29:17,264 --> 01:29:21,007
"Oh, help me, God!"

955
01:29:24,707 --> 01:29:26,883
What the fuck are you doing?

956
01:29:27,057 --> 01:29:28,493
What are you doing?

957
01:29:28,667 --> 01:29:32,758
[Paul] Jesus! Oh, my God!

958
01:29:36,893 --> 01:29:40,375
It'’s okay, it'’s okay.
Everything'’s fine. Hey, hey.

959
01:29:41,637 --> 01:29:42,638
You'’re okay.

960
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:45,858
You have a mild concussion.

961
01:29:53,605 --> 01:29:55,302
Where am I? Where am I?

962
01:29:55,477 --> 01:29:58,218
Harvest Moon.
It'’s a private wellness clinic.

963
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,569
You fainted and hit your head.

964
01:30:00,743 --> 01:30:04,050
We found you lying
on your living room floor,

965
01:30:04,224 --> 01:30:05,704
unconscious.

966
01:30:05,878 --> 01:30:07,619
The doctor said
you were sleep deprived

967
01:30:07,793 --> 01:30:09,752
and extremely dehydrated.

968
01:30:09,926 --> 01:30:12,189
No, no, no, that'’s not--

969
01:30:12,363 --> 01:30:13,843
That'’s not--
That'’s not what happened.

970
01:30:14,017 --> 01:30:15,932
Joshua, could you go
find Dr. Fowler

971
01:30:16,106 --> 01:30:18,500
- and let him know Skye'’s awake?
- Of course, yeah.

972
01:30:18,674 --> 01:30:21,241
I hope you'’re
feeling better, Skye.

973
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:25,420
I, uh... I brought a sweatshirt
for you, just in case you...

974
01:30:26,638 --> 01:30:27,987
...you get cold.

975
01:30:43,394 --> 01:30:46,005
We can cover that with makeup.

976
01:30:46,179 --> 01:30:49,139
And the team'’s already working
on a fill piece for your hair.

977
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,538
Don'’t worry, you won'’t be able
to tell the difference.

978
01:30:57,843 --> 01:30:59,976
And I'’ve cleared your schedule.

979
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:02,326
So today you can
just have a whole day

980
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,589
of rest and recuperation.

981
01:31:04,763 --> 01:31:07,505
Where'’s my phone?

982
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:08,854
- I need my phone.
- It'’s right here.

983
01:31:09,028 --> 01:31:10,508
I got it.

984
01:31:10,682 --> 01:31:13,163
- I need it. Give it to me.
- Maybe later.

985
01:31:13,337 --> 01:31:16,732
Right now, we'’re just
gonna focus on relaxing.

986
01:31:16,906 --> 01:31:20,344
Mom.
Please, please.

987
01:31:20,518 --> 01:31:22,215
Something really crazy
is happening to me.

988
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:23,869
I need to get out of here
right now.

989
01:31:24,043 --> 01:31:27,525
No. We are gonna
stay here together

990
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:30,615
until we head to the venue
tomorrow for the preshow.

991
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:32,878
That way we can make sure
you'’re a hundred percent

992
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:34,793
and ready to perform.

993
01:31:34,967 --> 01:31:36,491
No, no. I can'’t. I--

994
01:31:36,665 --> 01:31:38,014
Can'’t what?

995
01:31:41,844 --> 01:31:43,323
I can'’t do the show.

996
01:31:45,282 --> 01:31:49,634
If you... cancel the show,
then you will be

997
01:31:49,808 --> 01:31:52,985
checking yourself into
a recovery program.

998
01:31:53,159 --> 01:31:55,727
That'’s the only
explanation... Mom--

999
01:31:55,901 --> 01:31:58,121
...as to why Skye Riley
is canceling another tour

1000
01:31:58,295 --> 01:31:59,470
the night before it starts.

1001
01:31:59,644 --> 01:32:01,472
You will have to explain
to the label

1002
01:32:01,646 --> 01:32:03,605
who'’ve invested
millions of dollars.

1003
01:32:03,779 --> 01:32:06,172
And you'’re putting the workers--Mom, you don'’t understand!

1004
01:32:06,346 --> 01:32:09,306
No! You don'’t
understand, Skye.

1005
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,743
There are
no more second chances.

1006
01:32:11,917 --> 01:32:15,007
If you cancel, this is it.

1007
01:32:15,181 --> 01:32:17,967
The media will rake you
over the coals.

1008
01:32:18,141 --> 01:32:20,230
We'’ll be sued
by the label for millions.

1009
01:32:20,404 --> 01:32:23,973
It will be the end
of everything we'’ve built.

1010
01:32:25,322 --> 01:32:26,976
Oh, my God, Mom.

1011
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:29,544
Why is that
all you care about, Mom?

1012
01:32:29,718 --> 01:32:32,938
You treat me like
I'’m some fucking windup toy.

1013
01:32:33,112 --> 01:32:34,505
You don'’t give a shit about me!

1014
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:36,768
How dare you
talk to me like that?

1015
01:32:36,942 --> 01:32:38,248
You arrogant little asshole!

1016
01:32:38,422 --> 01:32:40,642
I have given up
everything for you!

1017
01:32:40,816 --> 01:32:42,513
Every second of my time.

1018
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:44,297
Years of my life.

1019
01:32:45,255 --> 01:32:47,997
My career.
And here I am,

1020
01:32:48,171 --> 01:32:53,002
sacrificing every fiber
of my being to support you.

1021
01:32:53,176 --> 01:32:56,005
But you'’re too selfish
to even see it.

1022
01:32:56,179 --> 01:32:59,835
You put everyone
through absolute hell,

1023
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:02,620
and still we support you.

1024
01:33:02,794 --> 01:33:05,667
But you want to go
and throw it away? Fine!

1025
01:33:05,841 --> 01:33:08,408
Do it! Throw it away!
I don'’t care!

1026
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,976
That'’s what everyone expects
of you anyway.

1027
01:33:13,762 --> 01:33:16,416
I wish you could feel
what it'’s like

1028
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:18,723
having to live inside my head.

1029
01:33:23,032 --> 01:33:24,990
I'’ve tasted
what'’s inside your head!

1030
01:33:25,164 --> 01:33:26,905
No, no, please, no!

1031
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:29,038
Please, no.

1032
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:30,256
No.

1033
01:33:34,173 --> 01:33:36,654
No, no, no! Please!

1034
01:33:36,828 --> 01:33:38,221
No!

1035
01:33:42,051 --> 01:33:43,879
Oh, no, no!

1036
01:33:56,456 --> 01:33:59,938
Look what you'’re doing
to your poor mother.

1037
01:34:02,419 --> 01:34:03,550
No, God!

1038
01:35:24,283 --> 01:35:26,285
Oh, God, that'’s not real.

1039
01:35:26,459 --> 01:35:29,114
It'’s not real. It'’s not real.

1040
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:30,637
It'’s not real.

1041
01:35:31,334 --> 01:35:32,596
No, no.

1042
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:34,076
No!

1043
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:39,211
It'’s not real, it'’s not real,
it'’s not real.

1044
01:35:49,265 --> 01:35:50,745
Oh...

1045
01:35:52,224 --> 01:35:53,225
Oh!

1046
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,593
It'’s Joshua!

1047
01:36:17,293 --> 01:36:19,338
I need a second!

1048
01:36:19,512 --> 01:36:22,080
I'’m changing.[Joshua] Oh! Sorry! Uh...

1049
01:36:22,254 --> 01:36:24,213
You know what?
I'’ll wait out here.

1050
01:36:24,387 --> 01:36:26,084
Also, the doctor said
he'’s gonna come and see you

1051
01:36:26,258 --> 01:36:27,172
in a few minutes.

1052
01:36:27,346 --> 01:36:29,435
Actually, I...

1053
01:36:29,609 --> 01:36:32,699
I... I feel kind of thirsty.
I need a--

1054
01:36:32,874 --> 01:36:34,789
Do you think you could go
find me something to drink?

1055
01:36:34,963 --> 01:36:37,139
Oh. Uh, I brought
some bottles of water.

1056
01:36:37,313 --> 01:36:39,445
Put them
in the little refrigerator.

1057
01:36:39,619 --> 01:36:41,926
I feel like soda. Could you
get me a soda, please?

1058
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,798
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

1059
01:36:45,364 --> 01:36:46,757
What kind?

1060
01:36:46,931 --> 01:36:49,455
Any kind, just... surprise me.

1061
01:36:49,629 --> 01:36:51,980
You got it. You know what?
I'’ll be right back

1062
01:36:52,154 --> 01:36:54,896
with one, uh...
surprising soda.

1063
01:37:23,185 --> 01:37:24,969
Fuck.

1064
01:37:25,143 --> 01:37:28,843
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, fuck!

1065
01:37:34,022 --> 01:37:37,025
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

1066
01:37:46,338 --> 01:37:47,687
Shit.

1067
01:39:24,436 --> 01:39:25,524
Skye?

1068
01:39:27,526 --> 01:39:28,701
Are you--

1069
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:31,182
Oh, my God! Is that...

1070
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:33,358
blood?

1071
01:39:37,841 --> 01:39:38,885
No.

1072
01:39:40,713 --> 01:39:43,586
Hey, uh...
We need a doctor over here!

1073
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,892
-  Shut the fuck up!
- Yeah, could we please

1074
01:39:46,067 --> 01:39:47,677
get some help, somebody?

1075
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:50,506
- Just shut the fuck up!
- Are you hurt?

1076
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,073
Somebody please help!
We need a doctor.

1077
01:39:52,247 --> 01:39:53,813
Oh, my God, Skye.

1078
01:39:54,901 --> 01:39:56,816
Hey... you, you, you!

1079
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,166
Please help me!

1080
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:00,168
Whoa, whoa, easy!
I got you.

1081
01:40:00,342 --> 01:40:01,473
Get away from me!

1082
01:40:05,608 --> 01:40:08,567
Hey... just take it easy.

1083
01:40:08,741 --> 01:40:11,657
I said get the fuck
away from me!

1084
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,705
I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry.

1085
01:40:15,879 --> 01:40:17,011
Skye?

1086
01:40:17,924 --> 01:40:20,014
Skye? What are you doing?

1087
01:40:20,188 --> 01:40:22,233
Think about the tour.

1088
01:40:23,887 --> 01:40:26,237
Fuck the tour!

1089
01:40:34,637 --> 01:40:35,986
Is that Skye Riley?

1090
01:40:47,084 --> 01:40:49,565
Fuck! Fuck!

1091
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:53,395
Fuck! Oh, God.

1092
01:40:53,569 --> 01:40:54,700
Skye?

1093
01:40:54,874 --> 01:40:56,789
What are you doing out here?

1094
01:40:56,963 --> 01:40:58,313
Gemma, what are you doing here?

1095
01:40:58,487 --> 01:41:00,402
Your mom called me.
Are you bleeding?

1096
01:41:00,576 --> 01:41:03,318
- Is your car here?
- No, your mom'’s driver
drove me, why?

1097
01:41:03,492 --> 01:41:06,669
- Where is he?
- He just dropped me off
over there. What'’s going on?

1098
01:41:06,843 --> 01:41:08,540
Skye!
Skye Riley. That'’s her!

1099
01:41:08,714 --> 01:41:09,976
What happened?

1100
01:41:11,674 --> 01:41:13,067
Hey, that'’s Skye Riley!

1101
01:41:13,241 --> 01:41:15,199
Totally off her rocker.

1102
01:41:15,373 --> 01:41:16,853
Hey, get out! I need your car!

1103
01:41:17,027 --> 01:41:18,811
Ms. Riley, what--

1104
01:41:18,985 --> 01:41:22,641
Get the fuck out of the car![bystander 3] She'’s got a gun!

1105
01:41:22,815 --> 01:41:25,340
What the fuck are you doing?

1106
01:41:25,514 --> 01:41:28,821
Gemma, I love you,
but if I don'’t leave right
now, I'’m gonna fucking die!

1107
01:41:28,995 --> 01:41:32,347
Fuck it!
- I'’m coming with you. Move over.
- No, Gemma, no!

1108
01:41:32,521 --> 01:41:35,828
You don'’t know how to drive.
- Move over!
- Fuck!

1109
01:41:44,794 --> 01:41:47,536
[bystanders] Whoa!

1110
01:42:02,246 --> 01:42:04,161
Dude, where are we going?

1111
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,598
What am I doing?
Where am I going?

1112
01:42:09,035 --> 01:42:11,125
- Where am I going? Skye!
- I don'’t know yet.

1113
01:42:11,299 --> 01:42:13,170
- Just keep driving.
- No, I need you to explain

1114
01:42:13,344 --> 01:42:16,130
what the hell is going on.

1115
01:42:18,654 --> 01:42:20,612
I need to get to Staten Island.

1116
01:42:20,786 --> 01:42:22,658
What? Gross. Why?
Oh, shit.

1117
01:42:24,312 --> 01:42:25,487
Fuck!

1118
01:42:26,357 --> 01:42:27,358
Fuck!

1119
01:42:30,231 --> 01:42:33,103
Jesus Christ!
You need to go to a hospital!

1120
01:42:33,277 --> 01:42:36,367
No! I need to go
- to Staten Island.
- What the fuck is going on?

1121
01:42:36,541 --> 01:42:37,629
Why are we going
to Staten Island?

1122
01:42:46,072 --> 01:42:48,684
Skye.

1123
01:42:48,858 --> 01:42:51,165
- Gemma, pull over, please.
- What? You just told me
to go to Staten Island!

1124
01:42:51,339 --> 01:42:53,689
Gemma, just fucking
pull over, please!

1125
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:59,085
All I'’ve ever done
is make your life hell.

1126
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:01,871
I don'’t deserve you.
So please, just pull over

1127
01:43:02,045 --> 01:43:05,004
and get away from me so
I don'’t fuck up your life, too.

1128
01:43:09,052 --> 01:43:11,228
No, fuck that noise.

1129
01:43:13,665 --> 01:43:15,537
Ride or die, bitch!

1130
01:43:23,153 --> 01:43:24,981
I need to...

1131
01:43:25,155 --> 01:43:26,504
I need to tell you something.

1132
01:43:26,678 --> 01:43:28,854
What?

1133
01:43:32,902 --> 01:43:33,946
Skye?

1134
01:43:52,487 --> 01:43:55,577
Hello?[Gemma] <i>Hey, it'’s me.
I got your voicemail.</i>

1135
01:43:55,751 --> 01:43:57,448
<i>Sorry it'’s taken me a few days
to get back to you.</i>

1136
01:43:57,622 --> 01:43:59,711
<i>But, honestly,
I wasn'’t even sure</i>

1137
01:43:59,885 --> 01:44:01,322
<i>if I was gonna call you back.</i>

1138
01:44:02,627 --> 01:44:05,543
Did you spend the night
at my place?

1139
01:44:05,717 --> 01:44:08,894
<i>What? I haven'’t been
to your place in like a year.</i>

1140
01:44:09,068 --> 01:44:11,462
<i>Since you said I was
a "stupid opportunistic cunt,"</i>

1141
01:44:11,636 --> 01:44:13,856
<i>remember?</i>

1142
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:16,380
<i>Also, what'’s up with these
weird-ass fuckin'’ text messages</i>

1143
01:44:16,554 --> 01:44:18,252
<i>you'’ve been sending me?</i>

1144
01:44:20,341 --> 01:44:22,299
<i>Hello?</i>

1145
01:44:22,473 --> 01:44:24,519
Gemma hates you, Skye.

1146
01:44:24,693 --> 01:44:26,521
No, please. Please, Gemma, no.

1147
01:44:26,695 --> 01:44:29,698
Please, Gemma, no.
Not you, please.

1148
01:44:30,786 --> 01:44:32,353
No, no!

1149
01:44:32,527 --> 01:44:34,093
No! No! No!

1150
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:35,399
Fuck you!

1151
01:44:35,965 --> 01:44:37,967
Fuck you!

1152
01:44:38,141 --> 01:44:40,099
Fuck you, fuck you!

1153
01:44:41,057 --> 01:44:42,319
Let me the fuck out!

1154
01:44:42,493 --> 01:44:45,191
- Let me go!
- No one cares about you.

1155
01:44:45,366 --> 01:44:48,107
This is not real.
You'’re not driving,
you'’re not driving.

1156
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:50,545
You'’re not driving,
this isn'’t happening.

1157
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:52,460
You'’re in my head,
you'’re in my head.

1158
01:44:52,634 --> 01:44:54,026
You'’re in my head!
You'’re in my head!

1159
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,159
You'’re in my head!

1160
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:57,856
You'’re in my head!

1161
01:44:58,030 --> 01:45:01,251
You'’re not in control. I am!

1162
01:45:03,601 --> 01:45:07,213
You'’re not in control. I am.

1163
01:45:09,085 --> 01:45:12,741
I'’m in control,
I'’m in control, I'’m in control.

1164
01:45:14,046 --> 01:45:18,790
I'’m in control, I'’m in control,
I'’m in control.

1165
01:45:39,637 --> 01:45:40,769
I'’m in control.

1166
01:45:46,078 --> 01:45:48,951
Fuck you!
Learn to fucking drive!

1167
01:46:07,752 --> 01:46:10,320
Jesus Christ!

1168
01:46:13,802 --> 01:46:15,804
Christ, are you okay?
Where are your shoes?

1169
01:46:15,978 --> 01:46:17,936
I don'’t have any.
- Here, take this.
- Why do you have a gun?

1170
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:19,851
Just take it! Hey!

1171
01:46:20,025 --> 01:46:21,505
If this theory of yours
doesn'’t work

1172
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:24,639
or you see me change
and start smiling,

1173
01:46:24,813 --> 01:46:27,381
- shoot me in the head.
- Whoa, whoa, hold on!

1174
01:46:27,555 --> 01:46:29,383
Hey! You need to stop it,
no matter what.

1175
01:46:29,557 --> 01:46:30,688
We'’re going to.

1176
01:46:30,862 --> 01:46:32,342
- Promise me!
- All right!

1177
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:36,346
All right, I promise
I'’ll shoot you.

1178
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:41,220
How do we stop my heart?

1179
01:46:47,313 --> 01:46:49,359
Sorry I haven'’t
done anything about the lights.

1180
01:46:52,362 --> 01:46:56,671
- Is this a Pizza Hut?
- It'’s the only thing I could find
for lease on short notice

1181
01:46:56,845 --> 01:47:00,718
- that had a large enough freezer.
- Why do we need a freezer?

1182
01:47:00,892 --> 01:47:02,416
For your brain.

1183
01:47:04,461 --> 01:47:05,549
Fuck.

1184
01:47:11,294 --> 01:47:14,732
Once we stop your heart,
your brain stops
receiving oxygen.

1185
01:47:14,906 --> 01:47:17,126
Normally,
necrosis sets in immediately.

1186
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:19,781
You'’d have two minutes maybe
before permanent brain damage,

1187
01:47:19,955 --> 01:47:23,306
but if we bring your body
temperature down far enough,
we can delay the process,

1188
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,395
giving us up to nine minutes
before permanent damage.

1189
01:47:25,569 --> 01:47:29,791
We need to make sure this thing
isn'’t able to hang around.
And...

1190
01:47:29,965 --> 01:47:33,142
...I like our odds
with nine minutes better
than two.

1191
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:52,291
The freezer door latch
is broken.

1192
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:54,903
If it closes all the way,
it can'’t be opened
from the inside.

1193
01:47:59,429 --> 01:48:01,300
Here. Change into this.

1194
01:48:06,392 --> 01:48:08,090
Jesus, that'’s a lot of blood!

1195
01:48:08,264 --> 01:48:09,918
Are-- Are the cops
gonna be looking for you?

1196
01:48:10,092 --> 01:48:12,398
I don'’t know.
Let'’s just do this.

1197
01:48:16,054 --> 01:48:18,230
Once your body temperature
drops low enough,

1198
01:48:18,404 --> 01:48:20,972
I will inject you with a drug
that will cause your heart

1199
01:48:21,146 --> 01:48:24,019
to start slowing down
until it stops.

1200
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:26,456
How long will it take?

1201
01:48:29,154 --> 01:48:32,506
It'’s critical you reach
flatline as fast as possible.

1202
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:35,900
So I'’ll need to inject it
directly into your
internal jugular.

1203
01:48:36,074 --> 01:48:38,816
After 30 seconds...
you'’ll be dead.

1204
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:41,515
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Jugular, like in my neck?

1205
01:48:44,474 --> 01:48:45,693
Let me see the needle.

1206
01:48:49,784 --> 01:48:51,133
What the fuck, man?

1207
01:48:51,307 --> 01:48:53,265
I know. Sorry.

1208
01:48:54,353 --> 01:48:55,441
Lie down here.

1209
01:49:18,203 --> 01:49:20,118
Oh, my God,
I'’m so fucking cold.

1210
01:49:20,292 --> 01:49:23,295
That'’s the idea. I'’ll be
monitoring your heart rate.

1211
01:49:23,469 --> 01:49:26,951
The moment you flatline, I'’ll
start a timer for eight minutes.

1212
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:28,910
Once the timer'’s up,

1213
01:49:29,084 --> 01:49:32,435
I will inject a dose of
adrenaline into your heart

1214
01:49:32,609 --> 01:49:36,308
and start CPR resuscitation.

1215
01:49:36,482 --> 01:49:38,920
I can'’t believe I might die
in the freezer of a fucking
Pizza Hut.

1216
01:49:39,094 --> 01:49:41,139
I promise
I'’m gonna bring you back.

1217
01:49:45,187 --> 01:49:46,580
Morris?

1218
01:49:46,754 --> 01:49:49,060
I'’m sorry about your brother.

1219
01:49:49,234 --> 01:49:50,496
I know that'’s why
you'’re doing this.

1220
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:52,977
Thank you for helping me.

1221
01:49:53,151 --> 01:49:56,590
Can I ask what made you
change your mind?

1222
01:49:58,809 --> 01:50:02,421
Every good thing in my life...

1223
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,989
ends up broken because of me.

1224
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:11,082
I hurt everything
and everyone I touch.

1225
01:50:14,433 --> 01:50:17,001
It doesn'’t matter
what happens to me anymore.

1226
01:50:19,525 --> 01:50:22,616
But I will not
let this fucking thing...

1227
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:26,532
use me to hurt anyone else.

1228
01:50:33,714 --> 01:50:35,367
Put this in your mouth.

1229
01:50:38,196 --> 01:50:39,545
Don'’t move.

1230
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:41,460
I just have to get something.

1231
01:50:43,462 --> 01:50:45,551
Wait. Where--
Where are you going?

1232
01:50:45,726 --> 01:50:47,075
Shit.

1233
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:51,209
Wait.

1234
01:50:51,949 --> 01:50:52,950
Wait.

1235
01:50:58,521 --> 01:51:00,131
Morris?

1236
01:51:20,499 --> 01:51:21,587
Hey!

1237
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:24,678
Don'’t leave me alone here!

1238
01:51:25,374 --> 01:51:26,418
Please.

1239
01:51:28,246 --> 01:51:29,421
Mor-- Morris?

1240
01:52:09,113 --> 01:52:11,768
No!

1241
01:52:21,212 --> 01:52:23,345
No! No!

1242
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:47,630
I'’ve been waiting for you
for such a long time.

1243
01:52:48,544 --> 01:52:49,893
Mor--

1244
01:52:50,067 --> 01:52:51,939
Morris! Morris, it'’s in here!

1245
01:52:52,113 --> 01:52:55,594
Morris can'’t help you anymore.

1246
01:52:57,771 --> 01:52:59,120
It'’s just you and me.

1247
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:03,689
I like wearing your skin.

1248
01:53:13,003 --> 01:53:16,659
You can'’t get away
from me, Skye.

1249
01:53:32,936 --> 01:53:34,720
You'’ll never
escape who you truly are

1250
01:53:34,895 --> 01:53:36,766
on the inside.

1251
01:53:45,427 --> 01:53:47,211
Look at me!

1252
01:54:35,738 --> 01:54:37,914
Fuck... you!

1253
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:41,004
Skye!

1254
01:54:44,225 --> 01:54:46,967
Skye!

1255
01:54:49,273 --> 01:54:52,450
Skye!

1256
01:54:54,017 --> 01:54:55,976
Skye!

1257
01:54:56,498 --> 01:54:58,674
Skye! Skye!

1258
01:55:17,084 --> 01:55:20,957
This isn'’t real, Skye.

1259
01:55:37,495 --> 01:55:38,583
No! No!

1260
01:55:38,757 --> 01:55:40,368
No.

1261
01:55:47,984 --> 01:55:49,507
No. No!

1262
01:55:50,291 --> 01:55:51,553
Please, no!

1263
01:55:51,727 --> 01:55:54,338
You'’re not in control, Skye.

1264
01:55:54,512 --> 01:55:55,557
No!

1265
01:55:59,474 --> 01:56:00,605
I am.

1266
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:15,925
Break a leg out there.

1267
01:56:37,468 --> 01:56:39,122
No. No.

1268
01:57:21,077 --> 01:57:22,818
Skye, I love you!

1269
01:57:23,384 --> 01:57:24,646
Skye!

1270
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:28,345
Whoo! Skye!

1271
01:57:28,519 --> 01:57:30,043
Skye, you'’re the best!

1272
01:57:30,695 --> 01:57:32,045
Skye!

1273
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:33,829
I love you, Skye!

1274
01:57:34,003 --> 01:57:35,483
Skye, you look beautiful!

1275
01:57:39,313 --> 01:57:41,097
I love you, Skye!

1276
01:57:41,271 --> 01:57:43,534
All right, Skye!

1277
01:57:43,708 --> 01:57:45,101
Skye![fan 2] Skye!

1278
01:57:45,275 --> 01:57:46,189
Whoo!

1279
01:57:48,844 --> 01:57:50,063
Yeah![fan 2] Skye!

1280
01:57:50,237 --> 01:57:51,629
Whoo!

1281
01:57:52,978 --> 01:57:54,110
I love you, Skye!

1282
01:57:54,284 --> 01:57:55,677
Smile.

1283
01:58:38,589 --> 01:58:39,808
No.

1284
01:58:42,506 --> 01:58:45,030
No!

1285
01:58:48,904 --> 01:58:54,475
No!

1286
01:59:34,863 --> 01:59:35,951
Somebody help her!

1287
01:59:37,996 --> 01:59:39,998
[fan 7] My God. Do something!

1288
01:59:41,043 --> 01:59:42,653
I love you!

1289
01:59:42,827 --> 01:59:44,089
Get up, Skye!

1290
01:59:45,352 --> 01:59:47,441
Yeah! There you go, Skye!

1291
01:59:47,615 --> 01:59:50,357
Whoo! We love you, Skye!

1292
01:59:50,531 --> 01:59:53,055
All right, Skye!

1293
01:59:53,229 --> 01:59:55,013
[fan 7] Skye, we love you!

1294
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:56,798
Yeah, Skye! You got this!

1295
01:59:57,625 --> 01:59:59,757
Whoo! Yeah, Skye!
