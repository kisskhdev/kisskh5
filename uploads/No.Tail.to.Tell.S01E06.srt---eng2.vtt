WEBVTT

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.066
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:47.194
{\an8}Sis, I found a way!

00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:49.237
{\an8}It's going to take some time,

00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:52.157
{\an8}but I found a way for you to turn back

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.909
{\an8}into a nine-tailed fox.

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:56.870
{\an8}Okay, let's talk about it later.

00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:01.291
{\an8}That means he can
go back to his life too, right?

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:04.461
{\an8}Wait a second.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.507
{\an8}What are you guys talking about?

00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:14.096
{\an8}Woo-seok, the thing is--

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.181
{\an8}Turning back into a nine-tailed fox?

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:19.601
{\an8}Then that means…

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:29.486
You weren't actually doing this for me.
You just couldn't go back?

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.029
Well…

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:34.032
- Let me explain--
- That's right.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.618
It's exactly as you heard.

00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:38.495
So what? What's it to you?

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:41.039
- Hey!
- Nothing's going to change anyway.

00:01:41.123 --> 00:01:42.999
Me, Si-yeol, and you.

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:45.627
We're all going back
to the way things were.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:47.713
It'll just take a little more time.

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:50.924
Really?

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:55.470
How much longer?

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:04.771
So you're saying you're human now,
just like the rest of us?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.816
And you're looking for a way back, right?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.322
So you found a way? How?

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:18.160
Now that useless human's involved,
this all just got a lot more complicated.

00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:22.998
So there's a chance we can't switch back
if that method doesn't work?

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:26.209
Well, that is a possibility.

00:02:26.293 --> 00:02:28.003
Why the hell do you care?

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:29.755
This matters to me as well.

00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:33.467
Why?
Are you afraid I might get in the way?

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:36.344
You tell me.

00:02:36.428 --> 00:02:38.430
I think you're fully capable of that.

00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:41.892
So tell me.
Are you going to get in the way?

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.773
Stop it, both of you.

00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:49.024
Why are you acting like this?

00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:52.652
You heard what he said, didn't you?

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:56.823
Don't tell me you're still clinging
to the idea of human friendships.

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.076
- You're just being too harsh.
- Si-yeol.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.038
I need to know what's going on.
Otherwise I can't relax.

00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:06.041
And there might be something
I can do to help.

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:08.835
You shouldn't just hide everything
from me like this.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.754
I understand what you're saying.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.256
Still, it would be best
if you left for now.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.759
- Later, if I need--
- Erase it.

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:18.053
Pardon?

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:19.554
Erase that human's memory.

00:03:19.638 --> 00:03:22.682
But my spiritual power isn't that strong--

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:25.811
I know. Just do it.

00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:26.895
Okay.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.272
No, wait--

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.079
What the…

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.082
I was just waiting for Si-yeol.

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.251
Why am I here?

00:03:53.463 --> 00:03:55.173
DAD

00:03:56.383 --> 00:03:57.425
Hi, Dad.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.594
Why are you just picking up now?

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:01.972
I can't really remember right now--

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.516
Have you been drinking
at a time like this?

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.684
No, it's not that--

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.311
Do you know what kind of mess you caused?

00:04:08.395 --> 00:04:10.397
You went to Korea
without the club's permission.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.148
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:16.236
It's the preseason right now.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.363
I've got the international call-up
next week anyway.

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:20.156
I just came to Korea a few days early.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.783
What's the big deal?

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:25.036
You've still got training,
even in preseason!

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.538
You just transferred,

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.624
and you've already upset the coach
and the club owner.

00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:31.835
You're being unprofessional!

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:33.587
Do you think I'm doing this for myself?

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.046
What?

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.299
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.052
Let's keep it like this…

00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:43.555
for now.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.932
Thank you, Si-yeol.

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:50.145
Wait, what was that memory just now?

00:04:52.856 --> 00:04:54.524
Did I actually meet Si-yeol?

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.318
By the way,

00:04:56.943 --> 00:04:58.278
where is the house?

00:04:59.487 --> 00:05:00.989
It's right here.

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.784
Isn't this a public restroom?

00:05:04.868 --> 00:05:07.037
There are lots of these in the mountains.

00:05:10.457 --> 00:05:13.543
This isn't a restroom.
It's what we call a rooftop apartment.

00:05:15.462 --> 00:05:19.633
It might not look like it,
but people actually live here.

00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:21.176
It's a home.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.596
Was it really necessary to go that far?

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:26.222
What?

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:30.352
I don't think we had to go so far
as to erase Woo-seok's memory.

00:05:30.936 --> 00:05:33.563
We could've just explained it
and sent him on his way.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.358
You still don't seem
to grasp the situation.

00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:38.735
If you'd talked to him nicely
and sent him on his way,

00:05:38.818 --> 00:05:41.154
do you think
you'd ever sleep soundly again?

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:42.656
What do you mean?

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:45.033
Well, let me give you an example.

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:49.412
If you just dropped dead tonight,

00:05:49.496 --> 00:05:51.206
who do you think would benefit?

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:52.290
What?

00:05:52.374 --> 00:05:54.542
No more worrying about
when he'd have to switch back

00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:58.046
or about ending up back
in this shabby rooftop place.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.257
Everything he has now
would be his forever.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:05.136
How long do you think
it'll take him to realize that?

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:06.763
A day or two?

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:10.850
Jeez, why is your example so morbid?

00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:14.145
What, are you saying Woo-seok
will try to kill me or something?

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.356
Come on, that's nonsense.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:17.524
Don't you remember?

00:06:17.607 --> 00:06:19.901
What did your friend do
when I gave him the chance

00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:21.736
to switch your lives back?

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.488
I mean, that was then.

00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:26.199
This is a different situation.

00:06:26.282 --> 00:06:28.827
Besides, Woo-seok's not that kind of guy.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.954
Get real. Humans are all the same.

00:06:31.037 --> 00:06:33.665
You think there's
a special "kind" that's any different?

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.335
Anyway, erasing his memory
is just a temporary fix.

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.089
An eight-tailed fox doesn't have the power
to fully wipe a human's memory.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.926
Whether it takes a few days
or a few months,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.096
your friend's memory will eventually
come back, bit by bit.

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:50.265
Oh, really?

00:06:50.348 --> 00:06:53.059
So we need to get back to how things were

00:06:53.143 --> 00:06:55.812
before your friend remembers
and gets any funny ideas.

00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:59.691
Now that the nuisance is taken care of,

00:06:59.774 --> 00:07:02.318
why don't you finish what you were saying?

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:03.611
You found a way?

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:05.697
Right, yes.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.823
All we need is

00:07:07.782 --> 00:07:10.618
for you and me to switch fates.

00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:12.787
Like you did with him.

00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:22.505
What?

00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:39.022
What's with her?

00:07:47.447 --> 00:07:50.241
EPISODE 6
THE FALSE KINDNESS

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:05.256
Come in.

00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:11.221
PERSONAL PROFILE
KANG SI-YEOL

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:12.889
So who is this guy?

00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:14.015
Nobody special.

00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:17.352
He went through rehab for about a year
after the accident,

00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:19.687
and his soccer career
went downhill after that.

00:08:20.313 --> 00:08:23.066
He was recently cut
from a fourth division team too.

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:24.526
So what does he do now?

00:08:25.527 --> 00:08:27.153
He doesn't seem to have a job.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.281
So, does he come from a rich family?

00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:31.741
Not at all.

00:08:32.242 --> 00:08:35.954
He has no parents
and no inheritance either.

00:08:37.831 --> 00:08:39.165
That can't be right.

00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:43.753
He's a client of that money-grubbing fox,
and you're telling me he's broke?

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.881
That makes no sense.

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:48.758
Anything else peculiar?

00:08:49.884 --> 00:08:53.012
There's something I found out
during the investigation.

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:55.682
You know the boy
who was a witness to that incident?

00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:57.934
Apparently, he's Hyeon Woo-seok.

00:08:58.601 --> 00:08:59.853
Hyeon Woo-seok?

00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:01.146
While you were away,

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:03.523
this athlete named Hyeon Woo-seok
became a huge star--

00:09:03.606 --> 00:09:06.192
I watched the World Cup in prison too.

00:09:06.276 --> 00:09:07.235
I know who he is.

00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:08.987
Oh, okay.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:13.449
Hyeon Woo-seok.

00:09:16.369 --> 00:09:19.622
Kang Si-yeol is completely broke,

00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:22.167
but Hyeon Woo-seok is his friend?

00:09:27.172 --> 00:09:31.050
I think I should meet this Hyeon Woo-seok.

00:09:45.982 --> 00:09:47.984
I feel a bit better now.

00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:50.528
Usually, I last half a day in human form,

00:09:51.154 --> 00:09:53.364
but erasing his memory
must have drained me.

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:56.284
If you've got your strength back,

00:09:56.367 --> 00:09:58.328
could you finish
what you were saying earlier?

00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:00.330
Earlier? I meant exactly what I said.

00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:05.001
I mean, is switching fates
actually possible for you?

00:10:05.084 --> 00:10:07.754
You tried switching Woo-seok
and me back last night,

00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:09.130
but it didn't work.

00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:13.927
That's because I lack power right now,
but what if I become a nine-tailed fox?

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:17.680
What?

00:10:17.764 --> 00:10:20.433
Then I'll have powers too,

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:22.352
so we can just switch our fates.

00:10:22.435 --> 00:10:24.896
You can become
a nine-tailed fox instead of me,

00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:26.898
and I can become human faster.

00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:28.107
It's good for both of us.

00:10:29.442 --> 00:10:30.902
Then what about me?

00:10:30.985 --> 00:10:33.154
I don't think
there's anything I can do about that.

00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:36.074
But she can probably help you later.

00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:37.575
Wait, why?

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.536
You could just switch me back first
after you become a nine-tailed fox.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.829
It's urgent for me too.

00:10:41.913 --> 00:10:43.373
It doesn't work that way

00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:45.458
because I'm the one who cast that spell.

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:48.002
- But--
- I'm younger than her,

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:50.588
and my spiritual power is much weaker.

00:10:50.672 --> 00:10:54.634
So even if I become a nine-tailed fox,
it'd be hard for me to undo her spell.

00:10:55.843 --> 00:10:58.221
Well, okay then.

00:10:58.304 --> 00:11:02.058
It doesn't matter how we get there
as long as I get my life back.

00:11:02.684 --> 00:11:04.102
Well, the logic holds up.

00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:06.312
So problem solved, right?

00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:11.609
Nothing's solved.

00:11:12.777 --> 00:11:15.363
I was wondering
what you were talking about.

00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:19.325
That doesn't sound like your idea, though.

00:11:20.368 --> 00:11:22.203
Who told you that crap?

00:11:23.288 --> 00:11:24.289
Pardon?

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.208
Well…

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:30.503
I was told not to say anything
because it's a secret.

00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:32.922
You don't have to say it. It's obvious.

00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:35.049
What's obvious?

00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:37.260
Just go. Quit talking nonsense.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.637
- But sis--
- I said, go.

00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:41.556
You're talking nonsense.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:45.143
Why are you chasing her off?

00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:48.021
- Should I really go?
- No.

00:11:48.104 --> 00:11:49.314
Listen to me.

00:11:49.397 --> 00:11:52.942
I'm telling you this
for your own good, so pay attention.

00:11:53.484 --> 00:11:57.155
You are being scammed.

00:11:59.282 --> 00:12:00.199
What?

00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:02.368
Why do you want to become human?

00:12:02.452 --> 00:12:03.786
What do you know about them?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.206
Do you honestly think
that was your own idea and decision?

00:12:08.082 --> 00:12:09.083
Well… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:12:09.834 --> 00:12:11.544
Isn't that just the way it works?

00:12:11.627 --> 00:12:14.255
It's what all the other foxes did.

00:12:14.339 --> 00:12:16.507
And the ones above said
it's the right path.

00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:19.302
Works for me.
If I trick a clueless kid like you,

00:12:19.385 --> 00:12:21.512
I can become a nine-tailed fox again.

00:12:21.596 --> 00:12:22.513
But what about you?

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:25.058
You turn human, totally unprepared.

00:12:25.141 --> 00:12:26.309
Then what?

00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:28.561
When you regret it later,

00:12:28.644 --> 00:12:32.231
you think the ones above
are going to help you?

00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:42.367
What's so bad about living as a human?

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.619
I like it. I'm satisfied.

00:12:44.702 --> 00:12:46.829
You're satisfied? Right now?

00:12:46.913 --> 00:12:49.207
Hey, that's different.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:51.751
I'm only in this mess because of you.

00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:53.711
I was perfectly happy with my old life.

00:12:53.795 --> 00:12:55.213
It's all the same.

00:12:55.296 --> 00:12:57.548
You could've fallen apart
at any time, with or without me.

00:12:57.632 --> 00:12:58.966
Isn't that what human life is?

00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:01.803
You never know
how your life will turn out either.

00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:03.596
Your old age might be miserable.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:04.680
What?

00:13:04.764 --> 00:13:06.349
Did you seriously just say that to me?

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:08.935
Anyway, I'll figure out
how to change back on my own.

00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:11.896
So go live your own life
and mind your own business.

00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:13.648
But…

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:16.359
No, no. You don't get to
decide that for her.

00:13:16.442 --> 00:13:19.195
She just wants to become human
as soon as possible.

00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:20.238
Unlike you.

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:23.157
She didn't make that decision
knowing all the facts.

00:13:24.242 --> 00:13:26.953
You'll be glad you stayed
a nine-tailed fox in the end.

00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:29.997
But like I said, that's not your call.

00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:32.750
How is what you're doing any different
from the ones above?

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:34.585
What?

00:13:34.669 --> 00:13:37.713
You chose your own way of life, right?

00:13:37.797 --> 00:13:40.258
Well, she's got her own path too.

00:13:40.341 --> 00:13:41.300
Right?

00:13:41.384 --> 00:13:43.928
I mean, I guess.

00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:45.972
What do you mean by that?

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:48.933
So you're dead set on becoming human?

00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:51.602
Well…

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.231
The decision's up to you.
Don't worry about anyone else.

00:13:56.149 --> 00:13:58.067
You want to become human, don't you?

00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:00.403
That's right!
You decide since it's your life.

00:14:08.119 --> 00:14:11.706
Now that you're both pressuring me,
I'm not so sure.

00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:18.045
Talking to you is pointless.

00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:22.842
VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT 2

00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:26.220
Let go of me! I'm the victim here!

00:14:26.304 --> 00:14:28.222
You're going to pay for this!

00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:30.224
Get your hands off me!

00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:37.773
I'm scared, sis.

00:14:38.357 --> 00:14:40.026
Don't look away. Watch.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.986
If you become human,

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:44.322
you'll have to live among trash like them.

00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:45.823
What?

00:14:45.907 --> 00:14:47.366
I have to live around them?

00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:49.076
With people like that?

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.872
She won't run
into people like them very often.

00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:54.165
Yes, she will.

00:14:55.374 --> 00:14:59.337
These people can spot
clueless kids like you

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.797
a mile away, you know?

00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:03.299
Just look at her face.

00:15:03.382 --> 00:15:05.134
Doesn't it just scream "easy target"?

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.937
Hey, what are you in for?

00:15:17.313 --> 00:15:19.482
- Mugging.
- You?

00:15:19.565 --> 00:15:21.692
- Online scam.
- You?

00:15:21.776 --> 00:15:23.361
- Assault.
- You?

00:15:23.444 --> 00:15:24.695
Illegal filming on the subway.

00:15:26.072 --> 00:15:28.574
Wow, you must be so proud of yourselves!

00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:29.867
Excuse me.

00:15:30.576 --> 00:15:32.620
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

00:15:32.703 --> 00:15:34.830
Make sure you investigate them thoroughly.

00:15:36.249 --> 00:15:37.500
See that?

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:40.294
The human world will rob you blind
right under your nose.

00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:42.713
Do you really think

00:15:42.797 --> 00:15:46.509
you can survive
dropping into this den of evil?

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.594
Well…

00:15:48.678 --> 00:15:50.012
Hey, hold on.

00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:53.391
You shouldn't pressure her
for an answer in a place like this.

00:15:56.102 --> 00:15:59.897
The human world has its good side too.

00:15:59.981 --> 00:16:02.858
This time, I'll take you somewhere nice.

00:16:09.323 --> 00:16:13.160
Feel free to eat whatever you want here
without worrying about what others think.

00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:15.121
Really?

00:16:15.204 --> 00:16:17.748
In all my 500 years,
I've never seen so much food.

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:22.420
Wait, hold on.

00:16:24.046 --> 00:16:25.006
Like this.

00:16:40.605 --> 00:16:43.274
Slow down.
No one's going to take it from you.

00:16:46.152 --> 00:16:49.322
This is the best food
I've had in half a century.

00:16:49.405 --> 00:16:51.407
That's because you were stuck
in the mountains,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.577
eating nothing but greens.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.413
This is nothing, really.

00:16:59.206 --> 00:17:01.208
Back when I was a nine-tailed fox,

00:17:02.126 --> 00:17:04.837
I ate way better stuff than this.

00:17:05.546 --> 00:17:08.591
There are so many delicious things
in the human world.

00:17:08.674 --> 00:17:11.886
If you become human,
you can eat like this every day.

00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:20.603
You really think so?

00:17:22.938 --> 00:17:26.400
You can't just go in there.

00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:31.697
How much do you think
that meal you ate cost?

00:17:33.783 --> 00:17:35.159
I don't know.

00:17:35.242 --> 00:17:36.702
The human world has classes.

00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:38.162
Here…

00:17:40.373 --> 00:17:41.582
Right.

00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:43.584
That one over there is at the very bottom.

00:17:43.668 --> 00:17:47.421
No matter how many dishes she washes,

00:17:47.505 --> 00:17:49.757
she'll never be able
to afford a meal like you just ate.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.510
Why? Because the pay is garbage.

00:17:53.052 --> 00:17:55.221
Who starts out as a chef from day one?

00:17:55.304 --> 00:17:56.847
Everyone works their way up.

00:17:56.931 --> 00:18:00.685
You think hard work is
all it takes to get to the top?

00:18:00.768 --> 00:18:05.690
There are tons of humans who end up
washing dishes their whole lives.

00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:14.657
You have to leave!

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.617
Just get out, please.

00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:18.202
Unbelievable.

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:19.537
I'm sorry.

00:18:20.538 --> 00:18:22.748
You got us kicked out
before we could really eat.

00:18:22.832 --> 00:18:25.751
- Did I say anything wrong?
- Wrong or not, that's not the point.

00:18:25.835 --> 00:18:27.712
Why on earth are you taking it this far?

00:18:30.297 --> 00:18:33.134
Do you actually have another way
to get back to how it was?

00:18:33.968 --> 00:18:35.136
Well…

00:18:37.304 --> 00:18:38.431
Not right now, but--

00:18:38.514 --> 00:18:42.017
See? You don't have one.
This is the only way.

00:18:42.101 --> 00:18:44.603
So why are you being so difficult?

00:18:46.397 --> 00:18:48.065
I'm not.

00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:52.153
But you're saying I should just stand by
and watch when I know how this turns out?

00:18:52.236 --> 00:18:55.364
It's obvious what'll happen
if that idiot suddenly becomes human.

00:18:55.448 --> 00:18:58.075
Since when did you care so much
about other people?

00:18:58.159 --> 00:18:59.577
What?

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.622
Excuse me.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.918
We went to the police station
because you wanted to,

00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:11.380
and we came to this restaurant
because Si-yeol wanted to.

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:14.925
So?

00:19:15.885 --> 00:19:20.055
So, isn't it my turn to go where I want?

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.185
There's somewhere I've always
wanted to go in the human world.

00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:34.069
Sis!

00:19:34.779 --> 00:19:36.655
She doesn't know the first thing
about the world,

00:19:36.739 --> 00:19:38.824
so where did she even hear
about a place like this?

00:19:38.908 --> 00:19:42.661
She said the stranded kid she saved
kept bragging about it.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.955
Just play along.

00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.961
What's so fun about that anyway?

00:19:51.629 --> 00:19:54.298
Si-yeol, how long do we have to do this?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.517
Now, that's better.

00:20:14.652 --> 00:20:16.278
- Did you have fun?
- Yes!

00:20:18.614 --> 00:20:21.450
But the kids in front of me and behind me

00:20:21.534 --> 00:20:23.452
were all riding with their mom or dad.

00:20:23.536 --> 00:20:24.620
So?

00:20:24.703 --> 00:20:27.373
You want me to act like your mom now?

00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:30.417
No, it's just that I keep riding alone.

00:20:30.501 --> 00:20:33.629
You should be grateful
we even came here with you.

00:20:33.712 --> 00:20:35.047
No!

00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:50.062
Tell them to stop this thing!

00:21:08.372 --> 00:21:09.748
That was so much fun, sis!

00:21:09.832 --> 00:21:11.208
Let's ride it again!

00:21:11.292 --> 00:21:12.626
I can't ride it again.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.753
Why not?

00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:19.800
This is a really popular ride,
so the line takes forever.

00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:22.344
Is that why?

00:21:24.972 --> 00:21:26.307
What's going on?

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.434
This fixes everything, right?
We don't have to wait.

00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:29.894
No, don't!

00:21:29.977 --> 00:21:31.353
Don't do it!

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:34.648
What the…

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:38.402
I'm going to kill that idiot fox!

00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:57.463
Hey, are you okay?

00:21:58.547 --> 00:22:01.342
I'm dizzy, and I feel sick.

00:22:02.134 --> 00:22:03.469
I feel like I'm dying.

00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:06.430
This damn human body.

00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:09.934
I'm so sorry, sis.

00:22:10.643 --> 00:22:12.561
I thought you'd like it too.

00:22:13.604 --> 00:22:14.521
Hey.

00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:17.274
Look at me right now.
Doesn't it make you feel anything?

00:22:17.358 --> 00:22:18.651
Do you still want to be--

00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:21.528
Sis, let's go on that one next!

00:22:25.282 --> 00:22:27.326
Is a tail really
the only thing she's missing?

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:28.577
If you ask me,

00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:31.288
I think she's got you
wrapped around her finger.

00:22:32.247 --> 00:22:33.332
What?

00:22:34.875 --> 00:22:37.586
Just accept it. It's easier that way.

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:40.464
We're coming.

00:23:22.047 --> 00:23:23.298
That hurts.

00:23:23.382 --> 00:23:25.467
It really hurts!

00:23:26.135 --> 00:23:28.262
You of all people
shouldn't be scared of that!

00:23:30.681 --> 00:23:34.268
I wasn't scared. I was just startled.

00:23:35.144 --> 00:23:37.438
Those fake ghosts aren't even scary.

00:23:40.607 --> 00:23:41.608
Unbelievable.

00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:06.759
The Divine Spirit told me
that an ominous guest would arrive today.

00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:12.556
That must be you.

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:18.145
They say you're
the best shaman in Sancheong.

00:24:20.314 --> 00:24:23.317
You've invited quite the ghost in.

00:24:27.571 --> 00:24:32.743
The sorrow of losing one's family
is a pain anyone can sympathize with.

00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:37.790
But you dare defy the will of Heaven
and devour every divine spirit?

00:24:37.873 --> 00:24:39.917
Save your breath.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.463
I have my reasons,
so hand over that ghost behind you.

00:24:49.176 --> 00:24:53.555
I was trying to catch a fox,
but it was just too vicious.

00:24:53.639 --> 00:24:55.516
I'm running low on spiritual energy.

00:24:56.141 --> 00:24:59.061
The karma you carry
is already as deep as the ocean.

00:24:59.144 --> 00:25:01.188
How will you handle all that sin?

00:25:01.939 --> 00:25:06.026
What's a little rain to the ocean?

00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:08.320
So,

00:25:09.988 --> 00:25:11.907
let's not be too difficult about this.

00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:06.461
I never thought I'd say this,

00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:09.173
but even after things go back to normal,

00:26:09.756 --> 00:26:12.509
I'll probably still think about today
from time to time.

00:26:16.096 --> 00:26:17.306
I mean,

00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:20.100
it's my first time at a place like this.

00:26:22.436 --> 00:26:24.563
You've never been to an amusement park?

00:26:25.355 --> 00:26:28.150
Don't humans go to these places
all the time as kids?

00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:30.652
My grandmother was out working,

00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:33.113
so I never got to visit places
like this as a kid.

00:26:33.197 --> 00:26:37.034
And being on the sports team,
I hardly ever got to go on field trips.

00:26:38.785 --> 00:26:42.039
You haven't really done much, have you?

00:26:42.122 --> 00:26:43.332
I've been everywhere.

00:26:43.415 --> 00:26:45.876
Jayeon Nongwon, Bugok Hawaii, you name it.

00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:48.253
You have?

00:26:48.337 --> 00:26:50.172
You were just puking your guts out.

00:26:50.797 --> 00:26:53.050
That's because of this damn human body.

00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:56.845
You get sick from just a few rides

00:26:56.929 --> 00:26:58.972
and have to wait an hour
for a one-minute ride.

00:26:59.056 --> 00:27:01.975
How is this supposed to be fun?

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:03.435
You know,

00:27:03.518 --> 00:27:07.064
you look like
you're having the most fun here.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.945
I only did this

00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:16.740
because you guys made me.

00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:27.417
What's wrong?

00:27:28.377 --> 00:27:30.212
- What?
- Let me see.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.550
Your heel is all scraped up.

00:27:35.634 --> 00:27:38.136
Why didn't you tell me
before it got this bad?

00:27:39.221 --> 00:27:41.932
I thought this was normal
when you walk a lot.

00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:44.434
That's ridiculous.

00:27:45.894 --> 00:27:47.479
Jeez, you're bleeding.

00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:48.897
That must've really hurt.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.029
Wait.

00:27:57.114 --> 00:28:00.284
Are you worried about me right now?

00:28:01.451 --> 00:28:02.369
Why?

00:28:02.869 --> 00:28:05.038
Am I not allowed to worry about you?

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:10.961
I mean,

00:28:11.586 --> 00:28:14.256
it's just unexpected, that's all.

00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:18.260
Technically, what you're suffering through

00:28:19.303 --> 00:28:24.099
is also kind of my fault, in a way.

00:28:24.725 --> 00:28:25.726
So…

00:28:26.226 --> 00:28:28.478
So, is it your fault or not?

00:28:30.188 --> 00:28:31.815
I don't know. Think whatever you want.

00:28:33.191 --> 00:28:34.776
It just so happens that right now,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.988
you're the only person
in the world on my side.

00:28:38.697 --> 00:28:41.908
I don't have any friends or family
I can rely on.

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:45.162
You're all I have.

00:28:45.787 --> 00:28:48.457
So you should worry about me too.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.250
I'll be worrying about you.

00:28:56.006 --> 00:29:00.427
And if anything were to happen to you,
I'd never be able to go back to my life.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.346
So how can I not worry?

00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:06.058
Especially with all the enemies
you've made with your misdeeds.

00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:09.394
What?

00:29:09.936 --> 00:29:12.147
Now that sounds more like you.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.815
Anyway, just wait here.

00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:15.442
I'll go grab a bandage.

00:29:24.743 --> 00:29:25.911
Sis!

00:29:35.879 --> 00:29:37.381
So, what's your wish?

00:29:38.006 --> 00:29:39.049
What?

00:29:39.132 --> 00:29:42.719
We made a bet
about a hundred years ago, remember?

00:29:42.803 --> 00:29:45.472
We said that whoever becomes human first
gets their wish granted.

00:29:45.555 --> 00:29:46.848
Don't tell me you forgot.

00:29:47.474 --> 00:29:49.267
Oh, that?

00:29:50.394 --> 00:29:53.605
Do you want me to dig up
that wild ginseng I hid?

00:29:53.688 --> 00:29:56.358
I hear it sells for a fortune
in the human world.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.027
Or maybe I should visit
the king in his dreams

00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:03.073
to tell him to promote that scholar
you've got a crush on.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.076
The mountain god
will scold you for that.

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:08.453
Only if I get caught.

00:30:08.537 --> 00:30:11.164
You think I'm like you?

00:30:11.248 --> 00:30:12.958
I know how to get around the rules.

00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:16.253
I don't want to wish for things like that.
My wish is…

00:30:21.967 --> 00:30:25.929
for you to do good deeds
and focus on your cultivation.

00:30:27.139 --> 00:30:29.808
What? I do that every single day.

00:30:32.686 --> 00:30:34.187
Not things like that--

00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:37.732
So that you become human quickly.

00:30:38.567 --> 00:30:40.777
We could live in the same village,

00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:45.824
make mugwort rice cakes in the spring,
and make kimchi in the winter.

00:30:47.033 --> 00:30:50.328
Wouldn't it be nice
to grow old together like that?

00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:57.752
But Geum-ho…

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.421
Yes? (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:31:01.047 --> 00:31:03.383
What if it takes me a long time?

00:31:05.969 --> 00:31:09.890
What if I finally become human,
and you're already a hunchbacked granny?

00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:11.683
Hey, don't say that.

00:31:13.477 --> 00:31:16.646
Grandma! Let's go pick mugwort!

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:17.814
Grandma!

00:31:19.316 --> 00:31:20.859
- Let go of me!
- No!

00:31:20.942 --> 00:31:22.152
Let go!

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:24.029
Never!

00:31:25.697 --> 00:31:27.324
Sis!

00:31:29.743 --> 00:31:31.369
Why are you standing here alone?

00:31:33.747 --> 00:31:34.789
Tell me. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:31:35.415 --> 00:31:37.751
Do you still want to become
human that badly?

00:31:39.377 --> 00:31:40.253
What?

00:31:40.337 --> 00:31:43.340
I used to know someone a long time ago.

00:31:44.424 --> 00:31:46.593
She was a fox, just like us.

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:51.306
She cultivated herself for a long time
and finally became human.

00:31:53.016 --> 00:31:54.643
What happened to her?

00:31:56.061 --> 00:31:57.354
She died

00:31:58.021 --> 00:32:01.566
after dragging herself through a long,
cruel, miserable life.

00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:06.613
That's what human life is to me.

00:32:07.197 --> 00:32:09.908
It's fleeting, weak, and fragile.

00:32:11.368 --> 00:32:15.163
And you still want to be one of them?

00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:23.547
You know,

00:32:24.881 --> 00:32:26.466
today was really special for me.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.593
How about for you?

00:32:30.554 --> 00:32:31.555
What?

00:32:31.638 --> 00:32:34.558
All this time, I wasn't exactly happy,

00:32:34.641 --> 00:32:37.018
but I wasn't exactly unhappy either.

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:39.813
I just haven't had any days
that were memorable.

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:42.190
That's because you've been holed up
in the mountains--

00:32:42.274 --> 00:32:43.984
Then what about you?

00:32:44.609 --> 00:32:46.945
You've lived in the human world
this whole time.

00:32:47.028 --> 00:32:49.239
Have you had a lot of happy days?

00:32:50.574 --> 00:32:52.867
Or even terribly unhappy ones?

00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:58.248
I want to become human.

00:32:58.331 --> 00:33:00.458
Maybe I'll be unhappy.

00:33:00.542 --> 00:33:03.295
Maybe there will be moments
I can barely stand.

00:33:03.378 --> 00:33:04.588
But still,

00:33:04.671 --> 00:33:07.090
I want to live a life that's memorable.

00:33:08.049 --> 00:33:10.552
Even if it's short,
I want it to be intense.

00:33:12.262 --> 00:33:13.805
I want to be swept away.

00:33:14.347 --> 00:33:19.978
Not a life where I can predict
and control everything.

00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:23.064
I want to be tossed about, swept along,

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.734
crying one minute, laughing the next.

00:33:25.817 --> 00:33:27.777
I want to live a real life.

00:33:29.738 --> 00:33:33.325
Some days,
I want to be torn apart by regret.

00:33:33.992 --> 00:33:35.577
I want to feel hollow.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.664
But when I laugh,
I want to laugh out loud.

00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:43.376
Sis.

00:33:44.461 --> 00:33:48.465
Even if I'm unhappy, sad,

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:51.051
and eventually die,

00:33:51.718 --> 00:33:53.261
I still want to become human.

00:33:56.264 --> 00:33:58.224
I will never become human.

00:33:59.476 --> 00:34:02.187
I won't love a human as you did.

00:34:02.812 --> 00:34:05.273
I won't live in misery,
and I won't die in despair.

00:34:06.066 --> 00:34:07.442
I'll never

00:34:08.693 --> 00:34:10.612
live like you.

00:34:14.658 --> 00:34:15.784
Eun-ho.

00:34:19.871 --> 00:34:21.122
Geum-ho?

00:34:22.165 --> 00:34:23.375
Are you with me?

00:34:25.377 --> 00:34:26.711
Do you recognize me?

00:34:28.338 --> 00:34:29.339
I've…

00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:32.676
lived my own life

00:34:33.635 --> 00:34:35.136
with no regrets.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:39.265
You need to live yours.

00:34:40.517 --> 00:34:44.020
Whatever that may be.

00:35:00.078 --> 00:35:01.663
Yeon-su?

00:35:03.248 --> 00:35:04.791
Isn't that Yeon-su over there?

00:35:06.084 --> 00:35:07.460
No way.

00:35:07.544 --> 00:35:10.422
She's single. How could she have two kids?

00:35:13.842 --> 00:35:15.969
Goodness, these kids.

00:35:16.594 --> 00:35:18.513
They've made a mess here too.

00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:33.945
Mom, hurry up!

00:35:34.028 --> 00:35:35.739
Yeah, I'm coming!

00:35:44.998 --> 00:35:46.833
Why are you being so moody?

00:35:48.543 --> 00:35:49.627
Hold this.

00:35:53.882 --> 00:35:55.633
You are so stubborn.

00:35:55.717 --> 00:35:59.137
You're not a nine-tailed fox
who can use earth-folding anymore.

00:36:07.145 --> 00:36:08.813
Where did the other one go, anyway?

00:36:09.731 --> 00:36:10.607
She left.

00:36:11.399 --> 00:36:13.234
What? Where to?

00:36:13.318 --> 00:36:14.402
Where do you think?

00:36:14.486 --> 00:36:16.613
She's from the mountains,
so she went back.

00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:18.448
- Let's go.
- Wait, hold on.

00:36:18.531 --> 00:36:20.658
Wait for me.

00:36:20.742 --> 00:36:21.826
Hey!

00:36:22.577 --> 00:36:24.162
What's going on?

00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:26.623
Did you guys fight while I was gone?

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.792
If that's not it--

00:36:28.875 --> 00:36:30.752
You got exactly what you wanted.

00:36:30.835 --> 00:36:32.587
- What?
- We didn't fight.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.756
We decided to switch our fates.

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:36.299
- Really?
- Yes.

00:36:36.382 --> 00:36:37.675
Wait, hold on.

00:36:38.301 --> 00:36:39.302
For real?

00:36:39.803 --> 00:36:42.138
So it's all sorted?
Do I get my life back now?

00:36:44.265 --> 00:36:46.267
Get a grip, Si-yeol.

00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:49.312
You can't just
go back to normal overnight.

00:36:50.605 --> 00:36:52.148
Why not?

00:36:52.232 --> 00:36:54.776
Did you already forget the condition?

00:36:55.401 --> 00:36:58.822
That half-wit eight-tailed fox
has to become a nine-tailed fox

00:36:58.905 --> 00:37:00.865
before we can change our fates.

00:37:01.658 --> 00:37:02.659
Right.

00:37:04.077 --> 00:37:06.246
But how long will that take?

00:37:06.329 --> 00:37:07.747
Will it be quick?

00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:09.999
Usually, it takes about 100 years.

00:37:11.167 --> 00:37:13.169
What? A hundred years?

00:37:13.253 --> 00:37:15.672
Did you think
growing an additional tail was easy?

00:37:15.755 --> 00:37:18.466
How can you be so calm about this?

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.718
You think you'll still be alive by then?

00:37:20.802 --> 00:37:24.597
Oh, come on! What's the point
if I die of old age first?

00:37:24.681 --> 00:37:26.850
I said, usually.

00:37:29.227 --> 00:37:31.396
So there's another way?

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.316
It takes 100 years for total rookies.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.193
But I'm a pro.

00:37:37.819 --> 00:37:40.113
I've got some tricks up my sleeve.

00:37:46.744 --> 00:37:47.871
Is that…

00:37:49.455 --> 00:37:50.748
Brace yourself.

00:37:50.832 --> 00:37:53.877
Just so you know, this won't be easy.

00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:57.297
We'll be slammed starting tomorrow.

00:38:18.192 --> 00:38:19.193
What?

00:38:19.277 --> 00:38:21.654
I was too distracted to notice before,

00:38:21.738 --> 00:38:24.657
but this place is a total dump.

00:38:26.451 --> 00:38:27.535
What?

00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:31.205
You call this a home?

00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:33.875
You can be broke and still have taste.

00:38:33.958 --> 00:38:35.835
A roof and walls don't make a home.

00:38:35.919 --> 00:38:37.462
Are you kidding me?

00:38:38.087 --> 00:38:39.839
This isn't even really my place.

00:38:40.798 --> 00:38:44.052
I changed your fate,
not your sense of style.

00:38:44.135 --> 00:38:46.387
You just don't remember it,

00:38:46.471 --> 00:38:49.557
but you're the one
who decorated this place.

00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:52.018
And I saw your original place too.

00:38:52.101 --> 00:38:54.354
It was completely empty.

00:38:54.437 --> 00:38:56.814
Just some weird machine
you get into naked.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:02.028
That's just a crash pad
for when I'm in Korea.

00:39:03.196 --> 00:39:07.742
My actual house in the UK
has a pool and a private theater.

00:39:07.825 --> 00:39:10.578
The closet is huge, and the decor is--

00:39:10.662 --> 00:39:13.373
This is so depressing.

00:39:13.873 --> 00:39:18.211
I need to change back as soon as possible.
I can't live like this.

00:39:18.836 --> 00:39:21.589
Yeah, I'm rooting for you.

00:39:23.675 --> 00:39:25.009
Where are you going?

00:39:25.093 --> 00:39:26.010
What?

00:39:26.094 --> 00:39:28.304
Why? You need something?

00:39:28.805 --> 00:39:30.682
I'm tired. I'm going to go rest.

00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:34.227
I get that you're tired,
but why are you going in there?

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.021
There's only one bedroom,
so obviously it's mine.

00:39:37.105 --> 00:39:40.650
This is my home.
And I slept in there last night, didn't I?

00:39:40.733 --> 00:39:43.528
That's because I slept
with the eight-tailed fox.

00:39:43.611 --> 00:39:45.989
Starting today, I get the bed.

00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:47.991
I'm the oldest here.

00:39:49.492 --> 00:39:52.203
Sure, whatever you say.

00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:55.873
You're older than the Republic of Korea.
How can I beat that?

00:39:55.957 --> 00:39:57.667
I'll just have to serve you.

00:40:02.463 --> 00:40:04.173
Then I'm going to go wash up.

00:40:05.842 --> 00:40:07.051
Hold it.

00:40:07.135 --> 00:40:09.053
I get to shower first too.

00:40:09.137 --> 00:40:10.888
Elders first.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.259
Si-yeol.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.721
Si-yeol.

00:40:52.889 --> 00:40:54.098
Wake up.

00:40:55.683 --> 00:40:56.768
Hello?

00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:01.189
My gosh!

00:41:01.731 --> 00:41:03.691
What do you want now?

00:41:04.484 --> 00:41:05.902
I'm hungry.

00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:07.904
What? At this hour?

00:41:09.113 --> 00:41:10.531
Come on.

00:41:10.615 --> 00:41:12.658
You said you were stuffed
from the lunch buffet.

00:41:12.742 --> 00:41:13.993
So you refused to eat dinner.

00:41:14.077 --> 00:41:15.953
I was full then.

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:18.915
Now I'm hungry, so I can't sleep.

00:41:18.998 --> 00:41:21.501
This damn human body.

00:41:22.418 --> 00:41:24.212
Just try to go back to sleep.

00:41:24.295 --> 00:41:26.506
You'll get fat if you eat this late.

00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:31.177
It's fine. Once I turn back,
I won't gain weight anyway.

00:41:32.887 --> 00:41:36.182
Any more of that stuff
she was eating yesterday?

00:41:37.141 --> 00:41:39.519
What? Ramyeon?

00:42:00.164 --> 00:42:01.457
Dig in.

00:42:11.175 --> 00:42:12.468
So good.

00:42:12.552 --> 00:42:13.928
Is it that good?

00:42:14.428 --> 00:42:15.388
Yeah.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.516
Why did you only make one, though?

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:19.642
Aren't you eating?

00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:22.270
No, I don't eat at this hour.

00:42:22.353 --> 00:42:24.063
Especially not stuff like this.

00:42:25.064 --> 00:42:31.195
I think the last time I had ramyeon
was 12 or 13 years ago.

00:42:33.406 --> 00:42:34.949
Come on, just have one bite.

00:42:35.032 --> 00:42:36.242
It's really good.

00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:40.121
No, I'm good.

00:42:40.746 --> 00:42:43.666
We both reset when we go back anyway.

00:42:43.749 --> 00:42:45.376
Just eat it while you can.

00:42:49.422 --> 00:42:51.507
I guess that's true.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.888
Then just one bite.

00:43:19.202 --> 00:43:21.454
Come on, surely you want more than that?

00:43:21.537 --> 00:43:22.705
What?

00:43:22.788 --> 00:43:24.081
Right.

00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:26.459
Right?

00:43:27.335 --> 00:43:29.503
I'll just have one more bite.

00:43:40.932 --> 00:43:42.266
What the heck?

00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:49.065
Hey!

00:43:49.941 --> 00:43:51.400
You can't just eat it all.

00:43:51.484 --> 00:43:53.194
There's nothing left for me!

00:43:54.987 --> 00:43:56.364
Should we make another?

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.034
Make it two.

00:44:03.788 --> 00:44:05.206
Tastes better with three eggs.

00:44:05.831 --> 00:44:07.041
- Mix in some rice?
- Yeah.

00:44:10.795 --> 00:44:12.255
What is this?

00:44:13.005 --> 00:44:13.923
What is it?

00:44:14.006 --> 00:44:15.883
What's wrong?

00:44:16.509 --> 00:44:19.679
Oh no… my face.

00:44:22.265 --> 00:44:24.267
You're all puffy.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.645
I told you not to eat that late.

00:44:27.728 --> 00:44:29.772
You think your face looks any better?

00:44:29.855 --> 00:44:31.857
You're all puffy too.

00:44:31.941 --> 00:44:32.858
Me too?

00:44:35.111 --> 00:44:37.071
What the heck?

00:44:38.823 --> 00:44:41.575
I think the swelling's going down a bit.

00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:43.869
We should've just gone for a run.

00:44:43.953 --> 00:44:46.622
I told you we'd be busy starting today.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.916
We can't waste energy on useless stuff.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.503
What an excuse.

00:44:53.129 --> 00:44:55.506
Whatever. Just go change the spoons.

00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:56.841
Get the cold ones.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.512
- Nice!
- Nice!

00:45:01.595 --> 00:45:02.930
That's it!

00:45:03.014 --> 00:45:06.475
Move it up! There we go!
Seo Beom, shoot! Shoot it!

00:45:08.811 --> 00:45:10.980
- Nice!
- He skied it, damn it.

00:45:11.063 --> 00:45:13.607
This is so frustrating.

00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:15.985
Coach, would you like some water?

00:45:16.068 --> 00:45:17.445
Forget it. Put that away.

00:45:17.528 --> 00:45:19.363
- Cross it in!
- Okay!

00:45:21.324 --> 00:45:23.534
Come on, block him!

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:27.455
- Block him!
- Block!

00:45:29.999 --> 00:45:31.834
Nice!

00:45:32.376 --> 00:45:36.130
You've got to move up as a group, okay?

00:45:36.213 --> 00:45:37.548
Hey, Bae Jeong-bae!

00:45:37.631 --> 00:45:41.510
All you do is send crosses all day.

00:45:41.594 --> 00:45:43.471
Try cutting inside sometimes.

00:45:43.554 --> 00:45:45.473
And dribble
the ball up the field like this

00:45:45.556 --> 00:45:47.308
so that they get confused!

00:45:47.808 --> 00:45:48.934
Yes, sir.

00:45:49.477 --> 00:45:51.812
How does the water taste,
Seo Beom, you punk?

00:45:52.396 --> 00:45:53.564
You call that a shot?

00:45:53.647 --> 00:45:55.024
You skied it way up there.

00:45:55.107 --> 00:45:56.901
I thought you'd hit a damn airplane.

00:45:56.984 --> 00:45:58.110
I'm sorry.

00:45:58.194 --> 00:45:59.487
Damn it.

00:45:59.987 --> 00:46:04.075
Are you guys just gonna play defense
the whole time and go home?

00:46:04.158 --> 00:46:06.786
You have to score goals to win!

00:46:06.869 --> 00:46:08.037
But why?

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.998
Why isn't anyone making a proper attack?

00:46:12.249 --> 00:46:13.417
But, Coach.

00:46:14.293 --> 00:46:15.920
Who are we supposed to cut back to?

00:46:16.003 --> 00:46:17.004
What?

00:46:17.088 --> 00:46:19.757
Well, even if we cut back,
there's nobody there to take it.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.883
Hey, why isn't there?

00:46:20.966 --> 00:46:23.260
Kang Si-yeol would be right…

00:46:28.265 --> 00:46:30.267
Just pass it to the forward striker.

00:46:30.976 --> 00:46:32.686
Who's the forward striker?

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.647
- What?
- If we're being realistic,

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.775
we don't have a proper striker
on our team right now.

00:46:44.323 --> 00:46:48.619
Don't you guys know modern soccer?

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:50.913
Total soccer.

00:46:50.996 --> 00:46:53.165
Everyone attacks, everyone defends--

00:46:53.249 --> 00:46:54.542
Excuse me, Coach.

00:46:54.625 --> 00:46:56.585
- Instead, can't we just--
- No!

00:46:58.879 --> 00:47:00.881
You're trying to bring up

00:47:01.924 --> 00:47:03.717
Kang Si-yeol again, right?

00:47:04.927 --> 00:47:06.554
You listen to me carefully.

00:47:07.805 --> 00:47:08.973
Over…

00:47:10.266 --> 00:47:12.393
my dead body.

00:47:13.185 --> 00:47:14.770
That punk Kang Si-yeol is out!

00:47:16.647 --> 00:47:18.107
Out for good!

00:47:26.615 --> 00:47:28.993
Didn't you say we'd be super busy?

00:47:29.076 --> 00:47:30.661
But we're not exactly fishing here.

00:47:31.745 --> 00:47:33.038
What are we doing?

00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:37.126
Fishing?

00:47:37.209 --> 00:47:38.836
We're doing something similar.

00:47:38.919 --> 00:47:40.963
Except we're fishing for people, not fish.

00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:43.632
What? Fishing for people?

00:47:44.341 --> 00:47:45.384
Yes.

00:47:45.468 --> 00:47:48.304
Because from now on,
we're on a "Good Deeds Project."

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.099
Fine.

00:47:52.183 --> 00:47:55.269
No matter what I say,
I get that you want to become human.

00:47:55.352 --> 00:47:56.729
But before that,

00:47:57.771 --> 00:48:01.358
becoming a nine-tailed fox
is no easy task to begin with.

00:48:01.442 --> 00:48:02.735
Are you ready for that?

00:48:02.818 --> 00:48:05.946
Can you follow my lead without complaint,
no matter what I ask?

00:48:06.989 --> 00:48:08.032
Follow what exactly?

00:48:09.992 --> 00:48:11.035
What?

00:48:11.118 --> 00:48:14.288
From here on out, you're on your own.

00:48:14.371 --> 00:48:16.290
I'm not the one in a rush.

00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:18.250
Wait.

00:48:19.335 --> 00:48:20.336
Well…

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:24.882
I mean, I'm still going to help you.

00:48:25.758 --> 00:48:29.136
But you need to do good deeds
to build spiritual power so your tails--

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.305
Then I'll just give you my fox bead.

00:48:32.014 --> 00:48:33.891
I'll use a spell to connect us

00:48:33.974 --> 00:48:37.269
so you can do the good deeds
and build the spiritual power for me.

00:48:41.899 --> 00:48:44.902
My transformation is about to wear off,
so I have to run.

00:48:46.362 --> 00:48:47.613
What do you say?

00:48:48.405 --> 00:48:50.032
I think you were right.

00:48:51.075 --> 00:48:55.162
I swear, she's got me
wrapped around her finger.

00:48:56.247 --> 00:48:59.667
So what you're saying is,
when you do good deeds,

00:49:00.334 --> 00:49:03.295
she gains the spiritual power instead?

00:49:03.379 --> 00:49:05.631
But you can't actually use
her fox bead's power yourself.

00:49:05.714 --> 00:49:06.966
That's right. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:49:07.049 --> 00:49:10.052
That's why from now on,
we have to do good deeds.

00:49:10.135 --> 00:49:13.389
Aggressively and in massive amounts
in a short amount of time.

00:49:15.683 --> 00:49:19.645
But what does that
have to do with fishing?

00:49:19.728 --> 00:49:21.146
Seriously?

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:24.024
Do I have to spell out
every single thing for you?

00:49:24.108 --> 00:49:25.442
Who do you think is the reason

00:49:25.526 --> 00:49:27.903
I'm stuck as a human
and suffering like this?

00:49:30.614 --> 00:49:33.701
It's because I saved your life!

00:49:35.661 --> 00:49:38.330
Okay, fine. So what?

00:49:38.956 --> 00:49:41.333
One human embodies an entire world,

00:49:41.417 --> 00:49:46.839
so saving a person's life
is basically saving an entire world.

00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:49.258
In other words,

00:49:49.341 --> 00:49:53.053
the ultimate good deed,
the highest virtue of all,

00:49:53.137 --> 00:49:54.138
is saving a life.

00:50:04.815 --> 00:50:05.816
Wait, don't tell me.

00:50:06.442 --> 00:50:08.527
That's not what you're doing, right?

00:50:08.611 --> 00:50:11.322
You're waiting for someone to jump
so you can save them?

00:50:11.947 --> 00:50:14.283
Why? Is there a problem?

00:50:14.366 --> 00:50:15.242
Hey!

00:50:15.326 --> 00:50:16.869
Forget the problem!
How's that a good deed?

00:50:16.952 --> 00:50:18.537
The karma will get you, you know?

00:50:19.538 --> 00:50:22.541
Why would karma get me
when I'm saving a life?

00:50:24.168 --> 00:50:25.711
Unbelievable.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.796
Okay, fine.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.050
I don't expect much
from your moral compass anymore,

00:50:31.133 --> 00:50:34.595
but putting that aside,
it's just inefficient.

00:50:34.678 --> 00:50:36.847
Do you honestly think this makes sense?

00:50:38.307 --> 00:50:40.392
- It doesn't?
- No!

00:50:41.185 --> 00:50:43.979
It's like lying under a tree
waiting for fruit to fall!

00:50:44.063 --> 00:50:45.648
How long do you plan on waiting?

00:50:45.731 --> 00:50:46.732
You think so?

00:50:49.568 --> 00:50:50.611
I guess you're right.

00:50:51.278 --> 00:50:54.073
You do have a point.

00:50:55.115 --> 00:50:59.787
Given the urgency,
this does feel too passive.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:00.871
Exactly.

00:51:00.954 --> 00:51:03.207
Even if the good deeds are forced,

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:06.585
we should try to do them the normal way--

00:51:06.669 --> 00:51:07.961
Fine.

00:51:08.504 --> 00:51:10.547
I'll just have to find another way.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.597
SHAMAN'S SHRINE
ADULT STORE

00:51:18.681 --> 00:51:21.225
GAME LAND
IMAGE SHOP

00:51:25.854 --> 00:51:27.356
Here, Si-yeol.

00:51:27.439 --> 00:51:29.400
Take this and burn that place down.

00:51:30.401 --> 00:51:31.360
What?

00:51:31.443 --> 00:51:33.070
Are you out of your mind?

00:51:33.153 --> 00:51:34.321
Don't worry about it.

00:51:34.405 --> 00:51:37.866
I know the guys inside. I met them
back in my nine-tailed fox days.

00:51:38.492 --> 00:51:41.829
Loan sharks, illegal gambling,
organ trafficking, you name it.

00:51:41.912 --> 00:51:46.500
This place is crawling with wicked
and evil people doing that kind of stuff.

00:51:47.126 --> 00:51:48.877
Trust me, they deserve to die.

00:51:49.503 --> 00:51:50.546
Hey.

00:51:50.629 --> 00:51:53.257
Didn't you just say
that "one human is a whole world"?

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.551
And now you want me
to burn people to death?

00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:56.760
What are you talking about?

00:51:56.844 --> 00:51:58.512
I'm a very cultivated beast, you know.

00:51:58.595 --> 00:52:00.097
Then what's this for?

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.392
You start the fire,
then I'll swoop in and put it out in time.

00:52:03.475 --> 00:52:05.853
Or we can just call the fire department.
That'd mean I saved

00:52:05.936 --> 00:52:09.064
a bunch of lives
in that building all at once.

00:52:11.108 --> 00:52:12.651
First the river, now fire?

00:52:13.485 --> 00:52:15.487
You really will stop at nothing.

00:52:16.238 --> 00:52:18.407
I can't do this. I won't.

00:52:18.949 --> 00:52:20.743
Do you honestly think this makes sense?

00:52:20.826 --> 00:52:23.120
What's wrong now? Why not?

00:52:23.203 --> 00:52:26.290
Jeez, you never just agree to anything.

00:52:26.373 --> 00:52:30.794
So you're talking about
a false kindness, aren't you?

00:52:30.878 --> 00:52:32.546
The important part is the kindness.

00:52:32.629 --> 00:52:33.630
Hey!

00:52:33.714 --> 00:52:36.133
You want us to be the bad guys,
not the good guys!

00:52:36.216 --> 00:52:39.219
Either way, we're still saving them.
That's all that matters, isn't it?

00:52:39.303 --> 00:52:41.472
Don't you know
what happens to the bad guys?

00:52:41.555 --> 00:52:44.016
They always end up ruined
and in the gutter.

00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:45.350
Enough!

00:52:45.434 --> 00:52:47.853
I'm older than any bad guy out there.

00:52:47.936 --> 00:52:49.480
So just do as I say.

00:52:50.105 --> 00:52:52.566
If you want to start a fire,
do it yourself.

00:52:52.649 --> 00:52:54.026
I can't do it.

00:52:55.569 --> 00:52:57.613
I would've done it already if I could.

00:52:57.696 --> 00:53:00.949
I need to do good deeds,
so I can't do bad things.

00:53:01.033 --> 00:53:03.327
Oh, so you know it's bad?

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:04.453
Fire!

00:53:05.078 --> 00:53:06.622
Fire!

00:53:07.956 --> 00:53:09.208
Did you…

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.001
It wasn't me.

00:53:11.084 --> 00:53:13.420
It really wasn't. I'm right here.

00:53:15.798 --> 00:53:18.425
But where is the fire?

00:53:30.854 --> 00:53:33.190
HOPE ORPHANAGE

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:38.195
- Did you call 911?
- Yes.

00:53:38.278 --> 00:53:40.989
But the children are still inside!

00:53:41.073 --> 00:53:42.699
There are children inside?

00:53:42.783 --> 00:53:44.076
Yes.

00:53:46.578 --> 00:53:47.996
Here, hold this.

00:53:49.665 --> 00:53:51.834
Si-yeol, what are you doing?

00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:53.377
You wait here. It's too dangerous.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.586
What?

00:53:57.548 --> 00:53:58.465
Si-yeol!

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.152
Si-yeol, I can't see a thing.

00:54:19.236 --> 00:54:21.613
I told you not to come! It's dangerous!

00:54:21.697 --> 00:54:23.323
Come to think of it,

00:54:24.032 --> 00:54:26.785
if anyone saves the kids,
it has to be me, not you.

00:54:26.869 --> 00:54:29.288
What? Are you crazy?

00:54:30.038 --> 00:54:31.206
Cover your face with this.

00:54:32.583 --> 00:54:35.419
I think the fire started in the basement.

00:54:35.502 --> 00:54:37.796
Let's get the kids out
before it spreads up here.

00:54:44.928 --> 00:54:46.638
- Hey, kids.
- Teacher!

00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:50.601
Are you all right?

00:54:51.351 --> 00:54:52.477
Okay, let's go.

00:54:55.731 --> 00:54:57.149
Take the kids and get out first.

00:54:57.232 --> 00:54:59.276
I'll check over there,
then follow you out.

00:54:59.359 --> 00:55:00.611
I'm scared!

00:55:01.403 --> 00:55:02.487
Let's go.

00:55:16.919 --> 00:55:18.295
Is that everyone?

00:55:20.297 --> 00:55:22.215
I can't find So-jeong!

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:52.162
They're out!

00:55:53.705 --> 00:55:55.958
Oh, So-jeong!

00:56:06.426 --> 00:56:09.763
Where's the woman I was with?

00:56:09.846 --> 00:56:12.474
She went back inside just now.

00:56:13.141 --> 00:56:14.226
What?

00:56:17.062 --> 00:56:18.689
Why won't this open?

00:56:19.564 --> 00:56:21.316
Damn it, open up!

00:56:49.928 --> 00:56:51.304
Don't be ridiculous.

00:56:51.805 --> 00:56:53.849
You think I'm going to die like this?

00:57:06.236 --> 00:57:07.362
Eun-ho!

00:57:07.904 --> 00:57:08.905
Eun-ho!

00:57:08.989 --> 00:57:09.948
Si-yeol.

00:57:10.741 --> 00:57:13.994
Seriously, what are you doing?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:57:19.458 --> 00:57:20.959
Eun-ho, are you okay?

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:24.880
Si-yeol!

00:57:49.196 --> 00:57:51.031
Oh, you're awake.

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:54.951
What?

00:57:56.036 --> 00:57:58.288
Wait, what happened?

00:58:02.542 --> 00:58:04.836
Si-yeol. Where is he?

00:58:05.462 --> 00:58:06.505
Excuse me?

00:58:07.547 --> 00:58:09.466
Wait, ma'am!

00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:11.968
- Where are you going?
- Si-yeol!

00:58:16.807 --> 00:58:17.808
Si-yeol!

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:24.022
Where is Si-yeol?

00:58:27.067 --> 00:58:28.610
You looking for me?

00:58:31.738 --> 00:58:33.448
People will think I'm actually dead.

00:58:34.074 --> 00:58:36.409
Why are you calling out for me like that?
I'm right here.

00:58:36.493 --> 00:58:38.829
I seriously thought you were dead.

00:58:39.996 --> 00:58:41.039
Were you scared?

00:58:42.457 --> 00:58:43.834
It just so happens that right now,

00:58:43.917 --> 00:58:47.170
you're the only person
in the world on my side.

00:58:47.796 --> 00:58:50.924
I don't have any friends or family
I can rely on.

00:58:51.675 --> 00:58:54.177
You're all I have.

00:58:54.803 --> 00:58:57.389
So you should worry about me too.

00:58:57.472 --> 00:58:59.349
I'll be worrying about you.

00:59:02.936 --> 00:59:03.854
Eun-ho.

00:59:04.729 --> 00:59:06.481
You told me to worry.

00:59:06.982 --> 00:59:09.568
You said I should worry about you!

00:59:10.485 --> 00:59:12.988
I'm really okay, I swear.

00:59:13.697 --> 00:59:16.575
Since when do you actually
listen to what I say?

00:59:31.965 --> 00:59:35.719
If you had died,
I would've killed you myself!

01:00:16.468 --> 01:00:19.304
NO TAIL TO TELL

01:00:19.387 --> 01:00:20.889
{\an8}Are you sure you're doing this right?

01:00:20.972 --> 01:00:23.058
{\an8}We haven't gained
one bit of spiritual power.

01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:24.726
{\an8}Why isn't the power building up?

01:00:24.809 --> 01:00:28.146
{\an8}How about we try
doing good deeds by the book?

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:31.816
{\an8}What if I stay human
and just die of old age?

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.362
{\an8}Was there really nothing good
about becoming human?

01:00:35.987 --> 01:00:37.906
{\an8}Last name Lee, first name Yoon.

01:00:37.989 --> 01:00:39.282
{\an8}You bastard!

01:00:39.366 --> 01:00:40.367
{\an8}Kang Si-yeol.

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:43.119
{\an8}- He must be a very close friend of yours.
- This memory…

01:00:43.203 --> 01:00:45.288
{\an8}It is you.

01:00:45.372 --> 01:00:48.458
{\an8}I know this is all your fault!

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:53.672
