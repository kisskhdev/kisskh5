From now on, I'll be the one taking care of you.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.640
♫What is left are shadows of ourselves
standing in its place♫

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600
♫And the scars of our pain♫

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.240
♫That will never fade away♫

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.440
♫What is left is the gaping wound of the past♫

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.800
♫Imprisoned by the love
neither of us could never grasp♫

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.040
♫If we could turn back time,♫

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.960
♫I wonder if we'd hold each other again♫

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.160
Hi, Vier.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.800
This is your welcome party.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.260
Are you having a good time here?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.760
Tomorrow,
I'm taking a trip to the beach.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.520
I invited a bunch of guys and beautiful girls.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.520
If any of them catches your eye,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200
feel free to choose.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.040
I'll pass.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.920
What would I do if your fiancee came after me?

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.160
Gosh.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.680
No need to worry about her.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.180
I simply want to do my part as a lovely host

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.180
and give you a memorable welcome.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.080
This will show you how far the King Group

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.840
has come

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.280
and how big it has become.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.000
Alright. Enjoy.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.800
You fool!

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.840
Can't you watch where you're going?!

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.520
Are you blind?!

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.960
Why are you just standing there?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.720
Apologize to him already.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.440
I'm sorry, sir.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.880
What? That's it?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080
Huh?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.680
Do you realize his jacket alone

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.130
is worth more than your salary?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.880
Don't just stand there and do nothing!

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.520
Don't you know who he is?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.160
Gosh, what a fool!

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.360
You've actually never heard of him?

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.400
That's enough.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.890
But...

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.120
It's fine.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.780
I'm the one

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.680
who's supposed to apologize.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.320
I was in your way.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.080
My name's Vier.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.920
If there's any problem,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.040
feel free to tell me.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.040
Don't just stand there!

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
Leave already.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.920
Hey, Vier.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.000
I'm sorry for what happened.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.600
Why don't you get changed

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.800
so you can enjoy the party?

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.880
It's okay.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.600
I'm getting sleepy, actually.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.160
I'm also going to stop by
and see Uncle Katha tomorrow.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.360
Sure thing.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.880
I'll give you a ride there.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.480
See you.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.280
Welcome, Vier.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.480
How was the welcome party?
Did you have fun?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.800
It was pretty fun.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.160
Thank you.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.360
The last time I saw you,
you were just a little boy.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.240
Now that I get to see you again,
you've all grown up.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.480
I've been friends with your father for ages,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.960
so consider this house your own.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.440
Alright.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.000
Let me show you around the house.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.640
It was actually designed by Ken,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.000
with the same standards as the hotel in mind.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.720
Soon, we'll be working together,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.060
won't we?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560
It'd be a pleasure.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.960
Alright.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.360
This deer collection looks immaculate.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.800
Its placement is just as perfect.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.000
This is Ken's work.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.160
He's good at this.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.680
If you interested in the hospitality industry,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.160
we at King Group

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600
should be among the first business partners

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.520
you think of.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.120
I've heard that VPG Group

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.800
is interested in this line of business.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.280
This is the perfect opportunity for us
to exchange perspectives

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.880
and grow our business opportunities together.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.800
Thank you for the advice, Mr. Ken.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.320
However, I think...

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.840
I need more time.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.160
I want to do my due diligence

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.920
before the time comes.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.080
Mr. Ken.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.400
The bench you ordered has arrived.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.600
What do you think about the color?

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.080
Where should we put it?

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.280
It's beautiful, actually.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.680
Just put it wherever you want.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.600
Can't you see that I've got a guest over here?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.160
It's not just the color, however.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.440
Finding a suitable location
is just as significant.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.520
It'll add balance to the overall space.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.960
In some matters,
if it's not your responsibility,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.260
it's better to let the one
at the helm handle it.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.320
Father...

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.430
I'm sorry.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.560
Wait.

00:08:46.446 --> 00:08:48.446
You mentioned the significance of the placement.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.640
What do you mean by that?

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.200
Is this your youngest son, Uncle?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.680
I met him last night, actually.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.200
But Ken didn't introduce him to me.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.320
Kelvin.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.200
He's my other son.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.240
Well,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.760
explain its significance to him.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.320
So...

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.680
The significance of decoration

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.460
is not solely about aesthetics,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.240
but about
the combination of beauty, functionality,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.120
and harmony.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.880
These three aspects

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.160
reflect the owners' characters

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.720
and lifestyles.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.400
Get back to your task at hand.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.200
Go.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.840
Dinner will be ready at 6:30 P.M., sir.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.320
If there's any food
you're allergic to or don't eat,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.280
please inform the house staff or me.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.120
Right. Thank you.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.660
Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.160
"There are a lot of security cameras.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.840
If you value your privacy,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.200
you should be careful."

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.520
Oh, Vier is here.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.880
How's everything?

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.410
Do you like your bedroom?

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.370
It's beautiful and very comfortable.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.620
Thank you.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.220
And...

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.640
Where's Kelvin?

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.920
Isn't he joining us for dinner?

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.880
Just ignore him.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.040
He's always been like this.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.560
He prefers to be alone,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.280
like the nerd he is.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.480
Kelvin is a very private person.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.160
I think it's best we dig in.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.400
The food's still hot.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.440
Eat it while it's fresh,
before it loses its flavor.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.000
Right.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.480
Make sure you finish it tonight.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.520
I've got a meeting to attend tomorrow morning.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.000
Yes.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.440
I'll get it done as soon as possible.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.400
Is there a problem?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.440
The steak at dinner...

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.120
Did you make it?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.920
Yes, I did.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.600
It was wonderful.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.000
And why didn't you

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.280
come join us?

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.280
Uh...

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.160
I have urgent work to finish tonight.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.200
Ken's work?

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.880
Don't tell me

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.170
you haven't eaten anything.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.920
I need to get back to work now,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.960
or I'll be late.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.600
Can you check the email I sent you?

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.500
Give it a read.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.560
Based on what I've found,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.560
each property has its pros and cons.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.280
Still, they seem pretty decent overall.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.040
They're perfect for a full-service hotel complex.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.320
Great.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.480
That's why you're my best assistant

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.400
and a good boy shareholder.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.520
A good boy?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.240
You called me "a good boy"?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.880
I'm a person, not a dog!

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.880
Be nice, please.
I'm helping you out here.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.360
Oh, and...

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.640
About King Group...

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.440
How's the research going on that front?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200
Um...

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600
Well...

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.920
Nothing good to report, honestly.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.240
Everything is exaggerated.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.360
I'll have to dig into it a bit more.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.720
As for the plan of VPG Group
to enter the hospitality industry,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.560
I think King Group would be a great choice.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.240
However, investments always come with risks,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.720
especially when dealing
with a company of this size.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.000
So, stay sharp and don't be careless.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.720
Mhm.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.200
Agreed.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.440
Can we get back to that topic?

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.720
If your hunch about Mr. Katha's son,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.280
Kelvin, is correct,

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.440
I bet it must have been rough for him.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640
How so?

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880
Well...

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.340
You're an only child, right?

00:16:31.273 --> 00:16:33.673
You grew up with all your parents' love.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.960
As for someone like me,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.280
I don't even know who my parents are.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.480
It's hard for me to get my footing in life.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.520
Don't think like that.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.840
You've got me.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.480
I'm your family.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.120
Anyway...

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.640
Let's get through this first.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.680
Then I'll give you a long vacation

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.640
so you can go stay with your grandma.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.600
Okay?

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.720
Mhm.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.000
Let's call it a night.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.640
It's getting late. I'm going to bed.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.120
Goodnight.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.200
"You're always being watched in this house."

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.760
Where's Ken?

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800
Why isn't he here by now?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.320
He's still in bed, sir.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520
Shut it.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.440
I was preparing for the meeting.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.120
What?

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.600
Dig in already.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040
What are you waiting for?

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.400
Uncle,

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.800
is it necessary to have security cameras

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.480
in the dining room as well?

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.840
I saw four of them in the living room yesterday.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.900
Is it necessary to have this many cameras?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.760
It's an affluent neighborhood.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.120
That's just how it is.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.320
It's nothing out of the ordinary.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.920
Other houses have just as many cameras.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.160
The valuables in this house

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.040
are priceless.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.840
I feel safe

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.840
having them installed.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.200
Do they make you feel uncomfortable, Vier?

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.560
Oh, not at all.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.280
I've checked both the Finance

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.480
and HR departments.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.520
Everything seems fine.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.560
After this, I'll probably check

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.760
the core business.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.960
Right.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.090
I need to hang up now.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.760
Oh, Kelvin?

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.080
Have a seat.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960
Is there a problem?

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.040
Those notes and letters

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.960
were from me.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.560
Could you please not tell my father?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.560
Why do I have to tell him about them?

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.320
You knew that

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.920
they were from me, didn't you?

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.040
Do I really look that smart?

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.120
Your ears are a bit red.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.400
So is your face.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.120
Why are you nodding?

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.400
Please don't tease me, Mr. Vier.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.560
All I ask is that

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.440
you don't bring them up to my father.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.120
I don't want any trouble.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.280
If you don't want trouble,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.280
then why send me the notes?

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.370
Why did you warn me
about the security cameras?

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.320
Can you tell me why?

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600
Those cameras...

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.280
They're there to monitor me.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.360
Helping yourself?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Oh...

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.600
Why were you acting like a waiter the other day?

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.200
Your dad doesn't give you any money?

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.920
Why do I need to use their money?

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.840
I've got my own two hands.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.080
I can make a living on my own.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.840
So you really were there to work.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.560
Ken told me that he needed to accommodate
a very important guest,

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.640
but he lacked the manpower.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.970
So I offered to help.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.880
Then why did he talk to you like that?

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.960
It didn't sound like you were siblings.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.520
That's how he usually talks.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.520
I'm used to it now.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.240
Okay, whatever.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.630
About what you asked me...

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.920
I won't tell anyone.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.640
Don't worry.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.700
Thank you.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.500
With that said,

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.560
I need to go back to work now, if you don't mind.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.900
It's already past working hours.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.130
You're not going home?

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.440
I'm helping prepare for my brother's engagement.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.240
I'll be on my way now.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.440
So people like this really do exist, huh?

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.650
He really can do anything.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.080
You can read English, too?

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.360
You're quite talented yourself.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.040
The door was left open.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.500
I knocked on the door before entering,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.300
but you didn't respond.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.680
So I decided to barge right in.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.740
I'm sorry for that.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800
What were you doing?

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.340
I wasn't doing anything.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.560
I was simply looking for something to read.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.080
Were you doing research

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.200
to help grow the family business?

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.080
No, it wasn't like that.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.390
I wanted to educate myself.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.040
It's got nothing to do with the business either.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.860
You've got great taste, I must say.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.440
You work harder than Ken, too.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.680
The fact that you were able to design this house

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.680
already says a lot.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.800
It's Ken's work,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.320
not mine.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.000
Really?

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.120
It's true.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.760
Liar.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.660
Here.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.320
You look way more handsome without the glasses.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.960
I'm sorry?

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.870
Kids these days...

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.320
They're so bad at their jobs.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.270
Even a little scolding here and there

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.410
is too much for them.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.530
Then they start crying and getting all dramatic.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.650
Come on in, Vier.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.570
Let's talk business.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.730
- This way.
- Of course.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.120
Have a seat.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.010
Sorry, I was just relaxing.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.080
Right.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.920
What's on your mind?

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.440
I think I would need some more time

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.760
to evaluate several other factors.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.860
It's in both of our best interests.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.730
So I'd like to ask to postpone
the contract signing for now.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.240
I want to have all the details
and see things a bit more clearly.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.520
On top of that,
you have big events coming up, right?

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.560
Your engagement and marriage.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.640
What do you think?

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.600
Sure. I'm fine with that.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.120
Right.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.640
Brother,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.440
I've finished the design...

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.400
and planning for the Hua Hin project.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.400
As for the backdrop and the stage,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.640
I've made some adjustments.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.400
Don't you see that I've got a guest here?

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.860
I'm sorry.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.080
I wasn't paying attention.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.200
Goddamn it!

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.720
Those glasses are useless!

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.020
Don't just stand there!

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.520
Get the hell out already!

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:42.980
Wait.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.160
I have to take my leave now.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.360
An urgent matter has come up.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.560
Why the fuck are you just standing there?

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.600
Get the hell out!

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.720
Right.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.360
Do you have to do this much for your brother?

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.200
Your talents

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.880
can actually secure you a higher position.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.080
I simply do whatever he asks me to.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.840
If he told you to serve a prison sentence for him,

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.360
you'd do it too?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.800
We're 20 minutes behind schedule, Mr. Likit.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.200
Hello, Uncle.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.040
Oh, hello.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.040
Apologies for being late.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.600
It's okay. The ceremony hasn't even begun.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.720
Oh, this is Mr. Likit,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.720
Ken's future father-in-law.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.240
He's also Chairman of the Board of Loyde Group.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.440
Nice to meet you, Mr. Likit.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.720
I've heard so much about you.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.920
It's been an honor to meet you.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.480
Mr. Watt has been blessed

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.720
with a son who is both handsome

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.080
and promising.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.680
Thank you.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.760
My father sent me
to offer his congratulations to both families

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.160
on this joyful union.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.600
The future will surely be bright and prosperous.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.800
Thank you so much, Vier.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.680
Once our project succeeds...

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.320
and our three companies join forces,

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.440
we'll be the dominant force in ASEAN.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.080
Right.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.320
Your daughter still hasn't arrived.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.400
Excuse me for a moment.
I have something to take care of.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.520
Make yourself at home.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.440
Thank you.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.200
I'll also have to be on my way.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.080
Alright.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.920
Hey!

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.000
You still can't reach her?

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.000
We're already 20 minutes behind schedule!

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.680
The guests are all here!

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.100
You're asking me?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.420
How am I supposed to know, Dad?

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.740
I've already called that bitch over 30 times.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.500
Watch your language!

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.020
Someone might hear that.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.900
Mr. Likit has sent his people to get Lalin.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.060
As for Vier, he's just arrived.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.500
This engagement ceremony
is very important to both of our families.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.540
Be patient

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.180
and don't mess anything up.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.140
Understood?

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.000
[All voice recordings]

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.080
You've never come all this way to get me.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.520
You were supposed to be dressed properly

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.840
and at the ceremony 20 minutes ago.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.440
Are you trying to humiliate me?

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.840
You wouldn't feel humiliated in the first place

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.720
if you hadn't agreed to let me be with that idiot.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.240
Have I ever told you I wanted to marry him?

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.840
You know how necessary this marriage is.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.040
We are joining forces to grow our business.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.440
There's nothing but benefits,

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.240
and you'll be set for life.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.960
Set for life?

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.800
I don't think so.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.040
Everyone knows Ken is an idiot.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.680
He's also a player to boot.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.000
Yet, you chose to turn a blind eye
and take him in as a son-in-law?

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.560
You're ruining everything.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.840
Your younger brother will also suffer.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.920
Everyone will be in trouble
because of your actions.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.200
So I'm the one

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.240
who has to take the bullet

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.080
just to make everyone happy?

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.760
What do you want?

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.520
Get rid of all your men.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.600
I'll find and hire the workers myself.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.920
While we're at it, stop sending a spy to stalk me.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.760
One last thing...

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.880
I want 20% more of the shares.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.320
20%?

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.560
That's too much. I can't do that.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.760
All of that in exchange for your daughter's life?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.880
[Katha]

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.960
Well, then...

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.440
I guess I can't help you.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
You'd better brace yourself.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.160
Thank you, our distinguished guests,

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.360
for taking the time to be here.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.560
The two of us

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.400
have known each other since we were kids.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.360
You can say...

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.960
Lalin is my first love.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.320
Today, I couldn't be happier

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.890
that we

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.360
are getting married.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.160
Apologies for the interruption.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.770
Dad?

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.360
Good to see you, Mr. Ken.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.280
You're being charged with money laundering.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.320
Please cooperate with the authorities.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.960
You have the right to remain silent.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.200
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.320
You have the right to consult an attorney

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.120
and to contact your relatives,
as permitted by law.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.880
Excuse me, officers.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.800
I'm Ken's father.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.240
There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.880
As far as I know,
my son has never done anything illegal.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.400
He's also getting engaged today.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.120
And there are a lot of guests here.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.840
If there's a problem,
could we discuss it later?

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.800
Please, officers, if you could.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.260
I'm afraid that can't be done.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.280
You're coming with us for questioning.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.320
Here's the arrest warrant.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.000
Alright. Take him away.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.200
Hey!

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.640
I didn't do anything!

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:47.880
Let me go! Hey!

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.000
Dad!

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.960
Sir, please help me!

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.360
If you're not guilty,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.720
there's nothing to worry about.

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:58.560
Dad.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.320
Officer...

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.880
- please.
- It can't be done.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.680
This way. Please cooperate with us.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.600
Let me go!

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.680
- Dad!
- It's okay.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.200
Ken, I'll come get you.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.680
Help me, Dad!

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.480
Let me go, damn it!

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.000
Looks like the engagement is off.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.880
That said, our agreement still stands.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.520
Kelvin!

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.600
You called the police on Ken, didn't you?!

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.240
What happened to him?

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.120
Kelvin!

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.840
Can you stop fucking playing dumb?!

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.360
You really think doing this
will get you everything?

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.200
Not a fucking chance!

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.640
I only have one son.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.600
His name is Ken!

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.440
You're not my son!

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.120
It's okay if you don't see me as your son.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.040
It's okay if Ken doesn't see me as his brother.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.800
To me...

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.320
everyone is family.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.480
Ken is my brother.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.440
There's no way I'd hurt him.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.680
I've been willing to do anything for him.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.520
You see it, don't you?

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.800
If that's what you're saying,

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.520
then come to the police station with me

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.640
and tell them you're the real culprit!

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.400
If you love your brother

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.320
and this family,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.520
do as I say!

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.360
You...

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.440
You mean...

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.200
You want me to...

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.640
serve his sentence instead of him?

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.960
It's to prove he's innocent.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.840
It's for his future

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.120
and for the sake of King Group.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.560
Can you do it for me?

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.880
Once things die down,

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.960
I'll get you out. I promise.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.640
It's fine if you don't love me.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.400
I've been biting my tongue

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.200
and doing everything,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.240
hoping that one day

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.120
you'd love me

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.520
and accept me.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.480
I never knew...

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.200
you could be this heartless.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.400
What makes you think I don't love you?

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.160
I'm simply asking you to save our family.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.340
Can you prove it to me?

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.320
Can you do it for us just this once?

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.800
I'll do it.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.680
I'll serve his sentence.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.520
Can you give me Mr. Ongart's phone number?
He's my father's friend.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.800
Hey, you're not going to meddle in
Ken's money laundering case, are you?

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.240
It's extremely complicated.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.040
I don't think it's worth it.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.160
Aside from lying,

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.880
what I hate most

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.960
is treating someone unfairly.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.160
- Dad!
- I'm here to save you, son!

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.440
Open the door!

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.880
- Dad!
- Ken.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400
Ken...

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.280
Are you okay?

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.640
Hey.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.680
Why are you doing this to me?!

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.520
A week ago,

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.960
fucking Ken
sexually assaulted my sister in his office.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.760
She's now suffering from depression

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.320
and almost took her own life!

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.760
What does this have to do with me?

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.570
Ow!

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.200
It's because you're related.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.920
If he comes to see you,

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.520
give him my fucking regards.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.120
Ow!

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.600
Stop!

00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.840
What are you doing?!

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.760
Let me go.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:48.880
Mr. Kelvin.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.640
You're free now.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.840
So...

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.000
My father's bailing me out of jail?

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.040
This way.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.960
Get in.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.880
Just ask me what's on your mind.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.080
I confessed everything.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.520
What did you do to get me out?

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.160
When it comes to this kind of stuff...

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.240
I have to pull some strings to get it done.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.760
Thank you.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.720
Did my father send you?

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.000
Your father?

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.160
Saving you?

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.360
I'm doing this myself.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.280
I'm returning the favor.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.040
Me?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.280
It's about the security cameras.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.280
Can you promise

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.840
not to tell anyone about this?

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.720
I don't want any trouble with your family.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.320
I don't want this to affect the business.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.760
Now, that's more like it.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.640
Where are your glasses?

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.960
Who did you get into a fight with?

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.440
I'm the one

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.440
who got beaten up.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.520
You're a fighter yourself, you know?

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.080
And that's cool.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.240
Thank you

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:26.720
for getting me out.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.800
I promise

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.160
that I'll repay you.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.120
No need to thank me.

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.840
With that said...

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.720
How are you going to repay me?

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.080
How about you repay me right now?

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.680
Let's just say...

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.360
You have to be mine...

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.520
alone.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.360
What's with you?

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.880
Don't tell me that

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.840
you've never...

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.680
Hey!

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.400
You're still a virgin?

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.360
Hey...

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.640
You said you'd repay me, didn't you?

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.320
This is nothing.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.240
Why are you taking me here?

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.280
You were locked up there all night.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.640
I want you to get some fresh air.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:56.000
Do you like the view?

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920
Well...

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.400
I don't know.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.920
I don't like it yet.

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.680
So?

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.200
Do you like it now?

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.640
This way, you'll see better.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.960
Well...

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.240
I do,

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.440
but I still can't see it very clearly.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.720
I don't have my glasses.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.040
Huh?

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.880
Can you...

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.920
see me clearly now?

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.320
It's blurry.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:00.760
How about this?

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.200
Still blurry.

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:11.720
Well... How about now?

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.640
Now, it's clear.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:36.340
From now on,

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.400
whatever you want,

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.200
I'll give it to you...

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.440
even my own life.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.540
I don't want it,

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.400
your life.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.800
For me,

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.160
sex isn't a big deal.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.080
It's like eating and sleeping.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.600
If I feel like it, I do it.

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.320
If I want it, I take it.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.000
We are not lovers.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.080
I do not love you.

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.440
Consider this...

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.880
a one-night stand.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.280
No strings attached.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.920
Oh, by the way...

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.760
I'll treat you to a pair of contact lenses.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.160
Didn't you say
your brother took the blame for you?

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.640
Why was he freed?

00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.080
The police said
it was due to a lack of evidence.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.800
However, you need not worry.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.760
I've taken care of everything.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:02.360
Such an incident will never happen again.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.800
When it comes to being a nominee,

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.240
transparency is the most essential quality.

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.680
Once tarnished,
they will have to be swept away.

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.360
Understood?

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760
Understood.

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.280
The current goal is
to secure investment from VPG Group.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.000
If you fail this,

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:26.240
your life will not be as easy as it used to be.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.000
Yes.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.660
Bastards.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.160
Lalin, my babe.

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.840
You were arrested, weren't you?

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.080
Why are you still loitering around here?

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960
Lalin,

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.960
I can explain this.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.680
I just talked to your father.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.480
Once things quiet down,

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.680
I'll arrange our wedding as soon as possible.

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.600
What a shame.

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.240
Some people

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.520
are better off in a prisoner uniform

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.480
than in a groom's attire.

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.840
You bitch.

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.160
You're not calling me "my babe" anymore?

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.720
I forgot...

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.200
that some girls...

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.040
shouldn't be addressed by their names.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.080
A girl like you...

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.440
isn't worth that much either.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.080
Don't be so arrogant.

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.720
No one would want you as a wife.

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.200
Are you just saying that...

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.280
to make yourself feel better?

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.040
Yes, Dad?

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.600
I've already spoken to Mr. Likit.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.800
Try to behave as best as you can.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.040
Don't cause any trouble.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.960
Have you met Lalin yet?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:13.880
What did she say?

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.520
Dad.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.540
Can you stop bringing up that bitch?

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.160
I'm absolutely pissed right now.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.880
What did you two argue about this time?

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.140
Can you just be patient
until the wedding is over?

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.880
Don't even get me started on VPG Group.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.720
You need to get Vier
to sign the contract already.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.760
Don't waste any more time.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.720
Remember this:

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.760
every day wasted is our money lost.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.280
So you'd better get it sorted out.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.320
Vier.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.160
I'm in the clear now.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.280
I wasn't at fault.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.920
I was framed.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.720
I hope this doesn't affect

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.200
the relationship between our companies.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.520
I'm glad to hear

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.440
that you're safe.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:14.040
It's a shame, really.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.360
I've pulled out of the investment
with King Group.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.030
Why would you do that, Vier?

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.280
Let me explain myself.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.640
It was all a misunderstanding.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.320
I didn't do anything wrong.
It's all cleared up.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.720
I was framed, Vier!

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.160
I understand how you feel.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.640
However,

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.160
our visions aren't quite aligned.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.240
A long-term, sustainable collaboration
would be hard to achieve.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.760
That said, I must thank you

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.200
for taking such good care of me.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.040
I've had my assistant
take everything you did for me into account.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.200
I've already transferred
the compensation to your account.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.320
I hope you understand.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.320
Damn it!

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.040
We are not lovers.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.040
I do not love you.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.080
Consider this...

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.520
a one-night stand.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.640
No strings attached.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.640
Still awake?

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.640
You dropped this in the car.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.320
Thank you.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.440
Is it your partner's?

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.440
It's my mother's, actually.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.560
I have to go now.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.120
Leaving already?

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.200
Where are you off to?

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.560
Negotiations and vetting of King Group
have concluded.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.320
Can I borrow your phone for a minute?

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.160
Call me if you miss me.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.360
♫Countless memories♫

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.920
♫That cut you deep♫

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.080
♫I know there's no way♫

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.720
♫To make things right again,♫

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:15.480
♫'Cause I once believed I couldn't love at all♫

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.320
♫Never saw your worth until the fall♫

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.600
♫If I knew how to love you right,♫

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.600
♫I wouldn't live in regret tonight♫

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.440
♫I hope the stars would hear my plea,♫

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.480
♫I don't want this pain inside of me♫

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.320
♫I need you♫

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.240
♫Only you♫

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.720
♫There's one thing you should know♫

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.730
♫I'm sorry I once broke your heart♫

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:42.480
♫I'm sorry for making you cry♫
