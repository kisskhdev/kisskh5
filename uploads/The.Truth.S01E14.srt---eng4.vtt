00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:15.073
Master,

00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:18.112
you just let her walk away?

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.880
We don't have enough evidence right now

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:28.953
that proves Pang Xianglan is responsible
for Pang Xinghua's death.

00:01:40.472 --> 00:01:41.513
(I know)

00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:46.832
(you want to go further.)

00:02:20.232 --> 00:02:20.833
Master,

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:24.033
you're thinking
about Zhan Qiuman's case, right?

00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:29.672
What's the foundation of our casework?

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:32.833
Evidence.

00:02:34.752 --> 00:02:36.713
But with cases like Pang Xianglan's,

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:39.553
sometimes we need a bit of luck too.

00:02:41.313 --> 00:02:44.993
Like you said, physical evidence
at the scene speaks,

00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:48.833
and it depends on
whether we're qualified listeners.

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:53.113
Eat up.

00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:54.296
It's getting cold.

00:02:58.792 --> 00:02:59.632
What did you write?

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:02.472
Tell me what this is.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.192
I can't understand a word of it.

00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:06.912
You knew the crime scene
posed potential dangers,

00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:08.153
so why did you charge in?

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.273
Master, I'm a cop.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.192
I had to go in that situation.

00:03:16.192 --> 00:03:17.033
Listen, Ye Qian.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:18.033
You are a cop,

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:19.792
but you only have one life.

00:03:20.672 --> 00:03:21.713
I've told you repeatedly.

00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:22.713
Keep a level head.

00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:24.672
We solve cases using our brains,

00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:25.472
not guts.

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:26.993
Rewrite this report.

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.033
I'm so unphotogenic?

00:04:08.072 --> 00:04:09.153
Nice progress.

00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:11.993
When are you taking the next step?

00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:13.033
The next step?

00:04:14.912 --> 00:04:16.352
The next step is a showdown.

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:20.312
Pick a few nice photos later

00:04:20.312 --> 00:04:21.472
and send them to Mr. Bao.

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:24.432
It's time to show him our next move.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:33.232
Are you sure about Ye Qian?

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:37.232
Relax.

00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:38.472
Now that he tried 'Meat,'

00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:39.992
it's not so easy to quit.

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:42.112
He'll be begging us then.

00:05:52.193 --> 00:05:53.153
Working overtime?

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:55.953
Yeah, just organizing some files.

00:05:56.193 --> 00:05:57.552
Nothing to do at home anyway.

00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:59.273
Cops are human too.

00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:00.552
Do it tomorrow. Let's go.

00:06:01.513 --> 00:06:02.232
Where to?

00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:03.552
Haven't eaten, huh?

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:04.753
No.

00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:06.393
I'll buy you dinner.

00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:19.153
I-I left it on on purpose.

00:06:19.153 --> 00:06:20.352
I figured I'd come back later

00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:21.792
and do a bit more work.

00:06:23.432 --> 00:06:24.352
Workaholic, aren't you?

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:25.992
Let's go.

00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:38.312
One more dish coming up.

00:06:38.312 --> 00:06:38.833
Okay.

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:42.312
Qiming,

00:06:42.513 --> 00:06:43.513
how's your father doing?

00:06:44.073 --> 00:06:44.792
- He's fine.
- Here.

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:47.393
Let me know if anything comes up.

00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:48.753
We're all in the same complex.

00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:55.232
Are tables three and seven ready?

00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:02.033
Your eldest?

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:04.232
- When's the due date for the second?
- Jing.

00:07:04.352 --> 00:07:04.713
November.

00:07:04.713 --> 00:07:05.352
We're off.

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:06.273
That's soon.

00:07:06.273 --> 00:07:07.112
- Come again.
- Yes.

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:11.472
Just hoping
these next few months go smoothly,

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.352
without a hitch.

00:07:12.352 --> 00:07:13.593
No unexpected problems.

00:07:15.593 --> 00:07:16.713
How's your father?

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:18.472
He's alright.

00:07:19.232 --> 00:07:21.033
How about I come by and see him later?

00:07:21.713 --> 00:07:22.393
No need.

00:07:25.273 --> 00:07:27.833
You shouldn't shoulder everything alone.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:29.872
We're like family.

00:07:30.153 --> 00:07:31.593
Many hands make light work

00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:32.593
and someone to talk with.

00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:34.713
Alright.

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:41.232
Lei, we're heading off.

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:41.713
Okay.

00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:43.273
How was the food? Okay?

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:44.193
It was great.

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:45.633
It really was.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:46.472
Take care.

00:08:03.472 --> 00:08:06.033
Ms. Liu's dog
had another litter of pups.

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:08.312
Should we get another one?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.112
The shop's too busy.

00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:14.672
We can't care for it well.

00:08:15.753 --> 00:08:17.112
A puppy is a lifelong commitment.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.073
Like having another kid.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.513
Can't bear to outlive another.

00:08:30.672 --> 00:08:31.912
You didn't eat much.

00:08:32.873 --> 00:08:34.113
Let me make you some dumplings.

00:08:34.353 --> 00:08:35.033
Okay.

00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:02.273
Dumplings are ready.

00:09:09.592 --> 00:09:10.873
Let's eat together.

00:09:11.873 --> 00:09:13.233
I'm not hungry. You eat.

00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:22.113
You won't eat?

00:09:22.113 --> 00:09:23.312
No. You eat.

00:09:37.153 --> 00:09:39.273
Dad, look.

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:41.113
Who's come to see you?

00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:43.753
Over here.

00:09:43.753 --> 00:09:44.633
Sir.

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:51.633
My dad is always like this.

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:53.233
He ignores people.

00:09:54.233 --> 00:09:55.393
Take this.

00:09:55.712 --> 00:09:56.552
And this too.

00:09:58.912 --> 00:09:59.712
Sir,

00:10:01.072 --> 00:10:01.952
I was busy with work

00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:03.233
and couldn't visit you.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:05.273
I'm sorry.

00:10:17.113 --> 00:10:19.393
It's He Changchun's case.

00:10:22.153 --> 00:10:25.273
That day, Ye Qian and I went out to sea

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:28.153
and scattered his parents' ashes
into the sea.

00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:29.912
At that moment, I thought

00:10:30.473 --> 00:10:32.792
a person's life
is just a handful of dust.

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:35.273
Once it enters the sea,
it's gone forever.

00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:39.233
But the memories of them remain.

00:10:40.552 --> 00:10:42.312
In the hearts of those still living.

00:10:46.432 --> 00:10:47.792
It's time for your dad's meds?

00:10:48.753 --> 00:10:49.233
Yes.

00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:49.753
Let me.

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:54.832
Dad, it's time to take your medicine.

00:10:55.192 --> 00:10:56.952
Time for your medicine.

00:10:58.153 --> 00:11:00.273
Take this one first. Give me your hand.

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:04.552
Is it too hot?

00:11:08.273 --> 00:11:08.952
Slow down.

00:11:13.712 --> 00:11:14.513
Good.

00:11:14.712 --> 00:11:16.153
Let's take one more, okay?

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:19.113
How about this one?

00:11:20.952 --> 00:11:21.633
Here you go.

00:13:23.353 --> 00:13:23.993
What's up?

00:13:23.993 --> 00:13:25.192
I came to see you.

00:13:35.753 --> 00:13:37.312
You took all your stuff from the dorm.

00:13:37.312 --> 00:13:38.153
What's going on?

00:13:40.513 --> 00:13:41.192
It's nothing.

00:13:46.264 --> 00:13:47.952
Steamed buns, rice rolls,
and fried dough.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:48.753
What do you want?

00:13:53.473 --> 00:13:54.153
Thanks.

00:14:00.273 --> 00:14:01.473
When will you come back?

00:14:04.273 --> 00:14:05.473
Didn't you say I was annoying?

00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:12.113
I did find you annoying before.

00:14:12.993 --> 00:14:14.393
But now that you're suddenly gone,

00:14:14.393 --> 00:14:16.432
I woke up and saw your bed empty
in the morning,

00:14:16.432 --> 00:14:18.312
I felt really empty inside.

00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:20.312
Really, bro.

00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:21.153
You're my buddy.

00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:22.432
If anything happens, tell me.

00:14:22.432 --> 00:14:23.513
I'll definitely help you.

00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:26.592
What exactly do you want?

00:14:26.592 --> 00:14:27.753
Just say it.

00:14:28.432 --> 00:14:29.672
I came just to prove

00:14:29.672 --> 00:14:30.753
I consider you my buddy.

00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:35.592
Well, Little Zhao wants me
to take her to a volunteer event

00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:37.033
in a couple of days.

00:14:37.033 --> 00:14:38.513
I think it's a good opportunity.

00:14:38.592 --> 00:14:40.033
You've known her since childhood.

00:14:40.033 --> 00:14:41.432
And you know what she likes.

00:14:41.432 --> 00:14:42.552
So just let me know.

00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:46.353
Bro, what does she like?

00:14:50.273 --> 00:14:50.912
This.

00:14:51.736 --> 00:14:56.427
(No-Name Diner)

00:14:57.192 --> 00:14:57.873
Ziwu,

00:14:58.072 --> 00:14:58.993
wontons are ready soon.

00:14:58.993 --> 00:14:59.753
Wait a moment.

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.033
Your steamed buns.

00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:03.233
Thank you.

00:15:04.513 --> 00:15:05.072
Here's yours.

00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:06.792
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:15:08.192 --> 00:15:09.633
Be careful. Don't burn yourself.

00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:37.672
- Captain Leng.
- Busy?

00:15:38.353 --> 00:15:39.513
Let's have a drink tonight.

00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:40.513
Sure.

00:15:40.672 --> 00:15:41.393
I'm leaving.

00:15:41.393 --> 00:15:42.552
- You book the place.
- Okay.

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:00.993
Excuse me.

00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:03.592
Your wontons are ready.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.792
(No-Name Diner)

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:37.233
Here, little one. Eat up.

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:39.552
Jiao.

00:16:40.873 --> 00:16:41.513
Your apron.

00:16:44.312 --> 00:16:45.513
You ran off with it?

00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:46.153
Here.

00:16:48.153 --> 00:16:49.192
Right.

00:16:49.192 --> 00:16:50.993
Don't forget
to deliver lunch to Mr. Leng.

00:16:51.072 --> 00:16:52.153
No worries. I won't forget.

00:16:52.952 --> 00:16:54.072
- I'm off.
- Take care, Ziwu.

00:16:59.832 --> 00:17:00.473
Come on.

00:17:03.912 --> 00:17:04.673
Oh my.

00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:06.872
It's raining again.

00:17:06.872 --> 00:17:08.312
Alright. It's just a sun shower.

00:17:08.433 --> 00:17:09.193
Let's go.

00:17:38.072 --> 00:17:39.753
How's your search for a boyfriend going?

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:42.152
Don't ask.

00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:45.632
Such things can't be rushed.

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:50.513
Look, I knew Jing for a couple of years
before we started dating.

00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:53.552
You need to spend more time together

00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:55.112
to get to know each other well.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.152
Though we know each other well,

00:17:57.152 --> 00:17:58.832
he might not even be interested.

00:18:01.552 --> 00:18:02.872
You mean Captain Leng, right?

00:18:03.193 --> 00:18:03.792
No.

00:18:03.953 --> 00:18:06.392
- I knew it ages ago.
- Don't you dare say anything.

00:18:06.713 --> 00:18:08.993
Alright, I know nothing.

00:18:08.993 --> 00:18:10.033
Absolutely nothing.

00:18:10.433 --> 00:18:12.433
I think what you and Jing have
is really great.

00:18:13.112 --> 00:18:13.953
Don't be jealous.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.832
You'll find someone you truly know
and like too someday.

00:18:20.792 --> 00:18:21.433
Perfect timing.

00:18:21.953 --> 00:18:24.792
The precinct reported a homicide
at Building 11, Fuquan Community.

00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:27.792
We'll catch up.

00:18:28.072 --> 00:18:28.713
Let's go.

00:18:57.273 --> 00:18:58.392
We received a report saying

00:18:58.392 --> 00:18:59.592
two people were dead here.

00:18:59.753 --> 00:19:01.152
One of them was a pregnant woman.

00:19:01.392 --> 00:19:03.433
She was already dead when we arrived.

00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:05.513
The man was still breathing.

00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:07.072
He was sent to the hospital.

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:09.112
The nanny called it in.

00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:11.832
Okay, you go ahead.

00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:12.392
Okay.

00:19:21.152 --> 00:19:21.872
Jiang Yuzhen?

00:19:22.072 --> 00:19:22.632
Yes.

00:19:23.193 --> 00:19:24.552
Tell us what happened.

00:19:25.473 --> 00:19:28.753
Well, I bought groceries
this morning and came over.

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:32.233
I found Mr. Liao and Ms. Song
hadn't gotten up yet.

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:35.193
Ms. Song usually slept in,

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:38.352
while Mr. Liao
usually does morning exercises.

00:19:39.112 --> 00:19:42.792
I saw his shoes and bag were still here,

00:19:42.872 --> 00:19:44.152
so I figured he hadn't gone out.

00:19:44.673 --> 00:19:47.832
So I started doing chores
in the outer room.

00:19:48.953 --> 00:19:50.592
But when I nearly finished my work,

00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:51.953
they still hadn't gotten up.

00:19:52.872 --> 00:19:55.632
I started to worry.

00:19:56.072 --> 00:19:56.953
I knocked on the door.

00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:00.792
No response. No sound at all.

00:20:01.552 --> 00:20:02.713
Opening the door, I went in.

00:20:03.913 --> 00:20:05.993
Both of them looked off.

00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:07.753
I went closer to check,

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:10.312
and neither was breathing.

00:20:10.592 --> 00:20:11.993
So I called the police right away.

00:20:13.673 --> 00:20:16.072
Do you usually come at this time?

00:20:16.312 --> 00:20:18.392
No, I'm a live-in nanny.

00:20:18.392 --> 00:20:19.993
I usually live here.

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:22.913
Yesterday Ms. Song said
it was her birthday,

00:20:22.913 --> 00:20:25.273
and she wanted to have some alone time
with Mr. Liao.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.753
She gave me the day off, so I went home.

00:20:28.392 --> 00:20:30.792
What time did you leave yesterday?

00:20:32.312 --> 00:20:33.033
7 PM.

00:20:33.473 --> 00:20:35.953
I left after making dinner.

00:20:37.872 --> 00:20:39.033
Did you touch anything?

00:20:41.072 --> 00:20:41.792
No.

00:20:41.872 --> 00:20:44.352
I rarely go into their bedroom.

00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.352
When you arrived today,

00:20:47.753 --> 00:20:49.072
did you notice anything unusual?

00:20:50.753 --> 00:20:51.433
No.

00:20:53.392 --> 00:20:57.152
How would you describe their marriage?

00:21:00.033 --> 00:21:01.592
They weren't married.

00:21:02.273 --> 00:21:04.152
Mr. Liao hadn't gotten a divorce yet.

00:21:10.753 --> 00:21:12.033
I'm Liao Guangyong's family.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.392
You're Liao Guangyong's family?

00:21:13.392 --> 00:21:14.193
Yes.

00:21:14.913 --> 00:21:15.953
I'm his wife.

00:21:16.072 --> 00:21:17.312
We're Fuquan Road Police.

00:21:17.312 --> 00:21:18.433
Your husband is in surgery.

00:21:18.913 --> 00:21:19.753
What happened to him?

00:21:19.753 --> 00:21:21.273
The doctor will explain shortly.

00:21:22.832 --> 00:21:24.193
Is Liao Guangyong's family here?

00:21:25.072 --> 00:21:25.753
Yes, here.

00:21:25.913 --> 00:21:26.872
How is he, Doctor?

00:21:27.033 --> 00:21:28.233
He's stable for now

00:21:28.233 --> 00:21:29.513
but not out of the woods yet.

00:21:29.513 --> 00:21:30.673
Prepare yourself.

00:21:30.673 --> 00:21:32.993
Let's get him admitted.
He'll be transferred soon.

00:21:39.312 --> 00:21:42.273
You said earlier
you're Fuquan Road Police?

00:21:43.913 --> 00:21:45.193
What happened to my husband?

00:21:45.273 --> 00:21:46.033
He was poisoned.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:50.233
What about Song Ying?

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:50.953
She's dead.

00:22:08.033 --> 00:22:10.193
Nobody passwords their laptops
these days?

00:22:10.473 --> 00:22:12.033
I don't use passwords at home.

00:22:17.713 --> 00:22:18.832
A suicide note?

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:22.572
(Suicide Note)

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.824
(Song Ying)

00:22:34.513 --> 00:22:38.473
Given what you knew, did Song Ying
seem like someone who'd commit suicide?

00:22:38.832 --> 00:22:40.872
I can't say for sure.

00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:43.233
Were there conflicts between them?

00:22:43.632 --> 00:22:44.592
Conflicts?

00:22:45.273 --> 00:22:48.033
Well, Ms. Song was pregnant
with Mr. Liao's child,

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.632
but Mr. Liao wouldn't get a divorce.

00:22:49.632 --> 00:22:52.152
She urged him to divorce and marry her.
That was the main issue.

00:22:52.753 --> 00:22:56.072
Officer, I've told you
everything I know.

00:22:56.273 --> 00:22:58.473
If there's nothing else,
I need to go home.

00:23:15.552 --> 00:23:16.233
Ms. Miao.

00:23:19.312 --> 00:23:20.112
Got it.

00:23:25.592 --> 00:23:28.673
It's Mr. Liao's wife.

00:23:31.433 --> 00:23:33.193
You know Liao Guangyong's wife too?

00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:38.033
I used to work as a nanny
for their family.

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:40.072
I only came here
in the last couple of years.

00:23:45.352 --> 00:23:46.433
The victim, Liao Guangyong,

00:23:46.433 --> 00:23:47.713
male, 61 years old.

00:23:47.832 --> 00:23:49.812
Legal representative
of Yongguang Supermarket,

00:23:49.812 --> 00:23:50.872
a well-known local chain.

00:23:51.352 --> 00:23:52.632
The deceased, Song Ying, female,

00:23:52.632 --> 00:23:54.152
30 years old, a local.

00:23:54.424 --> 00:23:55.392
With a master's degree,

00:23:55.392 --> 00:23:57.233
she was Liao Guangyong's secretary
for a while.

00:23:57.233 --> 00:23:59.953
She later resigned and moved
into Building 11, Fuquan Community.

00:24:00.713 --> 00:24:03.792
The forensic unit found
this suicide note on Song Ying's laptop.

00:24:03.993 --> 00:24:08.832
It mentions her long dissatisfaction
with Liao Guangyong's refusal to marry.

00:24:09.112 --> 00:24:10.713
Combined with pregnancy mood swings,

00:24:10.713 --> 00:24:12.832
she developed
intense feelings of pessimism.

00:24:13.513 --> 00:24:15.513
So she prepared poison in advance,

00:24:15.792 --> 00:24:18.632
poisoned Liao Guangyong on her birthday,
and then committed suicide.

00:24:19.713 --> 00:24:23.193
Can we confirm that this suicide note
was written by Song Ying herself?

00:24:23.872 --> 00:24:25.273
We can't confirm that yet.

00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:29.673
The note was indeed found
on her own laptop.

00:24:29.872 --> 00:24:31.352
But since her laptop had no password,

00:24:31.352 --> 00:24:33.953
it's uncertain if someone else
who accessed her laptop did it.

00:24:34.433 --> 00:24:36.913
Toxins were confirmed
in Song Ying's body.

00:24:38.753 --> 00:24:42.832
The cup and thermos on the nightstand
contained the same toxic agent.

00:24:43.352 --> 00:24:46.592
The estimated time of death
is around midnight last night.

00:24:47.233 --> 00:24:50.433
Fuquan Community's surveillance system
is quite comprehensive.

00:24:50.488 --> 00:24:52.312
Cameras are at the entrance
and in elevators.

00:24:52.753 --> 00:24:55.993
So far, it matches
the nanny's description.

00:24:56.792 --> 00:24:58.033
Based on the building layout,

00:24:58.473 --> 00:25:01.872
only Liao Guangyong and Song Ying
are on this floor of Building 11.

00:25:03.792 --> 00:25:07.713
The nanny left via the elevator
at 7 PM yesterday.

00:25:07.913 --> 00:25:10.392
She reappeared at 8 AM this morning.

00:25:16.033 --> 00:25:19.193
Since there are no cameras
in this floor's hallway,

00:25:19.193 --> 00:25:21.792
we can't rule out the possibility
that someone entered

00:25:21.792 --> 00:25:26.273
via the fire escape stairwell,
which also lacks surveillance.

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:28.832
The entry door is intact.

00:25:28.832 --> 00:25:31.832
No signs of forced entry or struggle
were found at the scene.

00:25:31.832 --> 00:25:34.352
Inside, only the fingerprints
of Liao Guangyong,

00:25:34.352 --> 00:25:36.872
Song Ying, and the nanny were found.

00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:39.312
No valuable leads were found.

00:25:39.513 --> 00:25:42.352
Both victims' IDs, wallets,

00:25:42.352 --> 00:25:43.832
and phones were inside the apartment.

00:25:43.832 --> 00:25:45.792
A safe was also found
in the master bedroom,

00:25:45.993 --> 00:25:47.352
with no signs of tampering.

00:25:49.473 --> 00:25:51.433
How's Liao Guangyong now?

00:25:52.273 --> 00:25:53.993
He's not out of the woods yet.

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:55.273
He may not wake up.

00:25:57.673 --> 00:26:00.592
From 7 PM last night
to 8 AM this morning,

00:26:01.433 --> 00:26:02.433
where were you?

00:26:04.072 --> 00:26:05.352
At Jiulong Hot Springs.

00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:08.152
I had a get-together with some friends.

00:26:10.193 --> 00:26:13.072
I went there yesterday.

00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:14.592
If you hadn't called,

00:26:15.072 --> 00:26:16.513
I wouldn't be back until tomorrow.

00:26:19.513 --> 00:26:21.352
About Liao Guangyong and Song Ying...

00:26:21.352 --> 00:26:22.232
Well,

00:26:23.768 --> 00:26:29.433
that place was bought when Liao and I
celebrated our crystal anniversary.

00:26:31.233 --> 00:26:32.713
I lived there for several years.

00:26:35.312 --> 00:26:36.993
Did Liao Guangyong
mention divorce to you?

00:26:39.352 --> 00:26:40.072
He did.

00:26:42.913 --> 00:26:45.753
But that was
about five or six years ago.

00:26:47.993 --> 00:26:51.473
I felt that
since there was no love left,

00:26:54.993 --> 00:26:56.753
I was willing to divorce.

00:26:57.433 --> 00:27:03.033
But the family assets and the company
had to be split equally.

00:27:03.673 --> 00:27:05.033
After all, he and I started

00:27:05.552 --> 00:27:11.193
from scratch and had built it together
since we were young.

00:27:12.872 --> 00:27:16.433
But later,
he never brought up divorce again.

00:27:19.913 --> 00:27:21.953
Did you know Song Ying was pregnant?

00:27:28.592 --> 00:27:29.312
Yes, I knew.

00:27:30.953 --> 00:27:32.152
When did you find out?

00:27:36.433 --> 00:27:38.273
She came to me with the report,

00:27:39.352 --> 00:27:42.312
asking me to step aside for her and Liao

00:27:42.552 --> 00:27:43.993
to give their child a home.

00:27:44.832 --> 00:27:46.273
I told her the same thing:

00:27:47.352 --> 00:27:49.273
I'll divorce anytime,

00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:52.993
as long as Liao agrees to my terms.

00:27:58.513 --> 00:28:00.193
Do you believe Song Ying did it?

00:28:04.953 --> 00:28:05.993
Song Ying?

00:28:14.233 --> 00:28:15.233
I don't know.

00:28:20.312 --> 00:28:22.713
Did Liao Guangyong offend anyone else?

00:28:26.592 --> 00:28:28.233
After so many years in business,

00:28:28.713 --> 00:28:30.993
it's impossible to say
we haven't offended anyone.

00:28:32.033 --> 00:28:34.033
But deep hatred?

00:28:34.592 --> 00:28:34.993
Mom.

00:28:34.993 --> 00:28:36.033
Not to that extent.

00:28:36.913 --> 00:28:37.273
Mom.

00:28:37.273 --> 00:28:37.872
Hua.

00:28:39.352 --> 00:28:40.312
Take it easy, Mom.

00:28:40.592 --> 00:28:41.713
How's Dad?

00:28:43.552 --> 00:28:44.552
Liao Guangyong's son?

00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:46.673
Yes, and you are?

00:28:47.152 --> 00:28:48.152
I'm with the city CID.

00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:50.592
Hello, I'm Liao Huasheng.

00:28:50.993 --> 00:28:53.352
I'm with the Beicheng District
Urban Management.

00:28:54.552 --> 00:28:57.193
Could you tell me
what exactly happened to my dad?

00:28:58.513 --> 00:28:59.513
I'll tell you.

00:28:59.632 --> 00:29:01.352
Okay, take it slow.

00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:04.152
What's wrong?

00:29:22.033 --> 00:29:22.673
Zhao,

00:29:22.872 --> 00:29:25.473
did you change the elderly patient
in Bed 17 just now?

00:29:27.072 --> 00:29:28.513
Changing the burial clothes

00:29:29.152 --> 00:29:31.233
calls for an extra red packet, you know.

00:29:31.592 --> 00:29:32.993
You should ask them for it.

00:29:33.233 --> 00:29:35.273
It's fine. It was no trouble.

00:29:38.312 --> 00:29:39.112
I'm exhausted.

00:29:40.033 --> 00:29:41.673
What should we eat?

00:29:41.872 --> 00:29:43.832
Anything works. Zhao, will you come?

00:29:44.552 --> 00:29:45.392
You go ahead.

00:30:00.193 --> 00:30:00.993
Sorry.

00:30:02.112 --> 00:30:02.753
My apologies.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:54.744
(Miss Yang)

00:31:11.672 --> 00:31:16.440
(Peninsula Ocean International)

00:33:24.792 --> 00:33:26.792
(Yunxi Police Department)
The case is still under investigation.

00:33:27.312 --> 00:33:30.312
(Yunxi Police)
We hope you two can assist us

00:33:30.753 --> 00:33:32.473
to uncover the truth quickly.

00:33:33.193 --> 00:33:34.033
The truth?

00:33:34.832 --> 00:33:38.552
The truth is my daughter
was the other woman who wrecked a home.

00:33:38.753 --> 00:33:40.312
She died pregnant.

00:33:40.513 --> 00:33:41.993
And you claim she's a murder suspect?

00:33:42.433 --> 00:33:43.953
Just suspicion. No charges filed.

00:33:44.513 --> 00:33:45.753
We're still investigating.

00:33:46.072 --> 00:33:48.753
My daughter made a moral mistake.

00:33:49.673 --> 00:33:51.033
But she could never kill anyone.

00:33:51.433 --> 00:33:52.953
And she had no reason to kill herself.

00:33:55.792 --> 00:33:57.312
On her birthday afternoon,

00:33:57.872 --> 00:34:00.552
she video-called me for over an hour.

00:34:01.872 --> 00:34:02.832
She told me

00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:04.673
that Liao Guangyong
finally agreed to divorce.

00:34:06.112 --> 00:34:07.673
This is the photo she sent me.

00:34:07.993 --> 00:34:08.793
Look.

00:34:10.513 --> 00:34:11.393
She called you?

00:34:11.393 --> 00:34:12.433
Why didn't you tell me?

00:34:14.313 --> 00:34:15.993
What good would telling you do?

00:34:16.712 --> 00:34:18.313
We've said our piece and scolded her.

00:34:19.072 --> 00:34:20.953
We even threatened to cut ties with her.

00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:24.953
Wasn't she still dead set
on being with that Liao guy?

00:34:26.353 --> 00:34:29.833
After all these years,
and she was pregnant.

00:34:30.913 --> 00:34:34.112
Getting married was better
than being nameless forever.

00:34:37.473 --> 00:34:38.752
My daughter was very stubborn.

00:34:39.192 --> 00:34:41.112
She endured all these years.

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.473
She wouldn't commit suicide.

00:34:43.552 --> 00:34:45.072
There must be something wrong.

00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:47.913
You must get to the bottom of this.

00:34:49.913 --> 00:34:52.592
When you spoke with Song Ying
on the phone,

00:34:53.152 --> 00:34:54.112
was she at home?

00:34:55.473 --> 00:34:56.672
Home?

00:34:57.473 --> 00:35:00.913
She was squatting
in his legal wife's place.

00:35:01.672 --> 00:35:05.793
My silly daughter was completely
manipulated by that Liao guy.

00:35:12.353 --> 00:35:16.712
That huge diamond ring
was from Liao Guangyong, right?

00:35:18.993 --> 00:35:21.513
Did Liao Guangyong give Song Ying
other expensive gifts?

00:35:21.913 --> 00:35:25.272
There should've been a jade bracelet
and some gold jewelry.

00:35:25.993 --> 00:35:27.152
Don't misunderstand.

00:35:27.913 --> 00:35:30.473
She didn't actually care
about material things.

00:35:30.953 --> 00:35:32.072
She rarely wore them.

00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:34.913
They were all kept in her home safe.

00:35:46.752 --> 00:35:47.552
Wrong combination.

00:35:49.192 --> 00:35:50.632
It used to be this combination.

00:35:51.272 --> 00:35:52.913
I don't know whether it was changed.

00:35:55.712 --> 00:35:58.752
Safes like this always have spare keys.

00:35:59.552 --> 00:36:02.112
Where would Liao Guangyong
hide that key?

00:36:12.793 --> 00:36:14.393
Try that spot up there.

00:36:31.072 --> 00:36:32.513
He hasn't changed that habit.

00:36:33.192 --> 00:36:34.592
You know him quite well.

00:37:20.752 --> 00:37:21.793
It's Liao's habit

00:37:23.033 --> 00:37:25.072
to always keep some cash at home.

00:37:25.473 --> 00:37:26.433
Never too much.

00:37:26.913 --> 00:37:29.632
Usually around 100,000 RMB
and 100,000 USD.

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.592
Is this watch his?

00:37:40.913 --> 00:37:42.913
Seems he finally agreed.

00:37:45.913 --> 00:37:48.353
The watch is his.
He bought it abroad years ago.

00:38:04.913 --> 00:38:07.353
How much is that watch worth?

00:38:09.752 --> 00:38:11.353
Given the brand and style,

00:38:11.913 --> 00:38:13.913
at least 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

00:38:15.433 --> 00:38:16.192
Master,

00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:18.873
none of the watch, the jade bracelet,

00:38:19.793 --> 00:38:23.232
and the cash
Liao Guangyong's wife mentioned

00:38:23.232 --> 00:38:24.752
were in the safe.

00:38:25.313 --> 00:38:29.393
I suspect this case
involves property theft.

00:38:31.033 --> 00:38:33.353
Both the key and safe
were tampered with.

00:38:33.873 --> 00:38:35.033
Hard to lift prints.

00:38:35.433 --> 00:38:38.552
But we might find something
at the key's hiding spot.

00:38:38.793 --> 00:38:39.873
Tell Long.

00:38:40.072 --> 00:38:40.913
Have him come over.

00:38:40.913 --> 00:38:42.592
See if he can find crucial evidence.

00:38:51.433 --> 00:38:52.833
Any update on Jiang Yuzhen?

00:38:55.712 --> 00:38:56.752
Investigate it again.

00:38:57.993 --> 00:38:59.232
Bring her in too. Yes.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.110
(Dan Qing: If it's all about hate)

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.496
(and revenge, would you still see me?)

00:39:27.712 --> 00:39:28.552
No reply yet?

00:39:32.592 --> 00:39:33.913
Maybe you were too direct

00:39:34.752 --> 00:39:35.752
and scared him.

00:39:39.232 --> 00:39:40.313
If that scared him,

00:39:41.232 --> 00:39:42.953
how should we play this next?

00:39:45.913 --> 00:39:48.632
Who knows what tricks Bao Hei will pull?

00:39:52.232 --> 00:39:52.913
Well,

00:39:54.433 --> 00:39:57.632
will he really trust us?

00:39:58.953 --> 00:40:00.112
He has no choice.

00:40:02.393 --> 00:40:04.913
If not, we'll add more incentive.

00:40:11.393 --> 00:40:12.833
How did you figure that out?

00:40:17.088 --> 00:40:20.504
(I would.)

00:40:28.313 --> 00:40:31.313
Chief Xu has wanted to give you leave

00:40:32.272 --> 00:40:35.033
so you can focus
on the provincial assignment.

00:40:35.873 --> 00:40:36.833
Do you need it?

00:40:38.712 --> 00:40:39.353
Master,

00:40:39.592 --> 00:40:41.752
I've spoken with the leader
of the Narcotics Division.

00:40:41.752 --> 00:40:43.232
Let's proceed as usual.

00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:44.752
Okay.

00:40:46.592 --> 00:40:50.552
Report anything you're unsure about

00:40:50.712 --> 00:40:52.433
and let the organization decide.

00:40:53.672 --> 00:40:56.513
Don't forget you're a cop.

00:41:03.833 --> 00:41:05.232
Is Jiang Yuzhen at home?

00:41:07.513 --> 00:41:08.313
Where did she go?

00:41:12.072 --> 00:41:13.953
Got it. Okay.

00:41:15.232 --> 00:41:16.232
Change of plan.

00:41:16.232 --> 00:41:18.393
Let's go directly to the city hospital.

00:41:19.072 --> 00:41:19.632
Got it.

00:41:19.632 --> 00:41:20.393
Drive faster.

00:41:23.793 --> 00:41:24.752
Knife attack!

00:41:29.152 --> 00:41:30.632
Run! Someone's stabbing people!

00:41:35.592 --> 00:41:36.473
What's wrong?

00:41:36.913 --> 00:41:37.513
Knife attack!

00:41:37.672 --> 00:41:38.393
Which room?

00:41:38.393 --> 00:41:39.192
The ICU.

00:41:40.513 --> 00:41:41.833
- Police!
- Make way! Run!

00:41:42.272 --> 00:41:43.033
Hurry up!

00:41:48.232 --> 00:41:49.072
Drop the knife!

00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:50.313
Drop it!

00:41:57.833 --> 00:41:58.712
Why did you kill him?

00:41:59.152 --> 00:41:59.953
He's finally dead.

00:42:00.993 --> 00:42:02.072
He's finally dead.

00:42:02.433 --> 00:42:03.993
Mom got revenge for you.

00:42:04.632 --> 00:42:05.913
I got revenge for you.

00:42:20.513 --> 00:42:21.152
Move.
