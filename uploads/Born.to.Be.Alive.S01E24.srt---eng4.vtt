[Born to Be Alive]

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.229
[Episode 24]

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.640
Regarding the previous questions

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.750
about the nature
of the Mountain Patrol's work,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.550
I need to reflect on my mistakes.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.289
I didn't expect that,

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.870
driven by profit,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.450
these people

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.670
would be so lawless.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.130
I owe He an apology.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.419
I didn't look after him well.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.330
There is a pension.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.690
Collect it from Li.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.329
It's not much.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.770
Just a token of the county's appreciation.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.810
Nine pairs of cotton shoes.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.170
Eleven pairs of gloves.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.870
I think,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.040
there's also a quilt.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.360
Wait.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.150
The numbers don't match here.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.730
Some are crossed out,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.010
and some aren't.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.600
What on earth was he recording?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.350
It's a mess.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.190
Such simple accounts,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.680
yet he could mess them up.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.410
This is the letter

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.230
you brought me before he left.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.000
Wangmu,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.300
going into the mountains this time,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.020
I might be gone for a long time.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.760
The debts I owed your shop before,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.000
I made a mess of them.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.270
I'll let you in on a secret.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.160
Some

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.920
were secretly crossed them out

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.380
to save the team money.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.020
This is a record

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.610
I kept privately.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.980
How much was owed each time,

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.610
I've listed it all clearly.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.360
Wait for me to come back.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.310
We'll clear this up face to face.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.960
Make sure you don't tell

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.030
Captain and Bai Ju,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.190
or I'll become a traitor.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.900
Wangmu,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.310
wait for me.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.840
The letter from him,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.010
why is it...

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.240
I understand.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.910
Actually,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.760
I understand his feelings.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600
Accounts that can never be cleared.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.390
So that

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.240
he could always come back here.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.390
We could always meet again.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.370
But why did he

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.159
never dare to say it?

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.240
I understand him.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.520
But I also

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.530
never dared to say it.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.920
Because we always thought

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.820
there would be a next time.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.830
A next time

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.270
to meet again.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.650
According to our tradition,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.390
now that he's gone,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.670
everything belonging to him

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.060
should not be kept.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.990
But this account book,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.300
I want to keep it.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.460
What he owes me,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.450
what I owe him.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.130
I want to keep it forever.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.890
We're leaving now.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.020
Bai Ji's cooking is still the best.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.480
I thought,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.810
I'd never get to eat it again.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.340
Then let's come here often.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.810
Yan,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.950
what are you doing?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.600
I said I wouldn't take your money.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.620
You left it on the counter and ran.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.080
Take it.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.810
You're running a business.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.010
If you don't take money,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.480
we'll be too embarrassed

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.370
to come back.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.190
You only had three bowls of noodles.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.640
You shouldn't give this much.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.130
Wait.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.640
Let me get you change.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.380
No need.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.659
Maybe next time.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.860
Hurry go inside
and take care of the customers.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.860
I'm going to work.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.370
Come to my house after work.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.640
My sister sent you

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:52.190
cosmetics from Guangzhou.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.900
Got it.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.080
See you after work.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.940
Stop laughing. Let's go.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.930
Here.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.110
Beef with potatoes.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.680
Here.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.310
Han,

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.020
don't just take their wine.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.660
Captain, I want to drink this.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.340
It's fine.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.200
Drink whatever you want.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.890
Drink this.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.170
Restaurant Kunlun.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.870
Good.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.580
Mr. Bai,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.130
this name

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.540
is a bit too grand.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.500
Is it?

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.630
Yes, it is.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.090
Not really.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.500
County Mayor Duo,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.510
you old comrades

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.840
always say that phrase.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.160
How does it go again?

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.290
"There will be bread.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.690
There will be milk.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.600
There will be everything."

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.060
I believe sooner or later,

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:39.950
it will become

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.370
a real Restaurant Kunlun.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.570
Then let me congratulate Mr. Bai first.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:44.730
Congratulations.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.510
Bai Ji,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.830
don't get too excited.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.010
He's not doing it for you.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.080
He's just craving alcohol.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.770
He's been thinking about this meal
for days.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.830
Nonsense.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.190
It's fine.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.240
Haven't... Haven't you been thinking too?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.610
It's fine.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.250
Haven't you all been thinking?

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.650
Pour it for me. Fill it up.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:00.420
Ju,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.560
help me take care of them.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.390
I have two more dishes coming right up.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.020
Don't worry.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.880
Go back to work.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.320
Bai Ji is right.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.690
Pastures in the wilderness

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.520
can become a county town.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.100
Tattered tents can become a hospital.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.590
Four or five tables and chairs

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.190
can become a restaurant.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.450
Our Mountain Patrol

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.100
will also witness

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.000
Bolamula

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.880
becoming a nature reserve.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.400
To He Qingyuan.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.830
For Dongzhiba.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.800
For Zhang Yang.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.270
For the Mountain Patrol.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.770
For Bolamula.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.430
Can I add one more?

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.230
Add what?

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.080
For permanent positions.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.130
That's all you ever think about.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.100
Come on.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.840
For permanent positions. Come on.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.180
Come on.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.980
Cheers to permanent positions.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.770
How are you calculating this?

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.080
Sixteen plus seven point five,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.280
what does that equal?

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.940
The editor-in-chief of our newspaper

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.070
contacted me today.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.360
He said the shutting down

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.530
of the Qima'er Gold Mine

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.730
has had a huge impact.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.780
Many newspapers have reached out to us,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.380
wanting to repost our story.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.660
Some from outside the province,

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.990
even some from Beijing.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.400
Captain.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.910
For us,

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.270
this is an opportunity.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.880
Are you suggesting

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.290
we publish another report?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.890
No.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.330
Repeating myself would make me

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.660
look like an amateur.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.120
You kid.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.960
You only seem to be arrogant

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.800
in front of me.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.590
In front of a certain comrade,

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.650
you wouldn't dare.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.120
Are you listening or not?

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.780
Are you going to tell me or not?

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.470
I am.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.700
I've prepared a two-pronged approach.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.650
Bring them in,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.740
and send the message out.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.500
Explain.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.010
I think

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.790
promoting environmental awareness

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.470
needs a long process.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.410
But right now,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.060
as for the importance
of the Mountain Patrol's work,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.990
people who haven't been through it

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.080
find it hard to immediately empathize.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.940
I want to invite

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.520
domestic and provincial media

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.500
who are interested to know more

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.300
to visit Mazhi

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.250
and hold a press conference here.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.640
Let them have a look.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.860
Look at your working environment

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.190
and your achievements.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.470
See what the real Bolamula

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.330
is like.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.430
There is

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.660
nothing more persuasive

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.140
than bloody facts

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.330
and the price paid.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.040
Through this,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.440
we can let more people see,

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.230
hear,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.960
and truly understand

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.180
the importance of establishing

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.180
a nature reserve.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.200
Great idea.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.870
Relying solely on our own strength

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.330
is just a drop in the ocean.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.840
The establishment of the nature reserve

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.440
can't be delayed any longer.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.820
I will definitely

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.620
finish the report on the reserve

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.080
before the press conference is held.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.590
Okay.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.470
What about getting the word out?

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.600
Let me have a drink first.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.050
What about getting the word out?

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.640
How's that?

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.890
I'm quite good, right?

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.800
Bai Ju.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.140
Looking for a beating again?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.700
No, no, not at all.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.560
I'll continue.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.240
Getting the word out.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.570
We must scientifically
analyze the situation,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.370
precisely grasp the key points,

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.050
and fully focus on economic operations

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.500
and tasks such as project construction.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.240
The establishment of the development zone
is proceeding in an orderly manner.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.000
In summary,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.600
the economic topic

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.560
is still

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.120
the priority

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.580
among the upcoming operations.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.220
Here,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.290
I extend a sincere invitation

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.520
to enterprises nationwide

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.590
and people from all walks of life.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.740
We welcome mining enterprises

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.580
to participate in cooperative development.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.200
We sincerely invite research institutions

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.960
to overcome the technical difficulties

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.000
of mining in the plateau permafrost areas.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.510
We earnestly request our friends
in the media

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.370
to objectively record

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.370
the course of western development.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.910
Sorry, County Mayor.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.920
My car broke down on the way.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:58.990
Sorry about that.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.580
I'm late.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.080
Comrades of the press,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.280
let me introduce him.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.060
This is

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.770
the Mazhi County Party
Standing Committee member,

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.870
Deputy County Mayor,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.880
General Manager of

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.820
Mazhi Economic Development Company,

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.440
and Bolamula Mountain Patrol's

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.300
person in charge,

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.230
Comrade Duojie.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.410
Sit down.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.790
Everyone, please sit.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:26.940
Sorry, County Mayor.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.530
I interrupted you.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.010
No.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.070
Please continue.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.360
I've pretty much covered

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.760
the economic situation.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.390
Comrades of the press,

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.540
to ensure the safety

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.340
of people's lives and property,

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.240
the county has

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.390
specifically organized

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.960
a focused investigation

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.660
targeting the Bolamula region's

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.790
illegal mining

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.900
and poaching activities.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.550
Now, let's invite

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.510
this operation's

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.410
main person in charge,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.410
Comrade Duojie,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.480
to introduce

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.760
the specific details.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.180
Before introducing this operation,

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.790
I'd like to take a moment

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.740
to tell you

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.830
how our team

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.690
came to be.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.110
As early as three years ago,

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.460
we realized that

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.110
Mazhi, as a major animal husbandry county,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.450
will never transform

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.390
by just staring at the rears

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.650
of cows and sheep.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.210
Back then,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.150
County Mayor Lin Lin decided

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.750
to shift our focus

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.620
to resource development,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.720
especially

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.440
the mineral resources

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.440
in the Bolamula Uninhabited Zone.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.100
To benefit Mazhi

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.430
and help its people

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.370
live prosperous lives.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.390
Later, proposed by
the County Party Committee

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.110
and decided by city leaders,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.120
we established

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.550
the Mazhi Economic Development Company.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.150
We called it a company,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.160
but at first,

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.110
there were only eight or nine of us.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.850
Four were even illiterate.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.250
To be honest,

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.700
in the beginning,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.190
we didn't consider

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.800
environmental protection.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.040
We just focused on the present,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.490
hoping to find mineable deposits

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.870
in Bolamula.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.800
But unexpectedly,

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.010
my first trip deep into

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:26.850
Bolamula

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.390
completely overturned

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:30.990
what I had imagined.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.110
As we drove in,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.940
there were tire tracks everywhere.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.450
They looked like

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.010
unhealable wounds.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.500
Along the way, we saw

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.810
hundreds of

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.500
Tibetan antelope skeletons.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.710
They had all been skinned,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.320
left bloody and mangled.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.230
These silent bones

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.400
told me

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.060
that in Bolamula,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.570
an endless slaughter

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.550
is taking place.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.820
How many people

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.750
did you call?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.440
I thought I printed too many,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.410
but we ran out before

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:05.810
half of them got one.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.360
I tell you,

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.080
I only made four or five calls.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.420
I didn't expect so many people.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.940
It seems everyone

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.480
is quite passionate

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.400
about our environmental cause,

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.970
right?

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.010
Did you count the people?

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.070
Go print some more.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.670
There's...

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.390
You go count them.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.060
Go on.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.270
No need to count.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.090
Then we don't need to worry

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.020
about saving paper for the county.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.200
Print as many as possible.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.580
Print as many as you can.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.470
Anyway, when they go back,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.330
they'll help us distribute them.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.290
Easier said than done.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.560
The lady running the photocopier

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.760
is tough to deal with.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.720
Bai Ju.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.220
Does that lady need a photo for work?

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:50.920
Let's go.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.670
I'll take a couple of shots of her.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.200
Let's go.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:53.960
Will that work?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.820
Of course.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.390
It's no trouble at all.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:55.760
Hurry up then.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.560
Hurry! Hurry!

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.290
So far,

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.020
in protecting Bolamula,

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:04.720
fighting poaching

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.240
and illegal mining,

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:09.599
three young men

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.280
have sacrificed their lives.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440
As the Captain,

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.880
I have failed these children.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.660
Many people may not understand

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.550
what we do.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.220
No money,

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.160
no permanent positions,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.630
no wages for six months,

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.170
failure after failure,

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.720
and even risking our lives.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.040
But I firmly believe

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.040
that blood will not be shed in vain.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.680
It is precisely those many failures,

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.610
added together,

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:51.980
that allow me today

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.380
to have this opportunity

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.320
to stand here

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.700
and tell you about Bolamula,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.130
and through you,

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.720
let more people know

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.930
about what this land has suffered.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.620
Some things

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.300
cannot be finished in one or two tries.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.250
But someone has to be

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.590
the first one to do it.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:20.770
Our Mountain Patrol

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:21.720
is willing to be

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.700
that first one.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200
And in the future,

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.850
we will continue

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.140
to persevere.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.740
County Mayor!

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.520
County Mayor!

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.960
County Mayor! County Mayor!

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.720
County Mayor!

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.290
County Mayor!

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:40.570
County Mayor!

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.220
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.620
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.850
Hello, Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.070
I would like to ask you,

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.790
regarding Bolamula's

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.240
conservation work,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.140
what are your

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.400
specific plans going forward?

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:49.770
I'm sorry,

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.970
I'm a little nervous.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.470
To completely eliminate

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.140
poaching

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.210
and illegal mining,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.180
and to protect

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.610
the wildlife

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.250
and mineral resources

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.530
permanently,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.170
I think the urgent priority

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.810
is to promote the establishment

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.480
national nature reserve

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.210
and set up an ecological protection base.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.140
When that happens,

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.060
our Mountain Patrol members

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.630
can become the first batch of employees.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.700
They are very experienced,

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.470
and they know Bolamula well.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.760
For them personally,

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.110
their lives can also have

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.240
basic security.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.380
Close the door.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.850
The establishment of the nature reserve

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.350
hasn't been clarified in the meeting,

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.090
nor has Secretary Chen approved it.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:06.910
How could you,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.660
announce it to the public

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.060
at the press conference?

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.030
I brought this matter up

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.460
to the county long ago.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.180
But the leadership team

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.840
hasn't reached a resolution.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.140
Your actions

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.210
have already drawn

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.520
so much public attention.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.410
We should seize this momentum

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.010
to bring in qualified

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.770
and capable mining companies.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.180
Once the development zone is on track,

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.060
all of

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:31.640
your previous concerns

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.010
will simply cease to exist.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:33.770
You do know that

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.510
once the nature reserve

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.200
is established,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.930
it means a complete mining ban.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.870
Isn't that

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.910
a waste of

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.500
national resources?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:40.180
Lin.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.630
We've argued about this issue

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.870
so many times.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.290
Over the years,

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.110
various forms of

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.960
poaching and illegal mining

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.000
have seriously damaged

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.860
Bolamula's ecological balance.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.040
For many areas to recover,

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.160
it will take at least decades,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.600
or even centuries.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.370
As for gold mines,

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.100
they exist elsewhere in China.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.200
But the plateau's rare species

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.920
can survive only here.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.250
You're being irrational.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:07.650
I don't want to have

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.080
this endless ideological debate with you.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.070
In short,

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.590
the establishment of the nature reserve,

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:13.660
without the county

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.770
and higher authorities'

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.770
final decision,

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.640
cannot be announced publicly.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.640
Did I make myself clear?

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:20.850
The reporters

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:21.880
are eating in the cafeteria right now.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.300
Go and explain it to them.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.480
Matters regarding the reserve

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.090
must absolutely

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.550
not appear in the reports.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.270
You're not going, are you?

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.150
I knew you wouldn't go.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.310
I'll send the Propaganda Department.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.550
Go to the cafeteria

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.420
and tell Director Wang

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.150
to come here.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.520
This was finished a few days ago.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.730
[Request for Approval to Establish
the Mazhi Economic Development Zone]

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.660
I forgot to give it to you last time.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.470
Take it back and have a read.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.270
We'll discuss it at the meeting.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:06.940
Okay.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.560
I'll read it carefully.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.010
As for my report,

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:23.030
[Feasibility Report on Establishing
the Bolamula Nature Reserve]

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.560
please take a look at it too.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.180
I cooked a lot tonight.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.290
We'll eat in a bit.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.270
Don't bother.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.140
Just make some noodles

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.140
for a quick bite.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.460
What's wrong?

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:49.830
I can't eat.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.680
What happened?

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.740
I heard there were a lot of journalists

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.920
here for interviews today.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.320
Is our county famous now?

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:05.790
Famous?

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.110
From now on,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.270
life in the county will be even harder.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.180
Why do you say that?

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:18.910
That Duojie...

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.620
He didn't give me any warning today

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.770
and told the reporters

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.460
at the meeting

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.290
that he wants to establish some

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.460
nature reserve.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.140
This person...

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.610
Then

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.770
Are we dropping

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.090
the Economic Development Zone?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.540
Once some

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:43.810
nature reserve is established,

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.370
it means

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.680
all the mineral resources inside

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.900
can't be touched.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.510
Then how can we build
the Economic Development Zone?

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:50.160
You have no idea

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.660
how hard it was for me

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.000
just to barely

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.880
hold those reporters back

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.810
this afternoon.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.550
They don't understand at all

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.400
what the most critical problem

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.280
for the county is right now.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.070
Did

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.700
Secretary Chen agree to this?

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.400
Secretary Chen...

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:21.680
I've noticed recently

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.680
his attitude seems to have changed.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.240
He says environmental protection

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.370
is like planting trees today

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.770
for future generations to enjoy the shade.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.110
He told me to

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.430
look at the big picture

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.660
and help Duojie more.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.960
We talked until we were blue in the face

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.420
just to get the subsidies.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.100
And now that we've tackle

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.050
what it seems to be

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.250
the largest illegal mining gang

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:42.980
in Bolamula,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.810
we can finally

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:46.000
catch our breath.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:48.960
I will never agree Duojie

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.400
to go on like this.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.430
Absolutely not.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.220
Back then,

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:08.760
at the Qinghai-Tibet Highway

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.420
construction headquarters,

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.940
you were working on a

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.090
world-class project

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.890
that no one had ever done before.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.610
Could it be any harder than back then?

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.200
At that time,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.730
you could always find a way.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.070
I'm sure you can now, too.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.170
Yeah.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.600
There must be a way.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.680
Who is it now?

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.440
Don't be annoyed.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.430
Feng is coming today.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.280
You two chat.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.330
Sister-in-law.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.150
You're here.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.240
Feng, you're here.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:55.990
Mrs. Lin,

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.920
I'm here to mooch a meal again.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.250
I feel quite bad about it

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.420
so I brought a small gift.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:00.940
Look at you.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.410
You're always so polite.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:03.520
Come on in.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.210
Lin is home.

[Use local resources to create fortune]

[Economic development is the only way,

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.850
Among over a dozen newspapers

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:46.990
from within and outside of the province,

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.520
only these were published.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.620
Gratifying results.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.080
What's gratifying about it?

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.290
Not even half made it.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.170
Someone suppressed them.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.150
Did you see the new slogans

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:02.110
in the county?

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.350
Don't be anxious.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:05.910
I saw them.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.120
I really didn't expect it.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.370
It was Uncle Lin.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.830
He instructed the propaganda team

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.310
to do it.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.740
You child,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.620
how can you say "instructed"?

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:19.880
Propaganda and the economy

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.480
are under his charge anyway.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.290
Lin is just doing his job.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:24.920
He did this,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.120
and I can understand.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.220
He genuinely wants

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.750
what's best for the county.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.430
But he doesn't understand us.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.180
Alright.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.320
The matter at hand

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.800
is what's most important.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.940
In this development zone's

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.680
report,

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:42.790
it involves

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.740
over twenty mining sites

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.940
within Bolamula.

the Uninhabited Zone?

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.940
Can it still be called
an Uninhabited Zone then?

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.860
I've been studying this report for days.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.260
I've been trying to find

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:57.690
a solution

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.210
that satisfies everyone.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.330
Is that possible?

[Request for Approval to Establish

What do you think?

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.980
It's a pipe dream.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.620
How does the saying go?

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.090
You can boil a stone for years,

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.690
but it won't taste like meat.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.010
You can churn creek water,

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.410
but you won't get butter.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:25.860
So what do we do?

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:26.930
The county standing committee meeting

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.170
is in three days.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.010
Your objections,

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.330
will the committee accept them?

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:33.640
Even if they don't,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.100
I still have to raise them.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.060
Whether Lin and the committee

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.120
understand or not,

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.910
this isn't a personal grudge.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.220
Since some people can't understand,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.820
we'll just have to find a way.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.790
We've already come

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.700
this far.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.670
We absolutely cannot

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.900
follow the development zone's path

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.630
any further.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.290
I haven't seen you all day.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.340
Where did you go?

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.420
Post office.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.770
Speak properly.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.430
I got this from the post office.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.920
Look.

and Beijing Forestry University,

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.600
are inviting you to give a lecture.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:33.850
Really?

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.210
A speech in Beijing?

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.830
Look.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:39.660
Duo.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.670
They want you
to lecture university students.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.480
Can you do it?

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.110
No problem.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.090
Let me see. Let me see.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:45.960
Many university students

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.980
couldn't come here

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.590
to visit.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:48.850
But regarding the topic
of environmental protection,

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:49.750
they care a lot.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.610
Last time,

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.270
when I went back to the provincial capital
to file a report,

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.590
I contacted a few alumni associations.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.220
The student representatives
were very enthusiastic.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:56.770
There were also a few

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.250
environmental professors.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.640
They said

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.440
they could give us

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.500
academic support.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.190
If only He were still here.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.860
We could've gone together.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.410

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.380
Zhaba Jiangcuo.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.230
A name needs a surname.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:46.360
Chishao.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.410
It's a big clan.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.430
That was hundreds of years ago.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.120
What is your surname?

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.720
My surname is Adou.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.940
That's not bad too.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.880
Date of birth.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.900
Autumn.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:03.830
What do you mean by autumn?

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.560
You can't just write "Autumn."

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.190
Mom said it was autumn.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.200
It needs to be precise.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:12.700
Like on your ID card.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.450
That's not accurate.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:16.850
That was noted

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.350
when Mom was getting me an ID card

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.070
in the county town.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.660
I was already 10 years old then.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:21.550
It has to be that one.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.410
Otherwise, they won't accept it.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.560
What a huge hassle.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.450
I'll go look for it.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.160
Height and blood type.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.250
I don't know.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.890
Just write the same as yours.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:42.440
Then I'll write

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.660
2cm shorter than me.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.010
Did you get Mrs. Nima's

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.290
air-dried beef?

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.560
I got it.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.160
She even gave us a cow leg.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.070
It's so big!

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.810
That's quite a lot.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:01.510
I don't know if

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.330
the Captain's suitcase

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.400
can hold it all.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.720
Zhacuo,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:09.890
why are you letting someone else

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:10.850
write for you?

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.680
Didn't you say you already started

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.410
learning Chinese characters?

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.660
I can't write it well.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.830
The application form
for the Forestry Police

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.890
cannot be altered.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.870
I'm afraid of making mistakes.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.050
You have to learn quickly.

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:23.060
Otherwise, when you go to
the Provincial Public Security Department,

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.610
you won't even pass the exam.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.550
No problem.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:26.770
Sangba says

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:28.380
my Chinese character level

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:29.520
has reached

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:31.570
the fifth or sixth grade
of elementary school.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.150
Really?

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.610
He's improved that fast?

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.070
Maybe third, fourth, fifth,
or sixth grade.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.740
Hurry up and write.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.720
If the application form is submitted late

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.640
and you two can't wear police uniforms,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.570
don't blame me.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.000
Hurry up.

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.030
Have you found it?

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.480
I'm looking.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.760
Where is Han?

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.460
He was just here.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.620
Found it.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.180
It was chewed up by a rat.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:56.880
Let me see.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.270
You'd better get it reissued quickly.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.240
Write faster.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.260
Okay.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.000
Do I need to reissue it?

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.180
Of course you do.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.080
Thanks.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.700
Since I came back last time,

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.650
it keeps stalling.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.050
I can't find the problem.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.110
It must be too old.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.010
All these years,

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.550
it's been driven too hard
in the mountains.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.810
It should be scrapped.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:44.750
If it doesn't go into the mountains

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.000
and just runs on city roads,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.090
it's still fine.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.290
If it doesn't go into the mountains,

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.550
what do you need it for?

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.080
Han,

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.260
about your situation,

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.720
I've applied to the Chief.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:58.750
He is currently

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.530
submitting a report
to the Provincial Forestry Police.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.480
Even if you can't get

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.420
a permanent position
in the police force...

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.220
Please don't.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.160
There's no need to make things difficult

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.480
for the leaders because of me,

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.040
a person with a criminal record.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.900
I've already thought it through.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.980
Once the reserve is established

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.420
and the Forestry Police are in place,

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.080
it will be time for me to leave.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.100
Where will you go?

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.790
I haven't thought about that yet.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.300
This old buddy

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:26.280
can still run

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.400
on the city roads,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.440
right?

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.780
If you leave,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.030
fixing these junk cars

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.380
will fall on me alone.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.239
If you dare to leave,

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.590
I'll arrest you and bring you back.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:40.780
That sounds like

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.639
something a deputy captain would say.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.429
I'll be waiting for you to arrest me.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:45.520
You really are...

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.280
Although I made

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.580
mistakes in the past,

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.810
I still have the right

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:52.139
to choose now, don't I?

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.230
When I leave,

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.150
get some good liquor ready for me.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.470
Shao mentioned

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.050
a foreign liquor before.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.730
Called Whis...

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:08.550
Whis... what was it again?

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.030
That's not your choice.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.020
What are you doing?

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.450
Trying to be an unsung hero?

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.770
Don't give me that.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.510
A proper job

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.540
is what you deserve to get.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.230
If you can't be in Public Security,

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.510
then be a ranger.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:22.880
The establishment of the reserve

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.280
relies on every one of us.

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:25.670
Once established,

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.960
it's not mission accomplished.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.360
It's just the beginning.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.260
In the future, this place

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.410
will especially need people like you.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:34.280
Me?

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.890
What kind of person am I?

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.380
Stubborn.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:44.050
Someone who sticks to one thing

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.180
and sees it through.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.340
I'm stubborn too.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.700
Stubborn people
understand each other best.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.280
Stubborn people...

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.630
You can't tell from the outside.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.220
But when I part the hair,

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.940
they're all white inside.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.920
You just figured that out?

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:15.350
I still think

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:16.720
you're like a young man.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.630
How did we get old without noticing?

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:24.660
We've been together

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.070
for almost half a lifetime.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.610
How long will you be gone this time?

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.660
Originally about ten days.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.880
Now it's hard to say.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.490
There are university lectures

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.300
and speeches.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:43.960
Shao said

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.610
there are some companies

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.840
that want to donate to us

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.840
waiting to see me.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.880
I also need to visit

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.430
the National Environmental
Protection Bureau

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.230
and leaders from the Ministry of Forestry.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.940
To report to them

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.050
on our work here.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.020
The reserve's establishment

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.480
depends on their support.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.340
I'll pray for you all.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.760
I have a feeling.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.960
Your good days

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.920
are coming.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.890
When the reserve is established,

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.620
the team will have more people.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.800
I can then stay home

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.400
and spend more time with you.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:17.330
Then,

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.020
we'll go traveling together.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.280
We'll go to big cities

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.410
and look around too.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.240
What about our son?

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.590
He even dares to go
to the Uninhabited Zone.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.190
What's there to worry about?

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.640
Just let him stay home

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:31.260
and look after himself.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.500
Dad.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.400
Why are you bragging to Mom again?

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.780
What are you laughing at?

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.320
When the time comes,

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:42.980
your mom and I

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.230
will go traveling by ourselves.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.980
We'll leave you

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.530
at home all alone.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.590
Let's see if you can still smile then.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.760
Dad, this hairstyle looks great.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.650
You should wear it like this from now on.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.280
I used to be

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.700
handsome back in the day.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.130
Otherwise,

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.260
how could I be good enough for your mom?

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.130
Now, in our family,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.460
the most handsome one

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.750
is Tashi.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.770
Dad,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.760
are you going to this university

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760
to give a lecture?

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.970
It's not really a lecture.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.690
I'm just going to tell them

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.790
about what the Mountain Patrol does.

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.780
Tashi,

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.400
tell dad what gift

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.260
you want.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.010
He'll bring it back for you.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.070
I don't need him to bring me anything.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.950
I'm going to get into a university
in Beijing.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.510
I'll go to Peking University.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.030
If I want something,

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.090
I'll buy it myself.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.170
Okay.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.460
A fifteen-year-old man

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.800
makes his own decisions.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.780
A fifteen-year-old girl

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.070
grinds her own tsampa.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.760
Our little Tashi

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.880
has grown up.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.170
From now on,

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.880
there's another decision-maker
in the family.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:46.720
This is for you.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:50.000
What is it?

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.570
Safe travels.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.300
Ms. Kang.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:48.730
Sorry to disturb you,

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.660
Director Zhang.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.580
You finally agreed to come.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.880
It's been so many years.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.390
This tree has grown taller.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.610
The bed is made.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.880
Mom, you're back.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.160
The Captain is staying with us

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:09.960
for the night.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.800
He's heading straight to Beijing tomorrow.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.670
Okay, okay.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.660
You're the boss.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:14.870
Come on.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.470
Come help me out.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.520
We'll cook a sheep's head today.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.070
That's too much trouble, Director Zhang.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.300
Just make something simple.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.340
Just sit tight.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.450
Wait for the food.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.180
What are you laughing at?

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.400
I was thinking about

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.800
when you first came here.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.350
How was my mom like
when she first came?

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.020
I wouldn't dare say.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:03.500
Tell me, tell me!

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.600
How was she like?

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.900
I know what he wants to say.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.650
Back then,

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.710
I had just arrived from Nanjing

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:10.910
and wasn't used to it.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:11.480
In this place,

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.930
there was only highland barley,
beef, and mutton.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:14.860
I got so sick of it

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.010
so I pestered the local officials

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.030
for vegetables.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.530
She made quite a scene.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.150
She'd cry if she didn't get to eat them.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:26.460
It worried our

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.790
County Party Secretary so much back then.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:29.880
Later, the county

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.080
went to great lengths

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.940
to bring a truckload of vegetables
from Tianduo.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.600
But the journey took too long.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.400
By the time they got to Mazhi,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.660
the vegetables were frozen.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.660
They tasted bitter when we ate them.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.210
That made her cry again.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:44.590
Was my mom such a crybaby

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:45.650
when she was young?

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:47.580
She sure was.

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:50.650
But your mom,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.590
apart from loving food,

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:53.720
had no other faults.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.120
Back then,

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.210
she slept in a tent.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.700
She rode a horse to make her rounds.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.870
She even bathed in the river.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:02.840
How do you know

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.650
that I bathed in the river?

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:04.070
Yeah.

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:04.980
How do you know?

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.820
It was all over the county.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.370
Anyway, she was tougher

00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:09.440
than the men.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:10.780
Otherwise,

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.420
with so many doctors in the county,

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.610
why would everyone only call her

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:14.360
Ms. Kang?

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.280
Back then, in the pastoral areas,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.940
echinococcosis was rampant.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.800
She mobilized the county

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.360
to make a batch of solar cookers

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.560
and distribute them.

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:26.790
She promoted drinking boiled water.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.730
Now she's working on

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.860
a plan for women's sanitary products.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.430
Your mom dedicated her whole life

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:35.780
to the pastoral area,

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.360
to the grasslands.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.640
Compared to her contributions,

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.890
the work we do

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.920
is nothing.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:49.320
It's useless to say

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.550
pretty words here.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.260
If you're so capable,
go say them in Beijing.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.580
Why aren't you eating?

00:42:58.930 --> 00:42:59.930
Is my cooking bad?

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.460
It's good. It's delicious.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.540
It looks delicious.
