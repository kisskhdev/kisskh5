Mom had a side like this.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.390

Okay.

She's fine.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.780
She just has a cold

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.750

Don't you know

for up to two months.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.830
It was two months and 20 days.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.750
You told me

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.020
you didn't want to study anymore.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.500
And I didn't have the energy
to deal with you,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.000
so I agreed.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:29.870
Thinking back,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.160
that is the thing

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.340
I regret the most.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.480
Mom.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.150
I...

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.620
I'm giving you two choices now.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.550
One,

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.240
go back to high school,

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.700
finish the remaining year,

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.860
get your diploma,

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.600
and take the college entrance exam.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.120
I'm...

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.340
just not cut out for studying.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.770
Yes, Mom.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.440
At his age

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.510
and with a criminal record,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.460
schools might not accept him.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:15.690
Alright.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.650
The second choice then.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.500
Come to the hospital with me

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.200
and work as a temp.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.170
It won't pay much,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.300
but enough to feed you.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.010
I'm going to the hospital?

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:33.870
I don't have any skills.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.700
What am I supposed to do?

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.860
You can clean, right?

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.570
You can serve tea and water, right?

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:41.580
Yes.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:42.960
Yes.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.720
And another thing.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.600
From now on,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:47.670
we need to set a rule in this house.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.630
The three of you,

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.800
no matter where you go,

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.260
as long as you're away from home

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.370
for more than three days,

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.960
you must call the hospital.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.070
If there's no phone, write a letter.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.130
Is that clear?

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.730
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.430
That might be difficult with my job.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.300
I can't make that happen.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.090
The Mountain Patrol
and the Public Security Bureau

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.150
both have phones.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.390
Can you still move your hand?

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.050
Yes.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.180
Go.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.040
Go help your eldest sister cook.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:02.750
What's wrong?

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.700
If you have something to say, say it.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.300
I told Duojie today

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.310
that I want to enter the mountains.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.330
He told me to come and ask

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.160
for your opinion.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.970
Say something, Mom.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.620
What do you want me to say?

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.200
That I agree to let you go?

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.370
Did you tell Duojie

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.410
not to let me go?

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.760
I used to think

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.180
Duojie was giving me special treatment.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.960
I even complained to you about it.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:52.480
It turns out

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.440
you were sabotaging me behind my back.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.700
How can you call that sabotage?

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.200
If it's not sabotage, what is it?

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.980
What mother doesn't want

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.150
the best for her child?

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.940
They wish they could
help the kids onto the horse

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.910
and see them off properly.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.390
They just hope their path

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.540
will take them further

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.690
and become wider.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.510
But look at you.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.910
There were no obstacles,

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.940
yet you created them for me.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.050
Created obstacles?

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.390
You think I'd let you go there

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.370
if I didn't want what's best for you?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.520
The Bolamula Uninhabited Zone—

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.290
you know better than I do

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.430
what kind of place it is.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.080
The lowest altitude

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.390
is over 4,000 meters.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.290
The mountain passes are over 5,300 meters.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:23.630
I've seen

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.180
plenty of cases

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.100
of sudden altitude sickness.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:25.770
If you get sick there,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.910
no one can save you.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.870
It's over 40,000 square kilometers.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.650
They say it's bigger
than 40 Hong Kongs combined.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:32.870
I've never been to Hong Kong.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.500
And I don't know

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.290
how big it is.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.580
But the herdsmen

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.320
I treat

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.290
have never even been there

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.500
in their entire lives.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.580
Why don't they go?

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.340
First, it's because of their faith.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.170
And also,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:42.790
they know

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.340
they can't go in there.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.180
Every time

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.620
the Mountain Patrol kids

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.340
come by the house,

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.670
seeing the way they look,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.500
my heart just sinks.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.860
I feel sorry for them,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.560
and I fear for you.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.310
I really don't want you

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.630
to suffer like that.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.970
Since we're on the subject,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.200
let me tell you, Bai Ju,

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:06.119
don't even think about
entering the mountains.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.030
I won't allow it.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.630
Then why did you support me

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.589
when I wanted to go to the police academy

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.109
and become a cop back then?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.020
What police officer

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.109
doesn't face danger?

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.140
Just because

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.990
the Uninhabited Zone is dangerous,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.329
does that mean I should back off?

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.530
From the time I was little,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.150
that's not

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.109
how you raised me.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.619
I supported you
going to the police academy

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.650
so that after graduation,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.910
you could find a stable job,

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.849
like your sister,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.869
following a routine and going

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.349
to work every day.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.080
My sister is my sister.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.720
I am me.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.030
I'm different from her.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.710
Why do you get to decide for me?

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.510
Even if you are my real mother,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.810
you shouldn't interfere.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.780
And I certainly don't need you

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:37.940
planning my life.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.280
It is precisely
because I am not your biological mother

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.630
that I must interfere!

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.960
Growing up,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.970
haven't I supported everything

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.190
that you wanted to do?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.110
You liked shooting,

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.090
so your father took you.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.300
You wanted to be a cop.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.170
Now, you're wearing

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.070
this uniform.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.440
Is that not enough?

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.550
Is it just because I won't let you
have your way

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.130
about entering the mountains?

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.440
I just don't understand

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.240
why you must

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.400
enter the mountains?

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.530
If it were Bai Chun, Bai Ji,

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.580
or even Bai Shao,

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:12.530
I wouldn't interfere.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:14.180
But with you, I have to step in.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.540
Because your biological parents

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.610
are watching me from heaven.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.250
If anything happened to you,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.670
I couldn't face them.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.400
Call Mom for dinner.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.960
Mom,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:53.960
dinner is ready.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.920
That's too much, Shi Long.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.640
The Party Secretary
and County Mayor just agreed

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.800
to give the Mountain Patrol

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.480
more weapon support.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.740
Why are you giving us less?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.090
Just one pistol

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.830
and two boxes of ammo.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:23.360
How do you expect me to sign for this?

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.590
Hey,

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.740
listen to me.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:26.570
The new ammo

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.810
we requested

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.890
is still on the way.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:29.870
As for those two

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.790
semi-automatic rifles,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.390
the municipal bureau hasn't approved them.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.350
No approval means no approval, so...

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.350
you know.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.370
We've seized

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.420
plenty of firearms and ammunition before.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.180
In storage…

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.710
Well,

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.520
the non-standard ones

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.590
were all destroyed.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:43.480
And the rest

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.480
were distributed.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.870
I can't go to the comrades

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.880
and ask for them back, right?

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.370
You sold them, didn't you?

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.720
You can't say that!

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:53.420
Well.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.500
There were

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.500
indeed a few

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.420
in good condition,

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:56.930
but they've already

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.310
been reassigned to other units.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:58.710
This...

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.020
This was decided
by the Bureau Party Committee.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.200
I didn't do it on my own.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.130
You were at the meeting.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.920
You know that.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.570
I know.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.200
Hey.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.420
Really.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:06.810
I still have to

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.030
keep my position.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.780
So,

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.030
please just sign it.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:12.920
Come on.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.130
Sign it.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.900
Thank you. Thank you.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.940
Don't worry.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:19.850
As soon as the ammo arrives,

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.760
I'll send someone

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.440
to bring it to you immediately.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.610
I'm anxious, too,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.260
you know.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.380
Just sign it.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.760
Thanks.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.590
It's getting late.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.610
We should go eat.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.460
The meal is on me later.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.010
I found a noodle place.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.930
Their pulled noodles are even better

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.250
than my wife's.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.070
Come on, let's go.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:42.920
Let's get the stuff first.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.510
Get the stuff.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.050
Let's go.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.140
Come on, get out!

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.470
Behave yourself.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:01.820
Chief.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.660
Who is this?

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.880
At the road checkpoint,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.160
we stopped a pickup truck.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.260
Based on the suspect's

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.980
physical description,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:10.850
I suspect

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.010
he's the fugitive, Guo Shun.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:13.770
Where's the truck?

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.590
That truck's got a carburetor problem,

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.260
so it drives slowly.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.400
We brought him back first.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:18.740
Hey,

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.550
Comrades,

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.440
you've got the wrong person.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.480
I'm just a transporter.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:24.900
The stuff on that truck

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.770
isn't mine.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.950
And I don't know anything

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.350
about what you're saying.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.000
Guo Shun.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.400
Do you think no one

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.850
in Mazhi County knows who you are?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.560
Do you want me to bring Bai Ji

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.500
out of the detention center

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.260
to identify you?

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.740
You sent the skinners

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.720
into Bolamula,

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.010
didn't you?

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:43.570
We're looking for your boss.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.550
I don't have a boss.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.440
I just do odd jobs

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.370
and small businesses

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.500
to make a living.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.110
Chief Shi.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.910
This suspect

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.070
is being very uncooperative with you.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:21:59.960
I think you should send him

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:00.810
to my place.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.090
The kids in the Mountain Patrol

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.920
have ways to make him talk.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.240
I guess that's our only option.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:09.770
You two,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.640
take him and go
with Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.160
Yes, sir.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.080
What are you doing?

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.570
Move!

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.080
Let go!

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.330
Stand up!

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.180
I'm not going anywhere!

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.940
I'm not going anywhere!

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.290
Let me go.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.680
I'm not going anywhere!

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.320
You blew up

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.240
our warehouse.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.560
Not long ago,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.740
we lost a member.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.340
He was only 18.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.820
If you want to redeem yourself,

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.000
give up your boss

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.830
and tell us everything.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.660
Otherwise,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.220
I'm pinning all of this on you.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.610
Who do you

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.140
think you are?

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.470
Everyone in the county knows

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.940
you've lost your mind.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.000
If you hadn't

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.140
insisted on taking people
into the mountains,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.070
would anyone

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.000
have died?

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.860
Everyone would've made their money.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:47.850
Let me tell you.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:48.820
That member of yours

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.970
died because of you,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.690
you bastard.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.160
Say that again!

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.060
Come on, hit me.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.720
Kill me!

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:54.130
Calm down.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.020
Deputy County Mayor Duo!

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:55.850
Deputy County Mayor Duo is hitting people!

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.550
Deputy County Mayor Duo.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:56.950
Calm down.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.830
Are you police going to stop him?

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:58.610
Calm down!

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.090
Behave yourself!

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.590
Are you going to stop him?

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:00.240
Behave yourself.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:00.570
Are you...

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.440
What are you doing?

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.130
What are you doing?

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.030
You're out of line!

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:08.940
What did you find in the car?

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.030
Explosives

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.960
and bullets.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.010
There are at least a thousand rounds here.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.340
A thousand rounds...

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.650
Fifty jins.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.120
These fifty jins of bullets

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.510
aren't for hunting the antelopes.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.170
Explain yourself.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.910
They're meant for you.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.530
You've got some premature beats,

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.400
but nothing serious.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.470
Stay in the hospital
for observation for two days.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:00.740
I don't need to stay, do I?

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.180
It's an old problem.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.220
When I don't rest well,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.350
it tends to happen.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.420
Lin is just worrying for nothing.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.270
The heart is no small matter.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.630
You must take it seriously.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.440
If there's a problem,
you need medical treatment right away.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.850
Lin did the right thing.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.580
Listen to that.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.240
Listen to that.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.220
If you're told to come, just come.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.410
Listen to Director Zhang.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:22.770
Stop writing.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.070
Talk to us.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.320
Wasn't it enough
to write it up in the office?

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.850
You had to bring it to the hospital, too?

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.810
In the whole county, no one's busier

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.030
or more capable than you.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:32.880
This report

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:34.070
needs more work.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.300
Last time
the Municipal People's Congress mentioned

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.970
they still need to assess
the snowstorm damage in the county

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.290
I plan

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.640
to go to the city government again

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.250
and submit a detailed report.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.500
Our county has no industry.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:45.700
The largest portion

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.200
of profit and tax this year

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.640
came from the animal husbandry tax.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.150
You want to reduce even this?

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.010
That put the city leaders
in a tough spot, too.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.660
I support Lin on this.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.830
I receive patients

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:56.930
from the pastoral areas every day.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.700
I know

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.720
that after this year's snow disaster,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.440
the herdsmen are really struggling.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.200
In the end,

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.580
our county's conditions

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:11.510
are simply too poor.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.640
Lin,

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.500
tell us,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.200
when will our county

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.570
get rich?

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.680
Just say our county‘s economy

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:30.020
is fixated

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.070
on cows and sheep,
working them to the bone.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.260
But the herdsmen

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:34.680
are reluctant to sell.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.980
And they like
to compare livestock numbers.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.980
Except for the required

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.400
beef cattle and mutton sheep,

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.010
they won't sell a single one of the rest.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:44.640
At the beginning of the year,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.200
a snow disaster

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.070
killed or injured more than half.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:49.610
Even now, the stock numbers

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.310
haven't recovered.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.980
Director Zhang,

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.570
there's a patient. Come take a look.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:57.550
Okay, coming.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:58.980
I'll go take a look.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:00.530
Light

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.610
that gas lamp up.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.720
It's almost ten-thirty.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.480
You carry on.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:13.410
You...

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.780
Director Zhang was here just now,

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.830
so I didn't want to bring it up.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.370
Don't you think about

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.880
your own career development?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.640
Right now,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:22.700
in your leadership team,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.200
you're the most educated

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.460
and the youngest.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.510
If there's another promotion coming up,

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.940
it'll be you.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.880
Do you have to

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.320
upset the leadership right now?

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.680
Jianshe is graduating next year.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.260
I was hoping you could pull some strings

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:39.260
to find him an internship

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.350
in the city.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.150
He's not graduating
until next year, right?

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.570
What's the rush?

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.880
Besides,

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.110
am I not even allowed to speak up

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.220
because of all that?

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:53.930
Duojie said something

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.770
that was really good.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.240
The situation in the county

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.940
is like a piece of lean meat.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.000
If you try to scrape fat from it,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.070
you won't get any.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.160
Given our county's situation,

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.630
the fact

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.850
that you've kept things stable here,

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:17.890
without any incidents,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.070
that alone counts as an achievement.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.000
Ms. Zhu,

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:26.970
your level

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.350
keeps getting higher and higher.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.730
What you just said

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.110
is exactly the same

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.410
as what you said
when the Governor

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.290
visited last year.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.180
We're almost done interrogating Shi Long.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.700
We're preparing to enter the mountains
in ten days.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.670
Did he give up the meeting location too?

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.310
If things go our way,

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:50.670
we're going

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.670
to nail the guy

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.250
who killed Dongzhiba.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.050
Don't just focus on making arrests.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.060
At the last meeting,

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:55.840
the Party Secretary said—

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:56.810
I remember that.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.980
I won't forget
about the mineral exploration.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:04.140
Shi told me

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.440
you took twenty-five jins of bullets.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:09.750
The Party Secretary also mentioned

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:10.510
at the meeting

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:12.170
that we will have full authority

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.880
over the use

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.240
of any seized firearms and ammunition.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:15.060
I said that, too.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.070
Yes.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.090
Hey, you can't jump

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.000
into fight mode every time

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.030
someone says something, alright?

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:20.850
Stop...

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:22.000
Stop wearing that look
on your face all the time,

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:22.640
okay?

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.240
I really don't like chatting with you.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.350
You've already said everything
there is to say.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.220
Isn't he just

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.090
annoyed because I took too much?

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.780
Shi said those bullets

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:32.880
were all meant

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.640
for your Mountain Patrol.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:33.980
He was surprised

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.180
you still left half for them.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.640
That's good then.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:40.940
I...

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:41.980
I'll have Bai Ju

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.850
go back to the bureau
to get them tomorrow.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.600
I agree.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.700
I support that.

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.570
There's one more thing

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:50.570
I need you to handle.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.330
You, the leader, said I look grim

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:56.740
and have an attitude.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.270
So I'll accept the task with a smile,

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.270
happy now?

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:02.710
What do you want me to do?

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.670
I got someone to contact

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.310
a reporter
from the Provincial Evening News.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.830
And a few entrepreneurs

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.130
who are interested
in our county's mining industry

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.200
and intend to invest.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.510
In a few days,

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.050
they'll come to our county together

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.130
for a site visit.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.250
Look, look, look.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.260
You're showing that attitude again,

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:24.670
aren't you?

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.040
No way.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.940
I've been smiling the whole time.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.500
Yes.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.710
You had a beautiful smile.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.310
This counts as our county's

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:32.720
investment promotion meeting.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.530
We have to let the outside world

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.720
get to know us.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.460
We must fire

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.500
our county's

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.960
first shot in mining development.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.690
Don't mention

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.530
the word "shot" to me.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.200
It gives me a headache.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.310
How about this?

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.510
How about this?

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.550
Let's strive to take

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.890
Mazhi County's

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.500
first step in mining development.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.570
Is that okay?

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.530
Is that okay? Is that okay?

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.080
What do you need me to do?

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.150
This smile isn't bad.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.920
I suggest we arrange the site visit

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.240
at Wulan Canyon.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.590
The altitude there is 4,200 meters.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.130
Why don't you arrange it

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.000
at Baozi Canyon?

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:24.970
That's 4,700 meters.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.900
That works, too.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:28.970
Baozi Canyon

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.530
is on the outskirts of Bolamula.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.090
There's even more to see there.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.680
Good. Baozi Canyon is good.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.040
It is pretty good.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.960
What's so good about it?

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.610
County Mayor Lin asked us to arrange

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.330
the inspection route.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.380
You set it up at such a high altitude,

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:41.610
aren't you undermining him?

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.270
Exactly.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.770
The Captain is right.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.610
It's so high.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.770
Can they handle it?

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.080
Why are you such a flip-flopper?

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.400
It's a fact.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.050
Are they here for tourism

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.070
or for an inspection?

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.250
Only by getting close

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.340
to the Bolamula Uninhabited Zone

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.810
can they find mineral resources.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.190
In the future,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.880
if they want to develop Bolamula,

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.530
the altitude inside will only be higher.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.690
These two spots now

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.250
are just small potatoes.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:09.230
What are you laughing at?

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.030
That's just how it's said in Cantonese.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.680
What does it mean?

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:13.870
It just

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.440
means “no big deal.”

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.400
Anyway,

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:20.220
if they can't

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.160
even handle this,

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.980
how are they going to survey

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.980
or mine later on?

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.460
We could take them

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.800
to a lower altitude for a tour.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.640
But then they won't see

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.550
the reality.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.240
Then what's the point

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.240
of a site visit?

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:34.400
Then we'd really be

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.000
undermining

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.070
County Mayor Lin.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.840
You're right.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.010
Let's do it your way.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:44.850
We'll set it up

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.460
in the outer areas of Bolamula.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:47.850
Small potatoes.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.960
Okay.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.330
Alright, stop laughing.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.240
Hurry up and make a budget.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:55.870
Make a spreadsheet.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.350
Okay.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.700
As long as this development company

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.720
can get off the ground,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.290
whether it's Liu or Jiumei,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.480
I can bring them back.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.850
This one?

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.310
Name your price.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.240
How about this much?

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:51.580
I'll offer this much.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.240
The price has to be reasonable.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.440
If it's not, there's no point.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.880
Fine, fine.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.730
Okay.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:13.740
Bai Ji.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.060
You scared me.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:15.970
What's wrong with you?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.030
You didn't even eat breakfast.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.100
Here.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.270
Eat the egg.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:24.770
What are you doing now?

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.100
You have a job now.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.240
Pull yourself together

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.640
and work hard, okay?

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.300
What kind of job is this—

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.040
Sweeping streets

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.980
and dumping trash.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.250
I have to clean the toilets later.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.210
After that,

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.640
I have to help in the kitchen.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:43.960
Sis,

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.160
these two jobs,

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.650
shouldn't be done
by the same person, right?

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.120
Stop talking nonsense.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.160
Just do what you're told.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.450
Quit your whining.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.430
Behave yourself,

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.770
or I'll have your second sister
deal with you.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.640
Got it?

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.350
Eat it.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.070
Okay. Bye.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:14.780
Okay, okay.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.040
Then it's a deal between us.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.210
It's a deal.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.560
Let me introduce you.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.510
This is our newly appointed Member

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.800
of the County Party Standing Committee
and Head of the Organization Department.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.260
Take care. Tashi Delek.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.170
Tashi Delek.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.449
This is our...

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.420
Open the window.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:25.980
Dad.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.620
Later, they...

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.190
Okay.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.780
I'm ready.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.510
Come here.

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.800
Let me introduce you.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.469
This is my son.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.170
Deputy County Mayor Duojie.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.190
Deputy County Mayor Duojie.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:35.880
Hello.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:37.840
Isn't this supposed
to be an inspection team?

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.730
Why are there so few people?

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.770
It's good enough that we have these few.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.010
Be grateful.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.929
Altitude sickness is like that.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.820
I don't need it.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.400
If anything comes up later,

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.060
you can get to

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.150
the Mountain Patrol members.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.560
They are very experienced

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.610
on the plateau.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.300
I'll go get ready.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.010
See you later.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.480
Okay.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.460
Go ahead.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.470
County Mayor Lin.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.110
Thank you for your hard work.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:07.670
Get down, everyone.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.370
Are you monkeys?

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.640
Put your guns away.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.050
Look at how Bai Ju

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:16.700
is standing.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.140
It's not our first time here.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.610
We've been the outskirts

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.920
of Bolamula many times.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:26.980
Chairman Ding,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.330
you are hale and hearty.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.300
I can't handle it.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:30.730
Ever since I came up,

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.370
I haven't been able
to go without the oxygen.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.300
Manager Zhao,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.740
you're just too nervous.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.970
Listen to County Mayor Lin.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.340
Relax,

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.610
and your altitude sickness
will be half gone.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:40.360
He.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:42.710
What's wrong?

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.250
I have altitude sickness.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.470
I need oxygen, too.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.630
Aren't we leaving yet?

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.120
The round trip takes six hours.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.040
If we don't leave now,

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.430
we won't make it back before dark.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.000
They said not everyone has arrived.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.610
Not everyone?

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.730
By the time everyone gets here,

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.710
they'll have used up all the oxygen.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:16.910
County Mayor Lin,

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.210
it's been half an hour,

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.310
but Reporter Shao still isn't here.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.110
Should we keep waiting?

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.480
Everyone.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.510
Everyone.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:27.570
There's no time to lose.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.250
Let's hurry up

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.150
and go for the field inspection.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:30.930
Deputy County Mayor

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.430
Duojie

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.460
will lead the way for us

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.080
to the outskirts

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.210
of Bolamula.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:37.230
Get in the car.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.000
Okay.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.980
Let's go.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.590
Okay.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.650
Get in.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.280
Bai Ju, are you driving or am I?

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.100
I'll drive.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.480
Okay.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:52.320
Come here.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.690
Everyone, follow me.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.080
Look over here.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.670
The next phase of the plan

00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.340
is to move in from here

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.280
into

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.590
the interior of Bolamula

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.150
and carry out on-site geological surveys.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:04.420
Based on

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.980
preliminary findings,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.680
this area contains

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.920
chromium,

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.150
lithium,

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:11.500
and placer gold deposits.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:12.330
County Mayor Lin,

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.880
about

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.420
the exploration report

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.320
we discussed last time,

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.820
when will it be ready?

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.200
Exactly.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.780
Exactly.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.120
Over the past year,

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.290
under the leadership
of Deputy County Mayor Duojie,

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.390
the Mountain Patrol

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.340
of the Mazhi Economic

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:31.970
Development Company

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.060
has entered the interior

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:34.110
of Bolamula multiple times

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.630
to conduct field surveys.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:37.960
In at most five months,

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.080
we will submit a relatively comprehensive

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.570
mineral exploration report to everyone.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.010
Five months?

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.620
That's almost half a year.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.130
The time is too long.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:51.050
Then...

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.050
Three months.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:58.940
In three months,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.240
you'll definitely see

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.270
the mineral exploration report.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.090
Come on,

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.190
look here, everyone.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.270
This mountain

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.820
right in front of us

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.580
contains rich

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:09.670
oil shale reserves.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.440
Oil shale extraction

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:12.790
has already been adopted

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.400
in many regions.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:15.320
You could say

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.840
that in the mining industry,

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.030
it is a highly high-profile resource

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:35.690
The...

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.620
The elevation

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.590
here isn't high—

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:39.130
just around 4,500 meters.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.650
It lies on the edge

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:42.890
of the county-designated development zone.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.260
Geological conditions here

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.110
are favorable.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.090
Winds are mild in winter,

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:46.960
snow cover is shallow,

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.800
so the mining season

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.690
can be extended.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.780
According to the plan,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.400
once the development zone is established,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.440
mining infrastructure projects

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.550
will be launched here first.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.520
By then, manpower
and logistical support...

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:57.400
Stop the car!

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.070
Why did you shoot?

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.040
Get in the car!

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.670
Come on.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.970
Everyone, hide behind the car.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.560
Go hide behind the car.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:07.320
You two stay here.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:07.880
Let's go. Let's go.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.190
Let's go.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.550
Hide behind the car.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:10.650
Go! Go! Go!

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.460
Everyone hide behind the car.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.370
Get behind the car. Quick.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:13.530
Give me the gun. Quick.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.400
Uncle Lin.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.400
Protect them.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.320
Stop the car!

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.160
Stop the car!

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.380
We are the Mountain Patrol.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.120
Stop or we'll shoot!

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:23.880
Stop the car!

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:24.980
Stop!

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.520
Stop!

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.340
We are the Mountain Patrol!

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:15.420
Everyone get down!

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.360
Get down!

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:16.900
Make them get down!

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:17.460
Go.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.270
Get down!

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.070
Get down!

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.130
Squat down. Come here.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:20.940
Get down!

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.030
Come here.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.690
Hurry up.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.550
Quick. Get down!

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.190
Where is that car?

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.420
It's tires are blown out.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.580
What about the guns?

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.250
Two hunting rifles are seized.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.440
What about the pelts?

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.920
About fifty pieces.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:40.750
This is normal.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.670
Zhacuo.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:43.950
Did they hunt

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.230
inside?

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.060
Hunting is banned inside it.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.060
They were poaching.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:50.500
Manager Wang.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.050
He has fainted.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.050
County Mayor Lin.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.550
Oxygen. Get oxygen, quick.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:55.230
What are you laughing at?

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.920
Get him to the car first.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.030
Heads down. Don't move.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.360
Sit back.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:57.940
Officer.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.150
Here.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.290
I still have half a bag of oxygen here.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:00.860
Give it to him.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.980
Take care of the rest of the people.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:02.590
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:03.260
Duojie,

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.900
I'm going to the County Hospital.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.420
Take care of them.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.210
Don't worry.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:06.900
I leave them to you.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.300
Don't worry.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.360
Drive slowly, sir.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.650
Are you okay?

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.460
I'm fine.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.720
You can't mine that mountain.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:20.660
Why...

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:21.540
Why?

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.520
That is the Mountain God's

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.670
third wife.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.280
That mountain—

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.280
you see it?

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.860
It is the Mountain God's second wife.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.220
The mountain to the north

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.660
is the Mountain God's

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.640
third son's wife.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.440
The mountain to the south

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.910
is the Mountain God's steward.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.250
What's wrong?

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.600
What did you say to him?

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.130
What did you say to him?

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.760
I was explaining the situation.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:53.840
Duojie.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.460
The site you chose today

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.430
was quite good.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.290
To those who have never been here,

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.360
it's a real shock.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.530
We've seized the initiative.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.900
You could say that.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.520
Even though right now

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.880
we're still insisting
on entering the mountains.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.390
But,

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:12.300
the thing is...

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:13.370
You're short on funds,

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.500
right?

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.420
If you need money, just tell me.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.550
Is 100,000 yuan enough?

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.330
No, no, no.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.090
Chairman Ding,

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.130
we can't

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.100
take any more of your money.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.530
Why?

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.170
The Captain feels bad

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.230
because the last mining project

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:30.900
didn't work out

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.600
and caused you

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.160
to lose a lot of money.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:35.780
It wasn't your fault

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.900
that the mine

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.110
didn't produce,

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:41.190
and I lost over a million.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:42.840
Not finding anything now

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.200
doesn't mean

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.010
you won't find it later.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.010
Anyone doing big things

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.310
is bound to hit

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.670
some setbacks.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:54.780
I'm not just giving it to you for free.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.950
You can pay me back

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.040
once the mine is successful.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.020
Then, on behalf of the Mountain Patrol,

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.340
thank you, Chairman Ding.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.540
We will definitely
get the exploration report done

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:02.420
as soon as possible.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.420
Don't mention it.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.780
I'll wait for your good news.
