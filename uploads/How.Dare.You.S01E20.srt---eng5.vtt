00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.590
will not have been lived in vain.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.140
♪ Go to the battlefield ♪

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.410
♪ Waters surge in reverse,
and time rewinds ♪

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.930
♪ Sever the mundane shackles ♪

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.830
♪ We can dance together ♪

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.630
I must ensure
his death was not for nothing,

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.430
♪ On the ruins fearlessly ♪

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.830
so that his spirit in heaven
may find peace.

♪ Never looking back ♪

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.350
Now,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.940
let's proceed with

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.200
the peace talks.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.240
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.720
Wanyin,

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.620
give the gun to Mr. Bei

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.590
and ask him to guard the gate properly.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.960
Okay.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.320
Buddy.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.790
What's your surname?

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.990
Buddy,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.410
look at this.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:12.780
Look.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.440
Trying to bribe me

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.240
with just a few copper coins?

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.410
With faith one may alter fate…

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:34.680
Marvelous.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.510
No, no, not marvelous at all!

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.720
What're you talking about,
marvelous or not?

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.680
Just now,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.660
I cast a hexagram for you
using the Six Lines.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:53.050
There's a great calamity in your fate!

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.480
If you keep spouting nonsense,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.940
I'll use the torture instruments on you.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.190
I'm the Director of
the Imperial Observatory,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.350
in charge of divining fortune
and misfortune for the royal destiny.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.070
Whether you believe my reading

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.730
is up to you,

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.780
and whether you can keep your new position

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.510
as Deputy Commander

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.400
is also up to you.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:17.720
How do you know

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.160
I was just promoted to Deputy Commander?

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.290
The will of Heaven

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.530
cannot be revealed.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.280
Buddy, I wonder if you've heard

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.780
the story of Cao Cao

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.720
and Wang Hou?

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.480
What Wang Hou?

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.010
Wait,

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.480
what does this have to do with me?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.400
My dear buddy,
it has everything to do with you!

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.290
It is said that when Cao Cao

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.640
went to conquer Yuan Shu,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.640
he encountered a drought,
and the army ran out of food.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.120
The grain officer, Wang Hou,
asked Cao Cao,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.790
"without food to eat,

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.600
what should we do?"

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.100
"Replace

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:00.550
the large bushel with a smaller one

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.130
when issuing the rations to them."

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.690
"But the soldiers will be resentful.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.790
What then?"

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.450
"No matter.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.850
I have a brilliant plan."

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.480
Once the rations were reduced,

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.650
the soldiers were indeed furious.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.020
And then, Cao Cao

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.860
said to the grain officer,

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.200
"I need to borrow one more thing from you

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.030
to steady the army's morale."

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.760
"What is it?"

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:26.680
"Your

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.240
head."

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.910
"I am innocent! Truly innocent!"

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.400
"I know you are innocent.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.250
But

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.700
if I don't execute you,

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.790
should I execute myself?"

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.310
W-What are you talking about?

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.710
Beating around the bush.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.790
Buddy,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:54.200
aren't you just like

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.810
that Wang Hou right now?

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.160
Look,

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.450
Zhao Wucheng could have just
asked you to watch me.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.310
Why did he have to
order you to interrogate me

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.830
in front of everyone?

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.990
For failing to save His Majesty,

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.570
someone's head has to roll.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.650
Even if His Majesty were to pass away,

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.170
Prince Duan would still
pursue this charge

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.700
to make a show of his stance.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.550
That Zhao Wucheng is Prince Duan's lackey,

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.010
so of course he'll be fine.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.160
Then the one who'll be in trouble

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.570
can only be whoever fails to get results
from the interrogation

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.630
and delays the deployment of troops.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:39.850
Did you divine all this

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.290
from your hexagrams?

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.100
[Be Remembered with Honor for All Ages]

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.640
You're a dying man,

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.420
and I'm a desperado.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.550
What's there for us to talk about?

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.010
Don't even think about it!

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:53.440
Indeed.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.520
Just take it as

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.110
the ramblings

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.070
of a dying man.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.300
Bring him forward.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:08.530
[Be Remembered with Honor for All Ages]

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.210
Years of war

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.390
have left the people destitute.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.510
You didn't notice,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.940
but Zhaluowahan realized

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.320
that the people
have lost the will to fight.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.160
He needs time

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.030
to recuperate,

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.610
and he also needs a new opportunity

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.480
to stir up

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.040
the people's fighting spirit.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.840
The Xia people know they are in the wrong,

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.030
[When two states go to war,
one is bound to suffer.]

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:43.720
so they sent someone with a peace treaty.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.440
[Prolonged war is no blessing to a state.
I seek terms with the Yan State.]

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.080
[Let's set aside old grievances,
forge an alliance, and keep the peace.]

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.690
[I hereby draft this pact
as a pledge of good faith and trust.]

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.100
The court ministers and the people

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.330
really don't want any more war.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.790
I don't want to go against
their wishes either.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.850
But Shanyi...

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.480
She was our holy maiden!

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.480
Shanyi was just a young girl.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.590
Why would she attempt an assassination
for no reason?

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.920
Who was it

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.590
that gave her the order?

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.120
And how did the person

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.280
who gave the order make her obey?

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.030
Coercion or bribery?

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.240
Or did they use her beloved

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.030
to threaten her?

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640
How did Xiahou Dan

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.090
know all this?

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.770
Being a puppet without even realizing it—

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.400
you can't save the one you love,

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.920
nor can you find your true enemy.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.130
Do you really think the Emperor of Yan

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.000
has no idea that you've come to
the Great Xia?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.320
Just like Shanyi,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.850
your deaths in the palace of the Great Xia

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.240
would be far more useful
than dying at their hands.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.480
When the news reaches the Yan State,

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.740
he can shed crocodile tears again

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.270
and cry

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.050
for the Xia State to pay in blood.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.240
You're right.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.130
I... I am a puppet.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.390
But what about you?

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.960
Aren't you one, too?

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.590
Of course I am.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.720
When I was young, I thought

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.700
that if I fought with everything I had,

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.960
I could escape their control.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.130
But later, I slowly realized

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.100
that every decision I made

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.140
and my every act of resistance

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.520
played right into their hands.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.440
I am a puppet,

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.510
a target,

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.240
and an arrow.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.440
I am the killing blade in their hands,

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.480
yet the one thing I cannot be

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.210
is a person.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.140
Is what he's talking about

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.350
the experience of Xiahou Dan
from the original story?

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.110
Actually, we are very much alike.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.310
But I'm not resigned—

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.590
I refuse to pretend to be ignorant,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.110
to drift blindly toward fate,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.570
or to deceive myself

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.200
and call it

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.660
"having no choice."

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160
Are you resigned?

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.590
Are you?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.690
Kneel!

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.440
You actually lost your composure
over a woman,

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.100
ignoring the bigger picture!

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.010
How can I entrust the Great Yan to you?

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.340
How can you ever be an emperor?

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.790
If I can't even protect the woman I love,

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.310
then I'm not fit
to be the Emperor of the Yan State!

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.040
You bastard!

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:46.250
Guards!

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.740
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.040
Pass on my order:

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.350
say that the Prince has gone mad.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.850
From this day forth,

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.220
he is not to leave the camp.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.380
If he still refuses to repent,

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.400
starve him!

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.780
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.660
I never expected

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.030
that you'd be such a hopeless romantic.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.180
Since that's the case,

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.290
I'll give you a poison.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.480
Smear it on a wound,

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.480
and the blood will drain, ending life.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.480
Go find your Shanyi.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.070
Hate me if you want.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.880
I'm a dying man,

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.360
and you're a desperado.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.000
It's just the one
who truly killed your beloved

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.640
can continue to sit securely on the throne

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.520
with nothing to worry about.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.200
Unfortunately,

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.200
I'm about to die.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.360
If you could kill
that treacherous Emperor Zhaluowahan,

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.010
it would be good news for me,

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.930
and you would get your revenge.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.310
But now,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.060
you've committed regicide.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.160
You probably don't even stand a chance

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.400
of leaving the Great Xia alive.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.100
I really don't have the antidote.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.170
That Qiang woman only gave me poison.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.580
Go find your imperial physicians

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.150
and try to figure something out.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.370
Then please pray hard for me.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.600
Then tell me how to turn this around.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:27.350
Speak!

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.120
To think there're people
so disrespectful of propriety—

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.490
you ask for guidance
yet won't even bow to learn.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.830
I can be even more disrespectful.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.430
Are you going to speak or not?

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.070
Buddy.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.690
Can you get the Tiger Tally?

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.360
Greetings, Commander.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.790
How's the interrogation going?

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.310
Commander,

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.160
I haven't got anything out of him yet.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.090
I'll definitely
conduct a thorough interrogation.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.380
Interrogate him properly

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.000
and meticulously.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.770
This is an important matter of the state.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.710
Both you and I will be credited for this.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.070
Yes, sure.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.330
Please take care, Commander.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.090
No survivor.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.260
Let's go

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.440
and kill them all.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:01.760
Yes.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.450
I really don't have the antidote.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.190
Dan!

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.070
Those ambushed in the woods

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:15.930
have closed in.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:18.830
Run.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.080
Let's go.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.630
I...

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.610
I don't think I can run anymore.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.200
Then let's find a place

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.000
to hide

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:39.920
and wait.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.720
Wait for what?

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.810
A chance—

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.310
to see whether Heaven

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.340
stands on our side.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.230
Let's get in the underground palace.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.760
Let's go.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.030
What are you doing?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.720
Let go of me!

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.640
I will lure them away

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.610
to buy Your Majesty some time.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.380
Wanyin.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.470
This underground palace

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.070
is like a shelter.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.970
Its locking stone falls into a groove,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.370
forming a triangle

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.480
with the stone gate and the ground.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.810
Without special tools,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.410
it's hard to open with brute force.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.710
This is

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.960
the stability of a triangle.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.360
Not bad, CEO Dan.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.000
You still remember what you learned

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.260
back in middle school.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.230
After all, it is

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.100
the crystallization of ancient wisdom.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:46.830
Lord Cao.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.960
We didn't find the bodies of
His Majesty and Tu'er.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.590
Keep searching. They won't get far.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:50.970
Yes.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.240
Found it!

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:52.810
Found it!

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.760
There is blood
near the underground palace.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:55.760
They must be hiding there.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.370
What are you waiting for? Go!

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.940
My Lord.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.850
The gate is blocked from inside.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:14.380
His Majesty must be inside.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:18.640
Break the gate down.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.550
Harder!

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.910
Bring the battering ram!

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.550
Yes!
