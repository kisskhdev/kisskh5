WEBVTT

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.552
What's so special about this place?

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:09.997
(Reply: I'll call you when I'm done)
I told you I'd come with you.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.550
So this is that jerk's house?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.930
He actually showed up?

00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:45.595
Let's get started.

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:47.596
Do... do what?

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.930
Ah! Sorry... my bad.

00:01:16.663 --> 00:01:18.570
Do you want to go back to the station?

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.410
I didn't do it on purpose...

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.010
Not on purpose?

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.490
If you hadn't pulled me first...

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.854
So it's my fault now?

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.158
No... I said I was sorry, didn't I?

00:01:31.752 --> 00:01:33.570
Fine. Just sit down.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.096
I'm going to the restroom.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.546
This is unbelievable...

00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:21.742
Geonwoo?!

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.660
What's wrong?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.552
Is this because of me?

00:02:26.553 --> 00:02:27.740
Why would you...

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.360
even think that?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.783
It's not a misunderstanding.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.551
I hit your head earlier,

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:33.640
and you even had a nosebleed.

00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:35.074
And now this...

00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:36.822
Stop talking nonsense.

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.360
You think I'd die from something like that?

00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:40.259
Then why did you pass out?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.890
You looked like you were in a lot of pain.

00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:43.770
Well...

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.110
I'm not really sure.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.640
Hey, open your eyes...

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.169
I'm too young to go to prison for murder...

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.145
You're being too loud.

00:02:54.146 --> 00:02:56.296
Can you help me to the sofa?

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.330
I haven't been feeling well for a while.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.700
Okay.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.965
You've got a fever.

00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.006
What should I do...

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.000
What the...

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.222
Why is this towel so soaking wet?

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.727
It's obvious you've never taken care of anyone.

00:05:53.314 --> 00:05:55.089
Geonwoo.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.271
You're sick, why are you getting up?

00:05:58.272 --> 00:06:00.239
Oh, you're awake?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.650
Just sit. I've got it.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.251
Feeling any better?

00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:06.805
You really passed out back there.

00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:08.639
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.270
No.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.704
It happens all the time.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:12.950
I just need some rest.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.660
All the time?

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.740
How is that normal?

00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:19.431
I told you, it's no big deal.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.350
Smells good.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.780
Yeah.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.242
You're not hungry, are you?

00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:38.332
I only made enough for myself...

00:06:39.655 --> 00:06:41.975
Oh... okay...

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.604
I'm just kidding.

00:06:45.346 --> 00:06:48.041
Seriously... who jokes like that?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.126
I think someone's here.

00:07:06.683 --> 00:07:08.995
Someone's always coming by.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.304
But there's no one outside.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.874
Not again...

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.100
(Kim Geonwoo, only look at me)

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.900
What is this...?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.250
(Kim Geonwoo, only look at me)

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.121
At least the handwriting is legible today.

00:07:42.122 --> 00:07:44.517
Wait...

00:07:44.517 --> 00:07:47.400
You mean... you get these a lot?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.590
It's nothing.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.080
Nothing?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.050
This is a crime.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.209
This is straight-up stalking!

00:07:57.612 --> 00:08:00.980
To be honest, that's why I was so jumpy yesterday.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.484
This has been going on for a long time.

00:08:07.651 --> 00:08:10.840
I've reported it to the police several times,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.920
but it didn't help at all.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.640
Now I just treat it like a nuisance.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.968
To some, it's just a joke or an obsession,

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.997
but to the person on the receiving end,

00:08:24.998 --> 00:08:26.890
it's actually quite painful.

00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:30.630
That's why I was so harsh with you.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.379
I'm sorry.

00:08:33.106 --> 00:08:36.583
It's not usually this bad.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.380
It's okay...

00:08:40.547 --> 00:08:44.991
I just... didn't realize it was this serious.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.660
Thanks for understanding.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.732
Let's push the interview to tomorrow.

00:09:06.586 --> 00:09:08.540
Thanks for today.

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:10.717
Um, well...

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.100
Hey.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:28.954
Good work today.

00:09:28.955 --> 00:09:30.770
You were there all day,

00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:32.639
so you must be exhausted.

00:09:33.565 --> 00:09:34.295
I'm fine.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.700
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.646
It was... pretty normal.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.980
Normal?

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.360
That's a relief.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.530
I was worried I'd dragged you into something.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.556
It's okay.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.410
Nothing really happened anyway.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.230
It's just...

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.410
Everything went pretty smoothly.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.850
Is that so?

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.706
Then get some rest.

00:10:00.707 --> 00:10:02.335
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.610
We didn't finish the interview today,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.576
so we're continuing tomorrow.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.610
Oh... I see.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.879
Yeah.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.401
You did a good job today.

00:10:15.402 --> 00:10:16.650
Goodnight.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.952
Goodnight to you, too.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.300
