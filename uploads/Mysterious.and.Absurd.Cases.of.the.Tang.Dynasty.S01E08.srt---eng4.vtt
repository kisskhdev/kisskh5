WEBVTT

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.040
Open the main road twelve feet wide

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.560
Open the side path eight feet wide

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.360
Let the soul depart

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.320
Let the funeral proceed

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.880
Commence the procession

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.800
Mother, this is your last day

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.360
Your filial son has kept vigil for you

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.120
Mother! Mother!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.240
Encoffin

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.520
The coffin... there's someone inside!

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.240
Have you found which shop this coffin came from?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.200
I have.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.800
The shop is in Anye Fang.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.040
The shopkeeper said

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.240
he checked it just before closing last night.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.200
The coffin was hauled away directly this morning.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.440
He didn't expect something like this to happen.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.640
Prepare

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.200
for the autopsy.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.040
Blood spatter patterns.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Consistent with Xiao Lian's manner of death.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.560
Both were nailed to death with coffin nails.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.640
No signs of poisoning.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.080
No obvious fatal external wounds.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.080
Only on the back of the head,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.960
there is a bruise.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.280
That means

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.440
the killer first struck the back of the head with a heavy object

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.480
to knock him unconscious.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.720
This also made the wound harder to detect.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.000
Then he was placed inside the coffin,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.280
his hands and feet nailed down.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.800
Finally,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.840
a coffin nail was driven into his throat to kill him.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.040
Judging by his pupils,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.120
the time of death

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.920
must be over sixty hours ago.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.200
Sixty hours?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.480
That means

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.160
Wu Tu'an died before Xiao Lian.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.280
Precisely.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.400
The urgent matter now

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.320
is to determine the killer's motive.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.320
Is it for money?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.920
Is it for passion?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.040
Or is it for revenge?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.200
Guiyi.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.800
Yes?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.960
Bring Wang San and An Fu, the coffin bearers from that day,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.520
for questioning.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.400
Yes, sir.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.160
Hey, Old Yao.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.800
Hmm?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.600
Can I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.360
ask a favor of Miss Mu?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.120
Haven't you troubled her enough already?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Such fake politeness.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.480
I see that you and the Vice Minister

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.800
just won't yield to each other,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.840
and neither gives way to the other.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.520
Is that so?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.800
You...

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.880
just stay like that for now.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.880
And then?

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.600
Wang San.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.320
Did Wu Tu'an have any grudges against you?

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.560
None at all, my lord.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.360
The money you earn from your work,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.160
how is it distributed?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.160
Whoever finds the employer

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.720
gets a bigger share.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.000
It has always been this way.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.200
It's fair enough.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.000
We... we all accept it.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.840
How was your relationship

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.920
with Wu Tu'an and his wife?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.400
Not exactly good,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.880
but not bad either.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.880
Aside from work,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.040
we didn't interact much.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.960
And you?

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.840
I didn't know him.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.240
I was just called in to help this time.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.000
Called by whom?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.240
Brother Dongqiu.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.160
My lord,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.800
I remember now.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.960
Originally, Wu Tu'an called me,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.520
Brother Dongqiu, and Zhu Zi.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.680
We thought

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.960
the four of us would bring four apprentices

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.160
to get the job done.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.320
But...

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.200
Wake up, everyone. Stop sleeping.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.840
Wake up.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.040
Mmh.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.280
What's wrong, Brother Dongqiu?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.280
Zhu Zi is so unreliable.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.280
It's almost time to commence the procession, and he's gone.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.640
San.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.360
You.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.840
Go quickly.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.480
Find someone steady to take his place.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.520
Right.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.960
An Fu. An Fu will do.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.560
Go get him.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.160
Okay.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.720
I'm going right now.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.200
Who is Zhu Zi?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.080
A helper at the coffin shop in Anye Fang.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.640
Anye Fang.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.560
Where is he now?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.680
We couldn't find him that night.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.560
And haven't seen him since.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.760
Guards!

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.000
Go to Anye Fang.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.040
Find this Zhu Zi for me.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.760
Yes, sir.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.760
Acting Vice Minister.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.200
County Magistrate Zhao of Chang'an County requests an audience.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.640
Let him in.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.520
Yes, sir.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.080
Acting Vice Minister, you are busy with official duties.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.680
So I will speak right here.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.040
The Evil spirit case that caused such a stir recently...

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.280
...is related to the Sun family in Changle Fang.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.400
The one being buried that day was the young lady of the Sun family.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.240
Sun Miaoling.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.360
A few days ago, the Chang'an County Magistrate's office...

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.240
...received a report.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.240
It stated that someone had gone missing.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.760
Who?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.880
The Sun family's son-in-law.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.880
Miaoling's husband.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.400
Zhao Di.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.080
The Magistrate's office searched for many days.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400
But there has been no news of him.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.080
I feared delaying the investigation...

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.600
...so I reported it as soon as I heard.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.960
I see.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.360
My Lord.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.080
Yes?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.120
When did Zhao Di go missing?

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.720
On the night of my daughter Miaoling's burial.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.760
He disappeared.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.720
Whose room is this?

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.680
It is my daughter...

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.920
...Miaoling's room.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.960
Did Zhao Di...

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.480
...live in this room?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.480
No.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.360
Miaoling was frail.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.280
To let her sleep peacefully...

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.240
...my son-in-law...

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.440
...always slept in the wing room.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.880
Take a look.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.040
Please.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.440
Did your daughter...

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.160
...enjoy using incense?

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.960
Indeed.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.960
My daughter loved fragrances.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.000
My son-in-law...

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.640
...often sent people to procure them.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.920
Incense burned all day long.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.360
What kind of person is Zhao Di?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.480
To be honest, My Lord...

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.800
...since my son-in-law married into our family...

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.120
...he hasn't shown great capability.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.760
But towards my daughter...

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.240
...he was extremely devoted.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.640
Take these fragrances, for example.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.720
He went to great lengths to have them found.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.680
I am old and frail.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.280
My days are numbered.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.160
Seeing his sincerity towards my daughter...

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.920
...I had intended...

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.120
...to hand over the family business...

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.160
...to the two of them to manage.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.720
But who could have known...

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.480
...my daughter would pass away first.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.880
And immediately after...

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.080
...my son-in-law also vanished without a trace.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.640
Old Yao.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.240
Judging by your expression...

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.000
...you seem to have discovered something.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.120
I can't hide anything from you.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.520
To solve this Evil spirit case...

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.840
...I'm afraid we must start investigating the Sun family.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.480
Old Yao.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.080
Open the coffin to solve the case.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:26.920
Yes.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.440
Open the coffin!

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.640
There really is a paper effigy.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.480
Why is this?

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.520
Where is my daughter?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.080
Why is this happening?

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.440
My daughter!

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.080
On the day the coffin was carried,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.400
did the coffin move strangely?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.840
It did.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.320
That day, before lifting the coffin,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.400
the coffin shook inexplicably.
