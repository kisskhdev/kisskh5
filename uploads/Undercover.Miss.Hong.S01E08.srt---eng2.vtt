00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.059
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:40.311
I knew it was you.

00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:43.565
Yehppee was able to keep his face hidden,

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:45.441
but he gave away something else.

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:52.365
What?

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.492
You already know, Yehppee.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:56.536
Hong Keum-bo.

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:06.379
I set a small trap
before I sent that email.

00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:09.465
{\an8}GENERAL MANAGER SO GYEONG-DONG

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:16.639
I deliberately broke Yehppee Candidate
So Gyeong-dong's "D" key,

00:01:17.223 --> 00:01:20.602
and as for Yehppee Candidate Cha Jung-il,
I broke his "E" key.

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:29.193
It's working fine.

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:30.445
This needs your signature.

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.281
No, "E" is the issue.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.158
The "E" key isn't working.

00:01:37.118 --> 00:01:38.912
- Maybe you're pressing it too hard?
- Hello.

00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:41.956
Test it out yourself.
Why isn't it working?

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.500
- What's wrong…
- Mr. Lee.

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.044
- Oh, hello.
- Help me with this.

00:01:46.544 --> 00:01:48.463
That keyboard's been
acting up all morning.

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:50.590
The "C" and "E" keys
keep switching to English.

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.383
Mine's been doing that too.

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:54.969
- Let him fix mine first.
- Sure, I can wait.

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:56.262
And the reply email

00:01:57.013 --> 00:02:00.266
I received from Yehppee looked like this.

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:06.648
MEET ME AT 9 O'CLOCK TONIGHT

00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:07.899
AT THE SAME PLACE
YOU USED TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT KANG

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:09.776
What's the issue? Everything looks right.

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:12.487
It's missing periods.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:17.450
The moment I saw
that there were missing periods,

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.870
I knew Bang Jin-mok was Yehppee.

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:26.626
HELLO, YEHPPEE.
THIS IS HONG KEUM-BO…

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.012
REPLY

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:41.224
Meet me at nine o'clock tonight,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.980
at the same place
you used to meet with President Kang.

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:55.405
Oh no. It doesn't work.

00:03:06.082 --> 00:03:07.417
Mr. Bang, is your keyboard broken too?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.751
Forget it.

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:10.420
You can blame your snacks for that.

00:03:11.212 --> 00:03:12.797
- Right.
- Makes sense.

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:16.801
I'd like to request a one-on-one meeting,

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:18.511
Mr. Bang Jin-mok.

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:37.905
{\an8}If you're Hong Keum-bo,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.866
{\an8}then who's Hong Jang-mi?

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.826
{\an8}She's my younger sister.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.202
{\an8}Your sis…

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.540
{\an8}You stole your sister's identity
to get the job?

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:49.459
{\an8}It's because of you.

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:50.960
{\an8}You, Yehppee,

00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:52.920
{\an8}ignored all my emails and vanished,
so I came to find you.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.632
{\an8}Tell me what happened to you.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.010
{\an8}If I find no justification
for your actions,

00:03:59.093 --> 00:03:59.969
{\an8}you can't go home.

00:04:00.595 --> 00:04:01.596
{\an8}You're crazy.

00:04:02.347 --> 00:04:05.600
{\an8}Damn it. Come on.

00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:11.147
Is there actually a slush fund?

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.569
Even if there is one…

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:20.156
we must make it not exist.

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:28.289
Welcome.

00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:33.336
Unbelievable.

00:04:35.338 --> 00:04:37.673
You have time to grab a drink and unwind?

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.093
What about the assignment I gave you?

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.054
You should be busy.

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:48.643
You really work people ragged.

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:51.729
Like father, like son.

00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:54.524
You picked up all your daddy's bad habits.

00:04:54.607 --> 00:04:56.401
Here's to you milking everyone as always.

00:04:58.778 --> 00:04:59.946
I can hear you, you know.

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:05.701
I meant for you to hear it.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:10.623
I'm done dealing
with the ethical sludge from the gutter,

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.708
so find yourself a new moneywasher, sir.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:13.626
Hey.

00:05:14.335 --> 00:05:16.337
Be respectful or don't,
but at least commit to one.

00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:19.549
Find yourself a new errand boy, all right?

00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:22.760
Asshole.

00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:26.055
I will reject every resignation you file.

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.562
The slush fund records
and the books the chairman had you cook…

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.231
You still have them, right?

00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.902
I guess you're at least worried.

00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:42.405
Are you worried I'll take them and run,
or leak them to the press?

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:46.117
Get every last bit together
and hand them over to me.

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:49.328
I will…

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:56.586
expose it all
for the prosecutors' investigation.

00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:04.552
So I'm saying
if you're dead-set on leaving,

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:07.096
do some work
to benefit your peers before you go.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.139
You lazy bum.

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:16.564
Did it ever

00:06:17.356 --> 00:06:20.109
occur to you that I might refuse?

00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:24.697
No.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.367
You're not some foolish coward

00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:30.745
who would throw away
such a perfect opportunity.

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:42.215
Drink on the count of three.

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:45.927
One, two, three.

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.369
Capital Market Investigation Division
at the FSS,

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:54.704
Inspector Hong Keum-bo.

00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:56.998
Let's reach out to her.

00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:59.083
What if she doesn't bite?

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:02.378
Why wouldn't she?

00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:06.299
According to Oh Deok-gyu's mole,

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:08.092
Inspector Hong was the one

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:10.678
who initiated the internal probe
into Hanmin's slush fund.

00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:14.890
However, the prosecution asked her
to bring back solid evidence first.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.353
So she too is fighting a lonely battle.

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:39.373
TIP: REGARDING HANMIN'S SLUSH FUND

00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:43.919
{\an8}YOUR MAIL HAS BEEN SENT

00:08:58.768 --> 00:08:59.810
NEW MAIL FROM HONG KEUM-BO

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:09.070
Let's talk in person.

00:09:18.204 --> 00:09:19.246
Mr. Kang.

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:21.123
She took the bait.

00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:24.460
Yes, she wants to meet in person.

00:09:32.051 --> 00:09:34.762
If, by any chance, things go awry,

00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:37.139
say, if I die in an accident--

00:09:37.223 --> 00:09:39.308
Look at you obnoxiously jinxing us.

00:09:39.392 --> 00:09:43.020
The chairman just might suspect you,
so we should be prepared.

00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:46.440
Take a few snapshots of me meeting

00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:48.067
with Inspector Hong.

00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:51.612
Let's just focus
on completing the task at hand.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.533
A little insurance policy wouldn't hurt.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.329
Life insurance, that is.

00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:09.088
You can pick up the slush fund ledger

00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:12.007
at the president's office
on the 12th floor

00:10:12.883 --> 00:10:14.510
in Hanmin's head office.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.976
It's being delivered as we speak.

00:10:35.489 --> 00:10:36.449
The deceased victim

00:10:36.532 --> 00:10:39.702
{\an8}in the traffic accident that occurred
at 6 a.m. today in Mapo-gu

00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:42.037
{\an8}was identified as
Hanmin President Kang Myeong-hwi,

00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:45.499
{\an8}who was under investigation
for fiduciary breach and embezzlement.

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:47.126
What in the world is going on?

00:10:47.209 --> 00:10:49.712
Further investigation has revealed

00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:53.549
that Hanmin President Kang Myeong-hwi
was in the driver's seat.

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:55.468
The police suspect

00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:58.304
{\an8}he was on his way to work
when fatigue led to drowsy driving.

00:10:58.387 --> 00:11:00.973
{\an8}The cause of death is
currently under investigation.

00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:05.978
The slush fund ledger

00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:08.105
never made its way to the FSS.

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.485
It was intercepted
before the search and seizure.

00:11:12.568 --> 00:11:14.403
Intercepted? Then where did it go?

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:15.488
Well…

00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:17.656
Should I tell him Bok-hee took it?

00:11:18.908 --> 00:11:20.826
How can I tell him it was incinerated?

00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:24.246
Mr. Bang.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.124
You have a copy
of the slush fund ledger, don't you?

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:34.882
No.

00:11:40.596 --> 00:11:42.848
President Kang Myeong-hwi
made it very clear

00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:46.769
that if something happened to him,
all files were to be destroyed.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:49.063
So before I met with
Executive Director Oh,

00:11:49.146 --> 00:11:51.982
I deleted the backup
and shredded everything else.

00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:57.196
You expect me to believe that?

00:11:58.822 --> 00:12:00.324
How exactly am I supposed to trust you?

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:03.285
It's not like
you'll take responsibility for my life.

00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:06.914
I have a family to support,
yet you want me to gamble my life?

00:12:06.997 --> 00:12:10.167
I understand the sense of fear
and helplessness you're feeling right now.

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:15.923
Nine years ago,

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:18.467
whistleblowing cost me my first job.

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:29.520
She reported Hanmin for accounting fraud,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.939
but their countersuit ruined her.

00:12:32.523 --> 00:12:33.524
How naive.

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:40.906
Wait, my wallet.

00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:44.535
You can't go back.

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:47.496
I said you can't!

00:12:58.048 --> 00:12:59.758
The hardest part back then…

00:13:01.802 --> 00:13:03.637
wasn't losing my job
but losing the people,

00:13:05.222 --> 00:13:07.141
and the regret that I ended up alone.

00:13:11.895 --> 00:13:14.648
That's why I infiltrated Hanmin
to find Yehppee.

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:17.651
Because I know what that feels like.

00:13:23.574 --> 00:13:24.491
Mr. Bang.

00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:26.577
Could you maybe think of this

00:13:27.828 --> 00:13:30.372
not as a gamble
but as a final investment in me?

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.543
I'll take responsibility and protect you,
no matter what happens.

00:13:40.049 --> 00:13:41.133
I came here…

00:13:43.177 --> 00:13:44.136
today…

00:13:47.723 --> 00:13:49.266
to turn you down.

00:13:53.312 --> 00:13:55.272
Do you really think
President Kang's accident…

00:13:58.275 --> 00:13:59.360
was a coincidence?

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.966
EPISODE 8: MONEY MONSTER

00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:30.349
ULLALA CHICKEN

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:32.685
Hong Jang-mi.

00:14:32.768 --> 00:14:34.645
I'll expose you
as the scheming brat you are

00:14:34.728 --> 00:14:36.855
for all to see, even if it kills me.

00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:46.448
Hello there. Welcome to Ullala Chicken.

00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:47.992
Sit wherever you'd like.

00:14:50.869 --> 00:14:51.704
The menu's there.

00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:02.131
Are you here by yourself?

00:15:02.214 --> 00:15:03.132
Yes.

00:15:03.882 --> 00:15:06.969
Take your time and let me know
when you're ready to order.

00:15:07.052 --> 00:15:08.387
Are you

00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:10.597
Jang-mi's father, by any chance?

00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:13.142
You know my Jang-mi?

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:14.351
Of course.

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:17.187
We're alums.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.190
I thought the name of this place
sounded familiar.

00:15:20.274 --> 00:15:21.275
I guess I was right.

00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:22.317
Gosh.

00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:25.070
You must be her senior alum then.

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:28.282
I must show you the warmest hospitality.
Just a moment.

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:44.798
Miss?

00:15:44.882 --> 00:15:46.467
Miss, are you all right?

00:15:47.676 --> 00:15:48.719
Have some water.

00:15:49.303 --> 00:15:50.345
Here.

00:15:55.893 --> 00:15:58.687
Who's that in the photo?

00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:00.606
That woman underneath the talisman.

00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:01.774
What?

00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:03.150
That's my eldest daughter.

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:04.610
Honey, she's Jang-mi's senior alum.

00:16:04.693 --> 00:16:06.153
Hong Jang-mi is our youngest,

00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:08.238
and Hong Keum-bo is our eldest.

00:16:08.322 --> 00:16:09.406
They look alike, right?

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.160
I guess our Jang-mi
kept quiet about her sister.

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:14.828
I guess there's not much to brag about,

00:16:14.912 --> 00:16:16.330
since she graduated from Seoun University.

00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:17.498
Seoun University?

00:16:17.581 --> 00:16:20.667
Yeah, it's nothing special.
She's an accountant.

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:23.504
She works in Yeouido now,
at the Financial Supervisory Service.

00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:26.340
I see.

00:16:27.424 --> 00:16:31.386
Ms. Hong Keum-bo must have
quite a brilliant mind.

00:16:32.596 --> 00:16:33.931
An educated

00:16:34.014 --> 00:16:35.182
woman.

00:16:39.353 --> 00:16:40.604
What's that smell?

00:16:40.687 --> 00:16:41.980
Oh no, the chicken's burning.

00:16:42.064 --> 00:16:43.732
- Oh, the chicken.
- Honey, go!

00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:01.625
This is so good.

00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:02.668
It's so tasty.

00:17:03.335 --> 00:17:04.503
Is it?

00:17:04.586 --> 00:17:06.505
- Eat up, Bom.
- Okay.

00:17:07.214 --> 00:17:09.299
- You should have some too.
- I'm fine.

00:17:09.383 --> 00:17:11.176
Should we save a drumstick for Jang-mi?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.344
You eat it.

00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:15.139
I'm sure she had her fill growing up.

00:17:16.932 --> 00:17:18.392
I'm back.

00:17:18.976 --> 00:17:21.311
Jang-mi, come and have some fried chicken.
Queen Bee bought it.

00:17:21.395 --> 00:17:22.771
I'm fine. Enjoy.

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:27.192
ULLALA CHICKEN

00:17:33.991 --> 00:17:37.077
Auntie Jang-mi has a scratch on her neck.

00:17:37.953 --> 00:17:39.997
- Oh no.
- Are you okay?

00:17:44.251 --> 00:17:45.085
Hey.

00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:49.882
I'm fine. It's nothing.

00:17:57.556 --> 00:17:59.600
She just has so many secrets.

00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:16.700
It appears that our clever kiddo

00:18:17.201 --> 00:18:19.494
had us completely fooled.

00:18:19.995 --> 00:18:22.414
Seriously, a 35-year-old
impersonating a 20-year-old?

00:18:24.666 --> 00:18:25.876
Go Bok-hee, how old are you?

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:26.877
I'm 29.

00:18:29.755 --> 00:18:30.964
Exactly.

00:18:31.548 --> 00:18:33.508
So I'm six whole years older than you.

00:18:35.093 --> 00:18:38.055
When you were a snot-nosed kid
about to enter school,

00:18:38.597 --> 00:18:41.683
I was eating jajangmyeon
with my elementary school diploma in hand.

00:18:43.852 --> 00:18:45.646
And what if I tell everyone outside--

00:18:54.905 --> 00:18:56.657
I'm too tired today.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.575
So if you're going to tell them,

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:01.286
do it tomorrow, Queen Bee.

00:19:38.824 --> 00:19:40.617
Hey, bro. It's Jin-mok.

00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:42.286
Yeah.

00:19:42.369 --> 00:19:45.664
Are there any updates
on the experienced-hire role

00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:47.291
I submitted my résumé for?

00:19:47.374 --> 00:19:48.375
Oh, right.

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:52.379
The HR manager said
he received a call from Hanmin.

00:19:52.462 --> 00:19:56.258
They keep passing you over for promotion,
leaving you stuck in a dead-end division,

00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:58.010
yet they won't even let you quit.

00:19:58.093 --> 00:20:00.387
Did you get on the higher-ups'
bad side or something?

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:07.477
That's a bonus from the chairman

00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:09.563
for your hard work on the last project.

00:20:12.316 --> 00:20:13.442
If you'll excuse me.

00:20:40.218 --> 00:20:41.678
{\an8}NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:43.096
{\an8}MANAGER BANG JIN-MOK, TRADING DIVISION

00:20:45.724 --> 00:20:46.725
I'm sorry.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.394
Why would you be sorry?

00:20:57.444 --> 00:20:58.612
SEPTEMBER 23, 1988
SIGNATORY: BANG JIN-MOK

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.509
I just did what I was told.

00:21:21.635 --> 00:21:23.303
Back then, I needed the money

00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:25.722
and thought that was my best option.

00:21:25.806 --> 00:21:27.974
Then you just need to hang in there.

00:21:28.058 --> 00:21:30.352
Not getting fired is key if you're stuck.

00:21:30.894 --> 00:21:34.398
This is no time for pride
when you have a sick kid.

00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:36.024
Right. Sure.

00:21:37.317 --> 00:21:40.028
Let me know if anything changes.

00:21:41.113 --> 00:21:42.114
I'll talk to you later.

00:21:43.281 --> 00:21:44.157
Thanks.

00:22:12.227 --> 00:22:14.187
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.693
Prep the main conference room by 3 p.m.
for the emergency branch manager meeting.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.445
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:22:22.863 --> 00:22:23.697
Thanks.

00:22:26.366 --> 00:22:28.034
Do you remember Hong Keum-bo?

00:22:28.118 --> 00:22:30.162
She's the one you had me handle last time.

00:22:30.745 --> 00:22:33.707
There's a car parked by my shop,

00:22:34.749 --> 00:22:36.126
and it's registered under her name.

00:22:37.002 --> 00:22:38.461
- Hello, sir.
- Hong Keum-bo?

00:22:41.006 --> 00:22:44.009
The car is parked there,
but no one's inside it?

00:22:45.093 --> 00:22:47.888
You said the spoiled brat
who came by recently

00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:50.098
was the chairman's grandson, right?

00:22:50.682 --> 00:22:54.352
I think the girl who interfered then
was Hong Keum-bo.

00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:56.855
So basically,

00:22:56.938 --> 00:22:59.608
they came separately,
but left together in one car.

00:23:00.192 --> 00:23:01.985
How do they know each other?

00:23:03.987 --> 00:23:05.363
Start digging again.

00:23:05.447 --> 00:23:06.948
You'd better not mess up this time.

00:23:09.284 --> 00:23:10.202
Ms. Song.

00:23:13.663 --> 00:23:15.332
If you have a spare moment,

00:23:15.415 --> 00:23:17.292
can we talk briefly
in my office right now?

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:19.252
Yes, sure.

00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:38.355
It sounded like
you were on an urgent call.

00:23:38.438 --> 00:23:39.981
I hope I didn't disturb you.

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:42.275
Not at all.

00:23:43.235 --> 00:23:44.444
It was just another work call.

00:23:44.527 --> 00:23:46.655
A few days ago,
one of our female employees

00:23:46.738 --> 00:23:48.990
was attacked by an assailant
on company grounds.

00:23:49.574 --> 00:23:50.408
Pardon?

00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:52.369
One of our employees?

00:23:52.452 --> 00:23:56.039
Yes, I witnessed the event and handed
the attacker over to the police.

00:23:56.122 --> 00:23:58.333
He turned out to be
Ms. Go's recently released brother.

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:01.503
He claimed he mistook
his victim for Ms. Go.

00:24:01.586 --> 00:24:04.005
I thought I would let you know

00:24:04.089 --> 00:24:06.549
since it concerns one of the employees
under your care.

00:24:07.175 --> 00:24:09.636
I suggest reinforcing security measures.

00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:12.305
Yes, sir.

00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:13.890
I'll take care of it.

00:24:14.557 --> 00:24:15.392
All right then.

00:24:36.871 --> 00:24:38.123
Where did he go?

00:24:38.206 --> 00:24:40.834
FULL-SERVICE SHOE REPAIR

00:24:43.044 --> 00:24:44.462
Did you meet Yehppee?

00:24:45.046 --> 00:24:46.965
Jeez, what are you doing?

00:24:47.048 --> 00:24:47.882
So who was it?

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:50.343
It was Bang Jin-mok.

00:24:51.678 --> 00:24:52.637
I knew it.

00:24:53.722 --> 00:24:57.434
See? What did I tell you?
I always knew it was him.

00:24:57.517 --> 00:24:58.810
It's the first time I'm hearing about it.

00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:05.400
So when is he going to
hand over the files?

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:07.944
There's nothing to hand over.

00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:09.988
He said even the backups were destroyed.

00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:12.449
Man, you're one naive lady.

00:25:12.532 --> 00:25:15.243
You believe that?
He's just playing it safe.

00:25:16.202 --> 00:25:17.662
You have to butter him up gently.

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:20.165
Try to gain his trust,
like I did with you.

00:25:20.248 --> 00:25:21.082
Think about it.

00:25:21.166 --> 00:25:22.834
You refused to go undercover at first,

00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:25.295
but I never gave up
until you were persuaded.

00:25:25.378 --> 00:25:26.421
Only because I was sick of it.

00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:28.757
It was done with great care and devotion.

00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:32.844
Hong, you also need to try
everything you can with him.

00:25:32.927 --> 00:25:34.429
Man.

00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:36.765
The stock market, exchange rates,
and bonds nowadays?

00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:40.226
Something feels off with all of it.

00:25:41.311 --> 00:25:42.937
It feels like the calm before the storm.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.982
At this rate,
something major might hit the country.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.568
We might need to rush a little.

00:25:50.445 --> 00:25:51.613
Oh right.

00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:54.199
He's not here, right?
Polish these for me quickly.

00:25:55.742 --> 00:25:57.702
These came from Mr. Yun
at General Affairs, right?

00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:00.580
- The heels need to be replaced.
- Don't be ridiculous. Hurry.

00:26:00.663 --> 00:26:01.790
But they're all worn out.

00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:05.335
Hand it over!

00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:09.089
Do I owe you something?

00:26:09.172 --> 00:26:10.632
I have nothing. It was all destroyed.

00:26:10.715 --> 00:26:13.927
That's how I managed to survive
that infiltrator manhunt last time.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.221
You only survived
because you handed over my photos.

00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:19.641
I handed over photos last time,

00:26:19.724 --> 00:26:22.727
but this time, I could hand over
the real Hong Keum-bo.

00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:27.065
Is this Admin? Is the chairman in?

00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:29.943
Are you crazy?

00:26:32.278 --> 00:26:34.447
If I really wanted to,
I'm sure I could land

00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:37.367
a private meeting with the chairman
to discuss your past actions.

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:41.162
Oh, so you've resorted to blackmail now?

00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:42.747
You started it.

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:44.833
Give me that. Go away.

00:26:44.916 --> 00:26:46.459
- Mr. Bang!
- Go away!

00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:51.798
{\an8}ULLALA CHICKEN

00:27:13.445 --> 00:27:16.531
It's already 9 p.m.,
but we haven't had a single customer.

00:27:17.282 --> 00:27:19.617
Sales have been down by half
since last month,

00:27:22.036 --> 00:27:24.164
and we might not be able to
afford rent at this rate.

00:27:24.247 --> 00:27:26.458
We're in the red
if we factor in labor costs.

00:27:28.042 --> 00:27:30.086
Maybe we should ask Keum-bo for help?

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.088
Honey. Seriously?

00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:33.965
You want to borrow money
from your unmarried daughter?

00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:35.091
I was just thinking out loud.

00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:37.093
Why are you getting angry? Jeez.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.513
We should just
start a farm in our hometown--

00:27:40.597 --> 00:27:42.348
You think anyone can farm?

00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:43.433
You can't live off dirt!

00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:47.395
Unbelievable.

00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:48.438
Take this too.

00:27:50.815 --> 00:27:52.650
Goodness.

00:27:53.526 --> 00:27:55.445
She used to be so gentle
when she was young.

00:27:55.528 --> 00:27:57.989
When did she become such a brute?

00:27:58.072 --> 00:28:00.074
NEW KOREA FUND
THE FIRST-RATE FUND!

00:28:02.577 --> 00:28:03.411
What's this?

00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:05.830
"New Korea Fund"?

00:28:06.748 --> 00:28:08.541
New Korea Fund…

00:28:09.834 --> 00:28:11.794
GET RICH IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM!
NEW KOREA FUND

00:28:12.587 --> 00:28:16.132
The stock market plunged
a record 38 points today…

00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:17.926
Interest rates are at a two-year high…

00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:21.137
Stock prices have dropped
to their lowest in five years…

00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:24.933
The IMF Managing Director maintained
that Korea's financial markets

00:28:25.016 --> 00:28:27.435
are not facing a crisis
like those in Southeast Asia.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:30.271
But Korea's stock market has frozen over,

00:28:30.355 --> 00:28:32.565
with foreign investors
beginning to sell off their shares.

00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:44.619
We're both busy people,
so we can skip the pleasantries.

00:28:44.702 --> 00:28:48.790
I'm calling out of concern
for the country, sir.

00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:50.834
Sure.

00:28:50.917 --> 00:28:55.672
I look forward to seeing you
at a year-end celebration, Vice Minister.

00:29:00.885 --> 00:29:03.096
He assures me everything will be fine.

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:05.139
Even the oil shocks
that sent prices soaring

00:29:05.223 --> 00:29:06.933
and the foreign debt crisis in the '80s

00:29:07.016 --> 00:29:09.143
all came and went, like a passing breeze.

00:29:09.727 --> 00:29:12.146
Hanmin managed to endure
and stand strong through it all.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.189
That's true.

00:29:14.607 --> 00:29:16.609
That reminds me.

00:29:17.193 --> 00:29:20.196
We sure made a lot of money back then.

00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:22.782
I sense a similar…

00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:24.367
No,

00:29:25.243 --> 00:29:26.578
it'll be even grander this time.

00:29:27.203 --> 00:29:30.790
I sense a major opportunity
on the horizon.

00:29:37.589 --> 00:29:39.465
There's no issue
with the slush fund, is there?

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:43.094
Is the OW Club fine? And Nora too?

00:29:43.177 --> 00:29:44.596
Most certainly, sir.

00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:45.805
All right.

00:29:46.556 --> 00:29:49.183
You can show Mr. Shin and Mr. Oh in now.

00:29:50.143 --> 00:29:50.977
Yes, sir.

00:29:52.228 --> 00:29:53.938
How are the sales

00:29:54.939 --> 00:29:56.190
for the New Korea Fund?

00:29:56.274 --> 00:29:57.942
It was launched three weeks ago,

00:29:58.484 --> 00:29:59.903
but it's underperforming.

00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:01.738
After a US investment firm

00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:04.490
put out a report
telling investors to leave Asia,

00:30:04.574 --> 00:30:06.159
the 500 mark collapsed immediately.

00:30:07.368 --> 00:30:09.537
With investors spooked,
sales are struggling.

00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:12.498
Increase the sales target.

00:30:12.582 --> 00:30:13.458
Pardon?

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:16.002
We need to raise the bar
to at least meet the average.

00:30:17.295 --> 00:30:18.421
But…

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:20.256
Send out a fax to all the branches,

00:30:21.132 --> 00:30:24.761
and gather all the branch managers
for a training.

00:30:24.844 --> 00:30:26.304
Yes, sir. I'll see to it immediately.

00:30:29.223 --> 00:30:32.310
Our branch's performance is on the line,
and it's everyone's responsibility.

00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:34.562
Let's put everything
into selling the New Korea Fund.

00:30:35.229 --> 00:30:37.607
The head office says
it'll take full responsibility.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.566
See?

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.151
All right now.

00:30:40.234 --> 00:30:41.235
Remember to smile.

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:49.494
Mi-sook.

00:30:50.286 --> 00:30:53.289
It's too bad they raised the target
when you've already sold so much.

00:30:54.207 --> 00:30:56.000
If the branch doesn't meet its quota,

00:30:56.084 --> 00:30:58.753
that reward's off the table,
no matter how much you sell.

00:30:59.587 --> 00:31:00.964
I'll just have to try harder then.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.950
Hello, sir.

00:31:29.033 --> 00:31:31.244
This is Kim Mi-sook
from Hanmin's Magang Branch.

00:31:32.787 --> 00:31:33.621
Hong Jang-mi.

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:35.331
No, Hong Keum-bo.

00:31:35.415 --> 00:31:36.916
You're done for.

00:31:51.764 --> 00:31:52.765
I heard your brother was released.

00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:56.060
How did you know, ma'am?

00:31:56.644 --> 00:31:58.104
How did I know?

00:31:58.688 --> 00:32:00.815
Your brother attacked
one of our female employees

00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:02.984
near our office the other night.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.403
He mistook her for you.

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:09.532
Auntie Jang-mi has a scratch on her neck.

00:32:10.324 --> 00:32:11.659
Are you okay?

00:32:12.243 --> 00:32:15.997
President Shin witnessed it happen
and had to go to the police station.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.165
President Shin did?

00:32:17.749 --> 00:32:19.625
Must I worry about your family affairs?

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.378
Talk to your brother
and keep him under control.

00:32:23.421 --> 00:32:24.422
Don't cause trouble.

00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:27.091
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:32:30.011 --> 00:32:31.512
What did you need to tell me?

00:32:43.107 --> 00:32:45.443
I came to let you know Ms. Kang,

00:32:45.943 --> 00:32:48.029
the chairman's daughter, is doing well.

00:32:50.156 --> 00:32:51.699
Nothing to report on President Shin?

00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:53.951
No.

00:32:55.578 --> 00:32:56.788
All right. You may leave.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:14.764
Hong Keum-bo?

00:33:18.142 --> 00:33:19.435
Start digging again.

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:21.270
You'd better not mess up this time.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.023
Why you little…

00:33:31.322 --> 00:33:32.990
- Damn it.
- Get in there.

00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:43.042
Come in.

00:34:00.017 --> 00:34:01.435
Sir,

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:04.981
I heard you were inconvenienced
by my brother recently.

00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:06.399
Please accept my apologies.

00:34:06.482 --> 00:34:07.900
I'm fine.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.238
You should be extra careful
when you're coming in and leaving work.

00:34:15.908 --> 00:34:17.118
By the way,

00:34:18.244 --> 00:34:20.371
was the assaulted female employee

00:34:21.122 --> 00:34:23.082
Hong Jang-mi?

00:34:23.166 --> 00:34:25.501
Yes, it was Ms. Hong.

00:34:26.752 --> 00:34:27.587
I see.

00:34:38.556 --> 00:34:42.643
{\an8}DIRECTOR YUN JAE-BEOM
FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY SERVICE

00:34:49.066 --> 00:34:50.818
You've reached Yun Jae-beom.

00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:52.612
Sir, this is Shin Jung-woo.

00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:55.948
My goodness, President Shin!

00:34:56.032 --> 00:34:59.118
Would you be free for dinner tonight?

00:35:00.453 --> 00:35:01.454
I am.

00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:03.289
Even if I wasn't, I'd make time.

00:35:04.582 --> 00:35:05.583
Where shall I meet you?

00:35:17.178 --> 00:35:18.179
Try some of this, sir.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.932
This is for me?

00:35:21.015 --> 00:35:23.559
My goodness, how kind of you.

00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:24.769
You're giving me this precious hairtail.

00:35:26.729 --> 00:35:28.564
Look at my suit matching its scales.

00:35:33.653 --> 00:35:35.321
That is so delicious.

00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:38.950
I assume you're planning
to have Inspector Hong Keum-bo

00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:42.328
return to the Seoul office at some point.

00:35:43.371 --> 00:35:45.206
Yes, of course.

00:35:45.748 --> 00:35:48.876
I can't just leave her
suffering down there all alone.

00:35:49.585 --> 00:35:52.922
She might not be aware of
the great dangers that await her.

00:35:53.005 --> 00:35:55.633
Your subordinate's safety
should be the priority.

00:35:55.716 --> 00:35:57.385
You should take her back immediately.

00:36:01.055 --> 00:36:03.099
I want to bring her back just as much.

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:09.313
However, unlike us,
who prioritize safety and well-being,

00:36:09.397 --> 00:36:12.775
Hong Keum-bo always puts
winning above all else.

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:14.944
It's all-or-nothing with her.

00:36:15.027 --> 00:36:16.696
So unless she's knocked out,

00:36:16.779 --> 00:36:19.323
she would never back out of her fight.

00:36:21.242 --> 00:36:22.076
I mean, you two

00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:24.078
were…

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:26.914
You know?

00:36:28.457 --> 00:36:30.835
Come on, as if I need to say it out loud.

00:36:35.923 --> 00:36:37.633
Could this be any tastier?

00:36:38.134 --> 00:36:43.222
The New Korea Fund's returns keep falling,

00:36:43.306 --> 00:36:46.142
but the higher-ups are
just riding the branches hard

00:36:46.225 --> 00:36:48.436
over their weak sales.

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:49.562
To make matters worse,

00:36:49.645 --> 00:36:53.190
customers want us to take responsibility
because we sold it to them.

00:36:53.274 --> 00:36:54.608
This is just between us,

00:36:54.692 --> 00:36:56.819
but hasn't the company made enough
from the service fees?

00:36:57.528 --> 00:37:00.239
Corporate employees like us
just do as we're told.

00:37:00.323 --> 00:37:03.409
How much responsibility
do they expect us to take?

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.121
Could you maybe think of this

00:37:07.204 --> 00:37:09.749
not as a gamble
but as a final investment in me?

00:37:11.167 --> 00:37:14.086
I'll take responsibility and protect you,
no matter what happens.

00:37:15.254 --> 00:37:18.424
Anyone willing to take responsibility
during this hot mess

00:37:18.507 --> 00:37:19.633
is either naive…

00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:23.429
or completely insane.

00:37:26.724 --> 00:37:28.726
Or maybe they're just desperately earnest.

00:37:44.784 --> 00:37:45.618
Hello?

00:37:46.786 --> 00:37:48.704
It's Bang Jin-mok.

00:37:48.788 --> 00:37:51.999
Come to the bridge by the Han River
where we met last time, right now.

00:38:11.852 --> 00:38:15.147
I know about the 24 billion won
that was embezzled by the OW Club.

00:38:19.276 --> 00:38:20.194
So,

00:38:21.487 --> 00:38:23.739
you knew about it going in.

00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:26.367
Just hand over the materials,
and we'll take care of the rest.

00:38:27.535 --> 00:38:29.703
We'll make sure
your identity remains secret.

00:38:30.538 --> 00:38:31.580
You can trust me.

00:38:40.214 --> 00:38:41.465
I need a little more time.

00:39:00.234 --> 00:39:02.570
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES
MAGANG BRANCH

00:39:02.653 --> 00:39:04.280
NEW KOREA FUND SALES PERFORMANCE

00:39:04.363 --> 00:39:05.239
Ms. Kim.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.366
Ms. Kim Mi-sook?

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:08.701
Yes?

00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:11.871
Attention, everyone.

00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:14.457
Here at the Magang Branch,

00:39:14.957 --> 00:39:17.501
Ms. Kim Mi-sook is the top salesperson.

00:39:18.544 --> 00:39:19.545
She's number one.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.091
Now, let's stop making excuses.

00:39:24.175 --> 00:39:27.428
Take after Ms. Kim
and give it all you've got to sell.

00:39:27.511 --> 00:39:29.263
Don't just stand there
and give her applause.

00:39:30.514 --> 00:39:32.016
Congratulations.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.767
Well done.

00:39:35.144 --> 00:39:36.145
Thank you.

00:39:38.063 --> 00:39:39.648
Why do you keep coming home so late?

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.569
Why didn't you tell me
you were attacked by Go Bok-cheol?

00:39:45.321 --> 00:39:46.530
How did you find out?

00:39:48.032 --> 00:39:49.658
Right. Shin Jung-woo.

00:39:49.742 --> 00:39:52.286
What did I tell you
about calling the president by his name?

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:53.412
Queen Bee,

00:39:53.496 --> 00:39:54.997
you know how old I really am.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.166
He and I are in the same age group.

00:39:57.249 --> 00:39:58.667
We're only three years apart.

00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:04.423
We're having a celebration party,
so come on out.

00:40:05.007 --> 00:40:06.800
- Okay.
- We'll be there soon.

00:40:07.426 --> 00:40:09.345
Let me just get changed first.

00:40:14.642 --> 00:40:18.020
Quit, leave the country,
do whatever you must to stay safe.

00:40:19.396 --> 00:40:21.899
I hate having to tell the victim
to be careful.

00:40:21.982 --> 00:40:23.692
But I think Go Bok-cheol,
that crazy bastard,

00:40:23.776 --> 00:40:25.110
will end up retaliating.

00:40:25.194 --> 00:40:27.446
Yeah, he's totally a crazy bastard.

00:40:28.155 --> 00:40:31.033
I'm going to quit
and move out of the dorms soon too.

00:40:31.116 --> 00:40:32.117
Until then…

00:40:33.994 --> 00:40:36.413
can you keep this a secret
from our roommates?

00:40:36.497 --> 00:40:37.331
I'm asking you a favor.

00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:41.835
Since you're asking for a favor, fine.

00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:44.421
Let's act natural.

00:40:46.465 --> 00:40:47.883
Sure, Queen Bee.

00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:51.136
{\an8}Mi-sook, congratulations
on being the top salesperson.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.388
{\an8}Congratulations.

00:40:53.305 --> 00:40:54.348
{\an8}Ready?

00:40:58.352 --> 00:41:00.062
- Congratulations.
- I was just lucky.

00:41:00.145 --> 00:41:01.730
No need to be humble.

00:41:02.314 --> 00:41:04.066
Fine. I did work really hard.

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:09.446
Ta-da!

00:41:10.197 --> 00:41:12.157
This is for the sales queen, Mi-sook.

00:41:12.241 --> 00:41:14.493
And this is for her junior, Bom!

00:41:14.577 --> 00:41:15.953
How exciting.

00:41:16.036 --> 00:41:16.912
And…

00:41:17.788 --> 00:41:18.747
this is for you, Jang-mi.

00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:20.416
For what?

00:41:20.499 --> 00:41:23.627
Next week will be the end
of our three-month probationary period.

00:41:26.505 --> 00:41:28.507
And this is for you, Queen Bee.

00:41:28.591 --> 00:41:30.175
What? Me too?

00:41:30.259 --> 00:41:31.385
Isn't this too much…

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:34.471
It's not too much for you.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.685
Mommy, I'm sleepy.

00:41:40.603 --> 00:41:42.396
It's already past nine.

00:41:42.479 --> 00:41:45.608
Let's save your donut for tomorrow, okay?

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:48.193
Shall we go to bed?

00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:50.279
Let me put her to bed first.

00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:52.615
Good night, Bom.

00:41:52.698 --> 00:41:53.699
Nighty-night.

00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.037
Let's eat.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.881
Mom told me to move in with Dad
once my probationary period's over.

00:42:10.257 --> 00:42:12.217
What should I tell my roommates?

00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:15.971
If I stall, Go Bok-cheol
is bound to shake me down again.

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:19.224
In a crappy situation like this,
the best move is to run.

00:42:19.975 --> 00:42:21.393
I'll be off to LA, no matter what.

00:42:27.358 --> 00:42:28.484
- Where are you going?
- Where?

00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:32.529
I just need some fresh air.

00:42:38.786 --> 00:42:40.412
There she goes again.

00:42:40.496 --> 00:42:42.956
She works out in the parking lot
whenever she's frustrated.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.501
It's the emergency stairs
when she's at work. I saw her.

00:42:51.423 --> 00:42:53.133
Let's not get sentimental.

00:42:53.717 --> 00:42:56.845
If I just get Yehppee on my side,
Chairman Kang Pil-beom will be…

00:43:05.312 --> 00:43:06.480
Hello?

00:43:06.563 --> 00:43:08.315
Hey, Hong. We're in big trouble.

00:43:08.982 --> 00:43:10.442
- What happened?
- Turn on the news.

00:43:11.026 --> 00:43:11.985
What?

00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:15.239
In an effort to address
the mounting foreign exchange crisis,

00:43:15.322 --> 00:43:19.201
the government has decided to request
a bailout from the IMF.

00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:22.121
Leaving behind the title of model economy,

00:43:22.204 --> 00:43:25.124
this served as an acknowledgment
of a national bankruptcy.

00:43:25.207 --> 00:43:27.543
The government is expected to
announce this decision

00:43:27.626 --> 00:43:29.211
in a nationwide address tomorrow.

00:43:29.962 --> 00:43:34.216
During a series of meetings earlier today
with the IMF Deputy Managing Director

00:43:34.299 --> 00:43:37.052
and the US Under Secretary
of the Treasury, who are visiting Korea,

00:43:37.136 --> 00:43:43.767
the Korean government reportedly agreed
that seeking IMF assistance is inevitable.

00:43:56.655 --> 00:44:00.075
The bailout request is expected to total
about 35 billion dollars,

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:02.286
given that the short-term external debt

00:44:02.369 --> 00:44:04.538
totaling 70 billion dollars
is due within a year.

00:44:04.621 --> 00:44:06.415
In addition, the government…

00:44:06.498 --> 00:44:07.332
Hello?

00:44:08.876 --> 00:44:10.544
An emergency executive meeting?

00:44:11.628 --> 00:44:13.505
Yes, I'll call the emergency contacts.

00:44:15.299 --> 00:44:16.216
Who was that?

00:44:17.134 --> 00:44:18.719
The president has called
an emergency meeting

00:44:18.802 --> 00:44:20.179
for division heads and above.

00:44:20.262 --> 00:44:21.346
Help me make these calls.

00:44:22.514 --> 00:44:23.348
Okay.

00:44:24.099 --> 00:44:25.601
I'll call everyone up to here.

00:44:26.393 --> 00:44:27.436
You should start from here.

00:44:27.519 --> 00:44:29.271
- I'll call up to here.
- Okay.

00:44:33.317 --> 00:44:34.860
Hello, I'm calling from Admin.

00:44:34.943 --> 00:44:36.361
Mr. Oh, it's Hong Jang-mi.

00:44:36.445 --> 00:44:37.988
I'm calling from Admin.

00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:40.532
- President Shin Jung-woo…
- He called an emergency meeting.

00:44:40.616 --> 00:44:41.575
Please head to the office.

00:44:41.658 --> 00:44:43.952
- I'm calling from Admin.
- Hello, this is Hong Jang-mi.

00:44:50.292 --> 00:44:51.168
Why won't he pick up?

00:44:54.922 --> 00:44:56.256
It's fine. Sit.

00:45:01.595 --> 00:45:02.471
Hey.

00:45:07.893 --> 00:45:09.728
Did you call
the Ministry of Finance and Economy?

00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:11.647
Yes, there will be
a special address tomorrow

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.106
and term negotiations next week.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.358
How much are they borrowing?

00:45:14.441 --> 00:45:15.901
Well…

00:45:15.984 --> 00:45:16.944
That I don't…

00:45:17.027 --> 00:45:20.280
According to the deputy prime minister's
10 p.m. press conference earlier,

00:45:20.364 --> 00:45:22.032
the government will initially seek

00:45:22.115 --> 00:45:23.992
aid of 20 billion dollars
from the US and Japan.

00:45:26.036 --> 00:45:27.162
Twenty billion dollars…

00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:44.137
You make sure to cash
every donation check I send,

00:45:44.763 --> 00:45:48.183
yet you have me find out
such crucial intel from the news?

00:45:49.685 --> 00:45:52.104
Just last week, when I went to check…

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.859
Listen to me.

00:45:57.943 --> 00:45:59.695
You must think with a father's heart

00:46:00.237 --> 00:46:04.032
and consider your kid
who's studying abroad in the US.

00:46:04.116 --> 00:46:07.452
You must consider how much money
you'll need for that kid's future.

00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:11.665
I've already done my calculations.

00:46:13.083 --> 00:46:14.126
Let's first arrange

00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:17.421
a meeting today
with vice ministers in attendance.

00:46:18.422 --> 00:46:20.841
I'll take care of the rest!

00:46:22.718 --> 00:46:23.844
Do you hear me?

00:46:25.679 --> 00:46:26.555
Damn it.

00:46:39.234 --> 00:46:40.360
Damn it.

00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:42.362
You've reached Hanmin.

00:46:42.446 --> 00:46:43.739
Hello, you've reached Hanmin.

00:46:57.878 --> 00:46:58.712
There they are.

00:47:11.642 --> 00:47:12.684
Hello.

00:47:14.853 --> 00:47:17.731
This isn't the result of
our mismanagement or incompetence.

00:47:17.814 --> 00:47:19.858
It's because of
the global economic crisis.

00:47:20.734 --> 00:47:22.569
Without immediate government intervention,

00:47:22.653 --> 00:47:26.281
the situation could end up
becoming a runaway train.

00:47:27.157 --> 00:47:29.868
Just as banks and securities firms

00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:34.706
provide people with loans
when they need money,

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:39.878
the government should provide
financial support now in the same vein.

00:47:42.047 --> 00:47:44.633
We've internally reviewed
the opinions you shared earlier.

00:47:44.716 --> 00:47:47.469
However, it'll be difficult

00:47:47.552 --> 00:47:49.554
to provide public funds across the board.

00:47:50.138 --> 00:47:51.973
To assess financial soundness,

00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:54.309
we will need a repayment plan proposal

00:47:54.393 --> 00:47:57.979
and audited financial statements
from the last three years.

00:48:07.864 --> 00:48:11.993
Submitting those financial statements
will work against us in many ways.

00:48:14.162 --> 00:48:16.957
Then make it so that they work for us.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.251
Are you suggesting falsified accounting?

00:48:19.334 --> 00:48:24.047
It's not like the government can
hand out money left and right.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.592
We must go through the motions
for the sake of appearances.

00:48:28.093 --> 00:48:28.927
President Shin.

00:48:29.886 --> 00:48:31.930
It's just a formality,

00:48:32.514 --> 00:48:35.642
so do your best to make
the numbers add up nicely.

00:48:35.726 --> 00:48:38.353
Put that accounting experience
to good use.

00:48:42.107 --> 00:48:43.942
You should review

00:48:44.568 --> 00:48:47.320
and submit the final copy yourself.

00:48:47.904 --> 00:48:49.865
Yes, sir. I will.

00:48:51.199 --> 00:48:52.075
Ms. Song.

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:55.787
Put together a team for him.

00:48:56.371 --> 00:48:57.205
Yes, sir.

00:49:04.212 --> 00:49:06.548
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:49:06.631 --> 00:49:08.717
I've called this meeting
to make an announcement.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.720
Ms. Hong's probationary period
is officially over.

00:49:11.803 --> 00:49:12.637
A round of applause.

00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:17.684
By the way…

00:49:18.727 --> 00:49:21.730
did Mr. Bang Jin-mok call out today?

00:49:21.813 --> 00:49:24.065
I just heard he's going to be out
for the next four days.

00:49:24.149 --> 00:49:26.860
Mr. Cha from Research
and Mr. So from Trading are also away.

00:49:28.612 --> 00:49:30.363
So-Bang-Cha are all on vacation?

00:49:31.281 --> 00:49:32.449
Something is fishy.

00:49:33.408 --> 00:49:34.618
I looked into it.

00:49:34.701 --> 00:49:37.287
Man, it turns out Chairman Kang,
that sly old fox,

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:40.874
asked the government for money
with his head held high.

00:49:40.957 --> 00:49:42.542
And the government is no better.

00:49:42.626 --> 00:49:44.503
They agreed to release public funds

00:49:44.586 --> 00:49:46.713
to the companies
that submit accounting records.

00:49:47.297 --> 00:49:50.008
Good grief,
what is this country coming to?

00:50:09.194 --> 00:50:11.988
They wouldn't do it out in the open
since it's "confidential."

00:50:29.256 --> 00:50:31.174
There are no conference rooms
on the first floor,

00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:35.470
and the 12th floor
only has executive offices.

00:50:37.722 --> 00:50:39.099
DESIGNATED PARKING

00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:09.379
AREA CLOSED
DO NOT USE

00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:25.812
AREA CLOSED
DO NOT USE

00:51:25.896 --> 00:51:27.856
NOVEMBER 29, 1997
SATURDAY, 5:12 A.M.

00:52:03.767 --> 00:52:05.310
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:52:35.006 --> 00:52:36.508
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:52:38.426 --> 00:52:39.719
How do I get in here?

00:52:44.933 --> 00:52:45.934
You can't be here!

00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:48.603
Why not?

00:52:48.687 --> 00:52:50.772
Are you doing something I shouldn't see?

00:52:51.815 --> 00:52:54.067
I asked you for some time!

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:56.778
We need to put out the immediate fire
before we move on to…

00:53:02.367 --> 00:53:03.201
Ms. Hong.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:04.869
What are you doing here?

00:53:06.871 --> 00:53:08.373
Well, you see…

00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:12.168
Hello, sir.

00:53:16.631 --> 00:53:18.842
What are you doing here, Ms. Hong Jang-mi?

00:53:21.636 --> 00:53:22.512
Well…

00:53:23.888 --> 00:53:25.724
I came to see Mr. Bang.

00:53:25.807 --> 00:53:29.936
Mr. Oh asked me to see
if he needed help with anything.

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.104
I don't. Get lost.

00:53:31.187 --> 00:53:32.022
Wait.

00:53:32.814 --> 00:53:34.315
We're on a tight schedule.

00:53:34.399 --> 00:53:37.110
Don't we need a clerical assistant
for menial tasks

00:53:37.193 --> 00:53:38.695
like coffee runs, copies,
and lunch delivery?

00:53:38.778 --> 00:53:39.738
- We do.
- We don't.

00:53:41.614 --> 00:53:44.451
Ms. Hong may have a nasty temper and all…

00:53:46.453 --> 00:53:47.495
but she's quick on her feet.

00:53:49.914 --> 00:53:52.250
I am quick on my feet,
and provide helpful assistance.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.546
Please help out as much as you can.

00:54:01.217 --> 00:54:02.343
The president is here.

00:54:05.889 --> 00:54:08.558
Including the president, we'll need…

00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:10.268
nine cups of coffee.
Two sugars, two creams.

00:54:10.351 --> 00:54:12.062
Yes, sir. I'll be right back.

00:54:23.782 --> 00:54:24.783
Oh, boy.

00:54:27.118 --> 00:54:28.536
BREAK ROOM

00:54:35.376 --> 00:54:38.046
This isn't a coffee shop.
You'll drink what I give you.

00:54:47.972 --> 00:54:49.265
Cha Jung-il's grain powder mix.

00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:51.559
Sneak a spoonful
for three years of bad luck.

00:54:51.643 --> 00:54:53.728
Nice, a healthy snack.

00:54:57.357 --> 00:54:59.943
But why did Shin Jung-woo allow it?

00:55:00.527 --> 00:55:02.070
He knows what I'm up to.

00:55:06.741 --> 00:55:08.868
I'd better get back
before Cha Jung-il flips out.

00:55:16.876 --> 00:55:17.794
It's so damn good.

00:55:17.877 --> 00:55:19.379
That stingy man was saving it for himself.

00:55:22.382 --> 00:55:23.967
- Good morning.
- Hello.

00:55:30.431 --> 00:55:33.935
What's this familiar yet uneasy situation
that I don't hate?

00:55:34.018 --> 00:55:36.521
I have joined the task force team
with Mr. Bang.

00:55:37.772 --> 00:55:39.440
You're not asking to go,

00:55:40.859 --> 00:55:41.943
but you already are?

00:55:43.987 --> 00:55:45.155
If that's President Shin,

00:55:45.238 --> 00:55:47.157
please tell him
that you asked me to help Mr. Bang--

00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:50.243
President Shin?

00:55:50.326 --> 00:55:52.370
Yes, I've called to confirm something.

00:55:52.871 --> 00:55:56.082
Did you ask Ms. Hong to assist Mr. Bang?

00:56:05.884 --> 00:56:06.968
Well…

00:56:12.307 --> 00:56:13.141
Yes, I did.

00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:15.894
Thank you for confirming.

00:56:19.939 --> 00:56:22.108
That's the least I can do for my savior.

00:56:22.192 --> 00:56:23.026
Thank you.

00:56:31.618 --> 00:56:32.493
I helped her out.

00:56:34.037 --> 00:56:35.163
- Pardon?
- What?

00:56:36.039 --> 00:56:38.124
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.065
It's the final draft. Keep it safe.

00:57:04.651 --> 00:57:05.777
Yes, sir.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:08.863
FINAL DRAFT FOR SUBMISSION

00:57:21.584 --> 00:57:23.211
I should empty this bin first.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.471
FINAL DRAFT FOR SUBMISSION

00:57:36.766 --> 00:57:40.311
1996 FINANCIAL AUDIT REPORT

00:57:44.607 --> 00:57:47.443
How dare they try to cook the books
and steal taxpayers' money?

00:57:48.903 --> 00:57:52.699
You'll submit the original records
for fair and square evaluation.

00:57:57.537 --> 00:57:58.371
Come in.

00:58:04.335 --> 00:58:05.169
Right.

00:58:06.754 --> 00:58:09.924
These are the materials prepared by
the crisis response task force team.

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:14.053
We adjusted the sales figures
to bring the company back into the black.

00:58:14.137 --> 00:58:15.054
Is that so?

00:58:16.681 --> 00:58:18.975
This is your specialty, after all.

00:58:19.058 --> 00:58:20.518
I'm sure you did well.

00:58:20.602 --> 00:58:22.770
When is the submission deadline?

00:58:22.854 --> 00:58:24.731
It's 6 p.m. today.

00:58:24.814 --> 00:58:25.940
I see.

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.110
Good work.

00:58:35.658 --> 00:58:36.826
Yes?

00:58:36.909 --> 00:58:38.745
I'll get the submission copy ready.

00:58:39.412 --> 00:58:42.999
Bang, grab me the printed submission copy
and make a copy of the floppy disk.

00:58:43.082 --> 00:58:43.916
Okay.

00:58:45.209 --> 00:58:47.045
- How many copies are you submitting?
- Just one.

00:58:47.128 --> 00:58:48.379
Are you taking it to the president?

00:58:48.463 --> 00:58:49.672
He's coming here to pick it up.

00:58:49.756 --> 00:58:52.508
No more questions!
Just prepare the envelopes.

00:58:53.092 --> 00:58:54.010
Yes, sir.

00:59:08.191 --> 00:59:09.359

00:59:34.967 --> 00:59:37.762
{\an8}THE DOCUMENTS PREPARED BY KEUM-BO

00:59:42.225 --> 00:59:43.893
It's all set to be submitted.

00:59:43.976 --> 00:59:45.353
Thank you for your hard work.

00:59:45.436 --> 00:59:46.854
Not at all.

00:59:55.571 --> 00:59:58.574
This is the final submission copy
and the floppy disk.

00:59:59.283 --> 01:00:00.118
Thank you.

01:00:00.743 --> 01:00:02.704
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:23.182 --> 01:00:24.016
President Shin!

01:00:31.983 --> 01:00:33.025
Excuse me.

01:00:33.526 --> 01:00:36.696
You should've been given
the finalized copy, but you weren't.

01:00:36.779 --> 01:00:38.072
This is…

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.868
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

01:00:43.494 --> 01:00:45.246
The one with the folded corner

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:47.039
contains the original records
that I prepared.

01:01:39.634 --> 01:01:42.970
HANMIN INVESTMENT & SECURITIES

01:01:48.518 --> 01:01:50.937
The government has decided to
inject public funds

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.481
to protect depositors
and stabilize the markets…

01:01:53.564 --> 01:01:55.191
Mom, I'm here.

01:01:55.274 --> 01:01:56.108
What?

01:02:00.112 --> 01:02:01.864
How come you're here
on a weekday afternoon?

01:02:01.948 --> 01:02:04.575
I worked through the night yesterday,

01:02:04.659 --> 01:02:07.370
so they gave me a day off
as a special perk or something.

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:12.083
Mom, can you pack me some side dishes?

01:02:12.917 --> 01:02:14.585
The family…

01:02:15.294 --> 01:02:17.046
I mean, my colleagues enjoy them so much.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.715
Of course, I'll pack you some.

01:02:22.593 --> 01:02:23.427
Where's Dad?

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:25.012
Is he at the market?

01:02:25.596 --> 01:02:27.139
He went to get a refund.

01:02:27.723 --> 01:02:29.350
Business has been slow,

01:02:29.433 --> 01:02:31.644
and your dad did something
out of character.

01:02:31.727 --> 01:02:35.106
Apparently, he bought something
called New Korea.

01:02:35.189 --> 01:02:36.941
It's some kind of investment fund.

01:02:37.024 --> 01:02:37.942
A fund?

01:02:39.277 --> 01:02:40.653
The New Korea Fund?

01:02:40.736 --> 01:02:41.571
Yeah.

01:02:42.071 --> 01:02:44.615
But don't worry,
I told him to sell all of it today.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:50.371
Damn it.

01:02:57.753 --> 01:02:59.171
Why do you look like that?

01:02:59.255 --> 01:03:00.506
Did you sell them off?

01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:05.011
It's at minus 80%.

01:03:06.178 --> 01:03:07.513
What?

01:03:07.597 --> 01:03:09.849
Dad, why would you buy that?

01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:13.561
You're the one who told Jang-mi and me
that stocks ruin lives.

01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:14.687
They're not stocks.

01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:17.189
I bought it because it was a fund.

01:03:17.273 --> 01:03:21.527
I asked them for a refund,
and they said it's impossible.

01:03:21.611 --> 01:03:25.072
But Hanmin is
the top-ranked company in the country.

01:03:25.156 --> 01:03:26.365
What are we going to do?

01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:28.117
How could they do this?

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.870
Honey, what are we going to do?

01:03:30.953 --> 01:03:32.955
Damn it…

01:03:47.887 --> 01:03:49.513
It's down 90%!

01:03:49.597 --> 01:03:51.390
You sold me the fund!

01:03:51.474 --> 01:03:54.393
What are you going to do
about my hard-earned money?

01:03:54.477 --> 01:03:55.728
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

01:03:55.811 --> 01:03:58.147
Let me cancel
the automatic transfer first.

01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:01.609
The branch manager said the head office
is working on a resolution.

01:04:02.193 --> 01:04:04.195
Hey, we'll be screwed
if Hanmin goes under!

01:04:04.278 --> 01:04:05.279
You'll pay for this.

01:04:05.363 --> 01:04:06.656
I will sue you!

01:04:08.074 --> 01:04:09.200
Answer me!

01:04:10.451 --> 01:04:12.828
- What are you going to do about this?
- Please don't do this!

01:04:12.912 --> 01:04:14.205
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

01:04:15.623 --> 01:04:17.208

- Sir!
- Hey!

01:04:19.585 --> 01:04:21.963
- Please help me!
- Give me back my money!

01:04:22.672 --> 01:04:24.465
Please try to calm down.

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:26.467
What are you going to do?

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:27.760
I'm so sorry.

01:04:36.352 --> 01:04:38.604
INTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATES, STOCK PRICES

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:41.649
Doesn't this seem embellished?

01:04:41.732 --> 01:04:43.734
Are these numbers even possible?

01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:45.736
Yeongsan Investment & Securities is out.

01:04:47.488 --> 01:04:48.698
All right, next.

01:04:48.781 --> 01:04:50.783
We're moving on
to Hanmin Investment & Securities.

01:04:50.866 --> 01:04:53.452
- Okay.
- While you review the file,

01:04:53.536 --> 01:04:56.372
you must review
if they'll be able to repay the funds.

01:04:57.164 --> 01:04:58.499
That should be our focus.

01:04:58.582 --> 01:04:59.625
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

didn't make the cut?

01:05:09.927 --> 01:05:13.014
Why is our name missing from that roster?

01:05:13.097 --> 01:05:14.223
Why?

01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:17.685
I've never experienced
such humiliation in my life!

01:05:18.519 --> 01:05:19.687
All we did was

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:22.940
do those other firms a goddamn favor!

01:05:23.024 --> 01:05:24.942
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:05:25.026 --> 01:05:26.527
Unbelievable!

01:05:29.947 --> 01:05:31.407
Goddamn it!

01:05:50.509 --> 01:05:51.343
I'm certain

01:05:52.136 --> 01:05:56.265
I personally handed off
the documents I prepared.

01:06:00.436 --> 01:06:01.395
That day,

01:06:02.229 --> 01:06:04.482
Ms. Hong Jang-mi followed me
to the parking lot.

01:06:04.565 --> 01:06:05.399
You know her, right?

01:06:06.859 --> 01:06:08.152
Ms. Hong did?

01:06:08.235 --> 01:06:09.862
She said I took the wrong envelope,

01:06:09.945 --> 01:06:11.572
and gave me another one.

01:06:12.823 --> 01:06:16.619
Weren't those documents
also prepared by you, Mr. Bang?

01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:35.429
Thank you for your hard work.

01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:37.139
Not at all.

01:06:38.974 --> 01:06:39.934

Korea is next.

01:07:31.944 --> 01:07:34.029
So process my resignation immediately.

01:07:34.113 --> 01:07:36.240
You're anticipating
Korea's financial crisis,

01:07:37.116 --> 01:07:39.118
yet you'll become the president of Hanmin?

01:07:40.161 --> 01:07:44.373
Securities firms have the fastest,
most credible intel on Korean companies.

01:07:44.999 --> 01:07:46.959
When the executives start floundering,

01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:48.502
I'll make a clean sweep.

01:07:51.755 --> 01:07:54.425
Everyone has such aspirations at times.

01:07:55.009 --> 01:07:56.260
Mine's not an aspiration.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.054
I'm solving a problem
I already know the answer to.

01:08:23.746 --> 01:08:24.788
PUBLIC FUND INJECTION
INTO FINANCIAL SECTOR

01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:25.748
HANMIN EXCLUDED

01:08:39.678 --> 01:08:40.554
That was your doing.

01:08:42.056 --> 01:08:42.973
If we go bankrupt,

01:08:43.057 --> 01:08:44.850
thousands of employees
will be out on the streets.

01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:46.227
Is that the justice you seek?

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:49.647
Then should I have just let you
cook books and loot public funds?

01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:54.193
Chairman Kang exploits crises
to line his own pockets.

01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:56.904
Would you stay complicit
while his employees, investors,

01:08:56.987 --> 01:08:58.906
and the public
pay the price for his corruption?

01:08:58.989 --> 01:09:00.449
I just did what I had to do.

01:09:00.532 --> 01:09:02.534
I was trying to save my colleagues,

01:09:02.618 --> 01:09:05.162
not to blow the company to pieces!

01:09:05.246 --> 01:09:07.414
Are you using your colleagues
to justify yourself?

01:09:08.374 --> 01:09:10.709
Right. I almost forgot.

01:09:10.793 --> 01:09:14.171
You're so devoted that you even led
the accounting fraud nine years ago.

01:09:17.633 --> 01:09:19.009
We've met before.

01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:25.391
Please take good care of us.

01:09:26.141 --> 01:09:26.976
Thank you.

01:09:27.476 --> 01:09:28.852
Sorry, Keum-bo.

01:09:28.936 --> 01:09:30.813
I'll persuade him to do the right thing.

01:09:32.398 --> 01:09:34.984
…committed suicide by jumping
from his apartment building

01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:36.151
around 3 p.m. today.

01:09:38.487 --> 01:09:41.156
The Hanmin accounting fraud case in 1988.

01:09:42.616 --> 01:09:44.827
Do you remember the accountant
who jumped to his death back then?

01:09:46.954 --> 01:09:48.455
He was my mentor.

01:09:49.373 --> 01:09:50.541
He was my colleague.

01:10:02.261 --> 01:10:03.762
I guess that settles it.

01:10:05.639 --> 01:10:07.349
Even in the thick of the storm…

01:10:10.269 --> 01:10:11.937
we'll never be in the same boat.

01:10:12.855 --> 01:10:13.856
Never.

01:11:00.611 --> 01:11:02.446
{\an8}UNDERCOVER MISS HONG

01:11:02.529 --> 01:11:04.907
{\an8}All signs point to us
ending the operation.

01:11:05.491 --> 01:11:06.450
{\an8}Let's wrap it up.

01:11:07.409 --> 01:11:08.535
{\an8}But I wasn't trying to hide it.

01:11:08.619 --> 01:11:10.621
{\an8}You never asked who my dad was.

01:11:10.704 --> 01:11:13.832
{\an8}If you think about it,
you're the biggest liar here.

01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:15.417
{\an8}Damn it!

01:11:15.918 --> 01:11:17.544
{\an8}You damn brat!

01:11:19.505 --> 01:11:21.256
{\an8}I'm D.K. Lee of DK Ventures.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.467
{\an8}If Hanmin goes bankrupt on its own?
That's a win for me.

01:11:24.968 --> 01:11:26.095
{\an8}A 40% staff reduction?

01:11:26.178 --> 01:11:27.471
{\an8}Show respect to your senior.

01:11:27.554 --> 01:11:28.514
{\an8}Senior?

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:30.974
{\an8}Director Yun, I found it.

01:11:31.058 --> 01:11:32.393
{\an8}The slush fund ledger.

01:11:34.061 --> 01:11:39.066
